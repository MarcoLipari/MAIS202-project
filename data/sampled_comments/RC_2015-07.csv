* it is not OK for a man to hit a woman because the man is naturally so much stronger than the woman
* it is OK for a woman to hit a man because she is so weak it won't possibly hurt him seriously (or if it does, he needs to man up and get stronger).

From 1940 to 1975ish, and prior to that during the Civil War and WWI, citizens of military age were subject to conscription (forced service). Every conscript army has a core of professionals - officers and senior NCOs - while the bulk of the troops are provided by conscription. This is cheaper, since you don't have to induce anyone to join with attractive wages, and really the only viable means of assembling a large military. Volunteers are supposedly better motivated and are often better trained (due to having been in the military for years, in many cases, rather than a few months), but it's hard to get and keep enough of them. As a comparison, a Private (E-1) in the US Army today makes about $16,000 a year; his equivalent in WW2 made about $500 a month, inflation adjusted.","1435708803"

If a relationship has issues,  it's ignorant to believe that sex with other people will magically fix everything,  but if the issues are relating to sexual satisfaction,  intamcy, botedom, etc I can see how swinging might help.

My wife and I were getting bored of each other in the bedroom and we had almost stopped having sex altogether.  Cheating wasn't an issue but we both agree that with all things being equal it could have been in 3 to 5 years. Fix problems? No, but perhaps prevention against a very limited number of problems.  We communicate better now and we are both just a lot more fun to be around after being in the lifestyle.

Why we support our military? We are the world super power. We need to defend our interests at home and abroad, and the best way to do that is to project power over the entire world. And for a bit we did ok. But those in charge have realized the potential for wartime economy boosts, and the necessity of oil for our economy, for now. So we take on vague causes like ""war on terror"" and have ourselves some off season skirmishes that we also happen to get paid for. We occasionally overthrow some dictatorships the CIA set up during the cold war in favor of democracies, so for that we have to believe that what we are doing is just, if not easy.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","While market-state constructs might ultimately replace some elements of contract law and arbitration, the recent financial crisis showed a lot of the gaps in the process where the very same auditing companies that were supposed to be quality checking bonds, and the insurance companies that were supposed to be acting as hedges against risk both were insufficiently doing their jobs.  It then fell to the nation-states to re-capitalize the banks and prop up the insurance companies.

Had a fixed currency like bitcoin been underpinning the crisis, any fractional reserve banking would have collapsed, and without the threat of jail time, few if any of the banks would have bothered to settle any lawsuits.  Basically, while there are plenty of money and resources going around, anarcho-capitalism works just fine.  When the shit hits the fan, those who control the army ultimately make the rules.

A private firm would do a terrible job of guaranteeing rights for those in poverty, and I fail to see how you could have a market-state without essentially turning the poor into slaves after they have run out of money to pay for their civilian insurance.","1435708807"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","imo, the hate for Gauss Barrel is justified, but a lot of the reasons for it are not.

My personal reason for believing Gauss Barrel sucks is that it's such a *marginal dps increase* for the *risk* required to use it. The *very moment* you're forced to cancel a cast for whatever reason, it's an immediately dps loss and you're doing less damage than you would've without Gauss Barrel.

While on paper, Gauss Round+Ricochet and the 20% overall skill damage increase should make up for the lack of autoattacks, it clearly doesn't.

It's not to say that Gauss Barrel should *always* be a dps increase even  if you mess up. It's just that the effort:reward ratio of using it right now is so pathetically low, there's no real reason to stress yourself to keep it on.","1435708808"

yes, actually - and it doesn't even back up your point. Did *you* read it?

"korrasami","t5_2ut7p","I disagree with the notion that in order for criticism to be valid the critic must provide a fleshed-out alternative. Suggestions for avoiding or expanding upon something are sufficient in my opinion.

If this is about what I said, well, first thing is I was very careful to avoid suggesting that the writing was bad. I loved what was there. If I thought the writing was bad, I really wouldn't be here as ridiculously frequently.

But I do concede that there are aspects that could have been improved. 

I think the relationship could have more explicitly tapped into the larger themes of the series or books. I wish they could have delved more into the theme of modernity and tradition, and where Asami and Korra fit into that picture. A central part of every book that the Avatar's role and the age she finds herself in are often at odds. And also, I just wanted to see more Asami. Even considering time and budget constraints, I think more could have been done. For instance, giving Asami her own thread to narrate in Remembrances, focused over the time in the desert together, would have been better.

I could go on, but this is exactly the main problem I have with the resurgence in criticism, valid or not. The threads on Friday were a fun celebration of the great real-world event. I can't help but feel that dredging up these debates now, regardless of the quality, is slightly suspect.","1435708812"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ok, maybe this explanation will make more sense to you.

The 1st Amendment protects ""speech"" (more accurately, expression), which is not bound to a particular form.  Speech is just that; expressing an idea.  You can do that in many ways, and just because one of the ways becomes obsolete, that doesn't mean that, conceptually, speech has been.  So, the form can change, but the underlying concept does not.  It doesn't matter if I yell on a street corner, publish a paper, or post on FaceBook.  All of that is speech.

But, the 2nd Amendment doesn't work like that.  It doesn't protect a concept.  It protects a thing: guns, or the ownership thereof.  But, guns are a thing, not a concept.  Guns change.  And, while society may always accept, broadly, that speech is a good thing, as guns change society gets to decide whether guns are still a good thing, the same way we get to decide whether any instrument is still useful to society.  So, we have to look at the underlying reasons why guns were protected in the first place.

Protection from the government?  Again, ha.  Haha.  In this day and age, you're fucked if Uncle Sam comes knocking, and there's no way in hell even Scalia would let you keep in your home the kind of hardware you'd need to fight off the military.  Times, they have a-changed.

So, now we're talking regular old protection from other civilians, which again, is different now than it was 200 years ago.  A very small subset of modern guns can accomplish this safely and effectively, and there's only the need for escalation when either: 
 
A ) other citizens are escalating, which laws would prevent, or 
B ) when lawbreakers are escalating, which the police protects against

So, if you want to have your unnecessary guns, then start writing laws making militias a thing again or join the police, but regular old civilians aren't obviously protected here, either.  And, again, even if they ARE, guns, as a thing, cannot possibly be protected in a non-contradictory way by an Amendment like this.  After all, if the 2nd Amendment is really as good at its job as the 1st, then you should be able to own a nuke in your house.  Arms are arms.  But, obviously this is not acceptable.  There are ALL SORTS of restrictions on anything more than even a full auto.

So, what people like me are saying is NOT that you shouldn't have guns.  It's that the 2nd Amendment is garbage at its job.  Now, if it was ""the right of the people of self-defense and defense against tyranny shall not be infringed"", that'd be a WHOLE nother story.  But, it's not.  I'd be more than ok with defending gun rights if the 2nd Amendment was written about a concept, like the 1st.  ","1435708813"

Actually, I would say they are too slow rather than too fast. But not terribly paced. It depends on the viewer's tastes.

&gt;and character actions are inconsistent...

I do not think that is an accurate assessment. 

&gt;this is a terrible excuse to get everyone naked

Well...is this your first time watching Code Geass?

&gt;only show the girls changing

Hey, I protest! There was an ass grab of a man! 

&gt;hey we're three movies in let's introduce the fact that feMC is a massive clutz with no prior warning

I think you're missing the point. The girl was spoiled with servants all her life. She is smart, but lacks real world experience and the skills to live alone. Leila herself realizes this though, which I thought was a valid characterization.

&gt;here let's do a fortune telling that'll definitely be true even though that shit don't happen irl

The list of things in Code Geass that wouldn't happen in real life is very, very long. 

&gt;isn't it nice how this ENTIRE PALACE is big enough to have knightmare battles in too?

Knightmares aren't that tall. You should visit more palaces. 

&gt;wait what the fuck they just introduced all sorts of new supernatural shit into this universe in the last 5 min 

Only one new element, albeit an important one. 

&gt;none of this makes any sense

I would beg to differ. What do you specifically mean?

&gt;There is literally no scenario that could've occurred after the Shin/Suzaku showdown that could've reasonably resulted in what we saw and R2. None.

On the contrary, I can think of at least three different scenarios that would perfectly match what we saw in R2.

To overcome this I suggest adding something that the reader can really grasp onto and cause fear. Something I'd suggest is that if Angus were being stabbed he would probably have trouble breathing, also, as the knife is removed, I'd imagine flecks of blood would splatter off the blade (you didn't specify the lighting in the scene so I'm unsure what exactly is visible but I'll leave that to you).

"mormon","t5_2qky2","&gt; When I meet with my Stake President, I don't try to convince him of anything. I never do. I explain what categories I'm struggling with, and he doesn't even want to discuss them. He just points me to articles about faith and tells me to keep the commandments.
&gt; Same goes for my bishop. He almost always just says we will know when we die. He also tells me he loves me all the time. All the time.
&gt; With my parents and inlaws, I don't even hardly touch the subject, but they consistently talk about how people are falling prey to ""anti mormon"" stuff on the internet and that Satan is deceiving even the most elect.
&gt; Fairmormon tries, but they were a big part of why I lost belief. Their apologetics are often horrible and deceptive, in my opinion. And the Church itself doesn't really say the things FAIR says.
&gt; The Church itself likes to reference doubt, but it doesnt' really attack it head on. The talks reference theories about moonlandings, but they don't get into the core issues.
&gt; The Church Essays are sugar-coated and extremely lacking. They include positive information from sources but omit negative information. The Book of Abraham essay, for example, doesn't really get into what Joseph told everyone about the scroll and his translation. They essay doesn't address that Joseph either falsely believed he could translate Egyptian or he lied to everyone.

I'm not going to say it, but *you* know exactly why that is so.

Since the PS4 is a custom system that does not conform to all of the same programming and architecture standards as a regular x86 style PC, they may be using custom low-level or operating system functions that allow the CPU to work OK with GDDR5.

It's one of the things that allow consoles to wring more performance out of the same hardware vs PCs. They are a bit more specialized. Regular PCs have to meet specific standards that allow them to perform tons of different tasks, instead of being specialized in mostly games and media playback.

You will just need to be careful with how you build it.  If you set a watchPath to /Volumes you can create code with logic to capture external disks being mounted, however, it will also capture network shares, disk images (like a DMG) and so forth.   Alternatively you can disable USB drives from a configuration profile using the OS X standard MDM spec.  You can side load profiles with out using MDM as well, although it is more work.  Google probably won't help you too much unless you know the exact question to ask.  Had you Google searched expiring passwords with pwpolicy you might have got some decent hints.

I assume these accounts are local and not LDAP?

This is what I do for a living so I am happy to hep out the /r/sysadmin community on such things since it seems there is mostly Microsoft, Cisco, and VMware stuff posted here.

"BlueJackets","t5_2sl3f","Chicago needed a center to replace Brad Richards, and Arty is a very affordable alternative who will service them well.

Dano is a great young talent.  He's only 20 years old, and in the 30-some games that he played this past season he put up numbers very comparable to what Saad did in his first half season when he was the same age.  There's nothing to say that after another year or two that Dano couldn't end up being as good as Saad, or even better.  Especially playing on a team like the Blackhawks.  But the big thing is that he's a heck of a lot cheaper for the next few years.

I wouldn't call Tropp and Morin junk.  They're not superstars, but they were definitely extra pieces for us clogging up the board.  I'd call both ""serviceable"" NHLers, probably on the 4th line.  But they're both young and cheap, which is what Chicago needs right now with all of their cap trouble.  If you'll recall, Morin actually came to us from Chicago, so they are definitely familiar with them.

All in all I think that it was a pretty fair trade.  We traded 4 players to clear a logjam that will hopefully allow us to re-sign Letestu, and we got back a very very young and probably first line winger in the deal who has already won two cups.  That's some very useful experience.  Chicago knew that they couldn't pay Saad what he was worth and avoided losing him on an offer sheet, while getting a serviceable center to replace the very expensive Brad Richards.  Chicago filled some holes and she did it without breaking the bank.","1435708823"

At first, changes in her behavior is limited to having strange interactions with an arcade game, doing sexy things with V8 juice, and being attracted to an unusually hairy police officer. But soon enough, she's systematically killing, ninja-style, the officers responsible for the ninja's death, and can only be stopped by another ninja\!

As for forcing all citizens to bake gay cakes, I've heard nothing about this from any reliable sources. It reminds me of the time when fox said that Obama was going to start executing white people. Or the time when he was supposed to reveal himself as the anti-Christ. Or when everyone in America was going to get Ebola because a few people got sick while they were in Africa.

"cardistry","t5_2sjb1","I had the idea for a comedic video based on cardistry (rather than a comedic cardistry video, subtle difference) maybe two years ago. I had a bunch of ideas, this was one of them. I always had Animus Vox in mind for the song, at least for that segment just because it embodies the tension I wanted to break with the 'weee'. Recently though, I made the decision to make it a standalone video, to make the effect more surprising. Location was handy, so I went for it. I gave myself some time to get somewhat of a mental plan on where to put what. Then I did the editing and color grading over a couple hours basically in one go. 43 seconds is short, but the Glitch Mob certainly made the process more tricky. The most difficult maybe is to decide where each sequence of clip goes. Where you can and where you want to put it doesn't always coincide. Color grading was fairly straightforward, I knew I wanted something dark yet crisp. Matching the shot was more difficult (as usual really).  
As for shooting alone, basically the trick is to have patience. Nothing is taken for granted, in my case focus and framing were very difficult since I couldn't see myself until I had made the shot. It's really important to watch the footage carefully, and to have plenty of takes. I was too lazy there and had to shoot the last cut again, which wasn't great. When filming, it can help to move your arms around a bit to have slightly different angles from the camera: move your arms up a bit, maybe it will be more in frame, or the opposite, etc. Something that may or may not be obvious is just to keep the camera rolling while doing the cut over and over. It's a bit more of a paint to deal with in post, but will save time on the shoot. Also having a decent tripod is a good idea, though if you're by yourself then you probably won't pan than much.  
This is slightly unrelated, but also I find it really helpful to label your footage when looking over it, like 'Crabshack ++' etc. It eliminates redundancies, since most cameras will output videos with basically the same name.  
Got a bit carried away there, hope you get something out of it!","1435708828"

"talesfromtechsupport","t5_2sfg5","This is equal parts CYA and social skills.

The CYA part is keep log of what you've done. If you leave the user with instructions, send them an email so you have record of it.

The social part is that some people don't operate on logic, they operate on how they perceive the other person's emotions / frame. If you react weakly or apologetic, they think you are wrong and weak. If you react with confidence and strength, they think you are confidence / strength. This is because they might lack logical understanding, but can read people well enough to get by regardless.

In this case, you need to stand by what you've done (remember the CYA part), and not give them any room when they try to verbally bully you around. Don't get reactionary, calmly state the same thing over and over, show them the CYA logs and STAND BY YOUR POSITION. 

If you can't do anything more, then calmly explain this to them ""There is nothing more than can be done about this without a repeatable error"". and don't react to their bullying.

From their perspective... If they bully people, then 9/10 the other person will crack and they'll be shown to be right. When the other 1/10 happens and the person stands back up to them, they realize ""oh maybe this is a real issue"" and will listen to you.

For one, I realized I have a hit rate of about 90% with Ravana Ex (either that or I had crazy RNG in all the runs I did)... Ive heard from other classes it has about the same acc requirement as T13 so it makes no sense

In T13, with 420~ acc I missed all the time, so how is it that here with only 350~ I rarely miss?

It means they must have drastically lowered the healer acc requirements for that fight (so whats stopping them from doing the same for raids?)

Plus, there is the fact they added a really nice accuracy caster food, and bards have a 100% uptime -10% evasion debuff skill to help healers out even further

And of course, we will probably be able to spec our new relics with accuracy if we feel like it

"photography","t5_2qh2a","My thoughts exactly. The couple was not being disrespectful in their request. And while they did sign a contract, the photographer was quite immature about his response. Choosing not to support gay marriage is their right. They did not know the photographer's stance prior to signing that contract, and I think it is fair for them to cancel because of it. The photographer could have quite simply said ""I'm sorry you disagree with my stance, however you signed a binding contract that states that your retainer is non-refundable. I accept that you will no longer be needing my service, and wish you all the best."". Not only that, he states that because of their conversation, he will be donating that money to GLAD. Not because he is so generous, but because they disagreed with his views. It's kind of a slap to the face for them really, when it was completely unnecessary. I find it hypocritical for him to do this because they don't agree with him. His broccoli analogy is poor too. They did not make any demands about ending gay marriage, just that they don't support it. A more accurate analogy would be someone not liking broccoli, then choosing to cancel a dinner reservation at a restaurant that they recently found out now serves broccoli. Don't want to eat at that restaurant now? That's cool. That's your choice. But now I'm going to take that $1500 non-refundable deposit you gave me and I'm going to donate that to the broccoli farmers just to spite you.","1435708831"

Wut. Why would you discuss that? Was the hunt over and you shouted ""Hey everyone! I got full credit! You didn't! LOL!"" ? If that's the case, that's why you're getting abuse. If that's not the case, then I don't understand how and why they know that you earned more than them (my point is I think you kinda asked for it, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Also being threatened of having a baguette shoved in your backside sounds more humorous than anything to me (but I'm French, so maybe that has something to do with it).

All in all though, hunting is very very polarizing, there is a lot of trash-talking going on, on most servers, and it's your choice of partaking in it or not (partaking = saying anything in shout chat after a mark is killed), but if you do (and it sounds like you do), then expect to be trash-talked.

For example, a random engine I found from the same time period:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome-Rh%C3%B4ne_14M

This engine has 700 hp and weighs 925 lb, which is more like what you would expect from an aircraft engine.

A good aircraft has at most 8 lbs per horsepower, that engine was 3 lbs per horsepower by itself, which is pretty terrible.

The reason the car only had 250 horsepower is because it was a gigantic car with no power brakes or steering, and wasn't a racecar.  More horsepower would just be dangerous.","1435708832"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Actually, ""kill the other guy"" is not a successful evolutionary adaption.  Why not?
1. 50% of the time the other guys wins
2. It does nothing to get your sperm in the game - and evolution is all about reproduction.  
a) Your penis is shaped like a plunger for a reason - it will pull out existing sperm while depositing yours.  
b) Men will fuck deeper and shoot sperm deeper when infidelity is suspected  
c) Men produce more sperm when infidelity is suspected  
d) The sperm produced after infidelity vary from normal sperm - and appear to play a role in preventing insemination 

Evolution is all about getting your genes replicated.  The most effective tactic for this is getting turned on when your mate shows signs of infidelity. 
 
At the same time, you are evolved to want to prevent cheating behavior - so anger is a likely secondary response.  But since human females have some control over who they mate with, the anger response is inconsistant.  

Of course human behaviors are complex and driven by many factors other then pure instinct - we are not insects - so individual responses vary greatly - as you experience in yourself.  

Let me ask you.  Have you been in an exclusive relationship?  Did you ever suspect she was cheating or did you have group sex?  

Like most guys, I never imagined I would get turned on by cuckolding - until the conditions were ripe.  It was upsetting, confusing and depressing.  ","1435708834"

Hell, Fallout is the earliest example of a game that I can think of that had ""modular"" (your limbs) HP, though you don't die in MWO when you lose both your arms and a leg due to lots of damage. Limbs make the game at least more interesting because it's much harder overall to null someone from being a threat than many of the other FPSs out there.

I don't think I'd say the biggest failure of MWO monetarily is the pricing so much as the associated value of the product. In LoL, a skin might be $13ish, but if it's on a champ you enjoy playing a lot or really enjoy, it'd be worth the value (especially if you play that champ a lot!). MWO customization options aren't at that associated value point yet. People joke about Atlas Truck Nuts, but I bet that people would buy similar cosmetic items if they could, and if they felt that it wouldn't be a waste of the item. That's a fair reason why I don't buy cockpit items: I'll forget them in one mech, and then totally forget about them","1435708837"

It used to be a lot worse (SMG's did full damage and had perfect accuracy at infinite range when burst firing. They were the perfect anti-air and flyers just weren't viable). While the noise and flashes may make it seem like you're getting ripped apart, the actual damage they do at that range is pretty weak, while your plasma is still effective.

But that's at T10 and level 100. I can imagine your planes aren't optimal yet as you're still leveling and maybe learning.

This will inform you where you want to be in this fight.       
If you have the longer arms then you want to stay outside their reach and hit them. Your job is to not let them get close.      
If you have the shorter arms you want to get inside his reach and plant your feet then hook your punches to the ribs. 
To hook a punch push off your back leg and twist your ribs while throwing your fists with your arms bent. Best I can describe it.    
If he has longer legs he can kick you, but odds are he isn't wearing clothes that make kicks easy. If he throws a lazy kick and its slow. Grab his leg and swing him around and throw him. Ideally into a wall. Then kick him the face before he gets up.               
If he has long legs and can kick you. Get inside. Works the same. 
Don't throw kicks yourself.              
If he is bigger than you build wise don't let him grab you or get on top. Big guys do a lot of damage.        
If you are big get a hold of him and sit on him.     
Punch him a lot once you're in control.          
If he has long arms, big build and hes tall you want to be no where near him.          
Size doesn't make you a good fighter, but if he is you don't want to risk it. They don't separate lightweights and heavyweight to protect the lightweight.

It can only be countered by the synergy and burst found in high level constructed decks killing off the wielder before using all of the charges. It's not a weak card, it's an unhealthy card. It's like how Kel'Thuzad or Jaraxxus works: insane ability that can give infinite value/damage, but slow enough or situational enough that you could just lose before you can fully utilize it. Thus, one can simply limit the extent it can be utilized (as players would never survive that long anyway), and make it a fast enough card to help in turning a game around.

"kayakfishing","t5_2snlv","I spent about $225 which was on sale, then my dad bought the same kayak for $160 on sale. We now own Lifetime Tamarak Angler. It's an inexpensive fishing kayak and it's able to be set up with all of the same gear as the more expensive ones. I've been kayaking for a year and a half and I still call myself a moderate user. I bought one with all I need. 

The main drawback on my kayak is the hull hatch. I am still trying to figure out to put a bait bucket or a dry hatch there and how to do it(There is not many accessories for a pre-cut lifetime kayak hull). At Sports Authority, they do have some  kayaks without the hull cut out with the hatch but with that comes no accessories like rod holders or cushions. 

The things you should consider are price, size, weight, and how often you will go out. If you go out often, like a few times a week or long days out, I would suggest purchasing a more expensive kayak that fits you near perfect. Another thing is the price of accessories. It depends on where you go in the water. You could want to just kayak for recreation and exploration, fishing, or just exercise. Anyone is welcome to ask me for more questions!","1435708846"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Yeah I don't want to make this as fast paced as an arena shooter, but I want the pace to be a bit higher than say Arma3. I think besides player movement speed one factor to consider is the damage/health balance. For example, in some games it's one or two bullets and you're dead, others it might be three or four, others still even more. That has a lot to do with the ""speed"" of the gameplay. Do you have any preferences there?

I like the idea of damage somehow affecting movement. The important thing would be having some kind of visual cue about which part of your body has taken damage, like an overlay on the hud indicating hits. I've seen this before and it sounds reasonable. The main thing is whether it would affect competitive play -- and sometimes that level of realism or logic might get in the way of the central ""click heads to win"" mechanic.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; However, it can't explain why all sectors go down when overinvestment happens. Sure, the housing market crashes in Phoenix but why do diners in New Jersey shut down too? Krugman states this with his Boston real estate market.
&gt; Why do many people go unemployed? How come unemployment isn't just isolated to a certain sector/industry/region?

I don't know too much about the specific elements of this model, but I would argue you can attribute this to the influence of declining securities valuations and equity values on the wealth effect. Most people had a significantly smaller portion of their net wealth in the stock market, property and other investment vehicles in the mid twentieth century.

&gt; For the US, the data doesn't support the idea that large booms -&gt; big busts. In fact, it's the opposite large busts -&gt; large booms but boom size doesn't predict bust size.

I don't see how this can be mathematically valid. How can you this be predictive one way and not the other? Are you assuming the same time frame/rate for a boom and bust?

I personally don't agree with it, simply because it's way too easy for negative psychological effects to be established within a family unit.

But as long as 2 individuals consent, honestly, I suppose it's not completely heinous.
Here is my understandably down-votable opinion of the week: In the event that incest becomes less taboo and all parties were consenting, I would be more accepting of sibling relationships than of parent-child relationships. 

But really, it just complicates genetics and I'm not quite sure of the consequences that arise in the gene pool. It really is best if we stay away from it.

At the very least if people want to compare incest and gay marriage/relationships, at least gay marriage has little-to-no negative effects (or any effects really) on the gene pool. Though feel free to correct me on this if you can, I really am just in a zone of thought.","1435708849"

"amiugly","t5_2rgjh","the hair is fine and you look fine but here are some photo tips (from a self titled selfie pro):

1. the cropping is pretty awkward. you'd be better off with more of your torso in the photo and less negative space up top
2. it looks like you're taking the photo from a low angle. raise your phone and make eye contact with the viewer or look away purposefully (don't have your eyes look like they're wandering off or looking into the screen)
3. consider moving the part of your hair to one side to give it more volume in the front. this will also make it seem more like your long hair is on purpose and not because you can't be bothered to cut it
4. consider taking the photo from a slight angle (not straight on in front of your face)
5. go outside or next to a window and take your picture in nice natural light- in the morning or late afternoon. not in strong direct sunlight (noon)
6. don't relax/slightly part your lips- it's generally less flattering for men
7. wear a shirt that fits you well, shave your face completely. look put together
8. look confident, strong, and purposeful

the reason you probably feel unphotogenic is because when you look in a mirror, you focus on the aspects of your face that you like the most, when you see a photo of yourself, you see your face in its entirety. try looking at your face as a whole next time you look in a mirror. 


here are two photos i took of myself ""before and after"" the (most of above tips. the first one is similar to the way you took the photo that you posted. 

also in the pictures i am sweaty and makeup-free and post workout and pre shower (but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to take a decent picture!)

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","You can update rather that restore, it's quicker, but it leaves 500mb of your previous Native Apps. But it will also save your old Themes folders and LockScreen Cydgets Folder if any. If you had Groovylock, SMBTHL or LockHTML it will save all that as well. Your /Mobile/Documents folder will remain also and that contains your Flex folder and all of your patches.

The Previous Native Apps folder is easily deleted and your old Themes folders can be moved into the new Themes folder with Filza. You can't do that until you install your Theming app, which creates the Themes folder. All of your old folders are identified by not having the current date on them, iFile can delete those and hold them in the trash until you feel safe to delete them.

All of your apps will be on your springboard, and any documents that are in them, and your Apple IDs will be properly inserted (usually).

Basically, you will see the two update options in iTunes, ""update"" and ""restore"", side by side. Choose Update. Make sure you shut off your passcode, however, these latest firmware revisions don't require you to shut off ""Find my iPhone"" or your passcode, you can just update. Maybe if you restore, you will have to shut those off, but yesterday I accidentally left ""Find my iPhone"" on in my 4S and it updated just fine. Just about everything was left in there, all tweak settings etc.

I usually keep the .deb files for the most common free tweaks I use so I can instantly install them using Filza (after I make sure they are compatible). But the only real problem I have had is with the TaiG tool not liking my phone to have all my apps and such in there, it gets stuck at 60%. But if you keep trying eventually it will work.

I've done it this way since iOS 7.1, and I haven't had any major problems. But if you don't want to do it like this, you can always backup your device and then restore fresh. Restore immediately, then jailbreak right away. After that, do any essential upgrades in cYdia and install OpenSSH/SSL right away followed by Apple File Conduit. Then restore your backup, which will contain a lot of the files that would have been wiped.

After you do that, start restoring your tweaks a few at a time, and your settings will be intact.

The main thing you will want to do is before doing anything, install AppInfo from BigBoss and email yourself your list of tweaks. Also, in the next AppInfo section there will be a list of your main tweaks (not including the command line tweaks) and you can export a detailed list from there, it will be shorter. Usually reinstalling those tweaks will also add the support tweaks as dependencies.","1435708850"

"starboundservers","t5_2u1z8","I'm not a dev, and I may be a bit late, but who knows, maybe someone else stumbles upon this...

As others have said, the server won't be using any GPU. What you are running is merely the world creating and player management, the GPU only calculates the displaying part. No displaying will be handled on the server's end, so don't buy one. Nearly no server software uses one without heavy set up, and will generally not benefit at all without optimization specifically for it, which starbound does not and probably will never have.

Your main concern will be RAM and CPU. I've noticed Starbound has a lot of disk IO too, so be prepared for a slight bottleneck there. From the money you save not buying a GPU buy the best CPU with the most RAM you can afford, and make sure you have at least a decently fast drive. Do buy server grade equipment even if it is usually a lot more expensive, especially when you will be using it for more besides starbound.

I run my server with at most 4 people connected simultaneously and I sometimes have trouble with 2.8 GHz on two cores with 2 GB RAM (it's just there for a few friends, they know and don't mind occasional lag, so I don't usually give it full resources), take that as a little hint at what you might need :)","1435708851"

As I said before, your argument was about Abraham Lincoln, ignoring why the states seceeded, about Emancipation which was clearly moving the goalposts, and ignored everything I said showing you weren't here arguing in good faith.

&gt; What the fuck the quran is their version of the bible

Doesn't matter.  You've just moved it to the Quran and ignored everything about how they're trying to negotiate with the US currently as well as how they're negotiating about removing [sanctions](http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/middleeast/2015/06/iran-nuclear-deal-snapping-sanctions-150630004109184.html) which contradicts your argument about how ""fundamentalist"" and ruled by religion they are.  I mean the main sticking points were that Ahmadinejad was critical of Israel and wanted to do nuclear power without nuclear weapons (which actually got worse due to American sanctions),  And obviously, if you look at Hassan Rouhani over just the Quran, you see that he's working to improve a lot about iran which they lost before the 70s under fundamentalist rule.  Obviously, they also have [protests and riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Iranian_protests) that go against the teachings of a book so if all you want to do is bitch about the Quran, you're free to do so, but your argument still doesn't focus anywhere near what I pointed out before about how people don't like the symbol of white terror which is what the Confederate flag is to quite a number of South Carolina people who had to experience violence in the name of white supremacy just because their skin color is the wrong one.  Yet you still ignore the logic and reasoning I put forth originally that explained all this to make up shit...

Agreed. I'm kinda generalizing and applying a demographic of kids playing on daddy's XBone to ""shoot some newbs"" in my mind.

&gt;I'm looking forward to CQC, it'll be a reliable source of PvP when there is not many online.

I genuinely hope this appeals to all sorts of people and isn't just targeted at that demographic that I'm probably blowing out of proportion. However, I am not genuinely confident that's the case.

&gt;I also think it may give people the confidence to fly in open more? If they get some PvP experience and see losing a ship is no big deal.

Again, I can't relate, because I know I'm not great at PvP, and still play in Open. But hey, the more the merrier.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No tunnels have ever been found. The principal complainant was an alcoholic schizophrenic who accused her ex-husband of sodomizing their son with a McMartin (the school) teacher. She died of alcoholic complications prior to the conclusion of the preliminary trial hearing. 
The police sent out a form letter asking parents not to panic (which they promptly did) but to ask their own children about the alleged abuses and many of the schoolchildren were interviewed at a therapy clinic that really cocked things up. The kids were asked all sorts of leading questions  (as overzealous investigators and panicking parents freaked out) and made up a whole host of easily unbelievable insanity, like children flying and orgies in secret satanic dungeon tunnels that don't exist.

The kids had no idea what was going on and the case is famous for setting new precedents in how to actually interview children for testimony and realize when young children are making things up/remembering things that obviously did not happen (like flying through walls).

After six painstakingly stupid years in which prosecutors wasted millions of dollars trying not to look like idiots nobody was convicted of anything and the prosecution look like idiots. 

There was certaintly no Satanic Ritual Abuse - the case is synonymous with disproving the very concept of Satanic Ritual Abuse as anything other than moral panic. If there was any abuse it was likely in the case of the one teacher, the father, and the original alleged victim, the ones the paranoid schizophrenic alcoholic mother initially accused of sodomizing her child. Her later accusations were entirely delusional but the resulting moral panic and batshit insanity obfuscated any chance the prosecution had of convicting the only likely perpetrators the entire time.","1435708855"

* The breeder is now claiming that you gave the dog to them, and has started using the dog as their own dog.
* The breeder has now backpedaled, and is now claiming that you owe fees to care for the dog.

Did he though? I mean yes, on paper he should because it's 3 supports vs. an all-carry draft .. but when you look closer the enemy has Sniper, Necro and Gyro. All heroes that are scary to push against into highground.

Regardless of how underfarmed the enemy would be, they would still have their abilities, so barring any major missplay from the Dire or godlike-initiation/execution from the Radiant both Sniper and Necro will be killing 2 people. Then there's Chronosphere and calldown that maybe also kill another 2-3 heroes. And then you've traded 3-5 people (not sure though how any survivors of the initial blast would escape flak/missile, considering they'd be all alone) for one T3 and the enemy has all of sudden caught up a bit in farm.

If anything, North America's slow embrace of cunt as a great insult probably speaks more to our ingrained, misogynistic discomfort with the female body.

More misogynistic, (IMO as a straight, cisgendered male who has only benefited from the patriarchy- so take with a grain of salt) is the use of the term pussy to describe cowardice or weakness. To my mind there is no male-anatomy interchangeable insult, and the term is almost exclusively used to shame men by equating them with female genitalia.

If you keep treating them like children, and not letting them do things for themselves, pretty soon they start to believe they can't do it.  On the other hand, if you treat them as individuals, find out their capabilities and limitations and encourage them to do what they can, you're creating a much healthier image for them.  They're much more likely to have a ""good"" time in old age.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I totally agree with everything you said!  My point was that because of all the cop hate lately and the the fact that officers are worried about big brother watching their every move it will lead to less discretion when it involves even minor stuff like speeding. 
As a Trooper my main focus is traffic and ideally we shouldn't be writing any tickets because the public would be in voluntary compliance(and if you read r/futureology we will all have self driving cars in a few years so I'll be without a job). Some people truly don't need a ticket to change their behavior like the cdl driver that has a spotless record. The warning is probably enough for him.
 But I just feel that officers, afraid that they will be judged themselves harshly by not being a robot will throw discretion out the window and just write everyone. 
 I really feel that cameras are good for officers for the most part(and other professions such as doctors and nurses). If an officer is abusing their power or showing a pattern of force it can be addressed before he does something stupid and make the Hate worse.  I like mine as it saved me when a citizen made a false complaint.

The Adepta Sororitas being essentially the military arm of the Adeptus Ministorum, is likely not in a good way.

This is *what I'm thinking at the moment:* essentially, you'll take whichever Home World suits you, the Adepta Sororitas Background and then choose the Warrior role. But note that while in typical circumstances, an Adepta Sororitas just outclasses Imperial Guardsmen, in this system, you are a Warrior. You're balanced with other Warriors.

I'm on the other side.  I had to get glasses when I was 18 and I'm 42 now.  I've come to really like wearing glasses.

For one, they're a lot easier than contacts.  I wore contacts for a couple of years, but there's a lot of maintenance and my eyes tend towards being dry.  It's so much easier to put glasses on.

Second, I have a couple of workshops.  I usually wear goggles over my glasses, but I wear Trivex lenses.  Trivex is the same stuff the military uses for the canopies of attack helicopters, so I feel pretty good about Trivex while using a tablesaw or metal lathe.  I love having a high tech shield in front of my eyes.

Third, I always have UV protection and I also have a pair of prescription sunglasses.

First of all, Afghanistan certainly showed you don't have to have an equivalent force to withstand a Russian incursion. That's not exactly the same as Ukraine, but it wasn't until the US started shipping the mujahideen modern weapons, especially advanced Stinger missiles, that they were able to have a significant impact. 

I'd say Turkey has a significant military. Not to mention a US presence. 

Poland is aggressively upgrading their forces as fast as possible. 

The Baltic states would obviously be overrun very quickly, and I don't think any of the Scandinavian countries are in a great place to repel an invasion. 

But what I'd argue is that all of them are in a better place than Ukraine has been. And Ukraine is the one who actually has Russian troops who have already invaded. 

I'd like to see them have a better shot at defending themselves. At the very least upgraded communications equipment and other C&amp;C technology, better guided artillery, guided anti tank, and more advanced personnel carriers. 

I'm not saying ship over a bunch of the latest longbows and fighter aircraft (they wouldn't be able to effectively deploy them anyway). But munitions and supplies that would allow them to better defend themselves against the Russian forces that overwhelmed them at Ilovaysk and Dobaltseve would help Ukraine be greater masters of their own fate, instead of helplessly waiting to see how Putin the cat is going to toy with them next.

&amp;nbsp;

**What this oppurtunity means**


&amp;nbsp;I was to go to Smash n' Splash which literally is 20 minutes away from my house. I was so excited, so happy, it was dreamlike, seeing you(bail out for reggie ay?) and M2K in person, been watching behind the screens. I planned this out ever since it was announced in December. Where I tripped was that I didn't know there would be a cap, I missed the registration. I'll admit I teared up a little because that was what I worked for *forever*. To know for what I have spent hours for, skipped homework for, denied friends for, thought all day for, I missed. Two years into the making, for perspective is half of highschool again, which I'm just starting.

&amp;nbsp;I am Gold 3 on Anther's Ladder SSB4 (Peach and Jiggly Puff mains), and play Melee at the **technical** levels of PC Chris in his prime. I really want to demonstrate my skill because I know that being that teenager with the sick Falco is a dream. 

&amp;nbsp;I can't really get money to do anything outside of my home because of our family's financial drought. My older brother is in college, my little brother and I are in school, the cat just needed surgery for an intenstine flush and opening, which cost $900. My parents are foreign and have practically no idea of American culture or even Las Vegas. This chance is definitely more than ""once in a life time"". 

Being selected would be surreal and a gateway into a dream. Thanks a lot.

This is how this beautiful bitch (the Rami) did at 30 feet on our second trip to the range.

I switched over from my HD428s to these since I wanted to try out an open-backed model, and have been impressed. The soundstage is vastly improved, and it is easy to pick out different instruments and voices from the background. While people complain that the 598s have a lack of bass, coming from the even more lacking 428s I feel that the bass is actually stronger and more detailed than before using these cans.

While the midrange is excellent, somehow I feel that the difference isn't as big as I expected quality wise - I'm listening to FLAC classical tracks and 320kbps streams of vocal (i.e. jazz, country, pop, etc.) music and feel that the difference isn't as strong compared to the 428s as I expected.

I'm sorry but i'll use your anecdote (which is all it is) in the case of my own, i've never seen a single case of it in the time i've been doing, yes actually doing and being surrounded by, CrossFit. Guess what, all the alarmist crap you've been reading is massively overblown, the sport enjoys massive success and is showing no signs of slowing down. You'd think if the imagined danger you present was real, that there would be a drop in numbers.

That 'mascot' (a cartoon which has appeared a couple of times) is obviously a satire of false oustide criticisms, not a confirmation that the condition is rampant in CrossFit...

Being stupid academically, or in any other way should not be a reason to condemn people. Being unwilling to try is. 

A teacher that can judge kids as failures has no business being a teacher. You have to believe everyone has the chance to be something, even if that something is not being the next Bill Gates, to be able to allow them to have that chance. I was pushed to work harder by my parents, my teachers even my boss. I am now in uni because of this. If I hadn't been supported because people believed in me, I would not be here. 

A school that could hire these teachers is also not something you should expose kids to. A school where people believe they have no chance is one where that prophecy is so often fulfilled, even when those in question do have a chance. 

A school system that has these kind of things is not a school system you want to have as a society. If we accept that people have no chance, then we are forced to be essentially slaves to the people who are telling us who those should be.

A society that accepts that is not one I want to live in. This society is one that has essentially screwed us all and allowed the rich to get richer, the weak to be weakened, poor made poorer because we are told that someone should fail and someone need suffer for our life to work. 

I believe that no matter what people are, you should strive to help them become the best they can be and it is not for you to tell them they cannot do that. ","1435708870"

I have read various excerpts with commentary on various sites, none of which swayed me to one side or the other. I didn't find the excerpts to have painted a pleasant light of the situation, but y'know, I don't know her, or her sister, wasn't there - I'm never gonna figure that one out.

What would be the other good reasons to hate Dunham? I've found the threads on here interesting, but with so many SRSD topics, I find it hard to articulate my exact feelings on the matter.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","&gt; How could he possibly do it otherwise? Come to her father and ask to hold her for a mistress?

No, just do it. Like all Targaeryns.

&gt; She's not just some random commoner or even a highborn lady of less standing, she's a fucking Stark betrothed to Robert Baratheon.

So what? You think the Starks wouldn't want their daughter to have influence over the future king? Why do you think they made the Baratheon betrothal in the first place?

&gt; In what world would that make sense? She was alone, that was their chance for them to leave together. He's a crown prince, he is not god. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. He figured they would move out of everyone's hair and fix the damage later. Just that the damage escalated so much it was beyond repair.

Once again, there are thousands, millions of  cheating couples. How many of them eloped?

That tells you how nonsensical, stupid this is. Did Aegon the Unworthy eloped hundreds of thousands of times? Hell no.

&gt; No, of course not, but I'm saying that it doesn't make sense that the prophecy was his primary motivation, or even anything more than an excuse.

Of course it makes sense. Why did he decide to become a warrior? Why did he decide to have 3 children? 

&gt; If the part of the prophecy is that he loved her, doesn't it only make sense it goes the other way around? 

..... no. That doesn't imply anything. It just implies he's a delusional idiot, which he obviously is, given he's an idiot who decide eloping was a great idea, or an idiot who decided to kidnap someone. 

He's a delusional idiot who think the prophecy is about his dead kid. Why would you think the prophecy is in any ways true? Why would he? Why are you putting rationality as a reason for an obvious deluded zealot?

So no, she doesn't need to love him back. It makes more sense that way.

&gt; I agree with her being KotLT, but that's exactly why it makes sense she loved him. She cried at his singing, he gave her a crown recognizing her for who she really wanted to be. Why do you think it's all malicious? Literally all that you use as your reasoning works better if she loves him back, except that you don't think it's plausible they eloped? But it's somehow plausible he just happens to independently fall in love with her, come into contact with her, and later decides to kidnap her because he wanted to get his rocks off?

Of course it is much more plausible. If she was willing, there are many, many options that don't involve eloping. So many I can't count them all. If she's kidnapped, then it suddenly makes sense! EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE. Tell me one thing in the whole course of the war that doesn't make any sense if she wasn't willing.

Absolutely nothing. On the other hand everything is incredibly far fetched if she was willing. This is a prince who was described as ""Determined, deliberate, **dutiful**, single-minded"" and he suddenly decides to abandon his family, duty and responsibility to love with a teenager? And she willingly followed him and didn't do anything once her family was slaughtered? How stupid would that be?","1435708873"

There is absolutely no country in the world that would protect the rights of an employee to publicly insult his company without getting fired. That would be fucking retarded.

What about trade secrets? If I told a rival company how we develop our products, do you think it should be illegal to fire me?

In the real world, a place that I hope you visit some day, the things we do and say have an effect on our lives. If we talk trash about our friends, they stop being our friends. If we talk trash about our employer, they stop being our employer. Freedom of Speech does not give you the right to say or do whatever you want, and comparing complaining about company products to complaining about illegal working environments is absolutely preposterous. One of those is protected by the government, the other isn't, and for good reason.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; So we have a whole system of knowledge that is of questionable veracity, and people are basing their moral decisions and political beliefs on these questionable results, because it is easier to do that than to admit that your parents were right, or to use your own brain and God-given sense of intuition.

This seems like a false-dilemma fallacy to me.  Just because some inaccurate or biased studies exist doesn't automatically mean your parents were right.  If God created us, he didn't just give us a sense of intuition, he gave us reason and rationality as well.  Should we only use one and not the other?

You say it's easier to believe bad information than admit your parents were right.  But frankly, I think it's much easier to just close your eyes and assume your parents were right, instead of putting in the time and effort to collect data and understanding so you can make an informed decision for yourself.","1435708876"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I think this is exactly right. I'm actually *not* a procrastinator. I usually (not always) get things done ahead of time, like school assignments. 

But I'm not naturally this way. I make myself do things, even when I don't want to. If I'm looking at the dishes in the sink and don't want to do them, I tell myself, ""Well, you're not going to want to do them in the morning, either, but you're stressed about them now. If you do them now, you won't be stressed about them tonight, and you won't see them again tomorrow and feel this stress tomorrow. Just get it done."" 

I seriously have to force myself to do things so I won't stress about it later. Do I need to have a cake for tomorrow? Well, I better bake it today so I can have all the dishes cleaned up, and tomorrow all I have to do is frost it. Even if I get really busy tomorrow, I can find 10 minutes to frost a cake. 

If I have a big final research paper to do, it's really overwhelming. Of course I don't want to start it, because that means I need to start stressing about what I'm going to write about, what I need to research, etc. I'd *rather* put it off and not think about it right now. But I know I'll be so happy with myself later if I just get it started. What am I going to research? OK, find two articles to read. What, I want to read Reddit? Well, reading articles on Reddit is no different than reading articles for my paper. I should just get the articles I need to read out of the way. OK, I read those. I know what I want to talk about. Now, I should just do a free write, a rough draft, of what I'm going to write about and what my argument will be. This will sum up my introductory paragraph later. Before I know it, I have my intro done, my research questions, and the paper isn't even due for another month. 

Basically, you tell yourself to just do the work now--even though you don't want to--because you know you'll be so happy later that you already did the job. 

Of course it's not easy, but the point is that it's not easy for anyone. Trust me, no one in school is *wanting* to start their school paper right away. No one at work *wants* to go tackle that pile of backlog files. They just force themselves to do the hard work now so they don't have to stress as much later. ","1435708877"

The problem is that antisemitism has historicaly been proven to be 

a) closely related and intervoven with capitalism and its crises.
b) a ""legitimization"" for murdering every single person on the planet who is identified as ""Jew"".

For a), take a look at [Antisemitism and National Socialism](https://libcom.org/library/anti-semitism-national-socialism-moishe-postone) by Postone, for b) look into every history of the Shoa.

Given a situation where the save haven of jewish people, the one place where they can stand together and fight back against a [still widespread antisemitism](http://global100.adl.org/public/ADL-Global-100-Executive-Summary.pdf) is surrounded on all sides by states with furiously antisemitic populations (70+%), I think that Israel should be the last state on the planet to be abolished. 

This is a position widespread in the German left, btw., most commonly expressed by the [Anti-German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Germans_%28political_current%29) tendency, but today spreading further into the communist left, especially those who call themselves ""Antinational"", like for example,  ""UmsGanze"".

"politics","t5_2cneq","Not really.  The impetus behind the military's switch to the M-16 family of weapons was a desire to gain several things that the traditional .30 caliber battle rifles of the day lacked: 

- Light weight for both weapon and ammo

- Higher magazine capacity

- More controllable automatic fire

These three things were accomplished by sacrificing the brutal lethality of NATO .308 rounds in favor of small bullets that injure efficiently and are easier to carry.  The rationale was that a wounded enemy is combat ineffective just like a dead one.  

By the time the weapon system had found its niche, the ""AR-15"" label was exclusively applied to the civilian market version, whose main distinguishing feature was (and still is) the total lack of automatic fire capability.  So we're left with a weapon that distinguished itself from .30 caliber hunting rifles simply by being lighter, less lethal, and slightly higher in capacity.  

It becomes apparent, then, that the only trait that could make an AR-15 more dangerous is the higher capacity - and even this isn't really a fixed trait, as magazine size in any modern rifle depends entirely on the shooter's taste.  There are .30 caliber rifles with 30-round magazines and AR-15s with 10-rounders.  

In the end, the AR-15 is essentially less lethal than the old-fashioned rifles it replaced.  Unfortunately for the firearms community, the rifle's close resemblance to its military cousin makes it an easy target for claims to the contrary.  ","1435708880"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Don't cut, you have very little to cut down to (not meant to be offensive but you were losing weight for ages, so you will have put on very little muscle while on a deficit). You're at a BF where if you go any lower, you'll look ""too skinny"" and not ""cut"" or ""ripped"" because you don't have the muscle underneath that fat. Personally, I'd bulk up, do a nice slow TDEE+500 bulk for the next few months, your lifts will progress much quicker than they did in the past because you're in a caloric surplus, and you'll look better. I know that you were fat before, and the idea of eating more to make yourself look better seems like an alien concept but I think losing any weight now will be doing more harm than good.

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","They will grow, obviously.  Look at barstow.  It has 8 stalls now and sometimes it is full (or close) but not very often.

So if there are Y cars on the road, and in 5 years there are 10Y cars, they're going to need a lot more stalls.  Maybe not 10 times more stalls (due to efficiencies with peak demand spikes).  But 60 stalls at barstow?  See that's not possible.  The utility probably couldn't handle it - or at least would charge a huge fee to run the necessary power to the area.  

I expect you'll see more locations.  Like 16 stalls in victorville, 16 at barstow, maybe 8 at the ""old"" barstow area, 8 in baker, 16 in primm.  Then improve the navigation system to be able to provide optimal routes for different cars - possibly even assign you a spot # (and lower a barrier for the spot when your car approaches).   

This software (and spot barriers) could also help with local-supercharging.  If you're within current range+10% of your home address the car will recognize it and prompt if you want to use one of say 10 per year ""free local supercharing"" passes.  If you've used them up maybe it'll cost $4.99 or something.  

The really interesting question is what happens with road trips in 20 years when all cars are electric.  Hopefully there's enough increase in battery technology (and charging speed) that cars can charge in 5-10 minutes or so, otherwise having enough power (and space) to charge every car on the road every few hours is going to be an interesting problem.  Perhaps on freeways, while on autopilot the car could lower something to connect to power in the road.  ","1435708881"

Let her know your expectations - are you telling her because you are going to ask her to be your partner through this or are you going to need to walk this road alone? Contemplate in advance if you are open to her setting boundaries. If her reaction is not quite as positive as you are hoping, please allow her to express and feel all the emotions as they come. Even if she is supporting and accepting, she may still be hit with a tidal wave of emotions that may or may not make sense to her.

Since he became king, Robert married a woman that he could not love, never taught his sons to be men, surrounded his court with Lannisters, grew fat, and became a drunkard. [Hence this exchange](http://i.imgur.com/e5OB7FG.jpg) and the fan-favourite ""Gods, I was strong then!""

They basically Sumo wrestle another massive guy 100 times a game.  Athleticism cannot be defined by one type of athlete.  Would you say Usain Bolt is a bad athlete because he can't beat the best endurance runners?  I think not.  They train for something completely different and their inherent physical abilities are catered to different athletic events.

Edit:  Just to add to this a bit.  I get a little tired of the argument that one sport is better than another.  Or that one type of athlete is better than another because of the sport they play.  Watch what you enjoy and let others do the same in peace.  I find it to be better that we have more than one great sport in the world.

3. Dantonio said that after that game he needed to change how we handle our trenches because you guys annihilated us in the trenches. Lo and behold we now have very good to great lines.
4. That team was arguably the most talented team in Saban's tenure; it was devastated by injuries.
5. When healthy, that team may have been the 2nd best team in the BCS era (behind 13 FSU).
6. That team was healthy 1/1/11
7. That was Dantonio's 4th best squad at MSU. They got by on a bunch of lucky wins (hail mary vs ND, trick plays abound, couple really close wins); it was probably more of a 9-10 win team than an 11 win team. ","1435708885"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Because they lack the anatomical necessities for language, largely the flexible and ranged voice box that we posses as humans. Some animals are great vocal learners (parrots, orangutans, elephants and dolphins have all been known to imitate human sounds), but lack the specific part of the brain that allows them ""language"". This doesn't speak anything of their sentience, in the sense of having emotions and thought, though. 


The thing is, we eat animals. We literally need protein to live and function properly. Even vegetarians and vegans need some source of protein, and even then it's just not the same. Vegetarian and vegan diets are extremely unhealthy in the sense that you cannot intake animal protein (which contains amino acids, as well as being critical for bone and cartilage health) and animal proteins are digested differently than plant proteins by our bodies - they don't replace each other. Something like over 90% of vegans are also vitamin B12 deficient - this is EXTREMELY unhealthy, and will lead to health problems as these people age and continue on this diet as they age. Carnosine protects against degenerative processes in the body, and is only found in animal proteins. Omega-3 fatty acids are found both in animal proteins and plants, but is not digested properly by our body unless it is sourced from an animal. Vegans and vegetarians also have lower levels of testosterone levels (also very unhealthy - testosterone is crucial in functions of both male and female bodies) because they don't have the necessarily cholesterol to process testosterone. In fact, eating a primarily meat diet (ala Atkins) is HEALTHIER than vegan or vegetarian diets.


So why am I saying all of this? 


We need to eat animal proteins to function properly, and live long and healthy lives. An animals' sentience is not a factor in this. It's entirely emotional on our part to say ""oh, pigs (monkeys, dolphins, etc., etc. whatever animal) are intelligent, let's not eat them!"", when these animals are consumed all around the world because we literally need to eat animals. 


The point is, even if an animal feels love and fear, and all of those things, and have varying levels of sentience, we need to eat them. Because of this, it's best, in my opinion, to slaughter as humanely as possible.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","Long story short, an ex's father lived in Guatemala and used to have some businesses running down there. Around the time that he was asking to get his daughter to come down to help get the businesses started again, he found out that I was wanting to go into high energy particle physics. He said that he knew someone at CERN who could land me an interview, but he wanted to meet me first to make sure he was cool with his daughter dating me.

I didn't even think about it. We drove down to Guatemala, and spent all our money getting there. I figured it wouldn't matter because he could help me get to Geneva.

Turns out he didn't know anyone at CERN. And turns out that he was lying to his daughter about how much money he had to start the businesses back up. He had no money. But now he had two people with no money there with him to ""help him out.""

The guy was a total narcissist, and focused on getting himself more money. I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even realize that he made us his slaves. In his mind, he was probably just thinking 100% about him and how we could be of use to get him back on top.

I ended up being a cook, electronics repairman, housecleaner, and many other random things for him. At one point I even helped illegally get electricity back to his house. He would take what money we made at the end of the day and blow it on cheap rum and cheaper women.

I don't know if it sounds bad or not by how I'm wording it, but it was bad enough down there that at one point I found a patch of wild belladonna. I used a small glass bottle to store the poison that I obtained from it. I didn't know if I'd have to kill myself or kill him, but I knew that I had to be prepared for it.

In one of his attempts at making money, he got a guy from NYC interested in buying coffee. The guy came down himself and got a look at us and knew that something wasn't right. One day the guy convinced him to go check out the coffee, just the two of them. Before leaving, he slipped us his phone. I have never proven so well that just how important it is to know your parents' phone number(s). I called my father and was able to get out, luckily.

How convenient that they're constantly reminding me that I can pay real money to get that gta money.

And you can't deny that this isn't their intention with these ""free"" DLCs. They know people want this stuff (even *need* it. The new vehicle is faster than everything just so they can force people to have to buy it if they want to have a chance at winning races. The case was similar with the zentorno. They'll probably keep doing this with updates in the future) so they put ridiculous price tags on everything. If they really had the big hearts people act like they do when they talk about this ""free"" dlc, then they'd actually make this stuff free or at least within a realistic price range.

"amazonecho","t5_34em3","You still need to set this up to be remotely accessible. When it gets requests from the Alexa service, it forwards them to a configurable endpoint (which can be local).

I listed the motivations above, but basically the idea is:

(1) There's a lot of overhead in setting up an Alexa endpoint. For it to be secure, you need to validate signatures, timestamps, and set up SSL.

(2) I'd imagine it'll be a while before all platforms have mature integrations with Alexa. This fills that role until they do (or after -- really depends on if you're okay with the overhead of an extra request).

(3) It prevents you from needing to set up any of the endpoint requirements in your application. The proxy service takes care of that for you.","1435708889"

"trashy","t5_2uao3","Hopefully the first poster calls CPS, but in cases like these, most children won't get taken away because the foster care system is already overburdened with children from poverty who've suffered severe abuse and neglect. The foster system in many cases can also be just as bad or worse than this, as sexual abuse, employing foster kids as 'free labor', and neglect are also common in foster homes. It's a really shitty situation, and there's only a very slim chance that these kids will overcome their circumstances. That said, a 3-year-old and one-year-old would have a larger chance of living a better life than the older children put into foster care.","1435708890"

In Bilbao make sure to go to Viña de la Ensancha.  IMO it's just as good or better than anything you'll find in San Sebastián.  Cork has good Pintxos and a great wine/sherry selection.  Bilbao is a bit more challenging than San Sebastián (there isn't one area with 30+ pintxo places in a few block radius) but can be a lot of fun if you make an effort.

One piece of advice: make sure to order from the hot pintxos menus.  The stuff on the counter is delicious but often the best stuff needs to be ordered directly.  If you can, take some time to bone up on Spanish and Basque food vocab.  E.g. solomillo=delicious steak and txangurro=crab.  There are too many to list here but it's well worth knowing what to order.  Some places will have an English menu as well but you'll have to ask for it.","1435708892"

I wasn't sure whether you wanted the monitors included in the budget or not, and whether you wanted two more of the one you have or two different ones. I would assume that with this build you'd want to move up to a 27"" 1440p monitor, which you could get for $250-$400. You can drop the mechanical keyboard (+$170), get a cheaper CPU cooler like the Corsair H55 (+$45), get a 1TB HDD instead of 2TB (+$20). That should be enough combined with the leftover budget for a cheap membrane keyboard + a monitor or two depending which monitor(s) you choose.

One thing socialists need to understand is that without the obscene failure that is the capitalist health care system Cuba wouldn't have those anti-retrovirals. Unless you think that it was Cuban research that led to their development.

Also, there was an AMA from a dissident Cuban doctor a little while ago. He confirmed that the Cuban authorities use small 'tricks', like forced abortions, in order to make their magical unicorn health care system look far more successful than it really is.

4. Everybody has weird situations whether it be medical or something else. Money gives you the chance to get past those and still have money.

There goes all that college money you love talking about. That kind of scenario is common.

"sydney","t5_2qkob","Copy and pasted from the article.

The Sydney Film Festival almost buckled to pressure from the Church of Scientology to ban screenings of the documentary about the contentious religion, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The church’s Australian legal representative, Kennedys, sent legal threats to the SFF and the film’s distributor, Madman, claiming the film was “highly defamatory”, particularly its allegations a leader of the church placed an illegal wiretap on Nicole Kidman, the then-wife of Tom Cruise. Reel Time understands the SFF board opted to pull the film from its screening at the festival before the late intervention of artistic director Nashen Moodley. Madman continued with its commercial release. Unlike many enterprises, the church can sue for defamation in Australia because it is a “not for profit” corporation. The church’s “not for profit” status is a point of contention in the film, and is likely to be an emerging issue for the church in the US and Australia if any legal action arises. CS Australia president Vicki Dunstan says “none of the allegations in Going Clear relates to the church in Australia” and “The Church of Scientology International (CSI) has already responded to the baseless allegations” the film raised on its website (www.freedommag.org). She says the church will not “publicly discuss” its legal rights. The legal threats are part of a campaign against Alex Gibney’s film by the church. “The church is passionate about both freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion,” Dunstan says. “HBO and the producer ignored the church and the result is a ridiculous fairytale by a handful of bitter individuals with their own personal agendas.” The legal action is also believed to claim the film will breach the television codes of practice, when subsequently broadcast on subscription television (Foxtel), by perpetuating “intense dislike, serious contempt or severe ridicule” against a group on the grounds of religion. It is believed the film has been turned down for screening by Qantas too. Qantas ambassador and high-profile Scientologist John Travolta is featured in the film. Sydney Film Festival chief executive Leigh Small and Madman Entertainment did not comment.

The windows are breaking. Release windows, at least. Following the prompt screening of Russell Crowe’s The Water Diviner on Seven only three months after its successful cinema release, when the network bought out the normal 120-day holdback window for its subscription TV and rental release, Transmission Films is crunching the release windows for Australian film Strangerland and Slow West, the Western starring Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn. Australian indie Transmission will release Kim Farrant’s regional mystery starring Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving on DVD and video-on-demand platforms (but not SVOD) on July 10, and Slow West on July 29, only weeks after their Sydney Film Festival premieres and platform releases in a “SFF Presents” initiative that has produced steady box office. Transmission says the two films are part of a new, possibly ongoing, strategy releasing on DVD/VOD soon after a film’s theatrical release.

The unstoppable 2015 box office continues apace. Jurassic World has topped the box office for a third weekend, bringing its take to $38 million, while animated films Minions ($11m) and Inside Out ($9m) continue to perform well into the school holidays. Comedy Ted 2 opened with a solid $4.28m, although it is unlikely to replicate the original’s unexpected success in 2012, when it earned $34m. Beyond the strong opening weekend for period romance Far From the Madding Crowd, the story of the weekend was the performance of Sardaar Ji, which had the best screen average among all films, and earned $353,000. Movies from the subcontinent have a big audience in Australia and regularly feature in the top 20 releases each weekend. Increasingly, they’re making the top 10, as did the Punjabi film with a 50 per cent bigger screen average than Jurassic World (albeit on 23 screens, not 507). And the film is not even a Bollywood film; it is from the “Pollywood” filmmaking region of the Punjab in India and Pakistan.

Further to last week’s news of board movements at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts, some clarification is required, even if the board members themselves aren’t clear who was elected via member election and who was appointed directly by the board. It appears AACTA lawyer Tony Petani was the only person elected by the AACTA membership, in place of sitting member Ian Sutherland. Alaric McAusland, Mike Baard and Geoff Brown stepped down and Margaret Pomeranz and George Souris were board appointments. Or that’s as far as Reel Time can deduce.","1435708896"

Of course, I 'd rather have the items I ordered, but now I have to go through the waiting for my money to get refunded back to me if the seller cancels (I use debit), which he has not yet. That's $200 bucks of mine that's just sitting there that I could be using it for other things.

 No response from the seller yet, and it's great, because he lists the 5 items again for outrageous prices (like 120% more compared to everywhere else), all which say ""Only 1 Left in Stock"". Funny, because when i placed my order before he relisted everything, I bought those 5 items when they all were 1 left in stock. Is this even right??

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Great player, and also quite overrated. To hear this sub tell it he's basically 1C with Revis and Sherman. He benefits hugely from Denver's scheme, and while he plays the hell out of his role in it, he isn't the kind of guy you can drop into any D out there and have him perform similarly.

http://www.footballoutsiders.com/film-room/2014/film-room-chris-harris

&gt;The former undrafted free agent is an ideal fit in the Broncos' zone-heavy coverage philosophy, while his ability to match up to smaller, quicker receivers perfectly complements the play of Talib and Ward. Harris may be the fifth or sixth most important player on his defense and he may become less valuable when the Broncos offense is less effective and their pass rush less impressive, but he should remain a valuable starter and a good NFL player even if he has somewhat of a bloated reputation right now.

Too much staring at PFF scores rots your brains, dudes. Remember, they're grading how someone plays **their role**. Even if you think their methods are 100% reliable, PFF themselves are not saying this guy is comparable to Revis, Sherman, etc. beyond how well they think he plays **his role** in the Bronco scheme.","1435708898"

* Bosses would be nice.

* Worlds need to feel busy, but not repetitive. I've not yet seen something do this.

It could also help if you told us what you've got (2d/3d, generally what exists, what worldgen is like)

I suggest you pick one of those, and make it drive the game. Make it a big focus. Also, pick a single theme. Fantasy? Sci-fi? Steampunk? Classics (i.e. greek/romany)? Any of them, or something else would be good.","1435708899"

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","I perfectly understand whAt you mean. Bettas are hardy fish, so ammonia building up in a bowl would not kill him very fast, but WILL kill them eventually. Bettas can live for a long time, up to 3-4 years, but many dies in months living in a bowl, since there's no where for bacteria to live on, and no oxygen from flowing water. That's why we need beneficial bacteria to convert ammonia -&gt; nitrite -&gt; nitrate (less toxic, and plants eat them). Technically a bigger tank means less work, since the ammonia spread out to more water volume, so less concentrated. Many people who don'tknow about cycling do ""accidental"" fish-in cycle: the tank is cycled in the end, but the risks of fish dying is high. So it's usually recommended for beginners AND veterans to always have a test kit handy to change water once the water parameter spikes to avoid fish loss.","1435708901"

These patches look innocent enough, especially the first one. There may be a delay in starting up your computer which the patch resolves. But it trades off faster start up times for breaking some future windows updates. Both patches have a shockingly important warning: ""Do not install a language pack after you install this update. If you do, the language-specific changes in the update will not be applied, and you will have to reinstall the update.""

So anyone who installs these optional updates will not be able to correctly install a new language pack (presumably unless they uninstall these hotfixes with side effects they knew nothing about or had long forgotten).

Currently you can hide potentially destabilising patches from within Windows Update and they will never be installed. Microsoft has eliminated this feature from all non-Enterprise versions of Windows 10, *including* Windows 10 Pro: [Windows 10 Upgrades Cannot Be Stopped](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/26/free-windows-10-upgrades-danger/).

Windows 10 Home users won't be able to stop updates. Pro users may be able to delay a patch for a maximum of four to eight months: ""it only allows for a delay of up to four months from the Slow ring release before updates are then forcibly installed. This can be extended by another four months if Windows Pro users opt to use Microsoft’s ‘Windows Server Update Service’ (WSUS) instead of CBB, but it’s still only a delay.""

Losing control of what you must install on your Windows PC is a big change. So what's the relevance to PC Gaming? Continuing to run older Windows titles may require a stable platform without forced updates. Windows 7 has promised security support until 2020. Windows 10 security support is at an end when you try to blacklist a specific update: ""So what if you still try and hold out? Versions of Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro will be cut off from Microsoft’s security patches leaving it wide open to attack.""

When I consider a cost/benefit of Windows 7 vs 10 I see Windows 7 being more beneficial to informed consumers and Windows 10 being more beneficial to Microsoft. I can see the balance tipping to Windows 10 when there are Windows 10/DirectX 12 exclusive games. This can only happen if Microsoft manages to get many people to upgrade to Windows 10. To do Microsoft a big favour upgrade to Windows 10 ASAP.","1435708904"

"freefolk","t5_37tpy","&gt; It's more social acceptable to ask Martin that because of ageism.

Actually, the way I perceive it, is more to do with his weight than anything. I know it is wrong to have that mindset, but we live in a culture where it is drilled into us that being overweight means your health is at risk, especially as you get older. So maybe then, it is a combination of both. Surely both of those factors combined with societal pressure could easily give someone reason to question someone elses health?

&gt;We are specifically talking about an instance where an author appears to have the creative freedom to not be limited by those constraints.  

I would suggest that his publishers would disagree there. They are paying him to write after all. It wouldn't be out of the question for them to expect a return on their investment. The way I understand it, there is a contract between the two parties that needs to be upheld. granted, I don't know the terms of the contract, but one would have to assume Martin is being paid to write the books. Even if there was something like an advance payment, that still constitutes payment for a product. On the other hand, I am not to know how aggressive the publishing party are in pressing for that return.

&gt;Game of Thrones on HBO is based on an outline he gave D&amp;D as well as the currently released books. But no one considers it Martin's work.

maybe you and I don't consider it his work, but a portion of people might, especially if they haven't read the books and only seen the show. 

&gt; If he were to pass away before the 7th book and it was finished by someone else, it most certainly would have an asterisk as to whether it would be a true ending for the series.

Even if he doesn't there would still be those who see the show ending as the actual ending. That medium is far more widespread and consumed by a greater audience. People are aware the series is his creation, as it stands, many people might consider the TV show ending to be the 'proper' ending as it is the only one they know, and it is the most prolific ending. If he were to pass away, that ending would be the *only* ending, and as such would be *the* ending, regardless of how Martin would have done it.

Considering how the Show has handled the material to date, it is a valid worry that people do not want this situation to arise.

&gt;I think asking the question is about wanting more security about the future of the story, rather than his story. Which, while it seems to be a small difference, is wanting something differently entirely.

I disagree. To those who view *his* story as *the* story, any other continuation of it will never be acceptable. The show may go on to finish the series first, but to a majority of readers, the real ending is whatever Martin writes. To not have that ending would be pretty shit, regardless of if the adaptation could provide an ending or not.

And yeap! There is a way to make things less redundant as you've said. 

Here is one way of trimming things down:-

    if (j == intCommandSearch) {
        int intArray = Integer.parseInt(ptOutcomeArray[i][j]);
        // IF '=', then check if it is really == 
        // IF '&lt;', then check if it is really &lt;
        // IF '&gt;', then check if it is really &gt;
        if ((userIntSearchType.equals(""="") &amp;&amp; userRealIntSearch == intArray)
            || (userIntSearchType.equals(""&lt;"") &amp;&amp; userRealIntSearch &lt; intArray)
                || (userIntSearchType.equals(""&gt;"") &amp;&amp; userRealIntSearch &gt; intArray)) {
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; numColumns; k++) {
                System.out.print(ptOutcomeArray[i][k] + ""\t"");
            }
            System.out.println("" "");
        }
    }

The comparison operators can be combined into a single IF statement! This is of course with the help of the &amp;&amp; and || operators. Pay close attention to the opening and closing brackets as they are essential for the IF statement to work.

Another alternative is as you've said, we can break things down into methods! You can either move the deepest for loop into its own method or move the IF statements into their own methods...or both! :) As long as it makes sense and does not make the readability of the code worse, break things down to as small as you like.","1435708907"

I don't see a lot of people going into Sears, but I guess it's up to you if you like that type of store. I only go there since it's close by, and the good stores like BN, Gamestop, and VS are still alive and kicking. Plus, the black hole of shopping (Target) is right next door.

Again, we don't quite know what's going to happen now; we're bugging the devs for more info, and trying to find what our possibilities are. Right now, there are two things: *there are no plans for more Mojang-made expansions to game content, and that they only guarantee the servers will be up until July 2016.* They could expand support still, possibly with enough fan support, but that's what their stated plans are currently.

* There will be 30 days it's public during phase 1 -- before Obama can sign the agreement. (It doesn't become law on this signature, though. It just indicate the US is accepting the agreement with the other nations.) 

* After that there will be months of work in Congress. This is an open-ended period that could go on for months.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is a specific example, but I think it is worth mentioning.

I was a family therapist and it was almost always extremely hurtful and damaging to a child and family when the parents would make these statements.  Language is powerful.  The words we use influence how we think.  When parents say they think their child has bipolar or oppositional defiant disorder, they often say it in the hopes that the problem is in their child instead of also being a parenting problem.  They are also completely wrong 9/10 times.  Parents would tell me they didn't need to be involved in the therapy because its the child's problem not theirs.  One even was offended that I had stipulated she had to be involved because she felt like it was a punishment her child was putting on her because of his behavior.  Kids will carry these labels and think they are inherently broken and unfixable.

Almost all kids with mental illnesses who struggle are having trouble because of maladaptive parenting.  This doesn't mean they are bad people.  It means they may need to re think how they parent in light of these behavior patterns/psychiatric needs.

I almost always start therapy with a discussion of what a diagnosis means and why in some ways its not worth even focusing on what the ""specific diagnosis"" is.  Yes, I diagnosed your child with oppositional defiant disorder.  Part of the reason I did is because your insurance won't let you do therapy without one.  This does not take away from the fact that there is a behavioral component that needs to be addressed with parenting skills.  Yes this could PARTIALLY be treated with psychiatric meds.  But you also have to be a better parent.  Yes that means you have to attend therapy.  Yes that means therapy specifically with just parents.

TLDR: Language influences how we think.  Kids carry the inappropriate labels we put on them like ""bipolar"" or ""oppositional defiant disorder"" and begin to think they are inherently broken or unfixable.  And that's a dick thing to do to a kid once you know why its important to use these terms correctly.  So don't be a dick.","1435708916"

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","&gt;I guess people are comparing a city (Portland) and you're comparing a state (Texas.) which doesn't seem exactly fair.

Well, outside of Austin, the culinary ""scene"" in Texas is understated. And there are *a lot* of different styles in Portland, which is something that excited me at first. There's variance in styles in Austin, too, but not as much as Portland. To get the breadth of comparison of the different kinds of foods in Portland v. Texas, I thought it be fair to compare the Texas food scene generally.

&gt;I have also heard Austin's vegan scene rival's Portland's, so I'm excited to check it out for that alone, since we have an incredible Vegan selection...

I don't know much about the vegan scene in Austin, tbh. I've heard good things, but I do know of a few joints that I enjoyed a lot that were vegetarian, at least. One is Mr. Natural's, which is a Mexican vegetarian joint, and the other is a small little place on Guadalupe (the Drag) in Austin, called (fittingly) Veggie Heaven. It's an Asian joint and all their dishes are plant-based. Mother's Cafe is really good, as well. Kerby Lane Cafe, while not strictly vegetarian, has a lot of really good vegetarian options.

If you ever go to Houston, *the* vegetarian place to go is the Hobbit Cafe. The place has been open since the 70s and is consistently good.","1435708918"

I've brought plenty when I appealed to the Sixth Circuit:

Katz v. United States, 289 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct.507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967):

&gt;The Government stresses the fact that the telephone booth from which the petitioner made his calls was constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he entered it as he would have been if he had remained outside. But what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eye -- it was the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a business office, [n10] in a friend's apartment, [n11] or in a taxicab, [n12] a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.

McCall v. Courier-Journal, 623 S.W.2d (Ky. 1981) (1) One who invades the right of privacy of another is subject to liability for the resulting harm to the interest of the other

For now make up a box with some blankets in so it has a safe place to retreat to and put it somewhere dark and secure.  If you have a cat carrier that'll do as well as anything.  

If it's drinking the kitten milk it's not going to starve overnight, and you could try giving it some jelly or gravy from the kitten food to lick from your fingers to get it used to the idea of solid food.  The vet will be the best person to advise on all of this.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","&gt; I had previously thought that it could perhaps be tied to proximity to Falchion or to the Binding Shield (being artifacts of particular Naga-y resonance), but that no longer seems to be the case given more recent information. Still working on coming up for a better explanation. Note that, because Naga is dormant for most of the 1000 years that the Brand has been around, it cannot be a result of conscious decision on her part.

Perhaps it's something of a combination? Proximity to Naga-y artifacts guarantees major blood inheritance, and therefore the brand, but outside of that proximity it operates by FE4 rules. Therefore, a member of the royal family marrying outside of the family and moving away from Ylisstol would see their brand fade in a few generations, while the ruling line would never see it fade, thanks to the Shield of Seals and the Falchion.

God. The way they treat Prime like a spin off is downright insulting, it's as if it doesn't deserve to be held in the same regard as the 2D titles. 

And then there's Sakamoto being the only hand on Metroid that bugs me. The man's sexist mind is literally poison on the series, and yet Nintendo leaves him in charge. Japanese respect is so weird. They were so willing to throw Gunpei Yokoi under the bus for the Virtual Boy mistake, but they let the Metroid brand be damaged by letting Sakamoto have the full reins? Sheesh.

Even if you were I'd say that the passage of time is an overriding factor and further that the comparison is difficult because in the context of reconstruction the Southern states were allowed to retain their rights to that flag and their history for 150 years and people like Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davis were given amnesty in the spirit of rebuilding the union on good terms.

On crating, we had a really tough time getting her used to the crate, even as a puppy. She hated it and would bark, whine, and try to dig her way out. She actually destroyed several in her anxiety to get out. 

For some reason, that has not been an issue this time. We've worked with her on it, she actually goes in it some on her own and we found her hiding in it a few times when she knew she was in trouble. We have tried to make that her space and so far it's worked well. 

As for separation anxiety, we consulted with a few trainers in the area and they seemed to indicate that her behavior lead them to believe she was the ""alpha dog"" in the family, which was a contributor to the separation anxiety. 

One part that I failed to mention in my post is that we have been living with my parents for the last year while I start a business. They treat her like a grandchild and for the entire year they disregarded everything we asked them to do with her. They let her sit on a chair at the table, they greeted her immediately at the door, etc (there is a lot more...). Basically, everything that reinforces bad behavior and put her ""in charge"". 

We're slowly and kindly breaking her out of that and have seen some improvements. I can't say whether or not we can leave yet without her, but we're going to experiment soon and see. ","1435708932"

"CHICubs","t5_37k90","Castro has four total extra-base hits in the entire month of June, and a .630 OPS on the year. 

Today he's batting 4th. Is that not fair to be concerned about, regardless of what he's done in TWO at-bats today?","1435708934"
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The problem isn't that a team can't be treated as one member. It's that the formula doesn't account for a team being treated as one member. People make really simple mistakes by assuming that formulas designed for 1-on-1 interactions seamlessly translate to team comparisons because ""well, a team is also one thing"". All those extra players introduce a much higher potential for single-game variance than the formula was ever meant to account for. It will still do a sort-of passable job at roughly saying ""this team or person wins more often"", because it's hard to completely botch the calculations, but when people start talking 50-200 Elo points worth of precision, that's fantasy.

When you have a large potential for variance, typically you'll want enough degrees of freedom to allow for a calculation to overlook that. Elo incorporates some of that too, due to acknowledging single-game variance between players, but using it is choosing to be less precise than possible, which is ill-advised when expecting comparisons based on 5-10% differences.","1435708934"

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","Totally :) sometimes I cut over-ambitiously and end up a grumpy shell of a human - for my 2-week check, if I'm feeling like that, I up the calories a couple hundred then re-assess in another 2 weeks. Then, once I've repeated that and found a deficit I can function on, I wait 4-6 weeks to make sure I'm losing weight at the pace I want to (too fast = lose too much muscle, too slow = frustrating progress/mental fallout). So 2 weeks for ""bad"" stuff, 4-6 weeks for effectiveness.

2 weeks is also for digestive upset or those kinds of side effects - it gives my body enough time to adjust to a new normal, and if it hasn't adjusted in 2 weeks it probably won't so then I would stop whatever was causing it.","1435708935"

I'm going to voice a minority opinion here - While I enjoyed Hibike! Euphonium, I did not enjoy it nearly as much as other people did. I was never a band geek, so this show did not make me wax nostalgic. The sheer banality of watching characters practicing instruments and doing their best may appeal to some, but I ultimately found the show quite dry in that respect. 

It's surprisingly realistic for an anime, though. The drama was there halfway there (like the tension between Kumiko and her sister, Asuka's facade), but not as touched upon as the characters' attempts to improve their playing and one up one another. ","1435708935"

Sure enough it's in the service agreement.  . They have called and spoken to tech support 23 times since they installed the service.   Comcast has issued 18 incremental one day credits for lack of connection. They told her just call on the days she doesn't have it and we will keep issuing credits.

It seems, however, that Gensokyo indirectly informed pretty much the entire HKE (they modified a map to include in in HT's area) just after we told them, which makes the possibilities very large.

I made that discovery myself, I travelled to MA by rail, and when I looked on the map I was like ""Huh, where did New Phoenix go?"", so I checked it out on my way back.

By now, I'm very much ready to say that it may not have been Gensokyo, but it seems both Gensokyo officials and me agree that it was caused, either directly or indirectly, by them leaking the adjusted map mentioned above. Whether it was done by someone who wanted to stir up trouble between Gensokyo and Holy Tree or by someone whose intentions were as we stated is therefore less clear, but it still seems highly likely (albeit there are other possibilities now) that it was an HKE citizen.","1435708937"

Also Price and Lunqdqvist's save percentages across each season they've played are both pretty comparable, though Price's season this past year is better than anything Henrik has done. But Lundqvist's career save percentage is better than Price's (.9293 vs .9281).

I know it may seem odd asking for help on a sub made for silvers to get help, but I see your past experience as a semi-pro and I want to follow a similar path. My team recently made playoffs in CEVO-Free, but after some time I decided to step up as the IGL. I have a general idea of what to do as in listen to comms and call a move based on information, set up defaults, etc., but I really want to be successful, otherwise I feel like the ~1800 hours I've put into the game will be for nothing. Also I just want to improve in general just as a player, because as the IGL I want to be able to be well rounded and have the fragging ability, not just the mindset. I honestly don't know how I can improve other than practicing my aim everyday, so I'd really appreciate it if you could help me out:

I'm not going to give the grand explanation of it as you can read it here  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism . But essentially that would mean it is a neurological disorder. Think for example if you are male, do you feel male? If female, do you feel female? Or do you just feel like you? Gender Dysphoria is the idea that you can feel a gender, but in actuality you can only feel what you percieve the other gender to feel like. I know seems like a contradiction to the biologic disorder part, but I think it kind of goes hand in hand. A male is born with a brain defect in which part of his brain works like a females and then gives him the delusion of actually being female despite the rest of his body working like a healthy male.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Please refer to what I said and only what I said.  A statistical argument used broadly to justify overseas ""wars on terror"" that is based on the number of 9/11 style attacks on US soil post-9/11 is nonsense for the reasons I mentioned above.  However, if you want to speculate specifically on how Osama's Al Qaeda organization was disrupted by targeted operations in Afghanistan, and how that (among other things, including freezing of financial assets, increased intelligence, etc.) contributed to a reduced threat from his organization, go ahead.  There is no problem with that.  Also, throw in the bombings of the embassies in Africa and the attack on the Cole prior to 9/11 while you're at it.  Sure, we pretty much took care of Al Qaeda, the one organization that had proven itself capable of launching large scale attacks against the US.  I don't even have a problem with speculation on how other wars have or have not contributed to a terror threat.  Just know that there are no meaningful statistics that will support your speculation either way.","1435708941"

I might be wrong, but I think there is a xbox elite subreddit around here somewhere. That might be a better place to ask if you are looking at winging up with someone as PC players cannot interact with xbox, and vice versa. If you are just looking for tips then ignore all I just wrote.

Some tips (might know these already)

Never fly what you cannot afford to rebuy. (keep enough for insurance, though you can get a loan).

Rebind that ""jettison all"" key (might not be an issue on xbox).

when jumping and the countdown starts (4...3...2...1) kill your throttle. The jump is already committed and it will not disengage, and you do not have to worry about flying too close to the star upon jumping into the next system. (Again and might be for all these tips not an issue with xbox because of different controls).

Also always remember ""KGB FOAM"" These are the star classes that you can scoop fuel from.

In a worst case scenario, they can keep pretending that Aldo fights, then at the last minute pull him out and put in Mendes. Then for any last minute trailers, they can just omit the part about aldo or mendes from the promos. 
Just show some Mcgregor highlights with some text about how the Irish Ali is finally getting a title shot. Show that shot of him screaming with his arms out, and Bam! PPV somewhat salvaged and the winner can fight Aldo later this year.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","I agree that you should get a vitamin c product. Not sure if LAA will be good right now, since I assume you're still adjusting to the retinoid and LAA can be quite irritating to sensitive skin. Something gentler, like MAP might be a better option for you, at least until your skin settles into the retinoid.                                           

In the meantime, look for leave-on products containing niacinamide (wash off products don't deliver enough of this type of ingredient because it doesn't have a chance to soak into your skin), as well as other topical whiteners, such as arbutin, licorice, mulberry, bearberry, Job's tears/coix seed, lemon/citrus extracts, rice extracts, yeast ferments, milk, turmeric, and tranexamic acid. I have major issues with pigmentation and I generally get these items into my skin through my essence (Missha First Treatment Essence the original version), my serum (Sunday Riley Good Genes - very lactic acid heavy so probably not suitable for you at the moment), sheet masks and wash off masks. CosDNA is also a great resource to find suitable products with these ingredients.                                

Once your skin settles, I would definitely revisit the issue of at least doing a light AHA with the derm. More than any other product I've used, AHA products have made the most difference in PIH. A series of light chemical peels done every week - bi-weekly can make a huge difference. Even a 5% - 10% AHA toner or serum, used 2-3x a week can produce noticeable change.                                         

But before you jump down the rabbit hole of whitening products, I would like to suggest another course of action....you can just wait it out lol. Retinoid is one of the strongest medicines for hyperpigmentation, and if it's working for you, then it might be a good idea to just stay the course and allow it to do what it needs to do. Your pigmentation is pretty mild-looking to me, and a year on retinol is ample time for it to clear, provided you don't have an acne flare up. Experimentation can lead to further breakouts (in other places too), which can lead to even more pigmentation and frustration. I might recommend starting a regular regimen of sheet masks with whitening products because if you use them enough, they really do help, but besides that, sometimes it's a good idea not to rock the boat lmao.

Vayne is not as strong as you make her seem, she's extremely weak during laning phase and keep in mind that she doesn't have that much lifesteal until she gets cutlass. If you want to win against a vayne you need to DESTROY HER, champs like corki, graves and draven just burst her down before she gets a chance to apply silverbolts. Other champs like cait and ashe have much more range than her and kite her. 

The thing against vayne is that she can outplay you or wait until she gets enough item to just straight up 1v1 your ass, know your limits if you play a bursty champ like graves or corki then fkin trade with the bitch early game, land your abilities and you will outrade her but if you're playing cait or ashe DO NOT let her all in you.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","I feel like there's a disconnect here between idealised goals and the real-world situation. I think most psychologists and behavior analysts would absolutely agree with creating a less punitive world through what we know about ethics and the behavior sciences - even the Judge Rotenberg and Matthew Israel would agree. 

The difficulty is in the fact that given what we know about behavioral science, we know that *at least for some theoretical situations and behaviors*, only punishment methods will be effective (as demonstrated by the debunking of Skinner's work on punishment, mostly by people like Azrin and Holz). The debate therefore can't be over whether punishment is ethical (because it has to be when the only alternative is death or severe injury), and instead the debate is only over whether punishment is necessary for these specific cases. 

I think it's too easy sometimes to view the world in black and white and say that aversives should never be used but when you have a situation where someone is going to kill themselves or severely and permanently injure themselves (against their will and wishes) and a situation where an uncomfortable shock is presented, I think most ethicists would lean towards the latter (especially when all relevant experts, judges, parents, and often clients consent to the procedure). 

You can raise the issue of choosing to terminate services but often these are people who are either too young to consent or need the help of someone to make such decisions for them (as unfortunate as that is, and of course independent advocates need to ensure the decision is in the best interests of that person and not the caregiver). So in the same way we don't let children choose to terminate their treatment in cases like chemotherapy because it hurts so much, we often don't in behavioral cases either (especially because ending it early could leave them in a worse position than starting so it would be unethical to do so).

There's still plenty of stupid and unreasonable stuff in 8th edition. Things like invincible vampires for example. I get that a blender vampire lord should beat 100 skaven.... but for a horde of 100 skaven to not even be able to scratch him is absurd. Those kind of situations are where point values are just stupid. It was also the problem with big units that were just tarpits and couldn't kill anything. It doesn't make for a fun or exciting game.   
Shit like only the 3 little rats in base contact can attack a single vampire made it even worse. 

Adding complexity and extra rolls doesn't automatically make the game better. You talk about narrative experience... but as awesome as vampires are... they shouldn't be able to kill 250 rats thrown at them at the same time.

"marketing","t5_2qhmg","I just enrolled in a 2-year Master's of Marketing program at a school in Europe, starting in September. I was debating for over a year if it was a good idea or not since most of the people in this sub from previous similar threads seem to think that it's unnecessary. I've lurked on this topic on /r/marketing for a while here's what i've gathered. 

Everyone will tell you experience is the most important thing in the field of marketing. Some people go as far as saying that if you have a master's you'll appear overqualified and it will actually hurt your chances of getting a job. Some people say that you don't even need a degree at all to get good marketing jobs. 

Many people say that pursuing a masters is only a good if you do it at a top school for networking purposes. I see where they're coming from, but I find it hard to believe that the benefits gained from networking would really pay off in the long run considering the tuition costs. Others say it's only good if you want to work at a big corporation as a manager of some sort, and if you're wanting to work at a small agency it's useless. I don't really want to work at a corporation but I could see myself doing it if the brand stood for something I believe in, so i guess it's good to have the degree.

Most people will tell you that it's best to get 2-3 years of work experience before going to MBA or Msc Marketing. I think they're absolutely right. I got my bachelors in psychology in 2010, I've been working in marketing for a couple years now. I would definitely not want to go into the master's program without the working experience that I have now. I plan to continue working at least part-time online for this company while I'm doing the masters so I can try to apply anything I'm learning in school to the business i'm working for. 

With all that said, my school is tuition free so it made it a lot easier for me to decide on going for the master's since it wont cost me a ton of money in the end and it's a good life experience. If I had to take out a fuck-ton of student loans I'd probably skip it altogether and wouldn't go back to school unless the employer paid for it. 

If you're not going to grad school you can still also just get various marketing qualifications online that will add a bit to your resume.

I'm 28 years old now and the way I look at it, If I don't go back to school by the time I'm 30, I never will. I'd hate to look back when I'm 40 and wish I would've just gotten the degree while I had the opportunity. 
 
I hope that helps.

As to the idea that the day of your birth produces evil spirits, and that's why you need friends around? That seems an awfully flimsy excuse to party.

So I don't have any qualms about looking at gore. It's very fascinating to me. 

I think it might have to do with my experiences growing up. I simply think everyone has their own problems and no one helped out with mine, so I don't feel better or worse when people react or don't react to my stories. Most of my anecdotes are simply amusing at this point and I have a morbid sense of humor due to it.

Of course I don't share that information freely unless the person knows me very very well. Even then it would take a pertinent situation for me to divulge my experiences relating to the event.  

Then again movies like Frozen, Grave of the Fireflies, Brokeback Mountain and some others definitely made me tear up at the end. Life isn't a movie though and I have my bits and pieces that make me feel emotional, especially if I drink. I simply think my circumstance and life experiences have made it incredibly difficult for me to empathize with most peoples' problems. Instead I view it as an opportunity to understand why the problems exist and what the person has done to contribute to those issues. It's rather pragmatic. ","1435708958"

Vegetables fill you up because they're bulky and have fiber and you can eat a lot more of them to get the same calories as you can with meat.  But if they don't fill you up, eat other stuff like beans, nuts, faux meats, healthy fats, bread, grains, etc...

Protein and fat and fiber are excellent for feeling sated, and you can find all those things in abundance from vegan sources.

So you could attach it to the case if you really want to and you don't move it around much, but it seems really insecure.

Meanwhile I'm waiting for my Massdrop Infinity so I can actually use the case I bought.

According to the Prima Guide, the Jet Squelcher has 80 range, 32 damage, and 40 fire rate while the Dual Squelcher has 68 range, 27 damage and 55 fire rate.

But the biggest difference between them has to be the subs and specials, Jet Squelcher has a Splat Wall and Inkstrike and Dual Squelcher has Splat Bombs and Echolocator.

Overall, the Jet Squelcher is better suited for a more defensive, campy playstyle and the Dual Squelcher is made for being more offensive at long-range, like the Squiffer.","1435708970"

"tressless","t5_2shlm","Why does the community ignore it? Simple. They are trying to be ""scientific"" but are actually being the exact opposite of scientific. Many members of any hair loss community considers themselves well rehearsed in the science of hair loss so when something comes up to question their knowledge, they instantly reject it.

These people are rather, unscientific. In science, you always consider every possible option because even if you rule out an idea 999 times maybe the 1000th time will yield a different result. You never rule something out in science no matter how bizarre. Sure, you don't consider it every second of the day but you keep it in the back of your mind. 

For the more basic person, I believe they reject this notion because abstaining is common amongst conservative groups who will make up nonsense. People here think that you are trying to do the same even though you aren't.

I've tried to figure this out on my own but obviously unable. But as a theory, there is a correlation. 1) Masturbation causes more stress, especially when compared to normal orgasm. 2) There is an underlying condition which constant ejaculation brings up which then comes to effect hair loss.

And I don't think there is a increase in young people losing their hair young. Maybe more people are shaving it because of the gym look. But as somebody who is &lt;20 losing hair, I can tell you that the older people in my family also lost all their hair &lt;25. There are too many factors to consider in any scenario to go to a one way conclusion.

Il fatto che il vero nodo sia quello può essere desunto da due fattori. 

Il primo è che, nei limiti in cui si può dire una cosa del genere, l'hanno ripetuto allo sfinimento i tedeschi. ""Moral hazard"" è la formula che usano. Se salviamo la grecia aumenta il rischio che gli altri paesi indebitati vogliano meno austerità. Lo ripetevano fino all'anno scorso in riferimento ai governi moderati che avrebbero voluto trattare alla renzi o berlusconi per qualche decimale di deficit/pil. Da quando è comparso lo scenario che possa addirittura arrivare al governo un syriza italiano o spagnolo lo spauracchio del moral hazard è diventata un eventuale situazione alle greca (anche nel medio/lungo termine). Con la differenza che spagna e ancor più italia minaccerebbero con la bomba atomica economica del debito che hanno. 

Il secondo è che sarebbe costato di gran lunga meno salvare la grecia, minuscola per le dimensioni dell'eurozona, di quanto costino le operazioni per mettere al riparo dal pericolo grecia. Si stimava 30 miliardi nel 2011, un'inezia a confronto della ricapitalizzazione delle banche dovuta alla crisi innescata sui debiti. Sono andati poi crescendo i soldi che sarebbero stati necessari al salvataggio, così come quelli impiegati per mettersi al riparo dal mancato salvataggio. Anche oggi converrebbe di gran lunga dal punto di vista economico chiuderla in 5 minuti, se non lo si fa è sempre per il moral hazard che si favorirebbe, a partire dalle elezioni spagnole di dicembre.

There's also a long, well established set of rules and laws for how checks are to be handled, when they're valid, and who's responsible for what if something goes wrong at any stage of the check payment process.  For example, when you take the New York bar exam you study a whole unit on ""commercial paper,"" ie checks.

*The Spectre: Crimes and Judgements* is super creepy

*Wrath of the Spectre* is an excellent bit of '70s horror if you can find it

*Superman: Kryptonite* is a great story about Superman encountering kryptonite for the first time

*DC 2000* is a two issue prestige format miniseries, and something of a thematic sequel to DC One Million. The Justice Society of 1941 encounter a weird team of heroes with a name similar to their own from almost 60 years in the future.

*Hawkworld* was a fantastic gritty reboot of Hawkman (DC didn't muck up Hawkman until they decided Hwkworld happened ""now"" instead of at the same time as Man of Steel or Batman: Year One) .

*Adam Strange: Planet Heist* is fun space opera with gorgeous art.

Correct in respect to July, but we in recent history we have had 2 cyclone events outside of the standard cyclone season in the Queensland jurisdiction in 2002/03 and 2006/07:

A cup of milk in a a recipe? That's easy, you just use...a cup. Because of the irregularity of the imperial system, for common daily measurements you almost never need more than 3 or 4 of a unit, or less than half of another.

still, it stands to reason that the ""power"" issue alone wouldn't explain why the vast majority of ps3 and 360 titles have skipped the u.  ""worth the effort""?  hard to know how to quantify that.  

""difficulty of working with the system"" makes a lot more sense.  even so, it's just super hard for me to believe that if the wii-u had x86 architecture or power pc architecture or peanut butter octopus architecture, it'd be seeing any more 3rd party support than it currently does.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh, gotcha. But doesn't

&gt;people lie (to themselves and others)

mean that *no one* is infallible? That's what I was getting hung up on, I think--the way you phrased it, it looks like you're arguing that, from a given person's perspective, they are infallible and can be trusted to make their own judgments of things, while *everyone else* is fallible and should not be incorporated into judgments. Which...isn't sustainable beyond a single viewpoint.

I mean, there are definitely things in which my personal experience on a subject *is* totally irrelevant. I couldn't say with authority what it's like to be black, or Australian, or to have read all the Lord of the Rings novels. So I have to construct a representation of what it's like based on other people's accounts, none of which I have much useful input into. I can use my experiences as a counterexample--I've experienced what it's like to be white, American, and popular ^((sorry, easy joke)^) , which lets me contrast other people's experiences with my own. But none of that information comes from *me*--I know fuck-all about Australia on a purely first-hand basis. I certainly wouldn't be able to contradict an Aussie talking about living in Australia with any sort of authority.

I mean, is it possible that other people are being dishonest about their experiences? Yeah, totally. For example, I don't particularly think that tracing Boromir's heritage is as plot-crucial as someone deeply invested in Tolkenian lore might think it to be. And that Aussie I'm talking to is probably exaggerating the size of the spiders he's run into.

But just like I shouldn't assume that everyone is being entirely honest and impartial all the time, I don't have to assume that everyone is being *dishonest* (maliciously or not) all the time, either. Is it possible that Australia is actually a frigid arctic iceflow and everyone's just lying about the heat? Yeah, it's *technically* possible. I've never been there. I wouldn't know. But I process information that other people tell me and I reach the conclusion that, hey, Australia's probably pretty hot. I don't have any *personal* basis for that belief, but I can synthesize multiple sources of information to arrive at a consistent representation. If other Aussies verified that other guy by describing the enormous size of the spiders they've seen, I'd be more likely to accept that what he's saying is true.

Like, what would science and gays get out of teaming up to fabricate evidence for homosexuality being due to factors out of a parent's control? Like, more gays get made? All of sociology is on the payroll of Big Homo's plot to, what, overrun the straights?

I dunno. I totally understand the desire to be skeptical and critical of ideas. That's important. But it's only fair to be consistent with that lens of criticism, because only turning it on certain people and opinions is just as bad as never using it. If no one is infallible, then you're not, either.","1435708984"

I ended up being friends with my colleague's friends too.  It just keeps extending that way.  There's nothing to stop you from meeting new people outside work, such as hobby groups, online games, etc.

My transition was smooth.  I already interned for the company the previous year and aced it so my application went through without a hitch.  On my first day a colleague or two sat down with me during lunch.  We ended up being friends since we had similar interests.  You'll also be friends even with people outside your team, since you WILL work with other teams for extended periods.  Companies usually have many activities such as team-building so join as many of them as you can.  I met friends that way, even though they're in teams that developers don't collaborate with.

The biggest change is that your career and output is now your responsibility.  School professors are just there to guide you on what you should study and give you programming problems.  Your code is probably messy, not maintainable, but it works as a solution (hopefully).  If you fail?  You'll just retake the subject.  It's not the case with work.  If you mess up, it can cost you and your company $$$.

"DarkFuturology","t5_2vva3","&gt;The only way out of this is for people to realize and quickly, transactionally (all at once) that true direct democracy is in fact, possible because of the internet.

Feel free to provide a working model of your direct democracy alternative. As soon as you can show it works, and isn't just a nice sounding ideal that fall apart in practice, then I am quite sure more and more places will start adopting it. Frankly, based just on the ballot initiative process in Oregon where people lower taxes, make new taxes nearly impossible, strip critical infrastructure funding to pay for pet projects and then pass ballot initiatives for unfunded liabilities, the idea of an internet based direct democracy horrifies me. 

As a group, humans are reactionary and tend to show little in the way of foresight. This problem is bad enough with a representative democracy where leaders feel the need to respond to the whims of their constituency. That problem would be amplified many fold in a direct democracy. Direct democracy sounds nice and all in theory, but I am quite sure in practice it would be a complete cluster-fuck. 

Hell, ancient Athens was a direct democracy for a decent stretch, and they did plenty of horrible shit. This despite being a very small population that was tremendously rich by ancient standards and with a good amount of leisure time due to the prevalence of slavery. There is a reason guys like Plato looked longingly to the *actual* tyranny of Sparta and tended to be rather dismissive of their brand of democracy. Representative democracy legitimately solves many of the problems of direct democracy by providing space for (comparatively) sober debate while still providing citizens a voice and a vote.

Retcons are weak glue, man. Haven't played it. Doubt it changes anything to do with Hylian origin, so I'm not going to engage on this point further.

Majora's Mask still starts in a forest, again, my point. The forest is everywhere.

&gt; Has nothing to do with Hylia or Hylians though.

It has everything to do with the theme of the games, though, which I think is going to tie into the inspiration for Zelda's overall theme and the word Hylian. They're elves, after all, a fantasy item that has always been related to forests.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","Preface: It all started about two weeks ago on this post https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/3a1qp0/what_headphones_do_you_like_that_no_one_else_does/ and another post which asked about commenting on our collections. As I was browsing through the replies, I came upon /u/metal571’s and /u/keanex’s posts commenting about the ATH-A900/A900X, and in them I noticed something that caught my interest: that they were euphoric *tips headphones* sounding. This made me really interested as I’ve heard that these are really excellent performers for the money, and that they are an enjoyable experience as well as having very special mids that make vocals sound sweet and creamy and lush. I previously had a taste of the A500 that a friend let me try and I thought that they sounded great as well as having a pretty large soundstage for a closed back. 

Anyways, I scoured eBay for an ATH-A900 (I remember hearing that this was the best built version as it’s made in Japan, I don’t know if the A900X is also built there) and lo and behold, I found a pair for $55, the only issue being the pads were worn out with the veneer material flaking off. So upon confirming with /u/metal571 that this was a great deal, I went ahead and purchased them instantly.

Upon arrival, I immediately took off the pads and removed all of the flaking material, basically turning the stock pads into cloth/velour-ish pads. When I listened to the headphones, however, I KNEW that the bass was not at its full potential, plus the headphones leaked the same amount of sound as not having them on your head (what’s the point of closed headphones if they leak the same as an open-back?). So, I took off the pads and put on my K240 pads, which fit perfectly. Now, I don’t know if these pads change the sound on these headphones (I doubt it), but for the time being I’ll use these. I ordered the Clarino pads from the ATH-A2000X and once they arrive I’ll post impressions on those.

Build and comfort: These are very sturdy headphones, and the build quality is solid. The cups are made out of aluminum and they have a sort of blue and purple color (my phone made them purpler than they actually are). The rest of them are made of plastic, but the plastic feels solid. Isolation is okay to good, but what surprised me is that these do not leak sound at all at my listening volumes. Outstanding.

I have a relatively normal to small head size. These headphones are very comfortable. They do not feel heavy on your head. The wing system on these is great, with the proper amount of tension. Leagues better than the ATH-AD700X that I owned for a short time. The wing system on those felt very flimsy and loose, and the headphones would slowly start to slide down my head. Also, something that I love about these is that the cups swivel up and down. Why oh why , Audio-Technica, do you not have this feature on your open models and some of the higher-end closed models? This is what killed the AD700X for me, as the top parts of the pads never touched my head/did not seal.

Sound: Before I describe the aspects of the sound, I noticed something very special about these headphones: these are the first headphones that I have tried where I just… enjoyed the music. No criticizing, no analyzing, just pure enjoying. With my other pairs, while I enjoy the music, I also tend to analyze the music as well, such as thinking things like “the highs in this song are good” or “the bass impact could be better”, etc. Not with these. You just put them on and enjoy what you’re listening to. Obviously though I had to analyze for the sake of this review.

 Let’s start with the lows. These have just the right amount of bass to satisfy all genres of music in my opinion. The bass is quick, tight, and has a nice punch. The bass extends down to about 30Hz. These are not basshead headphones. I hate basshead headphones or headphones that have bloated and boomy bass. These provide a bass response that is just above neutral to provide an enjoyable experience.

The mids are what I consider the highlight of these headphones, and are special indeed. I don’t know how Audio-Technica did it, but these provide some of the most lust, creamy, smooth mids that I’ve heard thus far. They have a nice body to them which makes acoustic instruments sound very nice. Vocals, especially female vocals, are awesome on these. I’ll exaggerate that when I first heard female vocals through these that I got shivers down my back and I began giggling like a little girl. You really have to experience how the mids sound on these, as even for me they are hard to describe. 

The highs on these are also perfectly balanced along with the mids and lows. They have the characteristic of being nice, sparkly, and bright when they need be to yet at the same time not being harsh or fatiguing at all. Great extension. Instruments such as cymbals, snares, hi-hats, and the like come out very nicely through these.

So, to describe the sound of these overall, I’d consider them to be natural and organic sounding. Nothing sounds artificial on these as far as I can tell. Separation is very good, and they have a big soundstage despite being closed-back. These probably rival the soundstage of the K550 that I used to own.

Conclusion: I really love these headphones and I could not be happier with my purchase. These (and the A900X) are a great value for the money and have now become my go-to recommendation for closed-backs under $200. These are very enjoyable and fun headphones to listen to despite having a balanced signature. Whenever I think about “fun” headphones I think of headphones that have a strong V-shaped sound signature, yet these are fun without having that type of signature. Usually when people think of balanced they think of a boring sound, but these are anything but boring.

Additionally, you have to take in account that these were all findings independent of one and another.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","If you're showing up to a tournament with anything but a competitive, top-tier deck, then you're not playing the same game as the people who are.  The cost of entry to a tournament in which you want to play the game of ""try to win the tournament"" is [entry fee + (cost of competitive deck / number of tournaments entered with deck)].  Competitive magic is an expensive hobby, which means that people who can't afford it (or can't borrow cards from friends) are excluded.  Does that suck?  Yeah, but there's not really much to be done about it.  If you like having new magic cards show up every so often, then you need to support the secondary market, because that's what supports WOTC designing and developing new sets.  That also supports the companies that run the large tournaments.

&gt; I'm not advocated undercutting the secondary market and breaking tournament rules by using fakes.

It sounds like that's exactly what you're advocating for.

&gt; Are there any formats that are played at a pro-level that restrict deck budgets?

That's basically what Standard is, when compared to Modern, Legacy, or Vintage.  If you mean a hard budget cap, that's impossible.  The good previously-inexpensive cards that initially fell under the cap would jump in price due to demand.

I could see a reasonable argument for providing all necessary cards to players on the pro tour (or official PR proxies, or whatever), since they've earned their spot there, and that level of competition shouldn't be impacted by card availability.  At anything under that? Nah.  Not worth the negative impact on the secondary market.","1435708998"

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","This one chick I hung out with in High School. Basically all my ""non-omega"" classmates banged her, I had the chance but didn't really feel like it. 

Anyways, she was a total attention whore, and really wasn't a human like you or I, she was pure emotion reacting to various pleasure or pain inputs. She lacked self-control, when she was hungry she would lick my food knowing I wouldn't eat it knowing where her mouth has been. 

Basically what she felt she did..... 

&gt; She’s young, independent, beautiful and has all the time in the world. When she’s horny, she swings into the closest drive thru and places her order. She does the same thing when she’s sad, lonely, happy, up, down, in, out, excited, needy, afraid, strong, weak, depressed, moody, joyful, exhilarated, stressed, etc. Any and every reason is valid because she’s being “true to herself”. Every three months on average she swings into McFling’s and orders up the best looking or most exciting thing on the menu (because she’s sooo selective). There’s also a couple of late night snack runs thrown in there for good measure, but not as many as some other girls, so you have no right to judge her. She’s young and her metabolism is firing on all cylinders, so now is the time for her to gorge herself with no consequences. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1r4o3s/a_must_read_drive_thru_boyfriend_by_solomon_ii/

Some notable differences between her and the character here.... she didn't fuck when she felt the entire range of her emotions, she sometimes fought, and sometimes cried. 

She also didn't possess the education to rationalize her actions, so she'd be depressed..... there was no ""exploring herself"" at least not when I knew her. 

I knew a couple high n-count dudes who were pretty much the same.... but pretty much all girls fit this description. 

A certain family member of mine was a man-whore, once having two girls he knocked up in a competition for his affection, one making his breakfast and the other his dinner. But it seems that he had a change of heart, being filled with a sort of concern for his offspring. No idea if it will last but that's the situation so far. ","1435709000"

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I think the idea behind trying to outrun the meta is extremely stupid. if you're going to try to make this a better place for newcomers, changing up the game to destroy the current meta is not the thing to do. 1st of all, you're introducing a player into a big battlefield with long lanes and short lanes and farming jungle camps, the first thing he's going to do is run into a lane, and start killing creeps, but that's only for the first few levels. after maybe level 10 you realize you really like this game, and you want to get better at it, you look up an online guide. this raises a problem in it's turn, because if you change the game with a META shifting patch, they need to learn all over again, or don't realize that what they're doing is wrong(even though it was right before). but players clamor to the feeling of fucking around in a game for shits and giggles right? wrong, they want to feel like they've discovered an entirely new game, that's really fun, so unless you're planning on changing the core mechanics of smite with every patch (and with that I mean stuff like the point of view, or just removing the towers) you're not going to trigger feelings of immense joy in veteran players. but you want to attract new players too, and you think new players don't like being told what to do, and while they don't, that only lasts for the first few weeks of play, after that, they either want have fun by winning, or they want to get good(or they've already stopped bothering with conquest). and how do you do this? by learning the meta. but how are you going to keep up if there's a new meta every month? you aren't. having to change the way you play every few weeks is only fun for two kinds of people: theorycrafters, and pros that enjoy theorycrafting. I've seen a lot of people on the edge of switching to another game, ever since this patch was released. and because I'm really not wanting to see this game go the way of the dodo, I'm begging you hi-rez, please, don't try to change the meta, just because people have found an effective patern, people will always try to do that.

"circlejerk","t5_2qpol","I literally credit my life to memes. I owe memes everything that I am, and everything that I will ever be. Memes saved my life when I was in high school. I grew up not playing any sports or having too many friends. I was 85 pounds overweight by the time I was 15. I was a hefty 285 pounds, standing only five feet four inches tall. As you can probably guess, I was targeted by bullies at my school. I experienced public humiliation time and time again at the hands of bullies, cyber and real. By the time I was 13, I was spending over 40 hours a week on the computer playing video games. I was also pleasuring myself up to 3 times per day, something that has prevented me from now having children in the future according to my doctor. I grew to age 15 and things really hit the fan. My parents had just gotten divorced because my mom caught my dad cheating on her with another guy. The one friend I had at school had left me for other people - he was a mute but he was amazing to have conversations with because he was a fantastic listener. I was spending $15 a week on ice cream at school. And on top of all that, I had just been kicked out of my end-game raid guild. What was I going to do? I pondered this over and over for weeks on end. One day, I came across this website, and my life slowly began to change. I started getting involved in multiple subreddits, racking up over 2,000 karma in mere months. I was getting my life back on track. One day, things really started to change when I found r/adviceanimals. I discovered the power of memes. I started making memes that were incredible. 5 karma here, 7 karma there, even 25 karma one time - the karma points were pouring in and I found myself refreshing my browser over and over to see how many of these little internet biscuits I had racked up. I realized that memes were what could save me. Memes did everything that I could not. I befriended several memes and started projecting them onto people in real life. I would walk up to a douchebag and picture him as scumbag steve and things would go great. I found my calling. That is why I am the man I am today.

However, I have since migrated into a more urban area and I find the police here hostile, arrogant, suspicious of EVERYONE, oblivious to any ""rights"" a potential detainee may have or invoke and are eager to use their toys. 

By what right would any individual like that legitimately command a modicum of respect? They are CIVIL SERVANTS... The people they fuck with daily and treat like criminals before even getting to the root of why the LEO/civilian interaction is occurring help pay their wages. Law enforcement is in dire need of an overhaul and I don't care who they are or who employs them, if they can't treat me with a basic level of civility/dignity? Well, guess what, my resources for 'civility' and cooperation just got limited as well, never mind proffering a 'tip' or reporting a crime; shit I'd be just as suspect as the perpetrator of said crime.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","In California to increase your rent by over 10% they must give you at least 60 days notice if you are on a month to month or less lease. They must present it in writing with a start date at a minimum of 60-89 days away from the days date but can not end during an inbetween period. For example, say your lease is for a 1st-31st time period. If your landlord serves you rent hike notice today they have to make it for either September 1st or October first, they can't make it for September  or august 27th. During this two month period you pay the going rate you have been paying. There's nothing you can do to stop them from raising the rent after that 2 month breathing period, but it does give you 60 extra days to find other housing. Be warned though, if you do decide to move out you must give 30 day notice with no in-between. Eg you have to give 30 days notice by august first for a September first move out or else they could claim your security deposit and/or go after you in smalls claims court for the increased September rent and will win.

For the amenities was access to a washer and dryer part of your original contract? If so when they aquaried the property they are responsible for maintaining essentials like that. When they bought out the old holding company they should of sent you a new contract with full explanation about who they were and what they were going to change about the unit/complex.

For staff it meant over 300 people on a weekly basis spending approximately 15 minutes each inputting data, printing it and givinf it to their supervisors. Who then spent about 45 minutes trying to interpret the data and put it into the access database.

I suggested a macro in access to pull the data from everyone but was shot down because they didn't want anyone to mess up the file...  so I did the next best thing.

Created a macro that grabbed all of the information from the employees and compiled it into a single sheet and formatting to make it easier to input.  Employees went to taking about 2 minutes to open a document and input the numbers and save it.  Supervisors went from almost 45 minutes to about 10 minutes.

The data was also much more accurate because I just added some basic formatting that forced them to put in the information we wanted.  Ie a date in this cell, time in this one, etc..  not fool proof but obvious enough that most people stopped fucking things up.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; People treat gender as though it's some sort of social construct when in fact it is very much a biological thing, something that, barring any abnormalities, is very much a concrete, visible and measurable thing. 

That's your sex, not your gender. We (scientists, not governments) observe sex based on chromosomes, genitalia, and hormone levels. Gender is observed entirely as a social construct, as an interpretation of sex.

&gt;If your mind does not respond to or recognize your inherent physical and sexual features, then the cause must be a mental illness.

They recognize and respond to these features; however transgendered folk are extremely unhappy (and potentially depressed) with their the physical sexual characteristics of their body and how that is seen by others (and themselves) in society.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Heterosexual sex acts are essentially open to procreation

That word ""essentially"" hides a lot of sophistry.  For this to be true, you have to explain why a long list of heterosexual sex acts somehow don't count, including:

* all sex acts other than PIV sex

* sex acts in which one or both parties are infertile or using contraception

* sex acts between heterosexual couples in which one parter is trans and the other is cis

* and indeed the majority of the remainder of instances of sex which do not result in a live birth

&gt; while homosexual sex acts clearly are not.

As long as we pretend that trans and intersex people do not exist, which would be silly in this context, given that ""traditional"" marriage laws tend to put many of them in particularly difficult situations.

&gt; Marriage, rather, is understood in this account as a legal institution enabling marital sex acts

But that *isn't* what the legal institution of marriage is, in any legal system I am aware of.  We do not insist that married couples have sex, we do not encourage them to have sex, we do not even insist that they need to be *capable* of having sex, and we don't try and prevent people from having extra-marital sex.  Marriage laws even tend to have specific features that benefit couples in circumstances where they could not possibly have sex, such as survivor benefits and exemptions from inheritance tax.  You want to punish same-sex couples for failing to adhere to a standard that is never applied to opposite-sex couples.  And I'm guessing from your name that you are yet another homophobic ukipper.

They might not be like ""OH MY GOD THAT'S AMAZING!"" but at least they'd say ""Oh you go there? That's cool!"" and it would give me an ""in.""

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You mention repeatedly that your girlfriend has had trouble standing up for herself in the past. You also mention that you have taken on the dominant, more experienced role in your sexual relationship. When you brought up having an ""open relationship"" during sex (wtf dude?) on multiple occasions, did it ever occur to you that she may have been simply going along with your suggestions because she didn't feel comfortable disagreeing with you? It sounds like you have an established pattern of sexual behavior together where you convince her to try something she may be uncomfortable with, and you reinforce your position as the ""wiser, more knowledgeable"" partner with an immediate ""I told ya so!"". Sexual exploration and experimentation is all well and good, but it only works when both partners know that their feelings are considered with understanding. Regardless of how ""sexually open"" a person is, I can assure you that most people don't want to hear about how their partner's biggest fantasy is fucking other people WHILE they are having sex with said partner. Your girlfriend may have consented to the conversation just because her feelings were hurt, or she felt insecure about telling you that she isn't interested in it.

You tell us that she wanted a different kind of open relationship than you. One where she didn't have to watch you fucking other people. You worded it as if she was just looking for an opportunity to fuck other people, but this was your idea. I'm going to be frank. Your girlfriend probably heard about your fantasy to fuck other people and thought, ""After everything I've done for this mother fucker. I've tried to make him sexually satisfied, have participated in all of his sexual fantasies, and have never once complained. Maybe I'll never make him happy. Well, if he wants to fuck other people, let's fuck other people."" Should she have initiated something with another man without discussing it with you? Of course not. She was wrong. But come on, man. Maybe I have this completely wrong, but your post screams that you feel you are emotionally/sexually/intellectually superior to your girlfriend. You speak about her as if she were a naive and vapid child you had to groom and condition into a woman capable of thinking and speaking for herself, but whoops! Your social experiment got a little away with itself and now you're regretting it.

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","The license and copyright ownership plays into effect.

I think in the SCO vs Novell rulings, it was made clear that SCO didn't have ownership claim to Unix, and Novell stated they have no interest in Suing people over Unix. So in effect, people have license to use Unix stuff.

Unix is basically safe because it has murky copyright. It was made by multiple people over a large timeline, and it's not clear who has ownership 100%. Without a clear view of ownership, it's impossible to enforce copyright.

Java doesn't have murky copyright, it's got clear ownership (oracle), and thus is a different legal landscape.

Google had choices of languages which are safe, C++ for example is a ANSI standard, or Google could have chosen a route to use a license for Java, by either staying on GPL as the OpenJDK does, or by taking a license for Java.

I might be in the minority, but I don't think people just have the right to take peoples IP's, but I encourage people to License their IP permissively whenever possible to encourage use.

If I made a new programming language and set of API's and set a bunch of really strict terms to it's usage that should be allowed, and I should be allowed to protect my IP, however I don't encourage that behaviour, just that I accept the legality of it. 

I don't think creators should be forced to give things away for free, just encouraged to choose licenses that are permissive enough to encourage adoption.","1435709018"

Well basically the ISP can decide that your service is less important and there by throttle your service accessibility. This gives way for many bad results (here three examples):

1. New businesses will stand practically no chance in the internet, since they can't afford to bribe *coughs* pay the appropriate fees to convince the ISP that their service is important (see the Netflix vs. Comcast standoff in the US). 

2. You will very likely be force to pay extra for a connection which handles everyone equally (as we have it right now).

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; The harassment expanded to include renewed threats against Anita Sarkeesian, who had been a target of previous online harassment in part due to her award-winning series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games which analyzed sexist stereotypes in video games; her attackers took her commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper, according to Cosmopolitan.[41][42][43]

No evidence of it being related to GamerGate as with all threats. Many of these are third party trolls, reported matter-of-factly like it's us with zero evidence, especially in the light of threats received by members of GamerGate.


&gt;  After a new episode in Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014 Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked;[44] she was compelled to flee home.[45] At the XOXO Festival in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that ""one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences"", and that ""the perpetrators do not see themselves as perpetrators at all.... They see themselves as noble warriors.""[46] In an interview on Comedy Central's program The Colbert Report, Sarkeesian said she believes women are being targeted because they are ""challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space"".[47]

True, but still no evidence other than the say-so of sites to link to GamerGate. If they know who did it, why have there been no arrests? Also notice how this entire paragraph is a love letter to Anita that is absolutely irrelevant to the article but shows the bias of the author.","1435709019"

Canadian wireless is a bit different from American. You guys have MVNOs like Ting etc. Our ""MVNOs"" if you can even call them that are just sub-brands under the big 3 Rogers, Bell and Telus. Albeit we have a few prepaid services from gas stations that pretty much no one uses. We also have smaller carriers that vary by region and WIND which is only available in big cities.

Rogers Bell Telus cater more toward corporate whereas their subbrands Koodo Telus Virgin cater more toward the average consumer.

All of them are GSM (Edit: oops, they're not GSM but they all run 3G HSPA &amp; LTE) carriers. The big 3 all use the same GSM frequencies &amp; sim cards so unlocking and using on another carrier is easy. WIND is the only other serious competitor of the big 3 that is kind of commonplace around Canada but has poor coverage and uses different frequencies from the Big 3 meaning you'd have to buy pentaband or buy from them. Luckily, phones bought on WIND work on the big 3, just not the other way round.


All in all, phone wise the big 3 might as well be the same company cause none of them will buy you dinner before they fuck you in the ass.

Edit: found it it was sol trujillio  ""After Trujillo left Telstra and Australia, he was quoted in an BBC interview describing Australia as racist, backward and like ""stepping back in time"". During his time in Australia, media commentators and cartoonists repeatedly made reference to Trujillo's Hispanic background including caricatures of him as a ""bandido"". The group of American executives who were recruited to work at Telstra were referred to, along with Trujillo, as the ""Three Amigos"". In the BBC interview, Trujillo cited Australia's ""very restrictive"" immigration policies and rigid rules on company privatisation as his evidence for the nation being backward and racist. When Trujillo's resignation from Telstra was announced, Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd gave an ""Adios"" response. Trujillo described Mr Rudd's use of the term as ""racism personified"".[28][29] Trujillo's views on racism in Australia were rejected by some businessmen and political leaders.[29]""

Like ask him to take a shower and if you can wash his booty! dont go in the crack, wait till like the 3rd shower to start working in there.. maybe let him have the first wash over himself, then let you back there, or have him guide you. 

after the 4th or 5th wash, he should be much more relaxed around you naked and washing his butt.. if not it may just take more time.

this is all up to him though, if he's willing to work through his ticklishness..

Eh, most people I know aren't pissed because Saddam died, dude was a bastard and won't be missed. They are pissed because the US started an unprovoked war of aggression against a country for reasons that are still unclear. The campaign of lies used to drum up popular support feels like ww2 propaganda, especially to us Germans (really? iraqi soldiers bayonetting babies?).  
And then look at the outcome. Iraq is a shithole and ISIS is rising from the ashes like the worlds shittiest phoenix. That didn't happen by itself. Sure there are other factors, but you can't tell me that the US invasion wasn't one of the main causes of ISIS.  
  
I agree that Germany needs to keep its NATO agreements. But surely you can see that people can become disillusioned when their ally starts randomly invading countries for strange reasons. Not only that, but then those countries turn into a huge snake pit.

"fullmoviesonyoutube","t5_2vlad","Grandma's Boy is the funniest Adam Sandler movie since The Waterboy, which is kind of funny because he's not even in it.  It's made by his production company though — Happy Madison — so you'll see plenty of familiar faces from Sandler's films, like: Todd (the guy who stranglers Sandler to death in a bathtub) from Little Nicky, one of the metalheads from Little Nicky, and Nick Swardson.  It's also got this skinny Napoleon Dynamite-esque style guy who plays a hilariously convincing douchebag villain, Kevin Nealon and a pre-Superbad fame Jonah Hill.   
  
The movie is focused on the world of video game developers and testers.  Todd from Little Nicky plays Alex, who is a 40 year old developer who smokes too much weed, but kicks ass at video games — both playing them, and making them.  He gets booted out of his house for not paying his rent because of his deadbeat roommate, and he goes to stay with Swardson for a while.  Unfortunately, Swardson lives with his parents, and that goes sour pretty quick, so Alex is forced to move in with the only other person who will take him in: his Grandma.  
  
Meanwhile at work, the big-shot game developer is some stereotypical Sandler film asshole in nerd form.  There's a consistently escalating beef between him and the rest of the team and it's up to Alex to save the day, and win the girl.  The girl in this film is some new blood bombshell who joins the company as the only girl around for what I can only imagine are demographic legal reasons.  
  
Alex and his friends spend the majority of their time getting stoned and playing video games, so if that's you're thing, you and this movie will get along great.  The movie unfortunately didn't do so hot in theatres, but it made a fuck ton of return in DVD sales, achieving cult status, and carving a good foothold for Hill, Swardson and the villain, who ended up snagging a role in Avatar later on.  
  
TL;DR - 8/10  
Although it's not the funniest movie, it's surprisingly amusing.  The actors get along well, and have a definite sense of camaraderie, which helps keep the 'by the numbers' storyline afloat.  There's a lot of entertainment here, and the movie does an okay job presenting the world of video game development to someone who has no clue about it.  It's the type of movie that Adam Sandler would make if he was still his 90's self today, but the guy who plays the lead really holds it together.  All of this, and there's still a good chunk of laughs and memorable/quotable lines.","1435709033"

A crap movie that pours squillions into advertising will do well on opening weekend, then drop like a stone as word-of-mouth gets around and reviews go up, whereas a great one that doesn't will probably do the opposite, and then go on to big DVD sales, etc once it's out of the theatres.

This metric will show the former as a huge hit and the latter as a flop, even though it's the opposite.

You cursed your phone camera as it refused to get a clear picture. The craft spun, headed inland, then thought better of it, zooming out towards the Pacific, disappearing into a cloud bank. You stood there in your yard and watched it go. 


You’re a smart man, so you respond proactively. If the aliens want something to do with us, you think to yourself, best to camp out somewhere away from it all. On the off chance they were only doing some recon, or on the off-off chance your eyes deceived you, well, there’s nothing like starting anew. You’re secretly glad you didn’t marry her– you’re not really a man to be tied down.


So you change your name. Put up the house for sale. Buy some supplies: a tent, a gun, a water purifier, some canned food. The U-haul guy says the van isn’t for sale, so you rent it out, assuming that if the aliens are coming, they’ll be here before the end of the month. You're loading the van when you slip on some loose gravel and suddenly you're falling.

You open every cupboard in a bad-tempered stupor and realize that you’re out of Cheerios again. You have some oatmeal instead, but you’re out of brown sugar, so honestly it’s pretty shitty as breakfasts go. It’s 7:44 and you’re going to be late for work. 


Dave is too cheerful, as always. “Did you get the information entered for that order, Dave?” you ask him, the way a teacher asks the slacker kid to answer a question. “Oh, something came up. I’ll get on that today.” “Sometime this year would be nice, Dave.” You’d like to stop being passive-aggressive to Dave and be active-aggressive, whatever that means. You wonder if the pay is worth it.


You are staring at a screen of numbers for what must be the thousandth time today. In your head, you know that the numbers represent shipments, the movement of goods up and down the Columbia and eventually around the world. The sense of excitement that came with that knowledge died a long time ago. 


You drive home from work in the rain, going a little too fast. In your head, you’re imagining ways for Dave to die a painful death. You wonder if it’s worth it to stop by the Safeway for some Cheerios. The road turns sharply, and you’re not prepared. As you realize what’s going on, the car skids, jolting you against your seatbelt.

While they may have turned their back on the Union, many only went to serve the confederate army because they could not turn their back on their state, and thus staying ""loyal"".

Besides, that's 600kbps. Not 600KB/s, which would be 6mbps. That's lower than the recommended bandwidth for **360p** video, according to this chart: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en

720p (30fps, not even 60fps) would not work at all, and 480p would be very iffy since it hits just below the limit for its *minimum* requirement. 

This is absolutely horrible. It makes it literally impossible to stream anything higher than 480p in a world where phone screens are moving to 1440p for high end models. Also, what about tablets with large screens? 360p and 480p would look absolutely horrible on those.

If you can accommodate something bigger, I'd go even larger, honestly. Since I usually make queen or king sized quilts, I'd be thrilled if I had something that could cover an entire table.

I'd also evaluate your scrap habits. We quilters make a lot of scraps. Are you the type to use your scraps? If so, do you sort by color or size, etc...? Depending on your scrap hoarding habits (that is one of my 'problems', lol), you might wish to develop storage that works with those habits. I personally cut my scraps into ready to use squares and strips (2"", 3.5"" and 5"" squares and strips out of whatever is left), and then sort by color. Each color has a labeled plastic shoe box. 

I also vote for a high cutting table. I've then used command strips and hooks to hand all of my rulers on the wall above my cutting area.

I also love having a design wall. If you watch for coupons/sales, you can pick up the Fons &amp; Porter gridded design for fairly cheap. Otherwise, you can buy sheets of insulation at a home improvement store and spray glue batting to them, and then use command strips to hang the panels you've just made.

I disagree.  When what you are trying to determine is individual wages you should count a working adult living at his parents and his parents as 2 separate units.  The fact that he is a dependant should have no bearing on what his income.  In fact the reason **why** they are a single household is because the young worker can't afford his own place.  Why should we statistically clump 3 or 4 working adults as a ""household""  when economics is what's forcing them together?  

Salim Furth,  at the conservative Heritage Foundation, is the biased one.  He would rather count households because it makes Americans look richer than they really are in order to quell the grumblings among the proletariat.

I doubt your ability to get a mortgage, even if your income is sufficient, because you are trying to get a secured credit card.

Hinkie is the Billy Beane of basketball. He has so much cap room so that when the 76ers stop tanking, they can sign so many other solid players. 

Buford is a drafting great. Obviously he takes advice from Popovich, but in the end it's his choice. He got Kawhi with a mid-first round pick, George Hill with a late first round pick and Tiago Splitter with another late first as well. 

Griffin got great value out of his Knicks and Nuggets trades and didn't have to trade away much value.

I bolded the important parts.

&gt;NON-BIRD EXCEPTION -- This is also a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception. Its name is somewhat of a misnomer, since Non-Bird really is a form of Bird rights. Players who qualify for this exception are called ""Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agents"" in the CBA. They are veteran free agents who are neither Qualifying Veteran Free Agents nor Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agents, and include the following:
**Players who finished the season with a given team, who have played no more than one season without clearing waivers or changing teams as a free agent.**
Players who were Early Bird free agents, but whose team renounced its right to use the Early Bird exception to re-sign the player.
Players who were to be Larry Bird or Early Bird free agents, were playing on one-year contracts, and were traded mid-season.
This exception allows a team to re-sign its own free agent to a salary starting at up to 120% of his salary in the previous season2 (not over the maximum salary, of course), 120% of the minimum salary, or the amount needed to tender a qualifying offer (if the player is a restricted free agent -- see question number 44), whichever is greater. Raises are limited to 4.5% of the salary in the first year of the contract, and contracts are limited to four seasons when this exception is used.
**A partial season counts as a full season for the tenure calculation related to Bird rights. If a team signs another team's free agent to a Rest-of-Season contract mid-way through the season, then at the end of that season the player is a non-Bird free agent.**

We didn't find a solid solution (also I got tired of feeling sales pressure), but they had me try on some curved bands, some double-band styles (where your engagement ring sits between the two bands), and also pitched the idea of getting the same band as my engagement ring (so they'd nest), pulling off the stone bracket, and inserting each of our birthstones instead.

I've also privately considered saying ""eff it"" and just wearing my wedding band on a different finger. Our wedding's in April, so there's some time to ponder. Upvote for solidarity though!","1435709044"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Actually, you're wrong there on a few levels. Firstly, a straight Catholic marriage only has to be open to life, not expectant of it. A couple with diagnosed infertility is still capable of living out their vows in a manner consistent with church teaching. 

You're right that homosexuality is not a sin, just as most other physical desires are not a sin in and of themselves. But lets be absolutely clear - homosexual acts are certainly a sin. And to celebrate a homosexual union as 'marriage' is to celebrate that sin. 

It's not a matter of which is more wrong. Sodomy is sodomy. Sodomy is sin. With a homosexual union, there is no possibility for anything other than a celibate relationship to be within the bounds of the church. That is very clear. It's also in line with church teaching that other physical expressions of romantic feelings short of a sexual act are similarly disordered as they are essentially going down a dead end street leading only to temptation and sin.","1435709045"

"gambling","t5_2qhuo","For someone who is capable of detecting the bias, it does not matter what numbers are in the favored slots.  I'm not arguing that case.  But most people aren't going to be able to detect a slight bias (say 51% for one half of the wheel), and even someone who is trying to sniff out an advantage would have to see a whole lot of spins to feel reasonably assured that one segment of the wheel favors the player.  Yes, a wheel that favors one segment can be taken advantage of no matter where you put the numbers.  But it's more likely to be taken advantage of if the numbers are distributed unevenly, because even players that don't recognize the imbalance could benefit from it by simply betting red or odd or high or whatever is most prevalent in the favored segment.  Having P(red) &gt; 50% is much worse for the house than having P(random combination of 18 numbers) &gt; 50%, because red is a very common bet.

My argument is essentially this:

1.  The house can't be certain that a wheel/operator is perfectly balanced no matter how much testing in done.  That doesn't necessarily mean that there is a group of numbers that favor the player, but the house can never be sure that such a group doesn't exist.
2. If a segment does favor the player and the numbers are not distributed evenly, it is possible that some popular bets will favor the player.  For example, P(red) = 51%.  **If this occurs, the house loses every time someone plays red, which happens frequently.**  With a standard American wheel, the absolute worst case for the house is a segment where one color has one more slot than the other, or a segment where either even/odd or high/low has two more slots than its counterpart.
3.  Combining points 1 and 2, it is more likely that a wheel with numbers distributed unevenly will have a common bet that favors the player.

You've made some valid points and I don't disagree with anything you've said, but you also haven't said anything that refutes any of these points.","1435709046"

Dean had also slept with famous singer/actress Vera Keyes, on whom he had a little bit of blackmail. After, he coerced her to enter into an affair with Sinclair. Sinclair, mad with love with her, builds the Sierra Madre casino and hotel -- but, with apprehension about the coming war, he also made it a fortress and kept his fortune inside! As fortune would have it, as the casino opened, the Great War happened and the bombs went off. The casino sealed itself and left Vera and the other inhabitants inside, where they were unable to get out. They died, sadly, and fast forward a couple hundred years.

Father Elijah managed to get in the Vault by manipulating Dog/God and othher forms of tech. Each character sort of has their hangup - God/Dog can't reconcile himself, Dean Domino is super greedy, Christine wants to kill Elijah for what he did to her and Veronica.

Additionally, people are also specifically told to not use condoms. Overpopulation and poverty are problems in many areas, and people are being told that using condoms is worse than both children suffering in poverty and risking spreading or contracting AIDS and other diseases. There are reasons for people, married or not, to use condoms.

They should be more concerned with people not contracting AIDS than with people having pre-marital sex. Innocent children are being born with AIDS that will not be treated and born into poverty that ultimately kills them because of the Church's message.","1435709051"

My point to all this involving race is baseball has become a rich kids sports, that minorities don't have the money to keep up to get exposure like the ""white"" kids. The minorities that do play are very well to do and afford to spend the thousands of dollars it cost to do so.

From those songs I'd say Rush would be a worthwhile goal. Limelight is pretty good, fun to play and sing but pretty simple. Red Barchetta has memorable licks throughout, and the story is fun. 

Also Iron Maiden will build up endurance in your hands, even if they aren't terribly difficult. Try The Trooper or 2 Minutes to Midnight. They might move a little quickly if you use pro tabs, do read through them at a slower rate to get use to where the changes are. Again, they aren't overly difficult because it's usually a stream of the same notes, but can be hard to sightread off of pro tabs.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Oh shit.""

It was not a lie. The WHO had confirmed the disease, as had the UN and every major news organisation out there. Surprisingly enough, the nation's leaders had remained silent, choosing to hunker it out in fear within their nuclear bunkers. Rioting had begun in the streets, an ironic move since the rioters would after 24 hours have no idea what they were fighting for.

The CNN report I was watching was clear and straightforward. On July 1st, 12:04 PM (UTC), all of our current memories would be lost. Forever. I didn't care about the actual science behind it, but knew that basic knowledge and ideas would remain indisrupted. Therefore, we would become amnesiacs, knowing the outer shell of life but failing to remember the details. It would be possible to walk and talk, but without knowing what our names were or where we lived.

Humanity would go into shambles. My life would be destroyed - unless I took some kind of action. Looking on Facebook, I saw messages from friends inviting me to parties, asking me to go out for a bite, wanting a last Skype call before we forgot each other entirely. It was sad, but I turned each and every one of those request down.

What's the point of having fun now if you'll just forget it all 24 hours later?

I sat down at my desk, thinking. My parents had urged me to write a diary many years ago, but I was, like most teens, too lazy for that. Now, I regretted my choice. I was camera-shy, not having much pictures to share. I never bought a school yearbook.

My memories were only documented in one place - my mind. Somehow, I had to get all that out of there and onto paper before it was too late. I wrote down my computer and account passwords first, then the locations of all my important documents. Then, I flipped to a blank page on my notebook.

Time to write down everything I remembered. My friends, my family, the past, the present. What things I liked to do, the places I went on vacation, the stories of my family passed down from generation to generation. Trying to fit it all down on paper.

Hopefully, when the amnesia fell, I would read it - and form the new neural connections that would help me remember the past.","1435709058"

But what sets it apart for me is that the core of the this huge epic is not the political machinations or some grand truth about mankind. What the story is really about is a very intimate and personal conflict between two men with pure and simple human motivations - love of family and a desire to please a parent.

Oh, my bad then. I know you were talking about the narrative, but with how it was worded it sounded like that her getting over her anxieties were 100% unnecessary for her character overall.

&gt;Her ""piss-poor attitude"" stems from her anxieties. It is not a separate problem, social anxiety affects perception broadly like that.

I suppose that's true, but I've seen people with anxieties who're still nice people, and likewise I've seen mean-spirited people who don't even have any anxieties at all. I guess that is kind of off topic though so I apologize for that.

I wouldn't want her to overcome her short comings right away, 'cause that would defeat the purpose. But she's still flawed, but I don't think that's a bad thing. A character can be a bad person but still be interesting and relate-able. (and even then I don't think she's 100% a bad person or anything!)","1435709061"

But for me, I always struggle with this because I don't want to jump the gun and say she is concussed or not. Just because it was head-to-head doesn't mean she suffered a concussion. Also, assessing from watching the game on TV is so vastly inaccurate. None of us are on the pitch, conversing with her, and most of us have no form of athletic training or doctoral training to accurately assess anyway.

Concussions are serious, and I would love to see protocol improve. But I can't definitively say that anyone made the wrong decision out there.","1435709061"

Focus on power strength, duration &amp; efficiency with her, as range does pretty much nothing. Use peacemaker to kill everything (use with moderation to not bore your teammates). Shatter shield gives you a 95% damage reflection, keeping you alive in endgame missions easily, even without shields! (It also reflects bombard rockets completely!). Shooting Gallery buffs her weapon considerably, and stuns nearby enemies for quite a long time. Use this to run past a group of enemies unscathed (stunning them), and stunning Grineer Manics for a very long time!

Lastly, Ballistic Battery is a very much underrated ability, as its useless in most of the content. But in endgame, a fully-charged Ballistic Battery (or BB) with a crit gun (like the Soma) and a headshot, can instantly kill even the toughest of Gunner Eximi! I have yet to test more, but apparently it ignores their defense completely?

Mesa is amazing!

Thats whats so cool about the way there making the game. If they would stop changing all of the servers and starting making actually unique ruleset servers then i think it would work. Just make a ruleset for care bear style players and rulesets for normal and one for hardcore.

2. Oh, that's a hard one. I'd have to say Borderlands 2. I absolutely love that game.
3. IRL friends? Never, I tried to get them into it when it came out but the cert grind was too much for them (it's infinitely easier to earn certs now) and I haven't convinced them to come back. However, I consider many of the people I play with in my outfit to be my friends (Ghosts of the Revolution on Emerald).
4. Uh, I think most things are fine actually. I felt Ravens were OP but I think the Archer is the perfect counter for it and will help (and is helping) greatly. I always prefer more counterplay options to straight nerfing something. I cannot wait for intercontinental lattice and more strategic depth for resources and cutting off territory. I also think player-generated mission would be awesome (though these ideas are a ways in the future).
5. You do you. Everyone enjoys the game different, do what you like. Some will say engineer or medic at the start to gain certs faster, and while, yes, you will earn certs quicker it's more important to have fun. So do what you enjoy. Also, this is entirely a PvP game. All your interactions are with people, both the good and bad ones. Find people with whom you enjoy playing, you will create far more positive interactions by intentionally playing the game with people you like. Also, try playing with people who enjoy the game (avoid those who are frequently talking negatively about it). You will be positively (or negatively) affected depending on the type of people with whom you play.

Service record as well as account overalls are all shown pre-boosts/campaigns/x2/premium.

There are tanks, such as the kv2 and isu I only run every day for x2 because they're fun. Their avg exp is not higher than the aforementioned despite this.

e: furthermore, a player without premium, would have a significantly lower personal rating and significantly lower avg_exp in his SR/stats tab even if he played better than his prem counterpart.

Also should be noted, I took my top tanks at the specified tiers. An avg would be lower considering I do not do as well in all t8s as I did in the caernavon for instance. ISU152 my most played tank overall sits at just 802b/1203p exp.

The caern case, I have 941 base exp over 84 games since that's how long it took to get the conqueror. Should this have been counting premium, the total would just be 79.044 exp, leaving 90.800 to x2 and other events.

If it's without premium as I claim, then it's 1411/game@84  = 118.524 which leaves ~41k for x2 and other events.

The tracks, top gun and conqueror = 169.800.

Fortunately I have a 5'4"" friend who is attractive and outgoing and has gone to a few parties with me, so I have some extra perspectives from that.

Let's face the facts, like it sounds like you probably have. Girls like guys who are taller than them. I think we'd all like to be at least 6 feet tall, even the 5'11"" guys. And in clubs, girls are wearing heels so even that 5'2"" girl feels taller than you - not ideal.

So, how do you overcome this? Well, that's the million dollar question, eh? ;) The obvious answer is to improve other aspects of yourself to make up for it, like how a blind animal may develop a better sense of hearing to compensate. This can make up for a few inches, in many cases. Given the choice between the 5'4"" guy with a rippling six-pack, 16"" arms, and a killer appearance (think haircut, facial hair, clothing choice, etc.) and the 5'9"" guy with a dad bod and average appearance, a girl will likely go for the shorter guy. Now, not always, because some girls really do refuse to date anyone shorter than them, but in general the height disadvantage can be made up for. You have to be better than the other guys, basically.

And just remember that you are the prize, no matter your height. You need that base of confidence to maintain an irresistible presence.","1435709074"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; It's amazing that reddit will get out its torches and pitchforks at the very mention of someone's depression/social anxiety being dismissed, but then collectively turns around and makes fun of people who've suffered trauma all the god damn time.

It's because they agree *in theory* that a lot of people have real problems and those problems shouldn't be dismissed, but fuck it all for a carnival sideshow if you point out that they themselves are part of those problems.

It's the same kneejerk reaction when I tell people I buy fair trade stuff. Like, they aren't huge ideological supporters of child slave labor, but if I demonstrate that by spending five cents more per cup of coffee, I can support a sustainable, consensual economy, then they need to put down the entire idea with an instant backlash of total derision. ""Oh, you can't save the world with coffee, dumbass."" ""What's that gonna do?"" 

It's the attitude of people who talk in movie theaters, but on a macro-scale - they're trying to pretend their behavior isn't obnoxious by pretending the problems they cause aren't real. One size fits all for courtesy, as long as that size is *mine.*

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","They're mg-IIIa's. These have the ribbon tweeters which is why I got them. Purchased at a very good price from a music lover who drove them gently with conrad johnson and pass lab amps. 

Right now I have a passive preamp and a mcintosh mc250 as my power amp for the speakers. The SAE amp on the floor is for the subwoofer. The sub is a shahinian double eagle, wired for stereo output.

I would just like to mention how incredibly impressed I am by this mcintosh amp from 1968. This thing is rated at only 50 watts a channel, 25 watts below what is rated as minimum wpc for the magnepans. This is far below what most maggie owners agree is minimum for these speakers (100-150+). 

I CANNOT GET THIS AMP TO CLIP AT ANY VOLUME, and at halfway volume they're almost too loud to listen to. I don't even go past the halfway point and it's still loud as fuck. Turned almost all the way up, a bout 3/4th volume, there is absolutely no clipping or distortion. This is only 50 watts were talking about. My room is fairly large too (15X30). 

The mcintosh mc250 must be severely under rated. There is no way in hell it is 50 watts a channel. I would guess somewhere between 100-150 at least. Either way, my plans of buying or trading for a higher wattage amp are on hold for now, unless the mcintosh shows some trouble driving these anytime soon.","1435709076"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I know GRRM is supposed to be some kind of ""expert,"" but I think he's just wrong about this!

Why waste state-of-the-art, functional Valyrian steel on a ceremonial blade?

A ceremonial sword would be made out of something beautiful but not all that functional. Ordinary steel alloy, polished to a high shine, and ornamented with gold and jewels that wouldn't last 5 seconds in battle.

Jorah Mormont and later Jon Snow take their heirloom swords into battle. Jaime Lannister gives his sword to Brienne of Tarth, expecting her to use it. 

Go on YouTube and you'll find plenty of experts demonstrating how a greatsword would have been used as a versatile and functional weapon by men of less than Mountainesque proportions.

In short, I urge GRRM to reconsider.

EDIT: I can understand leaving the family heirloom behind if he goes charging up to the front, expecting he might lose a sword or two. But he's the bloody king! He's got people to do that sort of reckless work for him. If the battle has gotten so dire that the king himself is fighting for his life, the loss of a family heirloom is pretty close to inevitable anyway.","1435709077"

For example, when we say that Warren Buffet is paying a smaller percentage of his income than his assistant, we are commenting on individual burdens, which generally implies that there is a loophole to be closed. Closing loopholes seems like a good idea, raising taxes on individuals to something absurd isn't.  
  
EDIT: Also just found [this.](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/49440-Distribution-of-Income-and-Taxes.pdf) The CBO numbers look like They should when dividing the population into evenly sized groups of people based on income levels.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Wow. You could really use line breaks.

&gt; The use of quotation marks around rehabilitation was not meant to imply that terrible people can't be fixed, so I admit that confuses the intent. The quote marks were meant to be representative of what a person with progressive views on justice would say to defend the hypothetical I brought up. I should have put the whole phrase in quotes ""because they are rehabilitated"". 

As I say elsewhere, I am not a fool, and the number one priority must be protecting the innocent. That said, real, *genuine* rehabilitation, rehabilitation that actually *works*, should be a second priority.

&gt; In the modern view of criminal justice rehabilitation has been emphasized, and I consider this to be a major beneficial development that should be continued. I just don't think it's the end all and be all of judicial action in the case of severe crimes.

Frankly, I think that our ideal should make it the end to *all* crimes. If we can take a criminal of *any* severity and change that person into someone who is going to contribute to society rather than detract from it, I think that we most certainly should.

&gt; Obviously, in the case of someone who shoplifts, if the person is rehabilitated, the harm to society is negligible.

It's a harm nonetheless, and it is all in the past, which we have no power to change, even if we absolutely want to. As such, it is best to focus on the present and the future.

&gt; That said, I think acting like the emotions of those wronged, the anguish caused in their life by a deliberate act, shouldn't be considered, is ridiculous.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be considered. Where possible, recompense should be made, and these people deserve counseling, financial aid - anything to help rehabilitate *them* as well. Because someone who has suffered such a terrible crime *does* need to be rehabilitated to find some semblance of normal, albeit a different sort of rehabilitation than a criminal needs. I'm talking help dealing with emotional trauma, help adjusting to the change in their life, help finding a ""new normal"". Right now, we do very little to ensure this, and giving victims the brief satisfaction of punishing the criminal who wronged them is a poor, poor substitute.

&gt; If someone raped and murdered your family, and was legitimately rehabilitated should there be no other punitive measures?

If they legitimately rehabilitated, then the person they are is not the person they were then. Punishing them would serve no purpose other than to ""make me feel good"", which is a poor reason to kill someone who is otherwise now a productive member of society.

&gt; Should they be allowed to carry on their lives as if nothing happened?

If someone truly rehabilitated, they will feel the shame and remorse for what they did for the rest of their lives. No one can ever move on ""as if nothing happened"". Not the victim, nor the (rehabilitated) perpetrator of the crime.

I should note, this is not to say that ""bad feelings"" are a punishment for the crime. They are not. They are a natural result. However, to say ""as if nothing happened"" is to evoke the imagery of someone committing a terrible crime, and then skipping off to go happily about their day. That is not true rehabilitation.

&gt; Is that fair to the victims?

Nothing will ever be fair to the victim, and killing someone won't make it *more* fair.

&gt; Does that not undermine their value in society?

No. I would argue that it values them more - to repay death with death is to celebrate the role of death in this person's life. It is to say that the bloodlust created by that death is so insatiable that it can only be satisfied with another death. That doesn't honor those killed, It doesn't honor those who survive. It only dirties them further.

&gt; I just think these questions get dismissed too often, with too little justification, by people with a progressive view of the criminal justice system.

I would say that I have taken *more* consideration for the victims here than pretty much every death penalty supporter I have ever spoken to. Death penalty supporters act as if retribution against the one who wronged them is therapeutic, as if that somehow helps the victim. Studies have shown this assumption to be [faulty](http://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/01/27/study-executions-do-not-bring-closure-to-victims-families/), and I would argue that it is used as a substitute for genuine care and concern for the victims. It's quick and easy to kill someone and say ""problem solved"". Much more time consuming and difficult to actually help someone find some semblance of a former life again.

How about instead of talking about how great the death penalty is for victims, we actually take the time to ask ourselves what would *actually* help them?

&gt; I've already said I oppose the death penalty for practical reasons (don't trust the government to get it right, adequate oversight/review is prohibitively expensive, questionable methods of execution, ect.). What I'm saying is I'm not sure that death as a punitive measure is completely unjustifiable in all cases from a moral standpoint.

And I would argue that when we kill a productive member of society, we collectively do as a society what we condemn the criminal for doing.

&gt; Is rehabilitation enough in the case of heinous crimes?

No. We must also better care for the victims, and where possible, the person who committed the crime should repay the victim for their act (which I would assume a truly rehabilitated criminal would willingly do anyway). And above all else, we must protect further innocents from being harmed (so those who we can't be sure of being truly rehabilitated should remain incarcerated).

&gt; I understand wanting to stop short of death, but should there really be no punitive aspect?

I don't see punishment benefitting anyone. Recompense is different, and should definitely be encouraged. Additionally, for crimes of a financial nature, some penalty makes sense to prevent criminals from ""gaming the system"" (i.e. A bank robber should have to do more than just give back the money he stole). Punishment, where it is used, should have a practical, *measurable* effect as a deterrent. But punishment for punishment's sake does nothing good for anyone.","1435709081"

Yes, plus all of their braking rates were off. Their brake assembly was not what the car was speced for, and they had all sorts of issues with torsional load on the suspension as well, because of the increased brake force. Plus they didn't have enough cooling for the brakes, etc. etc. The list goes on and on. The car that was running at LeMans was a ""what can we do to get this thing moving enough to make it to the race"". They set a goal of being faster than the P2's. And they almost made it. Of course they didn't have the raw pace no thanks to mechanicals, mostly due to components that were untested, like the brakes.

At least the cat proved it was fast enough in a straight line, and their aero and drag numbers were correct, and that the engine is a solid unit, and reliable, even under the extra load of doing all the acceleration work.","1435709082"

That would be a totally reasonable reason for the officer to investigate, but not to stop and detain a person. 

Imagine a concerned citizenry calls the police to tell them that they are scared that you're burglarizing houses. Nobody saw you break into any house, you're just carrying a stereo somewhere. A cop would have reason to arrive on the scene and try and determine whether or not you're burgling houses. Absent reasonable suspicion all he can do is ask you a couple questions. You don't want him to have the power to detain and arrest you based solely on the concern of some citizens.

The 5d doesn't have this feature and because it's a full frame sensor, the shots are often much further away than in a crop sensor, which makes it ideal for full face or product shots that can then be cropped.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I would suggest that pre-Christian Greek and Roman law, forms of government, social and economic organization have been *far* more influential on the growth of ""Western civilization."" Our ideas on democracy, the republic, military organization, what it means to be a citizen, what it means to live in a polity or city, civil engineering, city building, public services, recourse to the law rather than priests...all of these core concepts originate outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition. 

And as for the 10 commandments? Don't mistake modern rural-American rhetoric for ""Western Civilization."" You might be surprised how few courts in the US or elsewhere would ever consider or cite the 10 commandments (which are Jewish, btw, rather than Christian in origin) in a legal decision. In fact, the US Supreme Court in 1980 declared unconstitutional the posting of the 10 Commandments in public spaces, consiering they found [""no secular legislative purpose""](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/449/39) for posting them. In other words, the 10 Commandments are only relevant to US law as sacred texts from the Judeo-Christian religious traditions that have no bearing on law.","1435709089"

"MBTIPlus","t5_38aq6","Te is my tertiary. I use it a lot actually. I think it complements me Ne a lot. I think I use it sometimes to follow up on the things that I think of/create/do with Ne. I sometimes have issues sustaining the organization systems that I come up with unless I can automate them or make them second nature. Like, I do a really good job with saving money because I have my student loans, my 401K, my Roth IRA set on autopay. But I forget bills I don't have set on autopay unless I have the bill visible all the time, and even then I don't pay attention to the due date. My energy bill is the only one I can't have set to autopay right now. My job entails a lot of systematic approaches and organized documentation of the steps I'm taking, and I'm good at it because I practice it. I have a lot of trouble instituting systems for things I don't like/don't care about/don't *have* to do. Also, Te is used for following other people's thought processes and finding what's missing which is, in a nutshell, my job description. 

I also feel like I use Si a lot with people but unfortunately it's focused on negative experiences. I don't trust people easily, especially if I catch people contradicting themselves. If I think someone is important for whatever reason, I remember most of the things they say and do and I'm constantly reassessing the things they've said to past things they've said, but instead of thinking ""Hey, this person has changed in some way"" I think ""This person is lying"". I'm not super well-versed in each of the functions - I know Si compares current experiences to past ones, but I don't know if it's supposed to work in a sort of ongoing evaluation like that. I feel like this conflicts with my Fi in a way, if this is what's at work here. I remember what I consider ""bad"" things people do rather than ""good"" things. I stockpile reasons not to trust people.","1435709091"

Next time you have a ""bit of a miff"", maybe you should check and see if the person advising you is as ""clueless"" as you seemed to instantly assume. Not only did you come here and put the community at risk, you topped it off by insulting the moderators who volunteer their time to keep people safe. Instead of taking a moment to check and see if what I told you had some merit to it, you instead choose to go on the offensive, telling us about how respected NorseCorp is and how their publisher would never allow you to post phishing links to their blog. Well, it looks like their publisher allowed exactly that to happen, and that the only one who is ""clueless"" here is you and NorseCorp. 

In reality, what I should have done is banned your account from the moment I noticed those links were posted and blacklisted the NorseCorp domain from ever being allowed to submit a link to this subreddit again, as you have demonstrated that neither of you have this community's interests at heart. I also bet if the publisher at NorseCorp saw the exchange you had with me, they would not be thrilled to see what you are doing to their reputation, which according to you, is highly respected. I didn't do either of those things, because I assumed what happened was an honest mistake.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","The Democrats were the party of the Confederacy. The Confederacy was what fought to maintain slavery. But now the Republicans are the party of the Confederacy, ever since Nixon's 'Southern Strategy'.  That was when Nixon realized that the Civil Rights Act could be leveraged to win the South for the Republicans, for the first time ever. In 1964 when the southern Courthouses started flying the Confederate flag was the beginning of the end of Democratic party being big in the South.

That's how the first black President is a Democrat, and not a Republican. Blacks used to vote Republican in record numbers: this is no longer true. This hasn't been true since the Civil Rights Act.  

The Confederacy went to war for slavery, but it is the Republicans now who attacked  black people more recently. Google 'Dog Whistle Politics' for an explanation about this, ""welfare queens"" and other such derogatory images.  ""Tough on Crime"", ""Stand your Ground"", other such terms have an implied racism.

Edit: I forgot the Republican party pro-oligarchy tactics: My personal pet peeve is forbidding competition in internet provider service, but private prisons, drug testing for welfare recipients, strip searches for homeland security, mandatory sentencing laws, the War on Drugs, the confiscation of cash from motorists by police, the militarization of police, the privatization of public services while increasing costs to cover the profits, the disregard of homeowner rights to allow large polluters to pollute your land... these are all such horrible things.

As i said his 1st need a change.Hell with it:His entire kit needs a change except 2nd spell.

3rd spell cant be called a catching tool because it just stops them for small amout of time which is not enought for ravana to either get close or kill enemy in it(Because most of the gods have escape)

His ult is just not maked for solo lane.While i get what his ult is mean for and i am using it.Problem is this:Dont have root(Evene if i have root next step is same)=Enemy is gone=I am stuck in enemy team=dead.You cant deny the facts.Nope you cant build him tanky because you will destroy the build right in that second you do that.This skill is buffed ne zha 3 and there could be many other potencial ultys which would work better with the kit.

As a bonus ravana thanks to that lack escape which means once you are catched=Dead because you wont be able to do anything.

I feel like I just want to do football because it seems fun and would be a great way to get physically active and all. But then I think that all of these people on the team are so much more athletic than me and bust their ass off to ball out and do their best, and that I have no right to be there just cause it'd be a fun thing to do.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I had a severe gallstone attack that led to me walking into the emergency room waiting area, yelling for help, then collapsed and promptly vomiting everywhere. They gave me dilaudid for the pain and it helped by getting me high, but I could still feel the pressure and twisting in my abdomen, so I was high and uncomfortable as hell. Worst part of the experience was that it was Friday and the GI team needed to be sure it wasn't an ulcer. Once the pain went from 10 down to 6 or so I wanted to eat, having last eaten Thursday night. They wouldn't let me eat or drink all weekend until they could do the endoscopy on me Monday morning. I was in pain, in spite of the morphine, hungry to the point of delusions and near psychosis and just fucking frustrated for 50 hours. Worst weekend of my life. Oh, and it was following my divorce so no one came to see me or help console me. Just terrible fucking rows with the nurses over how the morphine wasn't working and I was hungry as hell. I actually ripped out my IV and tried to walk out of the hospital. They stopped me. Then I couldn't get the surgery because I didn't have anyone to drive me home or care for me for the 48 hour recovery. So, I am a ticking time bomb waiting to go through this again.","1435709098"

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Latency is commonly a problem when 'double tracking' and when recording audio that you need to hear 'wet'.  Latency usually happens when dealing with recording audio, not recording MIDI (which is what you do with a MIDI controller).

Double Tracking is the act of recording some audio then playing it back while recording it 'again' into a new track in the software.  This lets you have two versions of your recording to layer on top of each other.  It sounds nice and adds some 'fatness' and 'warmth' to the recording.  The latency is because there is a fraction of a second between the speakers outputting the track and when you are recording the second track.

'working with wet audio' is typically when you are using reverb heavily and want the person recording to have some timing 'off the reverb'.  For example if you have a vocalist singing and she wants to hear her voice + the reverb back in her headphones.  There is a slight delay as the computer takes in the audio, adds the reverb effect, then outputs it back to headphones.","1435709099"

And then everyone will jump on the asses of whoever made the call to not send SWAT in. SWAT should simply be a more trained and better equipped strategic unit, so whether it's cops or SWAT shouldn't change the outcome (""shouldn't"" as in ""if everything went well"").

The problem isn't sending the SWAT team for when they're not needed, but rather cops in general being too trigger happy.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","One thing that I was hit with by God a few months ago. 

First the verses:

Matt. 5:21-22: ""You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire."" 

and

Matt. 5:28: ""But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" 

+

Matthew 24:37/Luke 17:26: ""For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.""/""And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man""

+

Genesis 6:5: ""The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."" 

=

So, committing a sin in the heart carries as much weight as doing it; because it is the condition of the heart that matters; which is related to the concept of salvation by faith and not works or the Law. Now in the days of Noah, that the end times will be like, man's heart is on evil continually."" So it wasn't just that people committed acts of evil, it was that they constantly thought about it.

Well evil being sin, and Jesus defining what real evil was, and that it was internal rather than external. What does that mean for the end times and Noah? Are people's hearts really on anger, murder, lust, insulting others, etc. constantly? I mean other than what's going on in the wars, everyone else is pretty peaceful right? Not really. There is a $93 Billion dollar industry built largely on helping people do those things in their hearts. that industry is 'war gaming'.

I'm not saying all games are bad, but the vast majority are dedicated to the enjoyment of violence. I was convicted of that. YMMV.

It's not really that difficult to imagine. I'm gay. I still wouldn't call the person who condemned me a bigot.

&gt;Now as for (1), my guess is that the pool of people who oppose same sex marriage will gradually shrink, even among Christians, until it shrivels to practically nothing. Those who continue to harbor a passionate commitment to the anti-gay cause will retreat into ever smaller communities. 

It's not an anti-gay cause.

&gt;And perhaps, as new generations of Bishops and Cardinals come into power, even the Church will change to adopt to the societal norms. It is not unheard of for a religious doctrine that once seemed central to be dropped entirely.

Something like this has never happened in the Catholic Church. The location of the earth in the universe is not comparable, as that's merely a factual question, not one of faith and morals.","1435709101"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Hey all. I'm brand new here. I've poked around before but have never really posted. I'm at a point in my life where I need serious support. I actually made a post before posting here and this is probably a better place to give my story. I'm too healthy for gastric bypass. 

I'm 30yrs old, 5'3"", 315lbs and very healthy outside of the weight. The only problems I have are Fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. My insurance policy changed at the beginning of the year and unless you suffer from severe health complications due to weight, they will not cover it. My dr said we can appeal the denial with a six month monitored diet but all that will really do is just look good on the appeal process and not really help them change their minds. It's was heartbreaking to hear the denial. My whole life I have struggled with diets. I've never been successful at them. Since the process started for surgery I've made a conscious effort to really change things up. We hardly eat any pre-packaged meals at home anymore. I try to cook everything from scratch so I can control what goes in and portion size better. We no longer being soda into the house not do we really buy junk food anymore. I've started working again and live a block and a half from work so I try to walk every chance I can instead of driving. I've lost a total of 16lbs so far and I am very proud of that but with so much left to go I just feel overwhelmed and like such a fat loser. Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong, I've grown to accept what I see when I look and the mirror and feel confident throwing my clothes on. I no longer feel disgusted by what I see and that has been a huge break through for me. On some level tho, I feel like a failure for being a fat person. Not because society tells me so but because I feel as if I'm telling myself I'm not worth better treatment. 

I am unable to afford a personal trainer or the cost of surgery out of pocket. I just am at a loss I guess. It's hard being the biggest person you know wanting to lose weight. Sure it's great to have a skinny family member or friend tell you how much they want you to lose weight and succeed but it's almost painful at the same time.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","I have read every single one of these arguments before.

But GG floods hashtags, thereby preventing discussion, and GG pressures advertisers to get writers fired or to try to get companies to shut down.

I KNOW you feel that you were silenced. I even think you WERE silenced on some issues. But we have a classic become your enemy thing here. You SAY you want more speech, but it's just not true. Any speech, as long as it's not ""from people who silence you."" You didn't ""oppose those articles."" You attempted to get people who disagreed with you fired. You attempted to chase them off the Internet.

&gt;  Do you recall why the ""Gamers are Over"" articles were written? They were an attempt to mass-silence the gaming community over the Zoe Post. After the Zoe Post went up, everyone who tried to talk about it was silenced. The topic was banned from forums across the internet, users were banned, topics were deleted. Reddit was a graveyard of deleted comments. This was a coordinated act of censorship perpetrated on behalf of a single person. That is unbelievable, but it happened.

It's unbelievable because it's PROBABLY FALSE. It is FAR FAR more likely that too many people got too outraged in threads, and got threads banned all over the place. Arguably, the Zoe Post itself was sufficient for going too far, because it was 90% inappropriate content *even for a discussion on journalistic ethics* on any forum. Anyone who thinks all those sites coordinated or were directed centrally is lost in paranoid delusions. Each site took action independently because *the threads were that bad.*

Occam's Razor, basic practicality, simple logic. How the hell could one minor game dev with no money possibly control the editorial and community management of dozens of sites? She couldn't. Get real.

There's a case to be made that there's a hypothetical version of the Zoe Post which is not a scary explosion from an ex, and only has substantive discussion points regarding ethical behavior in games journalism. But that is not what we got. I don't know ANY professional community manager who wouldn't delete the ZP on sight as incitatory, potentially slanderous, and as a very real risk to legal liability. They'd be a fool not to, frankly.

&gt; Journalists were conspicuously silent on the issue. It was, as they say, deafening. When pressed for comment, they would deny that it was newsworthy and tell you to shut up and stop asking. So, more censorship. They thought they could squash the controversy and it would go away, but that didn't happen. Weeks passed and people were still talking about it. So, what to do? The solution that some of them came up with was the Gamers are Over articles.

This is total echo chamber stuff at this point. I'd argue it, but it's probably pointless. I have written PAGES on here about what motivated the Gamers are Over articles.

Look, I have said before that some of GG's issues are valid. But the ZP was a *terrible* start, and tainted from the get-go. You have the logs from GJP, and you can simply read them and see that nobody in them ever brings up ""let's censor this in the name of our feminist overlords."" It's all about whether or not the post is gross, or exceptionally gross, and whether it's news.

If we ask for benefits, that's for our benefit, but it also keeps teachers from turning over.

The problem in education and other specializations is the consumer has lop-sided information.  Parents do not know what they are investing in.

For instance, in CA, if a school has been missing test score targets parents can opt to go to ANY OTHER SCHOOL in the district.  Kids get sent to my school.  But there is a school at the other end of town that does better than all of the surrounding high schools.  But that's where the rich kids go.

Principals can accept and reject transfers.  The district doesn't want to piss off the rich side of town by shipping a bunch of poor kids there (that's another one: parent's think transportation is 'on them').  So the rich school rejects them and they come to us to fulfill the requirement.

There are hundreds of other slight-of-hands in public education that has NOTHING to do with unions.  I and other teachers are sick of the politics and try to work through our contract provisions to better the situation.

State law says I can bring my kid into our district because I live in X city and work in Y city.  A few teachers wanted to do this.  This was to remedy the whole ""Consuelo can work in X rich city, but her kid has to go to the poor school"".  There was absolutely no procedure set in place.  Parents had never taken advantage of this.  The district actually hinted at the teachers raising a fuss about nothing and they used stall tactics to try to get these few teachers to give up.  I just imagine would it would be i we had no protections.","1435709103"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Edit: I'm not talking about gun laws or anything here. This is strictly pistol vs. rifle. I'm also not talking about automatic fire. Let's assume all rifles are semi-automatic (one pull of the trigger = one shot)

Holy shit this is long. Yes, this is something I'm passionate about.

First off, rifles are literally the best thing (small arms) humanity can come up with to defend yourself with(this is a very broad generalization). They have larger caliber ammunition for more stopping power, longer barrels for better accuracy, larger magazines, a stock to direct the recoil into your shoulder instead of your wrist. They're designed to be a primary weapon. Pistols are designed to be sidearms. They're designed to be hidden or used as a last resort. The small barrel hurts accuracy, the smaller calibers have less stopping power. The recoil is harder to manage making follow-up shots harder to land.

Second off, you aren't going to hit that first shot. Picture this; for whatever reason, you have a 250lb man charging you with a knife. He's balls-out rushing you as hard as he can. Your wife and kids are behind you. You're scared as fuck. You're shaking. You're screaming at this guy as loud as you can to stop. Shooting this man is the last thing you want to do. You're going to miss. Trained police officers miss the vast majority of shots they take. Even if you do hit it and get him in the lung or something, it's not like in the movies. He's not going to fly backwards dead. His adrenaline is pumping so hard he probably won't even know he's shot (and this is assuming he isn't on drugs which makes it worse). He's gonna stab the fuck out of you and the rest of your family and then go spend the next hour bleeding out somewhere. You're all dead. 

You need to put ten in his chest, not one. You need to make his body literally incapable of harming you no matter what his brain says. You shoot until he stops. That's it. If he's dead, that sucks. It's his fault.

Anyways, if you're going to do something, you might as well do it right. Yes, you could cut your steak with a pocket knife, but a steak knife would do the job much better.

Pinning any ideological label on yourself, or others, just puts you/them into a box that has connotations beyond what you may have intended. 

What happens if you don't agree with one small part of what the majority population of that box believes? You can't fit properly in the box any more, so you either change your beliefs to fit the box, or you leave the box and find a new box.  

It's easier overall to just have no box, and have your own individual beliefs. 

There's no need for labels. They just separate the world into us, in this case feminists, and them, which most people seem to assume are anti-feminists. It's not necessarily the case though. Many of the people who aren't feminist just aren't feminist, rather than being anti-feminist.","1435709104"

In real life I was almost killed by a stray bullet, I was 3 steps away from my head being in the bullets trajectory path and other than that I was extremely ill the week after my grandmother died and when I was in the bathtub I saw her... I spoke to her, that is what I feel was my first sense of assurance that there is a higher power.

In the trip I can't even begin to try and link the two together, from what you are describing I don't think I could recollect feeling as if an EXACT moment was like that other than the moments I realized that I was being laid down to die and when I realized I was going to ""heaven"" so insane! hopefully that answered the question?","1435709105"

I don't think he will bring back those upper levels for one reason, you can't access them. He said there is no point if you can't go in it. And I kinda agree. Maybe if people get vocal enough he'll make a optional patch.

Now I agree with you with the Books of Solitude and Bathhouse thing, in earlier versions the Dawn of Solitude comp version didn't have the tower it currently does. While normal or JK versions did. I brought this up and he added a tower behind Books of Skyrim to fill the void.

Touch makes gameplay many times slower. You have to wait for through every menu animation for the next menu options to appear and become tappable. Even stuff you think would be easier/faster with touch, like selecting units during a turn, seeing how far units can move, what they have queued, etc... is way slower and more cumbersome.

Being so used to a fast pace, it's a deal breaker. It feels like player vs ui, rather than tactics rpg.

I miss the game aloot. But since it has gotten stolen i have decided to play Persona 3P, (i had accidentally bought it awhile ago, while trying to get Persona 3 Fes had just downloaded it on my vita not to long ago)

So my question here is, should i just wait out persona 4 since i am more than willing to just pay $19.99 in the future for it, and to finish persona 3.
Or enter a new experience with Persona 2, i have always wanted to try out the older games i hear ,alot of good coming from P2, but I've been told i would dislike them due to playing the newer released games.","1435709114"

stats guys have been derided in the sport, often by those claiming it's impossible to quantify ""guts"" ""emotion"" ""leadership"" and other such things.

True enough, but in the last 18 months over a dozen renound bloggers and statistical analysts has been hired by teams and given direct influence over actual roster decisions. 

As baseball discovered a decade ago, while you can't quantify every possible factor, there is plenty of legitimate value in this data, and forward thinking teams can find diamonds in the rough, or make other technical decisions in general.

Baseball is a very slow, considered game where you can quantify almost everything quite easily. It's only with serious manpower and now advances in computer data collection that sports like ice hockey, basketball and now soccer are benefiting.

To continue the hockey example, no one blindly takes numbers and  spends millions of players (I tried in it my league this year with disastrous results). But anyone who considers the analysis of no value will be left behind.","1435709116"

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","I will generally always favor a 1-1-4 build unless my opponent is a hero such as SF who can be completely shut down with points in my nukes. Laser 's miss chance to secure/deny CS, get in as many harass hits as you can, march out waves to secure runes. Always be conscious of opportunities to quickly stack. Dying is an absolute no-no. Like Storm, a behind Tinker is absolute dead weight.

Bottle &gt; Boots &gt; Soulring is the progression. Now that Tinkers early farming capabilities are so much weaker than previously, the Soulring before BoTs is pretty essential imo. Once you have it, rotate between clearing mid-lane waves to farming jungle camps and taking runes.

Once you have BoTs, Blink is the next item. You're focus is still farming like a mad man but stay conscious of opportunities to quickly BoTs in and secure a kill. Like previously, stacks/clear jungle camps and farm lanes where there is space.

Blink allows you to be more aggressive with your farming. You can get behind towers and cut creep waves to keep your creeps attacking the tower and draw rotations. I'm still partial towards Dagon as the next item. As your nukes are now approaching max level it means you can output a load of damage and really help in engagements. Hex is obviously coming at some point, but be flexible in when you aim to buy it as sometimes an early hex is useless, and sometimes its invaluable.

Gameplan from this point is continue to pressuring towers by cutting waves, fighting with your team when appropriate, and building whichever items fill a need the most (damage, lockdown, survivability, creepclearing etc).

One thing to be careful with is how much space you are taking up. If your team has one or two other farm dependent heroes, make sure to factor that into your movements. Focus on particular areas of the map (Dire safelane/woods for instance), which will allow your cores to farm elsewhere. If you're constantly keeping all three lanes pushed out then all you're doing is delivering safe farm under tower to their carries while starving your own. Rarely is that a good trade.

It doesn't have to be directly tied to a forest for a likely situation: writer sees term, finds it enticing to a Japanese tongue, decides to base game plot around and elements around it, or just ties it in because it matches with game's nature settings and general ethos. We don't really know until we find the guy who made the term and ask him where he came up with the term. 

Video games start with small things that are built into other things over time. Just because the end point doesn't resemble the start doesn't mean there isn't a tie to forests there at the start! Take Quake, for instance. Name taken from D and D character that creators used to play. Final product ended up looking nothing like the hammer wielding demi-god it was originally going to be about.

The memorial wasn't order by Stalin, the decision to erect monuments was taken by the Red Army leadership. Also, as an Austrian, the narrative of liberating Austria from the fascist oppressors is a very favorable one given how quite a lot of Austrians were being rather happy and good fascist oppressors elsewhere.

I've been catching a lot of people in toe holds and realized that there is a significant lack of respect for the position.  
In the last couple of weeks I've had the foot to the point that the ATFL was bearing all the pressure and I knew that all it'd take was for them to twist or kick and they'd end up with at least a nasty sprain, so I've been letting go if they won't tap.  
On one occasion we both had each other in a toe hold and I had the superior one and I tapped for fear that if I cranked on it anymore, he may have a knee jerk reaction to the pain and crank his hard and injure me, so I just tapped for both of our safety to avoid a potential dick measuring contest.  
Two other times in the last week I've had to advise the other guy to tap. It felt douchey. My coach saw me catch one guy in it and suggested to me as I held the foot that he may not really understand the risk he was in.

It doesn't matter if you can keep killing the same guys over and over, eventually more of them will turn up, they will pull more maxs, something will change and they will overrun you, happens every time.

This was what annoyed me in the previous couple of SS's to the most recent one. We watched some of our BAM guys using airhammer etc to farm infantry, only to allow those infantry to just respawn, rather than take out the spawn solutions.

Problemen med för höga skatter är många, men de viktigaste är att politiker inte lär sig att hushålla med ekonomin, utan gör av med mer och mer pengar, samt att vi inte bygger kultur där man faktiskt tjänar något på att anstränga sig. Det Sverige föder är en mentalitet av att ansträngningar är lönlösa. Om du undrar om det får några följder i ett större perspektiv, så ja, det får den infekterade mentaliteten. Vi har medelmåttiga företag (de flesta svenska företag är sedan länge sålda till utlandet), vi får medelmåttig forskning (svenska högskolor tappar år efter år i internationella rankingar), vi får en skola där barn inte lär sig läsa och vi får en ineffektiv offentlig förvaltning.","1435709125"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","&gt; so it can be used to not only nuke down the wave

You understand how midding works right? You generally want an on demand nuke, so that you can secure cs. Something that does 25/40/55/70 instantly is fucking garbage because a rightclick will be stronger. Think of every mid hero in the game, only like 1/2 do not have an on demand nuke because their laning is super strong. 

If you wanna say someone is a good mid its best to always compare it to puck, because for all intents and purposes pucks ability to mid is in the top 5. In a situation where the enemy has the highground vision, i can always orb to score cs AND gain vision to use aggro tricks. 

&gt;But basically, Atrophy Aura level one gives the enemy -~10 damage, Pit Lord +20 damage, 

He has 3 armour and is melee, i dont think you understand how bad that is. Atrophy aura only works on base damage and not damage gained from +damage items, making it more underwhelming lategame as well as weaker specifically against heroes like SF/Invoker who gain lots of +damage","1435709126"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;  The definition of an assault rifle is that it has selective fire and is capable of firing full auto.

Well, if we're getting down into the weeds, an assault rifle does not actually have to be capable of full auto.  Three round burst is considered auto, but not ""full"" auto, and is a feature on some assault rifles, such as the M16A2/A4 and M4A2.

But the whole assault rifle/assault weapon/sporting rifle debate is similar to the pro-life/pro-choice debate.  It's about framing the argument through linguistic priming.  If you can get your term to stick, you have a better political point of attack.  And fortunately or unfortunately, the anti-gun side (or is that the ""common sense gun control"" side?) seems to have pretty much won the framing battle here.

The UFC does. They own everything he did under the UFC forever which means bellator cant show any of his highlights while he was fighting for UFC. It means they can sell a shirt with his name on it but they cant say ''UFC veteran'' on that shirt.

&gt; Also, I didnt notice apparel in the contract, but that could just be me.

Your reading comprehension may need improving.

Fighter hereby grants to ZUFFA the exclusive worldwide *right to use, display, disseminate, edit, reproduce, print, publish and make any other use of the name, sobriquet, image, likeness, voice, persona, signature, and biographical material of Fighter and all persons associated with Fighter (collectively, the ""Identity""), in any medium in connection with advertising, marketing, exploiting and promoting the UFC brand* and each Bout and the exploitation of all rights pertaining thereto as provided herein and all rights to each Bout electronic and other (the ""Ancillary Rights"" and, collectively with the Promotional Rights, the ""Rights"").

Edit - If they wanted to they could put out a reebok shirt that said Josh 'small dick' Koscheck and call it an editing of signature for use in a medium connected to marketing of the new reebok deal as stated in the contract signed and perpetual rights described to Mr Koscheck before signing.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;On a bike we use numerical methods because we haven't figured it all out yet. 

This is patently false. Almost [all differential equations](http://www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb/preprints/diffforms.pdf) have no [closed form solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression). But numerical methods can be used to find answers to arbitrary precision, anyway, so even though they are ""approximate"" solutions, they're as accurate as you need them to be down to the stability of the solving function . 

I tend to agree with the parent here about the ""click bait"" phrasing of the video. It implies that we don't understand the *physics* of bicycles -- but we very clearly do because we can write down the equations of motion for them. What we do not have is an efficient means to reverse the equations of motion in order to solve for particular solutions that confer stability. Saying ""it is a mathematically intractable problem to solve"" is very different from ""science does not understand..."".","1435709129"
"AskMarketing","t5_2vqfw","Thanks for the help. I took your advice and decided to read up a bit about on how branding works. It still seems very nebulous. But I'm guessing that's what it must be like for a very high level strategic type of activity?

I guess, the question that comes to mind that I'll need to explore, is how does a client know when to seek out someone with branding skills. Or to be specific, what kind of problem are they solving for people. I ask this because I've come across to versions of branding.

Version 1 - Designing the aesthetics that express a brand along with making sure all activities of the business are living up to the brand.

Version 2 - Consultants who help companies define what their brand is.

I feel a bit naive in saying this, since I could be wrong, but the times a client might need these services would be when building up a company, maintaining their brand for the long haul, or saving a company who is falling from grace? I added that last part in since I learned about a brand consultant named simon middleton, whom seemed to do a lot of work in helping companies brand themselves appropriately for their market when they are in danger of becoming irrelevant.

Branding in general seem's very interesting.","1435709129"

"deathnote","t5_2riqp","I think that's a very astute observation, great job! - and I think there is more scenes when the sound of plane is heard (someone should probably check this). Other than it makes the scene sound cool as fuck, I'm willing to believe that there is additional symbolism to this effect - but as to what that is, I'm not really sure at this point. Perhaps by re-watching the series and paying close attention to every instance that sound effect appears, something might come to light. 

Very often in film and literature, flight (usually of birds, but why not planes) is used to symbolize departure of some sort. Clearly, the second plane sound you list symbolizes Light's death, and everything that follows (the departure of his dreams, aka delusions). The first instance is a little more tricky; perhaps it's about Light's innocence, since while he was amnesiac, he worked for the good side, and hence there was a chance that he would redeem himself even if he regained his memories afterwards. When he touched the notebook, the director wanted to make it clear to the audience that all that hope had ""departed.""

All this is speculation of course, as further analysis is required for a more concrete answer. And of course, some of it is up to individual interpretation. ","1435709130"

"neopets","t5_2r64t","I read mostly on my lunch breaks at work. It's my ""break from people"" time. If I'm reading a good book that has me hooked, I'll also read in the evening while I'm having dinner, or instead of Netflixing/internetting/gaming. I just finished Soul Enchilada the other day, and I actually read it in 2 days- I started on my lunch break one day, loved where it was going, read more that night, got to the ""good part"" on my lunch break the next day, and *had* to finish it that night. I mean, it helped that it's a relatively short book and written in a light enough tone that it was a quick read, but I pushed through it because it was really interesting and I wanted to know where it was going. 

One of the things they talked about a lot for National Novel Writing Month was that you can always find time, even if it's just a few minutes here or there. The important part is that you have to want to do it, or otherwise make it a priority. This is definitely true with my reading. I'd say I keep fairly busy, but when I'm in a good book, I find ways to shove other things aside to make time for reading it. (It also makes me feel guilty, because I'm totally neglecting my knitting and my attempts at learning Java to play silly games on my laptop... like, really? That's my priority? Pffft. But then I remember that games are fun and tell myself to shut up.)

But anyways, that's how I do it. I *want* to read, so I make little pockets of time. For someone who doesn't enjoy reading the way I do, I wouldn't expect it to be so easy or automatic. 

And if you don't enjoy reading a given book, don't feel bad about putting it down and trying something else. There are books I've never finished because I didn't like them. Read what you like. If you force yourself to read something you don't enjoy, you'll resent reading, like every schoolkid who thinks they hate reading because they've been made to read boring books in school. I know that for me, it would be more ""edifying"" to read more non-fiction, but uggghhhhh I do not like most non-fiction, unless the author is VERY engaging. I just can't do it.

Address: 400 Harbor Dr, Sausalito CA.

Since we need to give enough time to get back to SF for the Opera event, lets plan on leaving the dock no later than Noon.  That means most folks should be at the marina no later than 11:45, WITH all their supplies, such as snacks, water, and non-red-wine booze if you want it.  There is a Mollie Stone at Harbor Drive and Bridgeway, right by the marina.  

Accio and I will be arriving earlier than everyone else, so I can pick up the boat keys, and start getting it ready.  

I don't know what the schedule for /u/betanleclaire's carpool.   

Please let me know ASAP if you can't make it to Sausalito.  I *can* do a pickup at Pier 40, but would rather not.

One thing I noticed is that I dashed forward at Lux a lot, which was a bad move, of course.

Regarding the centripetal forces, my napkin math says a 1m thick tubing rotating so that there is 1g at the surface would be equivalent to 0.3psi.  1 atm is 14.5psi so the thickness would only have to increase slightly to compensate for rotation.

"Prismata","t5_31bl5","I don't think it's the strength of Trinity that's the problem, but the cost. Simply put, it costs more than a regular drone (Assuming G = 4/3) for a payoff that's very far into the future.

Not only that, but it's really inconvenient to buy. It's easy to squeeze one into a build order in many cases, but there's no convenient time to build more. Early game it can slow down your economy too much. Mid game you're putting as much gold as you can toward attack and defense. Late game building them is too slow, so you can't quickly convert your drones to prepare for breaching, especially since it leaves few drones left to use as emergency Forcefields while you're still establishing your breach defense.

I think 1G is too cheap, but GG is probably too much. What I would like to see is this:

Trinity Drone - 3GGEE (Consume 1 Drone)

That is, you're no longer ""buying"" one drone, you're buying two at a time for a discount.

This price makes it more cost-efficient than a regular drone, so that as long as you have the tech, it will be a good option. You might argue that it makes it no-brainer/boring decision at that point, but it's not the tactical decision to buy them that's important, it's the strategic decision of whether to go into heavy green tech or not. You also have the decision of whether to throw your green at more efficient drones, or toward damage/defense. You aren't going to want to use all of your green this way.

This price also has the exact gold cost of a regular drone, so that as long as you have the green, it's a good option. This means you can start building them fairly early in the game once you have your tech going and keep buying them mid game. And since you're only consuming one drone at a time, it leaves spare drones for emergency Forcefields in case things don't go as planned.

HP-wise this is actually weaker than the old Trinity Drone, but that should be fine for how convenient it is to get now. The old TD converted 2 drones into 1 TD (2 -&gt; 5, Net gain of 3 HP per G spent.) This one converts 1 drone into 1 TD (1 -&gt; 5, Net gain of 2 HP per G spent, still stronger than FF, but not prompt or a blocker.) The HP of the unit can always be buffed or nerfed as needed.","1435709140"

I have in mind not just real power series but also p-adic power series.

Also, the notion of uniform continuity is very important and relies in an essential way on epsilon and deltas (in metric spaces). If you want to prove a real-valued continuous function on a closed bounded interval in R is uniformly continuous, it's time to bring out the epsilons and deltas.","1435709142"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; I'm curious to know why you think sex is so special in terms of morality.

It is not. It is ""special"" because society is now fixated on it.

They are treating homosexuality or other sexual disorders the same as ethnicity.

Sex is ""special"" only in its intensity (it is the most powerful urge we have generally).

&gt; Why is oral or anal sex immoral as opposed to vaginal sex? 

Fornication is not moral. The reason why some acts would be always immoral is because they defy nature and thus can never be moral. Sexual intercourse is immoral when done at the inappropriate time or with an inappropriate person.

&gt; If we use toys to massage our bodies &amp; feel good that seems to be fine, but if you use toys on our bodies for the good feelings of sexual gratification it is wrong?

It is an abuse of the body and sexual organs.

&gt; If this isn't about acts or emotions, can you use rationality to explain what is wrong with these acts, why are they ""bad"" &amp; ""harmful""?

Yes, I can. Well, I do not have to. Ancient Greek philosophers already explained it.

&gt; If he created these, why is it a sin to experience them, to use the body he gave you to it's fullest extent if no-one is getting hurt?

That ""no one is getting hurt"" stipulation is arbitrary. It is something stick into sexual matters without regard to its basis. If sexual urges are so essential, why then are those whose sexual urges require non-consent demonized? 

&gt; Is it a sin to eat fast food which causes actual damage to your body &amp; indulges in gluttony, why sex?

Yes, gluttony is a vice.

"education","t5_2qhlm","Chinese workers are earning higher wages, the wage differential is less and less all the time. But the problem is, those low skill and medium skill jobs are rapidly being automated, they are going away fast, globally.

What kind of jobs do you think could or would be brought back? Do you think they would then be given to unskilled Americans? Why?

 They might be physically brought back here, but at the same time, services liberalisation might open up the service jobs market to global firms paying their workers who were temporarily here, in their home country. This is a completely different ball game and in my opinion its an extreme abuse of workers on all levels. 

Think its bad when commercial firms do it, just wait until that starts happening to much of the public sector (like education) down to the municipal level. 

Those workers would be working on special trade related visas, intra-company trade visas, (think ""SchoolsCo"") which . are basically mandated by trade deals. They have no wage parity or necessity tests associated with them, (no test to see if any national firms or workers from a country could do the jobs first- that is actually forbidden by the trade deal itself) The media has had stories on H1B visas, but only a very few stories (that I know of) on these other visas and both had inaccuracies one was full of inaccuracies.  

Probably because of what it was doing to health care, the US media never told us about G*T*, so we don't even have the knowledge to put it into its proper context.

In my previous comment, I was simple stating that, based off typical use of version numbers, that update is ""minor"". An update such as iOS 8.x.x to iOS 9.x.x is considered major. 

Every development team may interpret version numbers differently, therefore treating them differently.

"KingkillerChronicle","t5_2smxb","Except, I don't see how this would be an ""awesome"" development. It would just be a twist for the purpose of being shocking; it wouldn't enhance the story. It would provide inconsistencies--why do the Adem, who have such particular rules about talking about them, fear them so much? Why would the Adem, who have knowledge of history going back to even before the fall of Myr Tyraniel(one of Kvothe's forebearers used the sword), be as wrong as everyone else? Why did Shehyn say that Kvothe using all his talents to fight one would be of the Lethani(I guess she doesn't actually know the Lethani)? Why do so many disasters that happen in the story...that areaccompanied with signs of the Chandrian?(the tarpit broke because it was unusually cold; blue flames and rust at the wedding massacre)

It would honestly detract from the story if Rothfuss said--yeah, they have signs and everyone fears them and they laughed at Kvothe's loss of his parents and Cinder was in the company of mercenaries who were waylaying travelers and the Cthaeh said they tortured Kvothe's parents and present day Kvothe heavily implies that they hunted down his parents for saying their name----but its all a trick! He would have to do so much retconning that it would literally ruin the story.

Cold-blooded is simple. its use entirely depends on the current popularity of echolocators, and to a lesser extent haunt and point sensors. Anything that prevents echolocators from working is sooo good since a tag specifying your exact location is so much worse than a couple of splashes during swimming, but of course it's pointless if nobody uses them anyway. Since echolocators are currently super common in my anecdotal experience, it's very good. Also, keep in mind that by only slightly tilting the control stick, you can still sneak without splashes. Ninja Squid is only for fast sneaking.","1435709150"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Ok, here, I'll show you what you said, translated into the terms of my argument. I ignored it because it's not germane to my point which is ""let's not punish thoughts, but let's punish actions.""

&gt;If someone lashes out at your throat with a knife, but fails to sever your arteries... He still has to be charged for attempted homicide, not countered with the possible defense like ""no no, I was just aiming to injure him, not to kill him... You can't imprison me for some unacted action [homicide]. I didn't commit homicide. You can't prove I tried homicide!""

*If someone &lt;commits an injurious action with intent to kill you&gt;, but fails to do so, they will still be charged with the crime of &lt;attempting to murder you&gt;. You can't counter the charge of &lt;attempting to murder you&gt; with ""No! I was just aiming to hurt him!""*

Notice how there's a direct action (attacking you) that's being charged. 

What I'm saying is that any ""crime"" by which there is no action - meaning we're only punishing someone's intent - is unjust and immoral. 

Every example you've provided, fwiw, I think are actual crimes. 

* ""I did drive drunk but..."" (Driving drunk is an action. It's a crime.)

* ""I tried to kill him but only hurt him instead..."" (Trying to kill someone is an action. It's a crime.)

Essentially - you seem to be ok punishing people for crimes that haven't occurred, based on a belief that intent alone is enough to punish someone. I disagree, wholeheartedly, because I think we can criminalize enough pre-steps to actions like this to not require us to punish people for thought alone.

Yes, withdrawing from classes and taking more than 4 years to graduate will make med schools question what was going on, but I can guarantee that taking care of yourself and your family is 10 times more important than any of that.

Honestly, I would take that stress off your mind for a bit and take care of business. Med school isn't going anywhere.

One key thing worth noting with both of them, is that they have incredible potential to suicide save. If you've got 5 people chasing your carry, then Braum can stick up his shield, drop the ulti and just generally block them (It's kind of hard to ignore Braum when he's right in your face). Similarly, Janna can start up a tornado, run into the enemy team, ulti them backwards, then run away again. Tornado then releases a few secs later, and holds them up a bit more.

Both of these obviously can work without dying, but in my experience you do tend to die quite a lot of the time.","1435709152"

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","This is going to be a wall of text, sorry!

Channel layout is kind of lacking, in the sense that if you added playlists below uploads or popular uploads it would be easier for people to find. It just looks empty you know? Banner is fine, as with icon! The text on the banner seems a little fuzzy but not an issue really. You need to fill in your about page more with phrases and things that relate to you that would better help people find your channel when they search for it. It would greatly help with SEO, just don't keyword spam like ""funny videos, pewdiepie, jacksepticeye, letsplay, letsplayer, ect..."" More like sentences that describe you and what you do. 

I watched The One That Got Away video. Title could benefit from pipes, or some sort of separation between the number, game name and unique name. Something like ""firered | #11"" or ""Firered [#11]"" would work better. Description is barren and lacking, not helping with SEO at all, needs to be filled with relevant info about your game, what you did, what you found, stuff like that. Everything in the video was fine, you seemed nervous but whatever, all good, but when you **BURPED** you lost me. That totally just knocked me out of the video. Tags are also in need of help. ""xbox, Ps, pearl, platinum,"" don't relate to the game at all and are false tags. Make them more specific to the game you're playing like a phrase people would search in the YouTube Search Bar. 

Honestly, I think the channel has potential but you need to work on the behind the scenes stuff like Tags, Descriptions, maybe make the thumbs stand out more, the image behind the logo brighter or more eye catching, and don't do that burping thing. That's just gross, sorry. ","1435709155"
"cocktails","t5_2qpco","Find a recipe you like and use it as a base for your own creation. Sometimes I see a recipe and the necessity of a substitution leads to a new drink entirely, other times, I have a few flavors I want to combine and I find a recipe that would accommodate them. 

This becomes a lot easier with time. I find that now I am becoming better at knowing what something will taste like just by reading the recipe on paper.

I rarely make the same recipe more than once, as there are so many recipes in Death and Co and PDT to cover, as well as my own ideas to play with. If I'm with close friends I'll make them a drink with a new recipe; there has been some failures but they are forgiven and fixed on the fly. If it's a large group, it's always something I've done and perfected before.

I'm not too focused on writing things down in a well-documented manner, as I am always building a new understanding and refining ratios as I learn, I could often create a better drink than the original (had I written the original recipe down). If I was working at a bar, this would be an entirely different story and a lot more focused on reproducible and refined results, but I'm just having fun at home.

Making the name is the best part. Sometimes it's a simple spin if I'm using an established recipe (A strawberry-tequila Last Word becomes The Final Straw). Other times it's a song or a statement about my life and the temporal associations that gave rise to the drink. I take something on my mind and think about how I can express it in a drink. Eg: Frustrated with the conformity of a few peers, I wanted to build a drink called ""Bird from the Feather"", a reference to the popular phrase - so I took a bunch of saccharine ubiquitous flavors like strawberry and st. germain, used a base of tequila and then mixed it up with bitter grapefruit and acidic lemon. The conception is arguably dramatic, leaving me to not explain a lot of the names I create, but the product of the emotional expression is fantastic.","1435709155"

Seriously, name a team that made it to the Finals with a bad coach in the past 10 years. Please don't say Scott Brooks either, because having the most talented roster in recent memory counts for just as much as Lebron.

Now name all the teams that have fired their coach or are still in the process of finding a new one. If good coaches grow on trees, there'd be 30 of them in the league. But there aren't. There's probably less than 12. And if you really think you can win a championship with a bad coach..........","1435709158"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","&gt; To assume that because the statistics of sociopaths in the world at large would be mirrored in such a specific subset of a portion of the population, would be to mis-apply statistics.

No, I was not saying that because 1 out of 24 people in the world is a sociopath that the same percentage is at RBN. I only cited that statistic to indicate that because such a high percentage of people in the world are sociopaths, there are more than likely at least some in the sub.

If I had to guess, I would guess that less than 1 out of 24 people in this sub is a sociopath, in which case I would agree with you it's probably less here than in the real world. But that's only a guess.

But I think that despite all rules and regulations, some successfully make it in.

&gt; How are the sociopaths ""targeting"" RBNers if they are trying to pass themselves off as regular people? Doesn't the term ""targeting"" imply mistreatment of said target?

I have to give the mods of RBN credit for keeping out hurtful content in ways that most other subs aren't able or willing to.

But in life, as in this sub, as in other subs, I would argue that the most ""successful"" sociopaths' power lies exactly in their ability to pass as regular people.

If they were spotted as sociopaths, people wouldn't listen to what they say. Only by seeming to have good intentions can sociopaths cause the greatest harm.

I think that's how many sociopaths operate in real life. While the rules in RBN would make it harder for sociopaths to cause harm, there are still plenty of ways for them to, not because there's anything wrong with the rules or the mods, but because that's what sociopaths do.

For example, one thing that sociopaths would benefit from is having as much information about victims' as possible. So a sociopath pretending to be a regular person could spend a lot of time asking people to share more details.

Now, I'm not saying that in all instances that someone asks for details, they're a sociopath. But that is one method by which a sociopath could target someone in RBN while flying under the rules.

Giving bad advice is another way. It's not that hard to give bad advice, and it wouldn't be that hard to give bad advice that doesn't break the rules of RBN.

In short, sociopaths in RBN would operate the same way that sociopaths operate in real life.  Passing themselves off as regular people is one of sociopath's best weapons.  Mistreating people in a way that is invisible to most onlookers is another. And all of those things can happen despite RBN's rules simply because nobody is going to be perfect at catching sociopaths.

I'm just saying people should be aware of that.","1435709162"

Turning down 40m (!) for Sterling hoping for an improved offer is bonkers. The Sheikhs just want their English player for the homegrown stats to keep the FIFA bean counters happy (especially now they've lost Sinclair, Milner and Lampard). Sadly for Pool, City have realized there are much cheaper players about who fulfill the criteria of being English and playing in the Prem (see that rumoured interest in Delph for confirmation).

Now they're trying to cheap out on Benteke a week after spending 29m on Firminho without any back and forth? Baffling. 

The way it's going, they'll have a moody Sterling and a front line of Borini, Ings and Lambert which is not a strike force that will be troubling the top 4 any time soon.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","He sucks.

Now for real. i want to compare him to mercury since there was already a thread about osiris&gt;ravana.
his 1 have lowest range skill in game hits lowest dmg and even if you can stuck it after 8 basics, lets be honest after 8 basics eenmy should be dead anyway, and it s not even feel rewarding like comon 10% slow at rank 1 and WOWOW 20% at rank 5?!, also mercs 1 CAN CRIT 
his 2 is OKAY if it supposted to be high skill cap dodging abilities stuff that can let him get closed to enemy.
his3 WTF is this merc can run same distance be already there and throw enemy where ever he wants, this 0,8 roots just feels bad man, its single target god so if ymir blocking enemy hunter (80% of them have jump or roll) you can t do anything, also his healing is GARBAGE at rank 5 late game its healing for 100 hp?! the only good think i live about this ability is high base dmg at rank1 but that s it. and why for sake of zeus would you make it stop after hiting 3 minions? dmg at rank 5 is so low that he cant clear well or sustain so what was the point?
his UUUULTIMATEEE is more like nonexistance threat, why? i will compare 2 situactions A) you are full dmg angry ravana trying to 1 shot enemy carry in team fight suprise at lvl 20 with full build this ult deals from 100-150 dmg idk if it was intended to troll us or i dont know. dmg reduction is almost useless because you have very low scaling abilities where its not even worth to use it for other reason than 0,8root or dodge with his2, he wont survive 5 seconds on this dmg reduction cause he s sqish anyway.
B) he  stanky quinsais mystical mail hammer stuff bro , adc can just jump away or even ignore him cause it s  just ravana.

I rolled in chest ravana skin today and wanted to try him, all i got was 3 rage quits in lobby because my teammates rather wait 30 minuts than play with this god in team cause he s useless in arena/conquest(didnt play other modes). all i could done in my games with him was rooting enemy for non existing time and pray for my team to carry with small amount of kill secure on  his combo and it was horrible time.

I just wan't him to be a mele assasin who can sh it on enemies for short duration or a warrior who s getting stronger everysecond fight is going, it's so sad his passiv can stack 99times but after all it doesnt matter and don't fill this character or his playstyle OF COMBOBRAKER.

I guess you're okay with just missing the playoffs and having the team in-tact? I'd much rather just miss the playoffs and have 2 extra first rounders. That is such poor asset management.. If you know someone is leaving at the end of the season, your team's not making the playoffs, you want to keep him? What?

In the Superbowl, he made a quick drive with little time before the half to tie the score.  He then had an unproductive 4th quarter where you guys came back and pulled ahead.  Then with under two minutes left, he again pulls it together for another drive that brings them to the goal line and a potential game-winning score.

great QBs are hard to find.  You risk the unknown by ditching him.","1435709176"

Agreed, without that feature Apple Music is worthless to me.  The ""For You"" page is pathetic.  The recommendations are so bad it's making me suspicious of payola.

At some point it got confused with the Confederate flag, so you'll see it referred to as such. It means something vaguely in line with supporting the Confederacy. It could mean that you are patriotic towards the South, that you think the national government is abusing its power (the South seceded because they felt that was happening), or that you specifically think that minorities have too much political power (the South seceded because they wanted slavery to be legal, and it was clearly on its way out).","1435709179"

Note: the average human ability score is 6, just for scale.  
Armor 3; any damage dice rolled against the chamax that do not roll a 6 are ignored, as the creature is composed mainly of undifferentiated tissue and has few vital organs.  
Bite: 2d6+2  
Acid: The chamax can spit or vomit acid on it's victims, inflicting 3d6, and for each dice that rolls a 6, permanently reduce the armor of the target by 1 point.  
Life Sense: the chamax is telepathic, but is only smart enough to use the Life Detection form of the talent.  
Radio Sense: The chamax can hear and speak in the radio spectrum.

You seem to be jaded about something that isn't really a big deal in my opinion, and I would think that most of this sub agrees. Okay, Japan wasn't in love with IX, but they sure did love the rest (I guess). Plus X went with a very Japanese themed culture in my opinion, so why get mad about this one? Also, Disney is American based, why wouldn't we love it? FF characters were side pieces, not the main event. So, my advice, get over it haha.","1435709182"

"canada","t5_2qh68","The party leaders are typically marketed as paragons of party values.  If Mulcair actively considered a position with the very government he seeks to unseat, it is harder to maintain the NDP-man image.  For a moment, suppose this was Trudeau.  If prior to joining the LPC as a candidate if he had entertained an offer from the CPC, do you think orange partisans would be looking at that as sensible management of his political career or as further evidence that the Liberals are blue deep down?  Mulcair has already brought the NDP toward center (following Layton's strategy of doing much the same).  If there is a credible narrative of ideological alignment with the Tories, we can replace the ""Liberals and Conservatives are exactly the same"" narrative with the ""NDP, Liberals, and Conservatives are exactly the same"".  If firmly rooted, it would motivate a lot of would be NDP voters to stay home.  This whole thing is really a play at suppressing the NDP vote.  I would take it as an indication that the NDP is being taken seriously at the least.

&gt;For me at least, whether the claims being made are truthful is of vital importance.

If Mulcair asked for $300k and was met with a limit of $180k (essentially if the claims published by MacLeans are true), how would that change your view of Mulcair's NDP?  If it would cause you to withdraw your support, why?  It would make Mulcair a no less effective parliamentarian and it would change nothing of their campaign promises or platform.","1435709182"

People here don't seem to care if you're fat so long as you're not a jerk fat person (with a few outliers, as you said).

I'm always someone who leans toward the side of being sympathetic to fat folks because I know without a proper education from parents (parents, because the government's food pyramid is pretty silly, imo), it can be difficult. If only our schools taught kids how to get healthy foods of a budget and all that, we'd be better off. My ma is an emotional eater, but she taught my brother and I portion control and how to make cheap, healthy meals. She just did her eating in secret, it makes me sad to see her self medicate, because she's a wonderful person.","1435709183"

It's a requirement that must be done to your car twice a year to ensure it is working properly, it is checked by licensed stablishments and enforces by the police via a sticker you must place on your car. If you don't have it up to date, you get fined. It doesn't cover your point of changing a tire but it does ensure the car to be in optimal conditions.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Had a very successful move with my dog from house to apartment, ~8 hour trip plus overnight stay in the middle.


I chalk a lot of the success up to my dog being comfortable with the crate before as well. We stayed at a hotel for a day before moving--dog had her crate and was more comfortable, although obviously stressed. We carried emergency items (some medicine to calm an upset tummy and pumpkin puree, she tends to get a bad tummy when stressed) which was nice. She travelled in her crate as it was a lot safer for us if we were in an accident, and she slept most of the way. 


While in the apartment, the crate was very useful as it was a pet-friendly place and i didnt know how many other dogs had eliminated in the apartment (or how it had been cleaned) and I was worried she would be inclined to eliminate. The crate again, gave her a place that smelt like home, was safe, etc. It also gave her a place to go when she heard new/strange noises for the first few weeks/month, until she became more comfortable with apartment living.","1435709184"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Some different perspectives:

It is okay for politicians to change their mind. Facts arise and perspectives change. 

Some people have a problem with this when they voted for a politician for their ideas, and then see the politician as betraying them by switching sides. 

Others see it as not okay if they switch their voting habits to fall in line with the highest bidder.

It is also important to note that many people choose their politicians based on character. They want a strong figurehead who has figured out what they want and will drive for it. But they also want a politician to be understanding to new ideas. Essentially they want a politician who is always ""morally right"" so that they do not have to switch stances.","1435709186"

You obviously can add to that combo later and supplement it, but you at least have it. 

Of course, this is not to say that women who choose not to fight back are wrong, or that they are culpable for not having that training. There's no correct way to respond to assault. ","1435709187"

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","This is great - it's refreshing to hear this from the perspective of someone who has been through something like this as well.

She and I are very close: we trust each other with sensitive information. I've told her things I haven't told anyone else and she has done the same with me. She's the first person I want to talk to when something good, or bad, happens in my life and she does the same with me. 

I want to tell her because, in my own head, I think ""well, how can she *really* know that I have feelings for her? That I want to be more than friends with her?""...and then I think, ""I've said stuff like that before - but I don't know if she took it seriously or thinks I'm just joking.""
My mother, who I have discussed this situation a lot with, says that as a girl she ""probably can tell that [I] like her more than a friend"". Seeing as how my best friend frequently sets me up to tell her things like how I think we'd be a beautiful couple or how we make a great team and stuff like that, my mom also says that this is likely a sign that she is confused about the way she feels at me and is maybe trying to get me to admit some deeper feelings.

It just sucks that she is dating someone else. 

I also am worried to tell her the truth because I don't want her to think that all this time I have been considering her my girlfriend - because i haven't. I know that, right now, we are just friends. She is probably the closest friend I have. But at times, I do feel like I am treated by her more like a boyfriend - at least in the trust, loyalty, communication, emotional support aspects. 

At the same time, however, I feel like she and I are close enough that I can speak freely and openly about my feelings for her, just as I would any other sensitive topic that is important to me. It's just difficult to muster up the courage, to be bold, and actually do it.","1435709188"

&gt; ...
&gt; Guns are also HIGHLY affective.

This is a hypothesis that could vary well be true.  However, there are non-third-world countries with high suicide rates that don't use guns that have an equally high success rate.

&gt; The effect is permanent. ... There's no study to suggest otherwise and the data didn't show the effect reducing after a few years.

It's not short-lived, as I said several times already, but it's not permanent.  Suicide is just more complicated than what method is available.  Culture and economics are a bigger part.","1435709188"

4) practice makes perfect! constantly practice kiting when you're playing. when you're last hitting, practice moving around inbetween hits and work on your mouse speed (the higher the better, to a degree i think) also positioning makes kiting more effective / easier so keep that in mind too","1435709190"

My elven mage Warden who just set Alistair on the throne with Anora would be used to duty sacrificing personal needs.

"greece","t5_2qh8i","There is no difficulty in collecting taxes. It is just that some professions tax evade a lot, like lawyers, doctors, plumbers, electricians, etc. Property taxes cant be evaded, so they get collected. In fact because of this, the previous greek government made a new ""temporary/emergency"" property tax which pretty much fucked everyone over. 

Even if you had 0 income, as long as you owned a property, you had to pay it. And there are plenty of people who are unemployed but own the family house which they live in(Greece has high home ownership).

This was one of the main reasons that the previous government lost the elections and even though the current government promised to cancel that tax, they will keep it for now(because they need the monies).

VAT is similar deal, you cant easily evade it for the most part. Though you do have occasions where the seller might tell you ""100euro with vat, 80euro without vat/receipt"", but that doesnt happen often.

So tax evasion is often exaggerated for Greece, because it fits in the lazy, corrupt greeks rhetoric. While there is some tax evasion, things arent as crazy as foreigners assume. I mean that's why the greek government still has tens of billions of euro tax income. 

Also the greek tax system is fucked up and automatically assumes you are trying to cheat. So for example ""do you have a car""? If you do, then the system automatically assumes that you have a minimum income of let's say 10k euro a year. Even if you are currently unemployed with 0 money and you bought that car 5 years ago. And you are asked to pay income taxes, even with 0 income.

Hell, the previous government voted a retarded law that says deposit interest is a similar criteria. So if you have 200euro in the bank for random expenses and got 7cents interest, you are then asked to pay 2.5k euro income tax(even though you dont have any income/property). Thankfully this is more of a system ""bug"" and you probably wont have to pay for that, but it shows how retarded our tax system is.

Another popular among the foreign media thing is how greeks have millions of undeclared pools. This is because pools are considered a luxury thing and therefore you get fucked by the system for having one. Even though a pool costs like 10-20k to make, which is nothing in comparison to the value of the house. But this is a law that was made 50 years ago, when pools were a luxury.

&gt;Here in Canada, our income tax is taken automatically off our paycheques by employers and paid to the government. How does the tax system work in Greece? Thank you, again, in advance!

Well, for social security/healthcare, it is paid automatically by your salary(assuming you are working for someone else). For taxes, the system is still somewhat automated but you actually need to manually pay for them and fill in the tax report. But the system knows your income, so you cant really cheat. 

Well in theory you could(by having your employer underdeclaring your income) but  this doesnt happen often because it has other negative repercussions(like your pension, etc). As i said, people that tax evade are mostly doing jobs where they arent working for someone else, they are freelancers.

--------------------------------

Corruption is often correlated with poverty. Poorer countries have higher corruption than richer ones. People mistake the cause and effect. They think that rich countries are rich because they dont have much corruption. But this isnt true.

When you dont earn enough to live comfortably, it is more likely that you will try to earn extra money on the side. Hence the cause of corruption is poverty. Corruption was actually getting significantly reduced in Greece, especially among younger generations. But that was before the crisis. Nowadays, it is every man for himself. 

And on top of that, there is little trust in the government that they would properly use the taxes, so many people have even more reasons to tax evade. Though to be fair, the current government is a new party which is still pretty popular and ""uncorrupted"". They havent had decades of governing to get their claws into everything.

Which is why this government was the perfect deal for Germany. They had a government that could start things over and fight corruption. And instead of empowering it, they did exactly the opposite.","1435709192"

Just because you don't have a proper response doesn't make it wrong. Licensing a gun should be even more rigorous than a car because a gun is a weapon. You are even the one who made the comparison. If you disagree, enlighten me on how the constitution has any affect on regulation. What precedent is there? How do you follow that logic?

You're point about murderers being mentally ill isn't true. A lot of them have no prior history. Plenty of killers aren't insane but are enraged or have thought out what to do but are not mentally ill. Many have political or personal reasons and claiming mental health just doesn't work for several mass murders. The law failed us which is why we have so many guns. The other countries don't have as may guns because they have been regulating and control their gun ownership. Again, denying this is being ignorant of facts. Do you know how criminals get their guns? They steal them from people who have  proper licenses, they have a companion who legally can buy guns do it for them, buy from corrupt gun dealers, or they get it on the black market. Regulating and controlling guns would completely limit their access to guns. Just because the issue is huge doesn't mean we should keep having laws, or lack thereof, that don't work. Also, appealing to fear isn't viable. Just because we have people who break the laws such as gangs, doesn't give everyone the right to do the same. They are criminals for a reason and the logic that because professional criminals have guns we should too is ridiculous. Other countries have violent groups yet have severely limited gun violence compared to the US. The reason is our gun laws, as that is the only major difference between the United states ans the rest of the world. Other countries regulate guns which make it harder for criminals to get access.

The LS1 powered Camaros and Trans AMs are great and they have a huge aftermarket. I ridden in a 98 Trans am and I didn't think the interior was too cramped (roomier than my 1986 Camaro's interior).
I originally wanted a 4th Gen Camaro two years ago but couldn't find one in a decent price range so I brought an 86 Camaro IROC Z instead. 
I love the lowend power and the raw torque my Camaro provides. In the future I want to get either an LS1 or a 350 crate engine and build it as an all out drag car.","1435709194"

I actually disagree with this portion, while Patriarchy is a much more intimate relation than Colonialism and Capitalism (the family, intimacy is gendered, people are gendered at birth ect.) and Patriarchy makes people love their gender identification that does not mean this is wholly good. 

Of course it is ultra-leftist to attack people for their gender identification. We do still have to realize that it is still a product of a Colonial Patriarchal society that created genders (male and female) in order to have a dominant gendered class and a subordinate. The fact that Patriarchy makes us love our gender oppression does not mean this gender it assigns and influences us to identify with can go without criticism itself. That is still a product of Patriarchal oppression, even though pointing out the real life consequences of this all the time would be ultra-leftism.","1435709200"

I was talking about people with no particular theological or spiritual convictions who nonetheless have continued attending church for years because that's what decent people do, it's how they were raised, social pressure, family pressure, or what have you. People who unconsciously absorb their values and norms from the surrounding culture and who may, for now, feel a little uneasy about gay people, but in the end will support gay marriage and admitting gay people as members because it would be embarrassing to do otherwise.

Edit: Personal anecdote that may not be interesting..

Actually my grandmother is a great example of the kind of church-goer I'm talking about. She absolutely considered herself first of all a ""decent person"" and a Christian second.

She was on a committee at her church that gave every graduating senior in the small town where she lived a bible. One year, she told me, they decided to give the Catholic kids Catholic bibles. That made sense to everyone. Then someone remembered that one of the students was Japanese and there on exchange, and she was Buddhist. They realized that if they were going to give the Protestant kids Protestant bibles and the Catholic kids Catholic bibles, maybe they should give her something that she would like, too. So they decided to give her a book about photography, because someone had heard she was interested in that. My grandmother could never quite understand why the pastor didn't agree with the committee that this was all a wonderful and considerate plan.","1435709200"

Nothing really.  You might have a harassment claim against an individual for something like contacting you directly in real life repeatedly.  But posting to the internet and not directing it at you is basically inactionable.  

&gt;  I think I have a case against Youtube here for allowing people to profit from using my image, no?

Probably not.  Publicizing and profiting from are two different things.  And if they are wrongfully profiting from use of your image, the claim would be against the person doing it, not youtube.  

&gt; If I cannot get the video removed, how can I best scare those people into removing them?

Nothing truthful because you don't have much of a claim.  You can threaten to sue over what you're talking about, but clearly a) they don't seem to care, b) you haven't had any luck in the past, and c) you don't have a good claim to sue over now.

"alberta","t5_2qxon","There's an Edmonton Journal article now. The minister's spokesperson said they can't comment for legal reasons which is probably true. 

Assuming he was pardoned he technically doesn't have a criminal record. It's actually illegal when hiring someone to ask them if they have a record that was pardoned and illegal to not hire someone based on a pardoned offence (assuming the government even knew). It's also illegal in most cases for employers (including the government) to specifically comment about an employee like Ezra is demanding. Ezra may be annoying, but he's smart and a lawyer and he knows this. He knows that the government can't say anything about this. 

Why he was given a pardon? I don't know. It used to be fairly easy to get one (it changed recently under Harper and they're called ""record suspensions"" now instead of pardons). It used to be that after committing some offences, serving your sentence and spending a few years without committing any new offences you could apply for a pardon. The Parole Board would look at your offence, look at how you've changed your life since then etc and decide whether to give you one or not. If you got one you technically don't have a record and if an employer asks if you have a criminal record you can legally answer no. ","1435709206"

&gt;If I can think of instances where a belief in God results in murder or bigotry, then I must concede that no, a belief in God does not maximize Love.

This seems to indicate that religion fails the ""universal love test"" because it has caused at least some serious negative consequences. This is an unfair standard, since we can certainly think of at least one negative consequence to *every* situation.

For example, if we were to apply this same standard to homosexuality, it might look something like this:

&gt;If I can think of instances where homosexuality results in pedophilia or the spread of serious disease, then I must concede that no, homosexuality does not maximize Love.

---

Note as well that YOUR analysis of homosexuality seems very different:

&gt;If homosexuality doesn't result in decreased love in the world, it's immoral to oppose two same-sex ppl forming a life together.

In this case your standard is ""does it result in decreased love?"" This is very different than asking if it carries any serious negative consequences with it.

---

Finally, I would be terrified of your use of the word ""majority.""

&gt;Majority would agree  
&gt;Majority recognize it as love

By this standard, [up until 2009](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/support-for-gay-marriage-outweighs-opposition-in-polls/), homosexual marriage in America would been considered immoral, since more than half of Americans believed it was bad.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","&gt; When did it become an expectation that people have bank accounts?

There are mechanisms besides bank accounts that allow people to save - and even invest - money in insured forms while not having it completely and utterly vulnerable to common burglary, theft, or loss.

&gt;It makes no financial sense to have large amounts of cash (you're missing out on that sweet 0.1% interest), but it is not unheard of at all.

If we agree that it is irrational then we must only remember that some people are irrational, and unless he grew up under a rock, has only himself to blame for his choices.

&gt;Yeah..but grey markets are legal. Illicit dealings is an edge case too.

(I checked and I meant Gray economy, which refers specifically to employment outside the scope of government purview).

On that note, it is entirely illegal.

Illicit dealings are also often illegal - That's one part of what illicit means. I struggle to think of an illicit, legal, use for thousands of dollars in cash.

&gt;Most buyers will carry small denominations. Also, there is no evidence he is a seller. ALL money has drugs residue, and without supplementary evidence the police are wrong.

But the money didn't have drug residue (or was not entered as evidence as such), but his BAGGAGE. Which is a key difference, and apparently convinced a judge beyond a preponderance of evidence.

&gt;WELCOME TO PAPER MONEY. This is an issue with ALL money. Should you arrest me? I carry $100 bills all the time.

Unless you're carrying that money somewhere where it worth an order of magnitude more, no, that's not really suspicious. $11,000 sends up incredibly large red flags. A few hundred dollars (or even a thousand) is a grocery trip and other things, and is a rational amount of cash! But nobody is going to buy $11,000 worth of groceries.

&gt;For the reasons mentioned above, it is not.

For the reasons mentioned above, it is!

&gt;Now, I'm all for gun control (look at my username for more hints at my politics), but people carrying rifles do it for other reasons...
&gt;Very few actual crimes are committed by people open carrying rifles.

Tangential, I just thought that was a nice analogy. I cannot foresee a reason to reason to carry around $11,000 in cash, and neither can a court, apparently.","1435709208"

Some hopped in because it was a major pushback against SJWs. Some hopped in because they saw it as a pushback against the left in general. Some hopped in because they saw it as a pushback against feminism, and they think feminism is awful.

I think most are involved because they think there's something supremely wrong with games journalism and/or the industry as a whole. A lot of folks think that stuff in the first paragraph is at the core of what's wrong with games journalism/the industry.

I initially was in it purely because I love vidya, I'm a gamer, and the shit they said about gamers pissed me off. I also have consistently gotten annoyed at critique of games that seems fundamentally flawed. Regardless of who's saying it, deeply flawed critique should be called out as deeply flawed, and calling people bigots of various sorts for participating in that critique is bullshit.

Tim Hunt pushed me over the edge a bit. I do want SJWs to just sort of fuck off now. A bunch of ass holes got a Nobel laureate sacked over some jokes poking fun at misogyny. He's done solid research, and has helped others do the same. He's helped a lot of women in the industry.

Basically Target and KMart didn't register their copyright in Austraila and so anyone could use those names.

"SupernaturalTV","t5_31dbj","The ratings difference, btw, only occurs for eps whose *promos* show Cas interacting with Dean. If the promo does not show Cas, there is no Cas effect at all; if it shows Cas but not interacting with Dean, there's only a minimal effect. (several episodes with Cas have not shown him in the promo.)

That analysis also excluded premieres, finales amd week 6. Week 6 usually has a ratings bump no matter what the episode is about or who is in it (I think it's because that's the last week that the premiere is available on the CW site, so [I theorize] you get a lot of people catching up that week.) Those cases excluded though, Cas does seem to have a real effect on ratings. Of course there's individual episode variation on top of that - no one factor will ever explain 100% of ratings variation and there is definitely substantial noise in the data. But this does seem to be a factor that has some effect. 

BTW I've analyzed the data a lot of other ways and the most important factors, in decreasing order, seem to be: (1) air date (ratings are declining over time). Air date is the biggest effect. (2) Whether or not the episode is Premiere/Finale/Week-6. (3) presence of Castiel in the promo and whether he interacts with Dean in the promo. (4) Show writer. (Some viewers appear to be avoiding Buckner/Ross-Leming.) So, for example, you do have to control for factors 1&amp;2 before you can see the effect of factor 3. 

I thought MOTV vs mytharc would have a major effect, btw, but it turns out it doesn't.

Still haven't had a chance though to throw these all into the same big mixed-model. If you've got a better statistical model,  I'd love to see it! ","1435709212"

A high performance motorcycle engine can rev to the moon, and that's how they make their large HP numbers (13K+ redline isn't out of the ordinary for a performance motorcycle). This comes at a cost of Torque (making roughly half the HP rating in Lbs/Ft, so a 190HP bike would have around 80Lb/Ft of torque).

Black &amp; White having current makes sense because the black isn't a switched leg. Have you tried testing white &amp; red for current with the wall switch in the on &amp; off positions? White &amp; red should have current if the switch is in the on position. 

Have you touched the switch yet? Did the previous light fixture work with this switch? You may try bypassing the switch (wire the red &amp; black wires in the switch box together) and then testing to see if you get current on the red &amp; white wires in the ceiling box.

I am just floored sometimes by the simplistic logic of the left that post here on reddit. (not the left in general as most intelligent people ""get it"")

NONE of you actually know why the USA goes to war ""for oil"".  None of you can seemingly grasp it.  It's like I am in a room of teenagers.

***Simply put:***

The USA goes to ""war"" to protect their interests, those interests include keeping the world economy going.  We can survive on just ""our"" oil, but we cannot survive if a bunch of *other* economies collapse. It is a complicated game of thrones. It is not simply stealing someone's oil. And oil isn't the only reason we do things. The ONLY reason we do things is because it is in the best interests of the United States and our way of life.  You can disagree with the defined way of life, you can disagree on the need to protect it, but you cannot, (if you're halfway intelligent) simply say it's ""war for oil"".  Greece's problems recently tanked our markets... what would happen if say one or two countries were taken over, or wars started without our involvement.  The world is global now.. nothing can happen that doesn't have an affect on ""western"" nations. The USA makes serious missteps no doubt, but it is never actually ""war for oil"".

"anime","t5_2qh22","So, just this week I've finished my rewatch of Hanasaku Iroha and... can I just gush over how amazing the series is? 

It's going to contain some spoilers and I will mostly gush over stuff, that I didn't get to gush over in my [WT](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/34vt9u/wt_hanasaku_iroha/). 

* There's so much good about the series. The visuals are incredible. Backgrounds are [vivid](http://i.imgur.com/jj4ttwp.png), varied and [colorful](http://i.imgur.com/JHtaNKC.jpg) with [calm](http://i.imgur.com/stvq5GH.jpg) and [soothing](http://i.imgur.com/bNgkhLk.png) scenery of countryside and [lively, never sleeping buldings of Tokyo](http://i.imgur.com/8Wu3Gxb.jpg). Animation is simply top notch. It's fluid in both the characters and the scenery and it's incredibly expressive, greatly [showing characters' little quirks](http://i.imgur.com/jEZTkIw.gif) and their emotions. [Character designs are also amazing](http://i.imgur.com/qqHUAHe.jpg), with all of them being unique, different and with their appearance portraying their personalities. And that food. Just look at that food!

* Music is incredible! Both OPs are sang by an amazing band Nano.Ripe with visuals perfectly showing the very chaotic and busy nature of Kissuiso. Soundtrack itself is very slow, calm, and, what you might call, rural, with a lot of string compositions.

* And characters! Ohmygod the characters! In my WT I kinda sidelined most of them, with the exception of Ohana, but now I'd like to say a bit about every one of them.

[Minko!](http://i.imgur.com/7rx4DbT.jpg) It took me awhile to warm up to you. You were agressive, harsh and on occassion even violent towards Ohana! But as time went on and you clashed more with Ohana, you started exposing your very hardworking and dedicated core. I mean, a 17 year old girl, who already decided what her dream is and who follows that dream with such a fervor is worthy of admiration! And let's not forget your invention of one of the greatest anime insults in history.

[Nako!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r3CiBa0uvAM/TkDTRMWUcDI/AAAAAAAAATI/trNdKrRJPgg/s1600/hanasaku-iroha-1810.png) Oh beautiful Nako. How foolish I was thinking that you are just a shy wallflower. In reality you are a kick-ass older sister, who takes care of a bunch of younger siblings and two aloof parents. Oh yeah! You're also a professional freaking swimmer who's not afraid to JUMP FROM A CLIFF into the water to save some guy. Your comparisson of your house and Kissuiso being an ocean where you can swim freely was nothing short of brilliant.

[Toru!](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/113420.jpg) Boy, you came across as an asshole sometimes with your demands for the best work. But you were also a surprisingly caring and understanding individual, willing to leave the wedding of your friend to help out the inn. Your interactions with Ohana and Minko really demonstrated two aspects of your personality.
 
[Ren-san!](http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee515/yumekichi112/HorribleSubsHanasakuIroha-18720pmkv_snapshot_1808_20110731_190633.jpg) You are such a lovable dork! Beyond your rough appearance hides a vulnerable and gentle soul with a very questionable taste in fashion.

[Tomoe!](https://36.media.tumblr.com/21c237943d0ee7bfc032118d077dc5a2/tumblr_na5cjnVvZx1tvkp4vo1_1280.jpg) How can you not love Tomoe with her energetic and friendly nature and willingness to do some hilarious things just to get fired! 

[Denroku!](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/hanasakuiroha/images/7/73/Denroku_Sukegawa_prof.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110928155234) You are the kindest, the calmest and the most understanding soul in Kissuiso. Always calm, always collected and always willing to give that very subtle, but needed, push with just a few words. 

[Tarou!](https://static.hummingbird.me/characters/images/000/032/543/original/32543.jpg?1416229685) It's funny how someone as helpless and useless like you, managed to inspire so many people. And your usual antics definitely did make life in Kissuiso a bit more energetic.

[Takako!](http://geekrevolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Takako-Hanasaku-Iroha-Ep.-17.jpg) Even though initially you appeared to be nothing but a nuisance to Kissuiso, you soon revealed yourself to be a very dedicated, very caring and very hard working woman. A hard working woman who can Judo throw a guy at least two times heavier than you! Fuck yeah Takako!

[Enishi!](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/hanasakuiroha/images/a/ac/Hanasaku_Iroha_01_Uncle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110912125709) You were the first who was unconditionally friendly to Ohana and that made me really love you. Your awkward dedication to Kissuiso, your willingness to try new things and your acceptance of your own shortcomings just reinforced my love. 

[Satsuki!](https://ultimatemegax.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/irohabd0371.jpg) You are definitely one of the more complicated characters in the show. Even if your actions towards Ohana were questionable, one could stil see that you really does care about your daughter. You just don't know how to show that. It feels like, when you were raising Ohana, that the only thing you was worried about was not to be like your own mother. So you allowed Ohana to be free. To grow and fend for herself, while you tried to work and support your daughter. Your admitance of your mistakes and reconciliation with both Ohana and Sui only demonstrated how much Ohana's journey to Kissuiso affected you.

And, finally, [Sui](https://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hanasaku_iroha-21-sui-madam_manager-happy-smile-sunny-torii.jpg). What an incredible character you are. You are harsh, but fair. You are strict, but you always follow your own rules. You are demanding, but you also always reward the hard work appropriately. You are stern and unyielding, but you are also frail and traped in your past. Your interactions with Ohana and the staff of Kissuiso only highlighted the different sides of your personality. Not to mention how, in reality, wise was your decision to close down Kissuiso. You know, like no one else, how hard it is to run an inn. You know that Enishi is not prepared for that yet. You know that taking away Ohana's, Nako's and Minko's choice for their future is just selfish as they simply didn't experience all that the life has to offer. And your final farewell to both the Kissuiso and Ohana will always stay in my heart.

* And I didn't even mention how amazingly it portrays Ohana's personal journey. It was a pure joy to watch Ohana find herself. As she learned more about her family, about the inn, about people that surround her, Ohana herself, started thinking. Why do I work? Do I enjoy work? Am I being fair? Am I a good person? What am I going to do next? What do I WANT to do next? Seeing Ohana slowly find answer after answer, seeing her one cautious step after another, made you really, REALLY appreciate her as a character. 

In short: Hanasaku Iroha is simply incredible. It's a decent comedy, a varied romance and an eyecandy. But most of all, Hanasaku Iroha is an incredible personal journey of a very unique girl in a living, breathing and working environment of traditional Japanese inn. If you want to see that girl grow, learn, stumble, have fun and befriend, earn respect and change lives of multiple unusual people, you should give Hanasaku Iroha a go.

[Thank you, Kissuiso.](http://i.imgur.com/D39ayNM.jpg)","1435709216"

All you can do is try. 


I was playing league of legends at a semi-pro level, but the team split up because of 1 person not being dedicated to the team, who went to his summer house the weekend before LCS qualifiers when we were supposed to really practice hard. 

Honestly, we wouldn't have been that close to qualifying, but we beat some decent teams in scrims etc and it would have been fun and good to get some publicity. 


The hard part about finding a team is that you need to get along with the members, but you also need to be on the same page when it comes to goals and dedication.

When I first got my dog (rescued from an owner that got him because their parents passed away), I was WAY overwelmed with the actual nature of responsibility it entailed. I ALMOST gave him back but I'm so glad I didn't because he's been the best dog anyone could ask for BUT if I was in your shoes, no way would I have done it. It's a LOT of work. Don't get me wrong, can be a lot of fun but a ton of restrictions that having a dog can place on your life and they are not cheap.

You have completely misunderstood or misconstrued any discussion about performance from the start and are upset about a phantom slight. Nobody is mad about low KD players wanting to play server smash. Everyone with a brain is mad about bad players making excuses and wanting to continue. There is a world of difference.

Everyone who is good at this game started out way worse then they are right now. Everyone was bad. The frustrating difference between a bad player and a good player is that good players look at situations where they get shitstomped and improve, but bad players look at it and make excuses. Excuses like ""my stats are bad because I play x way"" or ""those guys who didn't play lost us the game"".

It's not about KD. It's about a group and culture of players who refuse to see reality even when faced with stark statistical proof and experience. Why would people want to play with teammates like that?

I raised my hand. I could keep a simple secret. Besides, I’m sure it wasn’t that big anyway. “On my honor, I will never tell.”

The maiden, Eleanor, smiled. Or at least I think she did. It was very hard to see in the dark broom closet.

“Good, thank you Sir Edipum. I am going to kill the Lord and Lady of Glenfareach.”

This is not what I signed up for. 

“Hold on, you plan to murder the Great Rulers? But why? They have brought nothing but peace to our land!”

“Keep your voice down! They might have brought peace, but it came with huge taxations for the working class, like I and my kinsmen. The Lord and Lady have infected Glenfareach with their social hierarchy and warring peace. We we’re better off before they came.”

“That is nonsense. What about I? I pay taxes and fight for my land, I have done nothing but benefit from their rule!”

“You are one of 20 knights, the best warriors of Glenfareach. AND you’re the prince. You are given everything you want.”

She put a hand over my mouth as I was about to respond. We sat silently in the darkness while an old man passed our hiding place. When he was out of earshot, Eleanor uncovered my mouth and spoke quickly.

“Listen, if you won’t help me, then at least stay out of my way. You only get to know all of this because you we’re stalking me, remember?” I nodded, and she slipped out of the closet. A few minutes later, I left as well. 

I can’t say I’m upset about the assassination plan, the Lord and Lady are horrible parents. They were never around for me, always caught up with politics. I’ve had to learn everything through my mentor, Marlin. He was more of a father to me anyway. For the moment, I decided to do nothing, let the events play out. I needed time, and a drink, to think. 

Eight mugs of Ale and three fistfights later, I was sitting in my chambers, being attended by the Royal nurse. As soon as she was done, I shooed her off. My trip to the pub hadn’t solved anything. I need something to cheer me up. I needed to see Eleanor. 

Sneaking out of the room, I threw a robe over my royal clothes and headed to the market. I had spent a lot of time here, watching Eleanor do personal shopping for the Lady, since she was her handmaid. Before long, I had spotted her. 

She was dressed in the same clothes as before, a brown dress with white lace. She had saved a long time to buy that dress. I know, I watched her count her money. As she completed her shopping, I felt a growing pain in my chest, something not like the pierce of a sword nor the burn of a coal, but a deep ache that comes from the soul. My throat was dry, my stomach was tumbling, and there was something hard between my legs; I had forgotten to leave my sword in my chambers.

I left a little while later, I needed to meet Marlin for my evening lessons. I tried to keep Eleanor in my sight for as long as I could, but we eventually parted. By the time I had reached Marlin’s chambers, I know the answer to Eleanor’s question. I was going to help her kill the Lord and Lady.

Yeah its looking pretty good for us, especially after last season. Feels like we are making a lot of moves in the right direction. Got rid of a lot of the squad, most of which were very unimpressive players at best, and feels like we ditched a lot of the conference mediocratity. We hung on to the players we needed too aswell, which is really nice to see.

A lot of nice signings coming in upfront, including our star striker from the conference coming back to us from birmingham. He's had a couple of injuries but hoping he can still perform. Pretty much every knew signing has said there really impressed with the managers vision and plans for the future, which is always nice to hear

The only real worry is the depth, we let a lot of players go and I'm not entirely sure we have brought enough to fill the gaps they left, but I'm still optimistic we can be competing at the opposite end of the table this season. ","1435709222"

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","&gt; and i put the fault on blizzard that never tried to balance it correctly

Huh? They changed its % reduction a bunch of times, spread it out to other classes (and then took it away), and possibly changed it in other ways I don't know since I haven't kept up with wow.

&gt; what i was thinking was not a permanent debuff

Neither is mortal strike (or the mortal wounds debuff) in wow.

&gt; while mortal wounds stay up forever

[Wowhead says it's 10 seconds](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=115804/mortal-wounds).

&gt; 5 seconds you get 50% less heal

Again, the existence of the debuff creates balance problems of its own. If it's the only way to kill people in the presence of a healer then it becomes mandatory, and then you need to balance around always having a hero with mortal strike on a team. Then heroes who don't bring mortal strike are devalued, so they need to be buffed in other ways, like just doing a ton of damage, which if you *do* have mortal strike on a team becomes OP. If the debuff becomes mandatory it's limits possible comps, and since healers will be balanced around mortal strike existing, if you don't have it healers will be OP

In short: mortal strike *creates* more problems than it solves, and it's better to just balance healing and damage across the board without having to worry about a mortal strike debuff.","1435709222"

Semantically, 欲で汚い doesn't sound natural.  If I had to interpret it somehow, it would be ""to be greedy.""  [汚い](http://ejje.weblio.jp/content/%E6%B1%9A%E3%81%84) can mean 「けち」 and is almost the same as 'greedy' depending on context.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx"," I've got 45 games with Irelia in rankeds this season and almost 100 or so in normals.

In lane, you max E first and then I usually max W. Try harassing while farming. If they trade first, you just use your E and stun them, get a couple AAs with the W activated on them and you usually win the trade. Depending on the amount of damage you do from that trade, you can decide if you have enough dmg to kill him or not. If you do, Q onto him and repeat. E and W autoattacking. 

Even though you can get some kills at lvl 3, I usually player her safe and don't go all in until I have at least a Sheen or a Phage. When you finish the TF, go all in as you will get the kill 9/10 times if your enemy isn't fed. Irelias early game is okey and her late game kinda falls off, but her mid game might be one of the best in the game.

After finishing TF I usually get a Frozen Heart and then a Spirit Visage. If their team is not that fed or if I'm crushing my lane, I'd go for a Maw of Malmortius. It all depends on the situation. Also, don't get BotRK on her. I don't think it's a good item on her and it's kinda a noob trap. Irelia is a tanky bruiser if it's built full tank, and her damage in mid game is crazy even if you go full tank but if you go full AD, it will still have mediocre damage compared to other bruiser that scale better into the late game like Riven. An underrated item with her it's Zephyr. With TF and Zephyr you don't even need boots, so you can get one more tank or AD item, so there's that. 

When it comes to teamfighting, it depends. She has 2 different roles depending on when the teamfight happens.
If the teamfight is in mid game and you have the Trinity completed, you just destroy everyone. Seriously, don't underestimate her power, it's crazy. You can blow up their ADC and mid and even their jungler if he is not that tanky.
If the teamfight happens in late game, you take a more utility role. I won a ranked playing 4v5 when I was duoing wiht a friend and he was playing as ADC, so basically I built full tank except for the Trinity and focused their carry. Q onto their carry, E him and start autoattacking. Always use W before ulting so you get that nice active.","1435709224"

But do we have more knowledge about our subject area than the average person? Most definitely. 

Now, my PhD smarts don't translate into smarts in other fields (good gods don't ask me anything about literature, engineering, finance, or law), but they do aid me in knowing how to learn other fields when the time comes.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I think this is ignorant. I think OP is trying to do adoption right, and not love or care for anyone less than another. If your blood daughter turns into a shitheap of a person, would you drop them before exhausting all means of trying to get help? No. I should hope not.

Alice needs to go to counseling with or without Joan, who I don't blame for not giving a fuck about being there. But if OP wants to go she should go. The number one priority is trying to get Alice to counseling and figure out if she's a narcissist or has attachment disorder or whatever. She probably won't accept help and stop sucking, but she might. And I think it's respectable of OP for trying to love her regardless in the meantime.

I think all the comments saying ""choose your daughter!"" and ""OP has a savior complex!"" are missing the point in a way. OP says she adopted her. To OP, Alice is her daughter and it's going to be hard for her to just cut and run because have you ever seen parents of a narcissistic person just immediately dump their child for being a narc? Or children of narcissists for that matter? Alice is her family, blood or not. It's going to be hard to jump ship and get over it. Joan deserves to be accommodated for what she is going through, no doubt at all. Alice is a horrible person. OP is trying to love both of her daughters.","1435709227"

"anime","t5_2qh22","I'm going to voice a minority opinion here: While I enjoyed watching the show for it was, it bored me at times. I did not play in a band when I was in school, so perhaps I don't wax nostalgic about band camaraderie like some do when they watch this show. 

The focus of the show seems to center on a group of people practicing hard to achieve a lofty goal - and while it appears that many people enjoyed it; that part of it bored me a lot. Watching people practice instruments and struggling at it is a pretty banal activity to watch, and a majority of this show's airtime was dedicated to that. I wish the characters were fleshed out a bit more through other activities outside of the band - but the process of watching people play instruments just didn't sit that well with regards to my personal entertainment. 

Though I give Hibike props for its realism and animation, though.

* There is still overtime. As long as you have tower it'll keep going.
* When neutral (no one on tower) it'll automatically go back to center.
* How far you are from the end is remembered and it goes faster to get to that point again and then goes back to normal speed once you reach it.
* You only need to be on the tower to make it move. Doesn't have to be covered in ink (recommended though).
* Since tower moves, enemy paint is everywhere so you constantly have to repaint to travel. I think this gives roller a travel advantage.
* Chargers are good at preventing the tower from advancing. Don't think they are good for riding the tower.","1435709228"

It's the same sentiment echoed on that recent podcast you were cherrypicking. Diverting slightly from the DDA sucks for *some* folks with very specific expectations, but it's also great for a huge number of players. I personally don't mind at all how FD is communicating, they have tricks up their sleeves but don't feel the need to dangle the carrot in front of us until it's time.

Personally: I never expected the DDA to be strictly adhered to, but I come from a development background where 'reality &gt; emotion'. In the end, I'm happy with the development choice of 'expanding the audience for additional income' vs. 'nickel-and-diming us to death' as other studios do. I think the method is pushing back older plans slightly, but stays true to FDev's 'building the core first' dev methodology.

Just because someone will temporarily let the debt stay high doesn't mean they aren't going to plan to pay it off.

Bernie's plan generates 6 trillion in extra taxes in 10 years without significantly increasing(if at all) spending that isn't accounted for by another tax on the top 0.3%.  That's a third of our debt that was generated in 14 years paid off over 10 at least, and puts us down to more reasonable levels.

2. When did I ever say tanks/cc didn't require follow up from their team? Tanks make an AD's life miserable in teamfights and 1v1's. A point and click Naut R at least puts you out of the fight for a huge period of time, and if it's followed up on results in your death with absolutely zero counterplay.

3. Of course, one of the two team's ADC is going to survive and clean up. The problem being, the ADC that does go ahead to get that quadra kill (by the way I don't think measuring a roles power through their ability to gain superfluous multi-kills after a fight is decided makes much sense) is alive only because they didn't get rolled over by tanks/cc because their team managed to do it first. It's very rarely about how well they performed prior to that fight or how fed they are because their ability to output damage almost entirely rests on their teammates. 

4. ""you're simultaneously the best at achieving the actual objective of the game (destroy a line of enemy turrets leading to an inhib, then nexus turrets, then the nexus itself)"". Yeah, ADCs are good at auto-attacking turrets. Great. Too bad by in large this only occurs as a reward from a successful engagement/fight which involves the aforementioned problems with the role in the tank meta.

Remember, it's extremely hard to have game influence outside of team fights. It's hard to make picks solo since there a few targets that can be 1v1'd right now. Frankly you won't want to because it's just so imperative to confine yourself to farming the whole game to try and combat the tanks.","1435709241"

The most important thing to realize is that a strong reaction to the word serves the purpose of telling the user that it's not okay to use the word. Typically, they won't learn this from their social circle so it needs to come from outside. It's more realistic than your position which, though great in theory, is basically impossible to implement while things like the shooting in Charleston still happen.","1435709247"

If a pistol counts as a cc weapon in assault then he is wondering if some of attacks have to be made as regular cc weapon attacks or if they all benefit from the profile of the superior weapon.

 You aren't going to impress me with having played this game for a while. A lot of people have, most of us here included.

The other thing that I'd like to point out is that for many, giving up a citizenship is a bad idea. It not only costs the fee, but means giving up your rights to work or live in the US in the future, and can be especially painful if you have a lot of family in the US.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","A big part of the problem is that  **Armor = Toughness + Defense**, so Defense is literally the same as Toughness. Ascended Armor has a higher base Defense than Exotic, Exotic is higher that Rare, and so on. That means by having Ascended Armor you've already got a big clump of extra Armor without any choice in the matter. The really annoying thing about Ascended Armor is that it has 5% more Defense, which is added to your Toughness and ends up being only a 1-3% boost (sad), and makes additional Toughness worth even less in terms of damage reduction (since Toughness + Defense = Armor, and Incoming/Armor=Damage taken).

To put it another way:

Damage taken = Incoming / (Defense + Toughness)

So if you have 1000 Defense and 1000 Toughness making up your Armor stat (2000 total), then get 50% more Toughness (total of 1500), you only got 25% more Armor (total of 2500), which is the damage reduction. Don't forget, Heavies have more base Defense on their armor, so Toughness is worth even less to them.

Then, assuming you're still on the non-zerk training wheels of T/V/H, you have to look at Vitality and Healing. Healing scales pretty poorly and is generally not needed, although some people like it, and it really depends on the skills you're using since they each use Healing at different percentages (usually XXX heal + 0.XX * Healing).

If you're considering Vitality, you need to look at the base health of each class. Guardian, as a Heavy, already has a ton of Armor from the high Defense stat on Heavy armor. Vitality is definitely a good choice on this class. 300 Vitality gives you around 25% more health, where 300 Toughness would only reduce damage by around half that. Of course, the extra health is only good if you can heal back up on it during a longer fight, and luckily decent Guardians would be overhealing their tiny health pool anyway (even without Healing Power).

It gets more complicated from there, just use your best judgement on your class and build.","1435709256"

Another time, I was out scouting for a place to hide another cache, and there were a couple of archived caches within proximity of where I was. At the time however I wasn't even thinking about them, and on a whim looked in a guard rail. Lo and behold, there was a tiny nano!

I'd also suggest that there's a lot more [to the history of that enumerated right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution ) than you're making it out to be. It's based in centuries of history in both the colonies and Britain. Also keep in mind that many of the founders assembled for the crafting of the Constitution had been active in the Revolutionary movement just years prior. That very same movement had been born primarily of individual citizens. 

On April 19th, 1775 it's absolutely true that the first shots of the war came from the meeting of the Lexington Minutemen (a militia) and the British Regulars who'd marched from Boston. However, the colonists had been alerted by private citizens, and it was private citizens who turned out at the call of powder alarm to join the Lexington and Concord militias as they harried the Regulars during the retreat all the way back to Boston.

When the Best Buy deal was announced, preorderers were assured they'd get theirs first. Many didn't and international backers didn't have the option of jumping the preorder ship and waltzing in to the nearest Best Buy (being a point you made, not me).

"anime","t5_2qh22","Same show, different day! Welcome, everyone, to another week of */u/LordTakuro's Hero Club Weekly Write-Ups!* We're onto Week 3 of my series on the Five Tenets of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club. This week, we're taking a look at one of the more obscure and harder to notice of the Hero Club's tenets. Let's get this show on the road:

*#3: Sleep well, eat well*

This one is probably the most simple, straightforward out of the five tenets in terms of application. The Hero Club's third tenet tells it's members to always make sure to eat well, keeping themselves energized and ready to go, and sleep well, always making sure to get a good night's sleep and be well-rested. This was easily the hardest to research and pick examples out of all the Tenets, due to it's broad directive and application. I was actually having a really hard time finding examples of  “sleep well”, so if anyone can think of some, feel free to leave a comment and I'll edit it in and give you credit. Without any further ado, let's get into the meat of our show today, shall we?

My first example and, imo, arguably the most prevalent comes to us through Fuu. In early episodes of *Yuki Yuna is a Hero*, Fuu is shown to be very partial to udon (a thick wheat type of noodle, prevalently used in soups), with one of the Hero Club's regular stops after school being a local udon shop. Fuu is a regular customer at the shop and stops there often, eating anywhere up to three or four bowls in one sitting. Fuu claims the udon to give her “girl power”, which Fuu claims to be a driving source of her power and energy. Fuu is often one of the most energetic of the group, and is able to be so by keeping herself well-nourished and giving herself the necessary energy to fight the Vertexes. (On a side-note, Fuu also serves as care-taker and guardian for Itsuki, making sure to keep her younger sister well-nourished and well-rested)

My second example comes to us through Togo and her snacks that she brings to the Hero Club, [much to the excitement of Yuna](http://imgur.com/UKRtgmO). [Slight Ep. 10 Spoilers](/s ""Togo's snacks were one of the first things she bonded with Yuna, her eventual best friend, over after moving next door to Yuna""). Togo regularly brings these snacks with her to the Hero Club's after-school meetings, sharing them with the other members of the club. This sharing and thought on Togo's part helps to keep herself and her friends nourished through the day (and they keep Yuna happy).

My final example comes from Episode 4 [Ep. 4 Spoilers](/s ""and the Hero Club helping Itsuki to prepare for her impending singing test. The last example comes to us through Karin who, looking to help Itsuki through her own methods, brings to the club room a variety of vitamins, foods, and drinks in order to keep Itsuki in top shape for the test. These snacks and other medicinal items include Magnesium and Apple Cider in order to improve Itsuki's lungs and voice production, Vitamins to improve bloodflow and prevent sore throats, co-enzymes which help with throat muscle activity, and olive oil and honey which are soothing to the throat. Karin brings these snacks and medicinal items to the Hero Club, so shortly after joining the club, in order to help her fellow club member, Itsuki, remain healthy and strong for her singing test"")

That pretty much brings a close to this week's *Hero Club Write-Up*. This was easily the hardest of my write-ups so far, seeing as it's such a general term and it's the tenet with, most likely, the least accentuation and presence in the series. Nonetheless, it was fun to remember all these little things from the show that helped create this week's write-up. Thanks to everyone who helped and gave me advice for this week's write-up, the help was definitely appreciated and next week's will probably be much better, given it's uses throughout the series. Got any thoughts, comments, questions? Want to just talk about anything Yuki Yuna? Comment or PM me, as many will tell you, I'm always happy to talk about YuYuYu. Hope you enjoyed this week's write-up, and be sure to join us next week when we'll take a look at the fourth Tenet: *""If you're troubled, talk to someone""*

EDIT: I also just noticed something added to the header of this thread

"spacex","t5_2srow","That statement by Shotwell does not stand alone. Musk mentioned around 2010 or 2011, that the Falcon 9 has many more strain gauges and other sensors built into the rocket than has ever been done before. Because of the fiberoptic ethernet and advanced computers, that data could be collected, processed, and transmitted to the ground to improve the design of future rockets, and contribute to man-rating it. I believe Musk said thousands of sensors. I do not know if the number has increased for Falcon 9 v1.1, or if he was not being as specific as Gwynne was in her statement.

I do know that a pressure sensor that weighed ~5 lbs on the original Titan missile, was changed to solid state and reduced to ~5 grams by 1975. By now a similar sensor should be only a few milligrams. The cost has gone down from hundreds of dollars, to pennies. The same goes for almost every kind of sensor a rocket should have. Engines have gone from having a dozen or so sensors to having between 50 and 100. (Sorry, I don't have a source.)

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","The problem is that Luke claims that Jesus was born during a census while [Quirinius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinius) was governor of Syria. That census was in 6 CE, 10 years after the death of Herodus the Great in 4 BCE. 

Here's a timeline:

4 BCE: Herod the Great dies. His kingdom is split in 4 pieces. His son [Herod Archelaus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Archelaus) becomes tetrarch of Judea. Another son, [Herod Antipas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Antipas), becomes the ruler of Galilee. 

6 CE: Herod Archelaus turns out to be a bad king, and the Jews ask the Romans to depose him. The Romans do so. They make Judea a part of the Roman province of Syria and appoint Quirinius as governor of Syria. Quirinius performs a [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius) in Judea. Not in the whole Roman world, as Luke claims. Also not in Galilee, which was still ruled by Herodes Antipas. ","1435709264"

Regarding variable voltage&amp;wattage mods, is it possible to use the voltage or the wattage because it's not within the other's range?
  
The MVP 2 for example does 3.3-5.0V and 6-11W. Let's say I have a 2.0 ohm coil and crank it up to 5 Volts (hypothetical). Does this mean I am firing at 12.5 Watts, or is it still capped at 11 Watts?","1435709266"

I was thinking some kind of extension tube could be made and placed between the heatbreak and nozzle. the tube would have two small holes drilled in the sides (180 deg apart) and a spring placed inside (compressed and then released once inside the tube), with the ends of the spring protruding thru the holes. The holes would be sealed with some high temp RTV or something. then the spring leads could be connected to the sensor. overall i just trying to think about ways to improve the machines so they can be easily used by less technical people. interesting in experimentation and data collecting., not trying to say its a good idea.

First we're talking a average difference of a quarter inch. That doesn't mean much in the greater scheme of things, especially since we have no idea what kind of standard deviation we're talking, since the article didn't include a link to the study, just very small snippets of an interview.

&gt;All his volunteers were between 18 and 35 years old. Rouillon emphasized that although his study spanned many years and included hundreds of women, he in no way claims his sample population is representative of the global population of women.

&gt;""These are preliminary results. The small sample of 320 young women is not representative of the entire population - that would require something like 300,000 subjects.""

Start tracking your calories with something like MyFitnessPal. There's sneaky calories hiding in foods you might not think of as junk (I'm looking at you, muesli/oat bars) and it can be easy to lose track of what you're eating and overeat without realising it. And you can add friends on MyFitnessPal (maybe on other trackers also?) which can help with support and motivation. And there is support here in r/loseit as well.

I also suffer from anxiety and other mental health ills, so I know it makes weight loss (and life in general) just that extra bit harder. But you can do this. I'm on MyFitnessPal so if you start using that, feel free to add me as a friend and maybe we can support each other.","1435709269"

Now, I've seen the Nintendo Gamecube attached by chain to the back of a truck and pulled for a few miles hitting the road and still work after, but that was one hell of a console design- I haven't seen a more durable console since. 

What have the Xbone and PS4 accomplished? I'm hardly a person who buys into the more graphics=better games argument(and besides, my gaming PC outdoes them all for the same cost), but they've sure as hell managed to attract a larger home audience, better critical reception, and far better third party developer support than the WiiU can even dream of.

I'm still not sure why you're putting forth the argument that they cannot and should not match Sony or Microsoft. I think they absolutely could. Nintendo can certainly no longer hold a ruthless vicegrip on the games industry, that's true, but they can certainly do better than they have- acquiring only a few lackluster poor quality ports to their system a year+ later.

Personally, I have much more faith in Nintendo's ability to create relationships with third party developers. They can certainly do it- they just currently don't see the value in doing so. Currently in order to play most of the games that come out, you need to have two consoles- a Nintendo console and a second one. I think that if Nintendo really buckles down with this new NX concept that they could eliminate (or at least reduce) that requirement.

And furthermore, you're painting Nintendo as an underdog here. They're most certainly not. Nintendo holds the distinction of being the world's largest videogame company by revenue, and have over a trillion dollars in assets. That's nothing to shake a stick at. Sure, if Sony and Microsoft decided to dedicate the entirety of their corporate entity to making videogames they could out finance Nintendo by far- but that's just the thing. They won't. They literally cannot do that- they're beholden to shareholders who invest in more than just the company's ability to produce videogames.","1435709269"

I don't work there anymore, but I collected a pretty extensive collection of Kobalt tools that I use regularly on my car.

Life in India for me, was absolute shit. Bribes, garbage everywhere, roads that aren't really roads, politicians who don't give flying fuck about the people, an education system that murders you if you aren't the absolute best. Let's just say the country has issues.

The people in the IT industry typically don't come from villages. They come from cities such as Bangalore. It's true, you'd earn enough and more to live a pretty decent life if you moved back from the States. But don't for a moment think you'd live like a king. Most of the world's perception of Indian cities are wrong.

The truth is, the first world countries have a better standard of living. It's not always about the money. And hardly any relative of mine who lives the States wants to go back. 

My Dad works in the IT industry. We were pretty well off, even in India. But if he worked the same amount in the States, he'd be earning close to 3 times more (after accounting for cost of living). Our family moved in to Canada a couple of years ago, and for the insane amount of experience my parents have in IT, they got amazing jobs. 

At the end of the day, who doesn't want to improve their standard of living? I'd want to give my family the best. And if that means I move to a better country, I'll do it.

"AdvancedRunning","t5_2t1rd","Right at 250 for the month.  A little over 1000 for the year.  Pretty happy because I started from ground zero in December, after a very long term injury.  And Im pain free.

It's time to start really training though.  As of now, I'm all base and strides.  No structure, 'just run baby.'

Goal is a HM in December.  I'm not going to race again in the heat, and anything in the fall will just be tune up for St Jude in December.

So, I'm going to keep doing base, but just structure it.

Comparing between three different structures:

Pfitz 60 MPW in Faster Road Racing.  I'm already at 60mpw, so if I do this, Ill just run the peak week over and over and alternate LT or Strides on Saturday.  I'm not sure I like the amount of hard/easy variation that Pfitz does though.  Does he go overboard with it? It seems like he's wasting half the week, and then prescribes 3 or 4 really tough days.

Daniels Gold Elite plan in DRF.  This looks awesome but Im not sure I can handle all the R and H work.  Might consider the Blue plan, but with more E running to match the time/volume of the Gold plan.

McMillan 'workout base' 7 days in You Only Faster.  This looks the most appealing but I think theres something that I fail to grasp about McMillan.  His easy paces seem absolutely insane to me, and his heart rate zones are completely useless.  I guess I could always run it with Jack's paces, but I really don't like to mix and match like that.

LA is still a hell of a great place to attract free agents and the Spurs have little experience wooing a marquee free agent. Whereas the Lakers are experts at it. 

LMA would like to win, but he also needs a free agency partner. See, he's 30+ and wants to balance income security with leveraging the new salary cap numbers. The Lakers are one of the few teams that have put their money where their mouth is when it comes to rewarding loyal players (see the Kobe extension). This credibility bolster's LA's chance to attract LMA. Whereas the Spurs have continually asked their players to take less and less money as they got older, and were never really willing to pay the tax if they could avoid it.

LMA would also presumably want to live in LA over San Antonio (#churros).

I think the main question will be whether or not we can obtain a center to put alongside him so he doesn't feel like he's got to do the dirty work in the paint all game long. But Robin Lopez would be fine for that. No need to snag Jordan.","1435709276"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Why do you think the CCG cut the funding? It was because the Conservatives are requiring the NHS to save money, aka funding cuts. If the private sector can't manage it, tough - that's what the public sector NHS hospitals have to do. Only Circle's allowed to just run away when things get difficult.

I don't consider a CQC rating of ""inadequate"" as exemplary care. It has improved to ""requires improvement"". That is also not exemplary care.

&gt; However, privatisation, as shown in your own example of Hinchingbrooke Hospital greatly reduced losses compared to the NHS running it alone.

Circle had a cap on the amount of losses it would assume, so the remaining losses have actually been passed back to the taxpayer.

&gt; Meaning the competition doesn't lie between hospitals, it lies in individual hospitals themselves

How do you effectively compete with yourself?

&gt; they have a vested interest to be streamlined to make profit

That doesn't produce exemplary care, that rewards low staffing levels, closure of services, and cherry-picking of easier patient loads.

&gt; This doesn't reward fairly and has no reason to push prices down/drive standards up.
Yes it does. If a private hospital receives a low number of patients, yes it has a reduced potential for profit, but is a lower risk hospital financially, and requires less financial investment.

Hospitals with low income and low patient numbers get regarded as unsustainable and earmarked for closure or merger. That's not low risk. Besides, I didn't say anything at all about lower patient numbers. I don't think a better hospital will have substantially different patient numbers to a worse hospital, because the vast majority of patients will always go to their nearest hospital. This means this is not a driver for competition. Choose and Book exists but it's not that common for people to actually use it.

&gt; It does however for surgery and treatment which will drive standards up.

My nearby hospital is rated as requiring improvement. It's full. The vast majority of people go to their nearest hospital even if there are better ones available.","1435709278"

Gonalons isn't realistic. Ligue 1 teams seemingly can't keep their players due to their finances w/ the exception of PSG, but Lyon offer CL. A simple google search of him shows that he says he'd stay w/ Lyon if they got CL, which they did. 

We'd be taken for a ride with Wanyama. They're inevitably losing Schneiderlin so they're going to make it tough for anybody who comes sniffing for another of their midfielders. I also think he's overrated by a lot of people. 

It's not as easy to get a player of Lucas' caliber. As you say transfers are risky, players sometimes don't transition to new leagues as expected, etc. I think you're heavily downplaying the difficulty of obtaining players who can perform for a club like us, something Lucas has proved to.

Once, long ago, at the heart of the Swordedge, a chorus of seven hundred mages called down a cataclysm to strike their enemies. Their enemies, invaders from Faerie, attempted a countersong. The disaster struck, raining fire, tearing the earth apart, and smashing the two realms together. Both worlds suffered from the proximity of the other, and the things that once existed between the worlds now roamed free, and angry.","1435709286"

[Here](http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/14_12/features/Alpha-Dogs_20416-1.html) is just one of a gazillion articles explaining the dominance theory myth. Even the researcher that first hypothesized the theory has since revoked it.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","&gt; The problem is if your great at teaching but dunno the subject matter then your teaching is fucked isn't it? At high school I found a good 50% of the teachers would just give you a textbook and say ""do chapter 1"". That was literally their teaching method. Perhaps its an issue of not needing to meet certain standards of teaching.

Possibly also the problem of having more subjects than teachers, e.g., you have to provide a biology class but headcount won't allow an extra teacher and your only available ""science"" teacher majored in physics and chemistry - obviously they'll know less than someone formally trained in chemistry but they'll just have to do their best.

I was in classes (e.g., computer studies) where I was ahead of the teacher and sometimes had to lead the class, but then this was the early 90s so the CS teacher was a hobbyist who actually taught something else and got drafted into the role.

Anyway, it's a complicated problem, but I think a lot of people reckon ""I went to school, I know what's wrong with it!"" and then feel obliged to share their reckonings with the world.

&gt; A big problem seemed to just be the quantity of kids in a classroom. I can work with 10 kids and get really good results, you just can't do that with 30 of the fuckers.

Very much so - and in 2012 we were expected to believe that having higher student-teacher ratios would be an improvement.  That got shut down pretty quickly!  As it was, our local school was going to lose something like 7 teachers as they provide the ""manual"" teaching for some other smaller and private schools.  ","1435709288"

Talking from experience the thing that helped me most was being able to talk to people and open up. Have someone that I know I could turn to and they'd try their very best to help me out, and those people quite honestly saved my life.

Depression is beyond serious and in some cases worse than others. You should be so proud of yourself for being there for her. Simply reading that made me have a shit ton of respect for you.

Going off the normal progression they have set, tier 8 would be at 63,000 points.

If you want even more grey morality, perhaps the assassination was organised by a third party rather than the sit in king or the Noble Houses. The sit in king isn't making a power grab but is genuinely trying to do his best with a kingdom that is simmering with tension. They're all blaming each other and he's doing what he can to prevent another civil war.

The noble houses seek to usurp him because they view his policies as tyrannical, and the other factions are too busy bickering among themselves to do anything about him. They realise the North will invade anyway because the kingdom is vulnerable, so they offer them information and aid. In return they get to rule the kingdom, and institute policies which they feel would help the kingdom. It's desperation rather than greed. 

Perhaps the Northerners are behind the assassination. Killing the man who united the kingdoms would cause significant internal tension, making their invasion easier. ","1435709292"

Incorrect.

He says he's still very sexually satisfied-I've encouraged him to masturbate next to me, on me, when he's horny. This morning for instance when I was getting in the shower and he asked if my body could handle sex and it couldn't but I invited him to come watch me shower and he was pretty into it.

Can I ask though, honestly, how sexually satisfied are you? Does it make a difference if your wife wants still wants to find ways to please you or do you have guilt about it?

Sometimes my husband has a hard time finishing and he never did before my health got worse and we've always been a very emotionally connected couple-even when we were friends and I sometimes wonder if it may influence his ability to enjoy getting off when he knows I am in pain or I don't want to try to orgasm because my body can't handle it.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I loved his idea of having different camps spawn at different times in the early game instead of everything at once.

He is correctly in that too much of a complex early game makes for bad design. It's just TOO much stuff going on. Past 5 minutes, the game becomes so fluid that everything is really situational. Of course you're going to have situations where you need to ward objectives and take towers, but that is a regular thing.

The early game is what matters and having a set meta, even though it might feel stale, is what keeps everything organized.

You can deviate from that meta all you want - it might work and it might not, but that is the choice you make. When you have eight billion choices early game, there are way too many variables to take into account.

I used to play a game called Natural Selection 2 that had this same problem: shit was just way too fucking complex. Even the most casual of games - you had to know EVERYTHING. That's why it has a player base of a few thousand, at best. The game is too hard to understand and too complex for new players. It isn't easy to pick up and play, which funnily enough - turns out to be fun.

Smite is a MOBA, I get that. Shit can be complex sometimes and SOME things are set in stone, but this **IS NOT DOTA** nor should it ever be. DOTA is so god damn complex and you have to be a fucking statistician to play that game - fuck that.

Smite should be the go-to casual MOBA because it's fun. It can have a competitive scene, but stop trying to make this game what it isn't. We've been slowly moving towards LOL and DOTA for some time now and this patch I think finally pushed us over the edge.

There are some things we should be doing that those two do - comeback mechanics, different ways of thinking about objectives and warding, etc. But I believe this game **NEEDS** to fit that slot between Heroes of the Storm and LOL - not too complex while not being overly simply.","1435709294"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","While absolutely true, OP is only 21 and his GF is only 23.  That's *young*.  Sure, there are people who know they want to be together for the rest of their lives at that young, but they're relatively rare.  So it's not unexpected that a 21/23 year old couple who started dating at 18/20 would be unmarried.

Normal advice would be never to get married that young, because the chances of divorce are better than 50/50 and divorce is expensive.  This is an unfortunate situation for OP, and hindsight is 20/20 that maybe they're the exception to the rule and should've gotten a quicky courthouse marriage or something, but as you say it's too late.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Simplicity and low maintenance perhaps. I've never heard of liquid or air providing more reliability than the other.

What moves... breaks.  Air cooling system has what to go down?  The fins that are cast into the head somehow snapping off in a way that didn't involve a wreck that totaled the bike?  Earth becoming a vacuum?  The laws of thermodynamics ceasing to function?  None of those are particularly likely.

Liquid Cooling has what that can give you problems?  Hoses rot, clamps rattle loose or don't get tightened properly after maintenance.  Pump motors die, or fins rust out.  Electrics can easily be a nightmare once things start going wrong.  Sensors (even simple mechanical ones like are in my 30 year old bike) fail as well.  None of those are outrageous or far fetched things in the least.

When's the last time you checked the condition of your coolant pump?  A bike with a maintenance schedule like a MotoGP machine will never have those issues, but most of us are changing oil and lubing chains, not rebuilding entire bikes after every ride.  Keeping an eye on things will minimize problems, but not nearly to the extent that just not having those parts to begin with will.

&gt;On weight, I have to disagree. 

You're allowed to.  You're wrong of course - and almost realize it in your last sentence.

&gt;More usable power out of the same displacement.

You're onto something there, but it kinda opposes the idea of a smaller engine to save the weight, no?

Liquid cooled sport or especially race bikes (or cars or airplanes or whatever else) don't use a smaller engine to offset the extra weight, they use the biggest motor they can for their class - just like they would do if it were air cooled.  The advantage that they gain is that liquid cooling can move a LOT more heat out of a motor than air cooling can, so that they can push a bit more power out of the motor.  The weight is more than offset by the power, but still makes it heavier, which still has it's drawbacks.  If you're designing a bike to go as fast as it possibly can, adding more weight to get more power is a trade off that should at least be looked at.  At some point the tradeoff stops being a net gain, but before then go nuts.  

If you're building a bike for say... fuel economy, handling, portability (things like the Di Blasi, or the folding motorbikes that are used for someone to drive your car home from the bar, and then ride the bike back to the taxi station) then weight becomes a lot more important than an extra MPH or two *very* quickly - and if weight is your primary concern liquid cooling looks like a pretty bad idea to anyone who's got a half a clue what they're doing.","1435709294"

"flying","t5_2qm1t","&gt; In this case, where two planes choose a straight in final, it's not much of a stretch to think that they may never have had each other in sight.

A great argument for why flying a straight in final into an uncontrolled airport is generally a bad idea. The traffic pattern was developed for a reason.

I've personally been involved in a situation at an uncontrolled airport that could have gone very badly. My father and I were taking off in his old 172E from KTDW in Amarillo on 17. Winds were out of the south, but uncharacteristically light for the great plains (5kts or so). We did our run up and our clearing turn, looking for anyone in the pattern. We announced our intentions and took the runway.

As we go to full power and start on our take off roll I notice something odd in the sky dead ahead of us. It was a King Air. I say to my father, who hasn't seen him yet, ""is he coming or going?"" Answer: he was coming. He was flying a straight in, downwind final because he's a King Air and fuck all the peasants who use this airport. Thankfully, I saw him with plenty of time and we were able to abort the take off and get off the runway *before the King Air driver even saw us*. Turns out our ancient radio was malfunctioning and we didn't know we were not being received, nor were we receiving.

Of course, Mr. King Air driver then goes around making a stink about the two idiots in the 50 year old 172 who don't know how a radio works. Well Mr. King Air driver... why don't you go back to flight school and learn to fly a proper pattern?","1435709296"

Austerity doesnt have to save Greece.
It delayed Greek default long enough to stabilise other nations like Spain. Sure the problems are gone yet, but Europe is much more stable right now than it was 5(?) years ago.

Now that a Greek default isnt as likely to demolish the entire continent, Merkel has no reason to keep feeding Greece money.

Things are probably going to get pretty bad for the Greek now which sucks. But ultimately: the Greek will suffer from problems that were caused by their own society.

Regarding my second comment... people react to lack of things differently.  So, no not having sex won't NECESSARILY lead to ""higher levels of stress and neuroticism"".  It could, but also it might not.  It would depend on the person and the rest of their situation.

Some people can smoke for 20 years and then one day say... nope, I'm done.  And never look back or have issues or struggles.  Others smoke for 6 months and are going to be hooked for the rest of their lives no matter how hard they try and quit.  It just depends.","1435709299"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Before I answer your thought experiment, let me answer your last question.

If a mother hits her baby over the head with a hammer, rendering the baby mentally disabled, the baby can, in fact, sue her for the harm inflicted.  (obviously, there would be a lawyer involved, but the plaintiff would be the baby).  The civil justice system is designed to address situations where person A injures person B, resulting in monetary and physical harm.  In the case of a brain injury, the harm is both physical and monetary (as in lost earning capacity).  There would also be criminal penalties imposed on the mother; as a society, we wish to discourage people from hitting their babies over the head with hammers, and we view such behavior as punishable.  

A friend of mine was a caretaker for a woman whose abusive parents flung her across the room when she was a baby.  She hit her head in the process and injured her brain.  She never learned to walk and talk; she was functioning at the intellectual level of a 6-month-old.  Do you think her abusive parents should not be punished for their actions?

Now, explain to me the difference between flinging an infant at the wall, giving it a brain injury, and knowingly using a toxic substance prenatally, giving the infant a brain injury once it's born.  To the infant, the harm done is the same.  Should the infant in the second case have no recourse?  

As for your thought experiment, obviously denying a pregnant woman medical attention in jail is bad.  Denying anyone medical attention in jail is bad.  But so is working as a caregiver while using drugs, never mind pregnancy.  Something should be done to save the fetus - assuming it's a wanted fetus.  I see nothing wrong with saying ""If you want this fetus, you are going to stop using, or the State will make you stop"".  Maybe a locked treatment facility would be better than jail, but something needs to be done to prevent further harm.

While the woman in your example stopped using drugs, millions of pregnant women do not.  Their babies are born with brain damage they did not ask for and did not deserve.  It is unfair to say that the baby then has no recourse whatsoever.  

A friend of mine has brain damage from her mother's alcohol and meth use while pregnant.  She did not stop using for pregnancy.  My friend did not finish school, has trouble controlling her emotions, can't read too well and can't spell at all, and knows that her brain is messed up.  And she's one of the lucky ones.  She is at least somewhat functional.  FAS can be a lot worse.  ","1435709303"

The two commanders at My Lai - the helicopter commander that landed his birds inbetween the Americans and the civilians, who *threatened to open fire if the Americans did not stop killing*, and the man who that threat was aimed at, Lt. Calley, were only as accountable as to what they were **in charge of**. Calley was guilty of the massacre, due to overseeing it, and the Air Cavalry officer was the one who stopped it, due to his command being the one that ceased the massacre. 

Neither man, however, can be held accountable for the decisions of Westmoreland, LBJ, Nixon, etc...

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I think each case needs to stand on its own. It's hard to make a general rule.

For example, if somebody says ""I will lower taxes"" before an election, but then get elected and there is an economic change, or there is new evidence that lowering taxes will be harmful, then changing is the right thing to do.

The answer should always be that the right view for a politician to hold is the one with the best evidence *right now*. So if the evidence available to them changes and they change views, so be it.

The problem comes from determining what's reasonable. It's not that they said they'd lower taxes and then raise them, but *why* did they say they'd lower taxes and *why* did they raise them. If things changed, fine. If things didn't change but they just didn't look at the evidence enough beforehand, they are incompetent and should have never promised that. If things didn't change and they *knew* they would raise taxes but said otherwise to win votes, that's opportunistic pandering.

Telling the difference, as a voter, is hard. That's especially true when it's in the best interest of the politician &amp; supporters to make themselves look the best and competing politicians/parties/pundits to make them look the worst.

The same applies for ""public opinion"". It's not the job of a politician to cater to public opinion. That's just populism and it doesn't work. As a voter, you are hiring the person to get the best information with the best team to put together the best policies in the best collective interests of the citizens. The general population isn't an expert at anything, but we sure do have a lot of opinions, usually ignorant ones. The value in democracy isn't the opinion of *average* voter, but the population benefiting by the *best* available evidence and reasoning. It's how civilization progresses. You only need one person to invent the wheel and everybody can benefit. You only need one person to cure cancer and everybody can benefit. You only need one person to demonstrate the best way to minimize crime, and everybody can benefit. Realistically these ""best evidence"" policies take time and effort of a lot of experts working for years, but the principle still applies. Our jobs as voters is to hire the right people to do their job well at collecting and implementing such policies, not to pander to our biases and ideological beliefs.

Now of course ""the best evidence"" may, in fact, be public opinion in some cases where it is really a matter of preference. Not a lot of government legislation falls into that category, but it certainly can sometimes.","1435709304"

"ecr_eu","t5_32hcd","The Little Boy RDA has fairly good airflow, but I'm not entirely sure you've grasped the concept of vaping. Why do you want to vape at 80 watts? Almost any tank should be able to handle it, dependant upon what coils you put in it. Vaping at higher wattage doesn't strictly mean better vape, and in reality if you want to vape at 80 watts, you'd probably want a hexa coil build or something otherwise you're gonna end up burning your wick out and dry hitting a lot, as well as burning off your liquid instead of vaporising it properly.

That's not to say 80 watts won't work on a single coil build, but to say that your build would need to be something special to handle it properly. People don't tend to buy an atty that can handle a certain wattage, but one that they can build as they see fit (aka fit a certain size of coil in, or wick in a certain way). To say that you want a tank that can handle at least 80 watts is a bit like saying you want a fridge that can hold at least 40 blocks of cheese. Your cheese could be various shapes and sizes, as could the fridge. You'll always be able to fit 40 blocks of cheese in the fridge, provided they are the right size.

You're using it correctly - the way the automatic sequencer works is by running through a bunch of sequences. For each sequence, it scores it based on the sum of (priority of artifact) * (position of artifact in the list) - this means that if an artifact has a higher priority and is earlier in the list, the sequence will get a larger score. The sequence you see shown to you is the sequence with the highest score found so far.

The result of a scoring mechanism like this is that you'll sometimes get lower tier artifacts earlier in order to get more higher tier artifacts earlier. For example, getting T5-T1-T2-T5-T1-T4-T5 as opposed to T2-T1-T5-T4-T5-T5-T1. This is somewhat subjective, but you should play around with priorities a bit. This is also the answer to salvaging UA - you salvage UA early on to get a better overall sequence.

I'd also suggest prioritizing UA and WI a bit more, especially WI - early on it makes progress a lot faster. Maybe something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Jv24sxo.png)?","1435709306"

They will do things such a pay for the membership, books, uniform, badges, camp, learning programs, etc. These things cost a lot of money, but they are essential to making the organization run. 

Camps don't simply maintain themselves, and if the kids want anywhere to go the council either owns a camp or they have to lease from an already existing camp to use the property. They also have to pay to maintain and inspect the camps, accredit them, pay for staff to make sure kids don't drown or fall off a horse or cliff.

Being trans is about owning it. You have to own who you are. If you walk around half assing it people will clock you and if they're assholes they will use it against you. But if you are good with you then the words of others will not hurt you. You need to find a release that isn't self harm. I don't say that out of fear for your life I say that because it's not healthy. People will argue it is, but it's not. Cutting is a way to physically show on your body the harm that others have done to you mentally. If you can love yourself the words those clowns say will never make it past your ears. Only the truly 'hardest' of bigots will attack someone who is okay with themselves while the mewling idiots (see: those kids in your class thing) lose their voice quickly. They're used to picking on people who are easy targets. If you're not an easy target they go away. 

Yes this is a lot of self exploration and coming to terms with yourself and loving yourself, but it's an important step in transitioning and in life. Only you get to choose how much uneducated bigots and slack jawed assholes impact you. Which also means you can choose to not let them impact you and in doing so make the world a better place.

This has been edited with a shit ton of stuff added.

Okay.

So, she allowed Garnet to be there. Also, Amethyst. So, the *only other Crystal Gem,* like, the *only other gem* on Earth besides them, and one of her best friends for thousands of years, *romantic relationship or not,* yeah, she’d let her be around. 

What is she going to do, otherwise? Cripple the CG’s, or kill Pearl? Or, its a cartoon, and this is a narrative, and a clever character being put together? I mean, for real. Taking this way too seriously on the Pearl being disturbed stuff.

I think what you aren’t getting here is that ***your theory is a theory. Your headcanons are not canon, your theories are theories, your ideas are ideas.*** Just like mine are, just like everyone elses are. Your idea is an interesting one. *And I am not even entirely on the “never involved ever” train.* But from ***what we actually know, and what we’ve actually seen,*** there is no mutuality to their relationship. 

Your theory is plausible to me except the fact that you’re equating “love” to “love” in regards to her relationship with Greg. That doesn’t make any sense to me and is just short of ridiculous, considering she literally couldn't relate that idea to herself when he explained what being in love was like. That’s my idea. You have yours. But I’m sorry, you’re never going to be able to make a decent argument when you have nothing actually going for that argument, other than stuff stacking theory on top of theory on top of head canon.

That is my idea. So far, nothing has proved me wrong. Their dance does not prove me wrong. Nothing canon has proved me wrong. Nothing has explicitly proved me right, either, but if my idea here is “nothing happened, but maybe something, so far nothing indicates that,” and we’ve been shown “nothing,” to like, every other person, every person besides a small few, *”nothing,”* than I’d say right now it’s reasonable to say, canonically, ***nothing.*** Nothing was happening there. Nothing canon has helped or hurt either argument other than the fact that Rainbow Quartz is actually a fusion which is not at all really in harmony.

If this changes, you didn't predict it so much as make a *lucky guess,* really, because no one besides this tiny minority of shippers are seeing anything which indicates that, and no, 99% of people aren't idiots. If it ends up being right, considering your thoughts now as being 'totally justified' would be equal to like, me saying 'what if the crystal gems put some shards together would it make a new gem?' and then claiming to predict Keeping It Together. Thats where you are, right now. Headcanons with like 0.01% of something to support it.

If it ends up being, oh yeah, they ate each other out nightly, than fucking beautiful, awesome, I can't wait to see that, that'll be a great episode. But right now, no, not the case, canonically, it isn't happening.","1435709312"

However..  I will say that I've heard so much praise for Sophie over the years, and I have never been impressed with her ability. Much of it just feels sub-par and I cringe at certain lines. I know this is an unpopular opinion but I just can't see it. She's definitely improved since season 1, though!","1435709312"

There is three midgets, or Tolkien calls them, hobbits, sent on mystical quest. Quest involves grey-heared man, with birds of eagle! 

""Run, you foolish peoples!""-Gandalf, king of grey-hears.

This is why King of circles is best book, because book is best. 

There is no scorpions, unlike old country, in which many scorpions perpetrate horrific acts among my people. You should be happy to live in country, without scorpions, with book-librarys in which a man can read day all long.

Then in book, book send Froddo to Mr. Doom, and Mister Mountain is angered, because he owns circle, and circle is king's circle, not midgets.

So midgets fight king-circle man. Then, human people come, and they are lucky too, because they have food, and no scorpions too.

So when they arrive to Mr. Mountain, one of the midgets, having become drunk, wants to the king-circle. He chews off king-midget's hands, and jumps into lava.

If I can come with one(or a few) hypothetical situations where a person is legally carrying cash with them then it should worry you because it sets a dangerous precedence.

You should be free to keep your money in cash if you wish to...but does it make financial sense? no

A minarchist libertarian govt might in time of war but you are largely right. Ancaps won't by definitoon because they don't run governments.

&gt;Regardless who did it the fact remains that the problem is the excessive government spending, that is an indisputable fact, had the government run surplusses every year then there would be zero debt to repay.

Yep. So what?

At the start of this mini thread some guy with no clue was blaming socialists when it's actually right wing overspenders (greece spent a fuckton on it's military and cronyism in the 5 ruling families who operated the place until Syrzia got in).

I just corrected him. I didn't say ""yay socialism"" or anything like that. I just put the blame where it lies - with right wing and neo liberal stooges who fucked up every bit as badly as any socialist govt in a democracy has ever done.

From the design it appears to be parallel but check this - it makes a big difference. If both batteries go in the same way up, it's parallel. If they're top to tail, it's series.

In parallel:

You still get 4.2v but you have two batteries supplying the amps. With two 30a batteries you can draw 60a, minimum resistance 0.07ohms.

In series:

You get 8.4v with the maximum amps being the same as for a single battery. With two 30a batteries in series you get 30a and the minimum resistance is 0.28ohms.

Both give the same max power and the same battery life, in theory. In practice you get more power and more battery life in series because losses are lower.

You must use matched batteries charged to the same voltage to make sure one is not being asked to work too hard. Matched manufacturer pair, used and charged as a pair from new. Alternate their order in the mod to keep them under equal strain over time. Check their voltage coming out of the mod occasionally to check they're still matched. 

In series the lead battery will take more strain, especially at higher power or discharged to a low voltage. If they're coming out of the mod with large differences in voltage, change the batteries sooner or swap their order halfway through discharge.","1435709326"

&gt; * At the other end of the spectrum, Geneva has the costliest beer at an average price of $6.32 for a 330ml bottle.The Beer Price Index, which compares several beers in stores and bars to rank 75 world cities in terms of price, is also meant to double as a useful guide for holidaymakers looking for value holidays this year.

&gt; * In Delhi, if your menu price is Rs 100 for a bottle of beer in a restaurant, you would have to fork out Rs 142 after adding taxes.

&gt; * On the other hand, Goa and Daman are great places to have cheap beer because taxes are very low,"" he said.Close on the heels of Geneva as the home of the most expensive beer are Hong Kong ($6.16), Tel Aviv ($5.79), Oslo ($5.31), New York ($5.20) and Singapore ($5.13).

I completed all three parts of Uncharted (in first part played for 2 years because it was too boring and plot with characters were B-movie level, second was a little better but still average quality and third was best in series because of character connections and graphics 7/10 game to me) but Tomb Raider is even worse in that way because it's a totally qte game for movies fans (I played first five original Tomb Raider).

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","I think the build for him mostly is a hamstring build:
Invigoration
Flail Axe
Brutal Strike
Furnace Blast/Lamb
Savage Charge/Spell Shield
Enraged
Bolt/Nexus blades/Lamb upgrade

Brutal strike is just really good, giving tons of damage and frontloading it which is huge. Abattoir + Blood frenzy is obvious too but with Invigoration you are are Hamstringing once every couple attacks anyway so Brutal strike actually outdamages Abattoir in teamfights, plus getting that bonus damage on the first hit after butcher's brand is huge to get heal back up.
With Blood frenzy abattoir does start to outdamage but i think you'll often need the CC reduction on enraged to prevent getting nuked too easily.
If you need block early though instead of Invigoration I like the abattoir blood frenzy build. And probably unrelenting pursuit instead of Flail axe too then. As axe becomes a bit too many hungry to poke if you don't have Invigoration. 

In that case it becomes:
Block
Unrelenting Pursuit
Abattoir
Furnace Blast/Lamb
Savage Charge/Spell Shield
Blood Frenzy
Bolt/Nexus blades/Lamb upgrade

Furnace is the straightforward ult most of the time but against splitpushers etc. the lamb is really nice especially as it's lvl 20 upgrade is sweet for wombo combo's. Butcher punishes splitpushing quite a bit already by being rediculously strong 1v1 and lamb is quite useless in teamfights early that I think furnace will be the more popular pick. 

Overall really solid hero, especially in some comp that can support him well. Cleanse to back him up when he uses brand is pretty huge, getting that CC'ed is difference between mopping them up or butcher instantly dying.","1435709329"

For those who don't like links or just want a TL;DR:

1. The witness system in GTAV is severely rigged, pedestrians don't need to call the cops to give you a wanted level and the player can't stop this.
2. The code that makes peds have to call the cops and allows the player to interfere is rarely used
3. Animals can report crimes just like peds can. This means that when you kill a lone hiker on top of Mount Chilliad, one of the 5 birds flying above you may trigger a wanted level.
4. These issues can be fixed in the game code easily and solve a lot of complaints

For those interested,[ here's a pastebin of all the vanilla crime information.](http://pastebin.com/e1h0geDV) Note that while all crimes have ""MustBeWitnessed"" as a flag, most of them lack ""MustNotifyLawEnforcement"", meaning most crimes don't require a ped to report you.

Also, the optical drive doesn't seem to be an essential buy, because most of the drivers that you will need are mostly accessible through internet(specifically the manufacturer's website). But that's just my personal preference.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","I moved here in January of 2013 from San Francisco (BUT I'm not Californian; I'm Canadian). I met and started a long distance relationship with someone from Portland in 2012, and it quickly became apparent that we would have to live in the same city, and Portland made a lot more sense than SF. I spent a couple of months job hunting from afar and had some nibbles but no bites. I probably would have kept looking for much longer, but I lucked out and ended up being hired to work remotely for someone I had gone to school with, so now I work from home, or from a coffee shop if I'm feeling ambitious. 

Finding a place to live was okay. My boyfriend was renting a room in a house owned by a couple who were friends of his. They graciously invited me to move in, so that was easy. We also lucked out in the rentals we've had since; both have come to us through non-traditional channels: the first through the bike racing scene, which we're both part of, and the second through some handyman work my boyfriend took on. Both were lucky breaks. We're currently about to close on a modest house in Sumner, and that has been a pretty hard-fought battle. 

So, I guess I had a fair bit of help (meaning moving here to be with someone who was already here) and a fair bit of luck.

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I'm an artist and here's where I think this fits. Bernie very clearly supports increasing general education funding from pre k -12th and has recently introduced legislation to make public colleges and universities free. Fine arts and performance arts are routinely cut due to budgeting restricitons. Bernie's plan to increase funding would allow pre k -12th grade schools to restore cut programs and  strengthen those that exist. He also thinks it's unacceptable that our schools are teaching to the tests created by big, GOP backed companies, he is in favor of repealing No Child Left Behind and I don't see why he wouldn't be receptive to all the evidence that supports arts based teaching and brain development. He has written his own poetry after all! The free college programs would obviously include art departments and allow those of us who have chosen something that is difficult to begin with a fairer chance to begin our careers without drowning in debt. I also think that Bernie is very aware of the benefit of large scale public arts projects and how they increase community morale and can put people to work. Think about the Infrastructure increases he wants to make and how that mirrors what FDR did. Then, think about the WPA which allowed amazing artists like DeKooning and Pollock and Thomas Hart Benton to receive a pay check while working in the community and avoid starvation while they developed their own art. I have no doubt that he sees the value in wholistic community revitalization.

The concept of ability grouping or tracking has tons of research on it, but it's mostly 20+ years old. This is because we reached a scientific consensus on it long ago and there is not really any doubt that it's a bad practice for kids, so there's not a need to keep proving that again and again.

Nevertheless, it remains popular both because the parents of the smarter kids still like it, and because it's easier for teachers to teach narrower groups of skill levels rather than having to differentiate their instruction for all. There's some common sense appeal to the idea that the teaching is better with homogenous groups, but it's really just not supported by research.","1435709344"

The AFB is a great example.  Investing in the AFB would create a boom in the local economy.  When the AFB is no longer affordable, the local economy experiences a bust.  If you put an AFB in every town in America, you'd have a boom across the country, and an eventual bust across the country.

If you have an economic boom experienced due to an unsustainable increase in debt, whoever experiences the boom will experience the bust when the debt goes bad.  If there was a situation causing an increase in unsustainable debt throughout the country, then the whole country would experience a boom, and when the debt went bad, the whole country would experience a bust.","1435709345"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't really know if you can call an opinion wrong. To call an opinion true or false, you would need a way to measure it accurately, and you can't often do that.  
  
If I were to say, ""I hate Chad, he is a jerk"", how would you measure that? You could see who likes Chad and who doesn't, but what if the people who like Chad are jerks too? See who likes them? You can never really say if an opinion is correct or not, because if you could slap on a true or false, then it would be a fact or falsehood, and not an opinion anymore. So I never said his opinion is wrong, I just said it was an opinion and neither a fact nor lie.  
  

&gt;'Religion also did good things' is....  
  
Yeah, there is both good and bad in everything. Why is the fact that religion does good irrelevant now? Don't you think that is unfair to say that? To only look at the bad things it does and ignore the good?  
  
For a moment, lets ignore religions as a whole and think about the people inside them, because most of the major religions I can think of preach good things. When a person does something evil nowadays in the name of religion, it is because they strayed from the usually peaceful teachings of their religion.  
  
Has religion led to regrettable events? Yes. Are the also responsible for a lot of good? Yes. There is also the Mormon Church, among others, which seems to be doing in its power to help remind people of the good that religion is capable of.","1435709346"

I never reveal plans to women, and they are included. I would rather give the appearance of doing nothing than to give them the truth. Anyways, they're talking about organization and having everything in life scheduled. As an example they put forth my mother, the most organized neurotic mess you've ever seen...also with a genius level IQ. (She has two PhDs and was active in light waves and quantum physics). As a counter point I bring up my dad.My aunt replies that every person who is relaxed in life or has an IDGAF attitude is a parasite and that I need a wife to run my life. She went on to say how my dad wouldn't do anything without my mom etc. This is the man who earns over 200k a year, the man who brought our whole family out of Siberia into the USA. But hey apparently he's a parasite to my mom who hasn't had a job in 16 years and spends all of her time mismanaging his money while talking about how frugal she is because she got it on sale. The same woman who just spent 50k on a kitchen remodel and is always complaining about a lack of money. Fuck.I literally just sat there and stared at them. I really could not believe this shit.

Any instance where we are not going to have an avatar, they should put the camera either at sitting level or standing level. Period.

"politics","t5_2cneq","1) There are too many morons in our country who would ruin every negotiation we have if they were all made public (see letter from the stupid ass congressmen for Iran).

2) We live in a representative democracy. That means we vote for people who vote for us. They make the decisions because we put them there to represent us.

3) Other countries don't want the morons in their countries ruining negotiations, so they want secret talks

4) It's pointless for them to keep releasing drafts of a trade deal. It's counterintuitive and counterproductive, as people would complain every time and set us back in negotiations.

5) You can go read trade deals in the past and expect something that's almost exactly the same. I compared the Investment part of NAFTA and the January TPP draft and they were almost identical, with lines tailored to the different countries and with some updates.

6) We have experts involved in these negotiations, and no one gives a fuck what random civilians think on complex international trade deals because it's over most people's heads, as well as the international laws involved.

7) It's pointless since Liberals virtually always oppose trade deals and Conservatives virtually always support trade deals. Liberals listen to the labor market, Conservatives listen to the corporations. No one gets unbiased information, and everyone keeps fighting along political lines.

Why would they make a deal that's bad for ourselves?  You are getting into major conspiracy theories about ties between the government and corporations.  At the end of the day, neither our government nor our corporations want us all to get fucked over.  They both need us to spend money.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm 18 years old, I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome when I was 7 or 8. Truthfully, now, my life is very much the same as everyone else'. When I was younger, I took a long time to develop, up until I was about 14, I had the mentality of someone much younger, though, I believe I had the intelligence of someone much older, I participated in practically zero socialization and spent all my time simply playing video games and using the internet. 

When I was 14, I began participating in a hobby which caused me to become more social, it took me a while, but after about a year of that hobby, I began simply socializing with a group of friends for the sake of socialization, I began socializing on an every day basis, albeit, with a small group of friends I knew quite well. My socialization continued to improve, now I have more friends than I can handle, and I'm usually the one who starts the conversation. 

Only real difficulty I have is difficulty sticking to a routine, after a while, routines become extremely tedious and boring for me, this does cause an issue with education, and always has, but with enough will power and a strong vision of the future, I've managed to power through my education up until this point. As far as working is concerned, I managed to remedy that problem by studying in an area that will allow me to pretty much choose my own working hours provided I meet deadlines. I'm already self employed in the field I'm studying, and while studying I'm living on my own with an income some people with a degree would be jealous of, I've found if I want to do something, it gets done through any means necessary. 

Overall, I wouldn't even call it ""coping"", if anything, my Asperger's syndrome has been a blessing, it definitely did hinder me when I was younger, but as I've gotten older, I've grown out of most of the negative traits, while keeping the positive ones.

I know you didn't say you were looking for advice, and it may go against your parenting instinct, but I'd recommend not sheltering your son as many parents of autistic children do. I believe the best treatment of an autistic person is to give them a chance in the real world. I feel one of the things that mainly hindered me when I was younger was the fact that my mother sheltered me, which I can understand, but it didn't help me in the fact that I hadn't realized how great the outside world is, and therefore, didn't have the drive to develop the skills needed to survive in it.

Achieving recovery from an addiction and subsequent sobriety is in itself a rewiring of brain circuits warped or damaged by chemical activity.  A brain is a machine of sorts.  It can be damaged or destroyed or otherwise altered by use or misuse or injury.  To take away or damage or disrupt a part of the brain is to take away the corresponding part of the personality.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","It is the parenting.  Kids are not allowed to make mistakes and learn for themselves anymore, hell kids are not even allowed to go outside anymore.  Many parents would much rather have their kid sit playing video games in their bedroom because then they know where they are at all times and feel they are safe.

What do you expect when you basically force your kids, in the crucial periods of social development, to never leave the house or have friends or talk to people in any way?

It used to be you would have to force your kids inside at the end of the day, because they were outside all day and they had to go to bed.  Some of the kids in my kid's class are not allowed outside, not allowed to ride a bike, not allowed to have friends etc.... they are gonna be beyond fucked up when they are older.

I let my kid go outside and play whenever he wants, result so far is he has friends, knows how to interact socially with pretty much anybody, does stupid shit like any boy should ( jumping his bike over crap he can't, comes home dirty with scraped knees and hands all the time etc) and it is for the better.

Best part, he has an Xbox he has not played in 3-4 years.  He just thinks video games are dumb cause they are not as much fun as actually doing something.  I am gonna be stoked when he grows up, because I really feel letting him grow up like I did and many people my age (40 ish) is really that much better then locking your kid inside all day.

If you don't let kids form their own social skills together, outside on their own, they are never really going to develop them.","1435709355"

"billmaher","t5_2s496","&gt; shows that the holy scriptures can change as well. But I think you get the picture.

So much for the unerring voice of god.

So if the bible condones slavery, but modern civilized societies do not, where did that progression come from? Thin air?
We have made considerable moral progress over the years, and we didn’t make this progress by reading the Bible or the Koran more closely. Both books condone the practice of slavery -- and yet every civilized human being now recognizes that slavery is an abomination. Whatever is good in scripture, like the golden rule, can be valued for its ethical wisdom without requiring us to believe that it was handed down to us by the creator of the universe.

“Meaning, values, morality, and the good life must relate to facts about the well-being of conscious creatures—and, in our case, must lawfully depend upon events in the world and upon states of the human brain. Rational, open-ended, honest inquiry has always been the true source of insight into such processes. Faith, if it is ever right about anything, is right by accident.” 

― Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values

&gt; Considering that passages of these holy books are self-contradictory,

They should be viewed as the useless ancient barbaric myths that they are.

You say that because there's a choice to go between full AT and AT with manual mode that's somehow inferior to a MT? It's like saying that having manually operated windows makes the driving experience better because you're more 'connected' with the car.

Anecdotal evidence about what some people do doesn't make for a solid argument. Just because some people don't use their paddle shifters, doesn't mean it's not equal to using a MT. It's a false argument predicated on weak data.

The Toyota argument is equally weak. If any form of automation *could* fail, does that mean we should change course and use the manual route? You know the Apollo missions were nearly 100% automated right? Based on your Toyota argument, we should change all automation in spaceflight to manual to avoid any chance of error related to automation.

If someone just *likes* MT over AT, there's no argument. Opinions are accepted in all forms. To argue that MT is better than AT is silly.","1435709360"

"Pizza","t5_2qlhq","This discussion is beginning to get pretty long, but, fwiw, here's my take.  I've been consulting with pizzeria owners for close to 5 years.  The common thread is that, while they tend to have no problem finding restaurant workers, finding people with real skills is close to impossible.  When I say 'real skills,' I mean

1. the ability to tend an oven- to be able to bake multiple pies at a time, turning each when it needs to be turned, and ensuring even consistent bakes. On a wood fired oven, this also means knowing when to add wood and how much.

2. An understanding of fermentation- how to manipulate the temperature of the dough so it's ready when you need it.  Understanding when to pull the dough from the walk-in and how many trays to pull at a time. 

3. Top notch stretching skills.  Not two successfully hand stretched pies ;) but 2000. Speed, agility, and consistency.

4. An eye for making dough- understanding the potential variations in flour and weather that might require on the fly corrections to the formula. Being able to take the dough to the perfect level of gluten formation, no more, no less. Documenting everything.

5. An ability to work under pressure.  When the shit hits the fan, and you're in the weeds, you have to be able to bear down, and rise to the occasion, not fall to pieces like many people would do.

With your present amount of experience, if you walk into a great pizzeria and ask for a job, they'll probably laugh at you (sorry). For instance, you might live near Cane Rosso. With where you're at, they wouldn't even give you a dishwashing job.  You might be able to find work in a generic place, but you really don't want to learn the trade from mediocre pizza makers.

If you really want to be in the pizza business, learn everything that you can online, start networking- yesterday and make pizza every day for at least a few months. As you get to know people and people get to be familiar with your work, eventually someone will know someone that can get you in the door of a pizzeria where you could really learn something.","1435709360"

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","&gt; I believe GoT would have shown him dead if they wanted him gone for good.

Personally, I think the director just thought ""wouldn't it be cool if we showed the killing blow from Stannis' eyes?"" and that's all there is to it.  I doubt if he considered the fact that doing that means we can't see Stannis actually dying and launch a bunch of tinfoil.

&gt; I believe Stannis sent all his horses and the half of his men that he was told abandoned him away to launch a surprise attack on the Boltons.

This amounts to saying ""what we saw happen didn't happen.""  Why would Stannis' men tell him that his force had abandoned him if his force hadn't abandoned him?  Unless he suspected his command was thoroughly infiltrated by spies, not telling his remaining captains what his other part of the force was doing would be terrible strategy.  

Also, we saw the results of his losses on the battlefield, with Ramsay wandering around at will picking off the dying.  Stannis lost that battle.  Big time.  There's no upside to pointlessly sacrificing half his force like that, at all.  Much less leading that sacrifice charge from the front - the fact that he walked away from the battlefield at all is a miracle in itself, no matter what his plan might have been.

But even from the beginning, Stannis never seemed to me like a character who was going to make it to the final bracket.  As many admirable qualities as he has, there's much more about him that's tragic than heroic.  D&amp;D may have pulled the plug on his story earlier than GRRM will, but that plug has definitely been pulled.

&gt; In King's Landing, Cersei will want vengeance on the city and the Faith Militant. I believe she will destroy Kings Landing with the hidden storage of wild fire.

At this point, Cersei has no power whatsoever.  Kevan's running the show now.  The only reason she had any power was because Tommen never told anybody she didn't, and nobody else had been appointed as Hand.  And now that every peasant in KL has spit on her and called her names while naked, nobody is going to let her boss them around ever again.  The main use of FrankenMountain is to get her off the hook via another trial by combat, which is a right she still retains.  But that's the only card she's got left at present.

&gt; Sansa will use the nightly torture and rape endured upon her by Ramsay Bolton to piss off the remaining Stark loyalist in the North...

This is a good one, I like it.  Sansa hasn't been good for much, but one thing she's damn good at is making decent people feel sorry for her over all the shit she goes through.  And she's got plenty of shit to tell about the Boltons.  Using that to turn the North against them is something she could definitely pull off, and it would be very much in character.  It would also be a handy way of explaining the politics of the North rapidly souring against the Boltons, when they so far seem to have things in hand.  Kudos on this.  I don't necessarily agree on how the military angle would play out (Stannis and his army are dead!), but I bet Littlefinger would love to play ""savior of the North"" with Sansa paving the way for local support.

&gt; Bronn and Jaime will be taken as prisoners as they were leaving on a Martell ship(the ship was never meant to leave for Kings Landing)... Trystane Martell never loved Myrcella in the first place and will be sent to marry Daenerys.

Doran: ""OK, here's my plan.  We kill Myrcella.  First, Trystane, you pretend you're in love with her for years.  Then I'll stop the Sand Snakes from killing her, let the captives who tried to save her go, then have Elaria kill her using delayed poison (which she'll risk dying from herself) that'll activate while she's on a boat, then we'll have the boat turn right around and come back, and take the captives we released captive again, right after we killed the person who was in our power while she wasn't in our power.  Brilliant!""

Areo Hotah: ""Why don't you just leave them in jail and kill her here?  I mean I've got this big-ass axe, I'll do it right now.  CHOP!""

Doran: [""You just don't get it, do you?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7O7sBg-iJc#t=1m47s)

Unless Doran's ultimate sole desire is to give Jaime the mother of all mindfucks, there is absolutely no upside to this convoluted triple-backflip of a plan whatsoever.

&gt; With Dany marching North to Kings Landing to attack Little Finger

Woah woah woah, what does Dany have against Littlefinger?  I'm pretty sure he could negotiate his way out of that one pretty easily, if she's got dragons.

&gt; Jon Snow will unite the wildlings he brought south of The Wall 

There are some gaps that need to be filled in here.  Did he just get up after the assassins walked away?  Then what?  How does that play out from him lying bloody in the snow to leading a bunch of wildlings who swore they'd never serve anybody?

Basically it looks like you've got Littlefinger set up as the ""end boss"" of the story *over* the White Walkers.  That could be cool in a way, but I just don't see him in that role.  He'd cut a deal, and it would be a fair one that they'd be idiots not to accept.  Also, why are Jon and Dany coordinating from across a continent?  They've never met.  They don't really have a unified purpose here except ""fuck Littlefinger,"" and neither of those two people have any reason to dislike him.  Neither of them have ever met him!

It's inherently devicive and should be abandoned for maybe just something as simple as equality.

op.gg info: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Stylomax

IGN: Stylomax

Age: 37 (yes, I'm an old fart)

Time Zone: MST (mountain time zone)

Highest Rank: Bronze 1 (possibly because I hate playing ranked solo)

Current Rank:k Bronze 2 

Role applying for: Support and/or Jungler

Favorite Champion(s): For support: Thresh, Alistar, Leona, Sona, Annie and Morgana For jungle: Sejuani, Gragas, Zac, Nautulis, Rammus

Top 3 Champs in champ pool: Thresh, Sejuani, Rammus

Strengths/Weaknesses (be honest): I enjoy hearing feedback that will improve my league play. I know that I have room for improvement there are times where I'm able to figure it out for myself and others where I need it pointed out. My weakness would be thinking that I'm responsible for any teamfight or gank attempt that goes poorly. Sometimes it is indeed my fault, other times I'm putting the blame on myself for something that's completely out of my control (have had this pointed out to me several times, still working on it).

Communication preference(Skype,ts, etc.): By far I prefer TS (I run my own server should we need it) but I can use any voice comms needed

When are you usually on: Weekdays: Typically 6pm till 11 pm (mountain time) Weekends: 3 pm till midnight or later (with breaks in between for meals) 

Rough schedule layout: Weekdays I'm good for practice and/or games anytime up until 11 pm with the exception of Fridays where I do have some planned activities which take about an hour of time Weekends unless I have a planned activity (which I can give notice for) anytime during the hours specified

Previous team experiences: Mainly casual teams with some friends, I think the highest we got was into Silver 3 IIRC. Most recent team experience was for the TForce Podcast, unfortunately we were eliminated during the second round

Why you want to join: I'm looking for a team that's into being competitive and making each team member better. I want it to be a good learning experience and who knows maybe even expand my champ pool

Amount of LCS/CS you watch: Not a lot currently. Previous seasons I watched several hours a week, have just spent more time playing league or doing other things.

When and where do you regularly answer riddles involving old people?: Trivia Pursuit at a retirement home

Why do you do the question stated above?: Why not? Nope, not a conformist, more of a completionist :P","1435709367"

"amateurradio","t5_2qi86","Hi, this is Casey, I am also one of the project creators. I have successfully designed and launched several hardware products in a commercial setting and our lead EE (Morgan Redfield) also has similar experience. I completely agree -- some of the hardware projects on Kickstarter make me cringe. I have learned many hard lessons years ago.

However, I believe we have done our homework. We have a contract manufacturer in Seattle lined up, our BOMs quoted out, quite a few board revs under our belt, and we even met with our main radio SoC provider in Shenzhen a few months ago. I was not comfortable launching this Kickstarter until we made sure we had everything working. It has been a year in the making and I think the extra time we took to make it a success will pay off!

As soon as we get the funds from Kickstarter, we can immediately purchase our BOM and give the CM the green light to start making boards. Morgan just checked in with them today and gave them the link to our Kickstarter. They are excited and ready. I have every belief that we can shipping on time for October.  

There are unseen risks and delays, but with a completed design that actually works (not just some CAD renderings), we are in good shape.","1435709368"

PvP is all about the capabilities of hitting of your target! Priests may seem weak but really, they're actually quite strong. Their basic attack really doesn't need strategic aim like Archers, Assassins, or Warriors; AND on top of that, their basic attack also stuns the target. So as a Priest, you'll be able to hit your targets most of the time, kite them easily because of the CC, and STEAL KILLS from others easily if you're playing free for all. Winning in PvP IS ALL ABOUT GETTING KILLS and as a Priest, you'll be able to gather lots of kill participation which opens you many possibilities to earn points. 

Their SURVIVABILITY is also good because of heal, and their Laser has just OP range and damage, so you can use that to last hit your targets. Priests will be OP in PvP but that is only because they will be easy to handle.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","Think of the RA meme as more generally saying ""have experience with high level math"". Real is typically the first tough proofs course people run in to and is typically the only tough one (aside from abstract) required of math majors. 

No committee is going to see an application where some kid got an A in PhD micro, topology, or differential geometry and go ""*but he didn't take real analysis!*""

&gt;I mean, I would think that a math minor and at least one proofs writing course - an intro course at the very least - is sufficient. AFAIK economics proofs are not as formal as mathematics proofs (the lack of English in the proofs my micro professor wrote was astounding). Or perhaps my limited experience in a lower ranked university isn't enough.

Sufficient to be able to handle first year coursework? Maybe (however, I would definitely debate that or at least condition it on the program one is at). Sufficient to make for a competitive applicant? No way. Remember, *a lot* of people apply to Econ PhD programs. 1000 kids applied to NYU last year; 50-60 get in while 20-30 matriculate. It's not because only 5% of applicants have the capabilities to complete the PhD; it's because they were the 50-60 best.","1435709373"

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","There are several ways of measuring something like this. All with their pros and cons. I know nothing about the system, but I would start with something like...

Look at where a user touches on, look at where the touch off; compare that with the times they did, and then the timetable of services (not the actual services) which should have got them between the two points. Then see, did they make it in that time?

For example. Touch on at Upfield at 7:10am, Touch off at Melb Central at 8:13am. Timetable says there was a 7:14 that arrived at Melb Central at 7:54. Add a few minutes for getting to the barrier (say 5), then call that as a 14 minute delay.  
Yes there are problems with this, but as things like this are technically achieveable, you can set KPIs, such at 80% of commuters aren't delayed by more than 5 minutes. This will account for the people who aren't going direct, or stop to buy a drink or something.

This is not something you do manually, but automatic reporting is something that systems a lot less expensive than this have.","1435709378"

"Steam","t5_2qwis","Terraria (and Starbound) is a weird kind of game for me. There's nothing about it that's decidedly un-fun, but I just can't keep myself interested for more than a couple hours before throwing it back on the pile.

I think a large part of it is the mining curve. In Minecraft I could get a good supply of coal and iron in the first 20 minutes of playing, and then be set for a few days above land to get food/shelter/trees set up. Then I can go back down to my mine and find my first diamonds in a half hour or so. Once I've got diamond tools I can quickly start harvesting away at whatever materials I need to build myself a proper house and utilities.

In Terraria, I spend my first hour mining copper, get enough to come back and make the basic furnace and anvil, and then go back for another hour or two to finish up the copper ""tier"" of crafting. Then it's back down for iron, then silver, etc.

I love love love the combat and tons of content in Terraria, but I think the sheer number of ores combined with the increased resources needed to make things, causes the ""mining grind"" to feel really long, unfortunately.","1435709378"

I can sympathize with the frustration of dealing with bad information. It just doesn't want to leave, and the more you show people the truth, the more it comes off to them like you're the one that's uneducated or a shrill for someone. And the talk about vaccinations really hits home for me.

As for gluten, I personally end up using gluten-free food because it's a decent alternative to white flour (which I can't have). If there was another type people would make that didn't use simple carbohydrates, I'd probably have that too. But those options wouldn't even be available for me had this ""fad"" not been as big a thing as it is.

I agree with you that we should properly educate people about gluten now that it's out in the wild, but we shouldn't necessarily despise the ways it became popular. ","1435709378"

"playark","t5_386qw","Regional servers will not solve this ""issue"". Why? Non-enforcement of being region locked. If anyone remembers an older mmorpg called Shadowbane, it had the same exact problem. Without going into the details of the game itself, it was a large scale pvp mmo with base building and siege warfare. Battles could be small with a handful of people or hundreds vs hundreds. The game eventually went free to play (with no cash shop, completely free) for about 3+ years and in that 3 years the game was over run by Chinese players. An immense horde of Chinese players. When a battle would happen, your guild of 20 or 30 people would be trampled by HUNDREDS of Chinese players. It was like bad 300 Movie joke where they'd literally blot out playing field. 

The point I'm trying to make is, those of us that played Shadowbane pleaded, begged, offered money to it's developers to put up Oceanic servers and region lock IP's coming from that area of the world. Even if the entire English speaking population of a server grouped up, we still couldn't really take down the mega zerg Chinese guild(s). So while you may want regional servers, it solves nothing unless Ark's devs region lock the game. Sure some may VPN in their way through but the majority won't be hassled to do so. It's the only way to combat being over run. When a server maxes out at 70 players, and 50+ of them are one big tribe, Chinese or not, that tribe is going to dominate that server. Do you constantly transfer your character to another server to avoid the horde? Losing your dinos and base in the process? How many times should you expect to move just because you are outnumbered 10 to 1? Region locking and also limiting Tribe membership numbers would be good steps to stopping it.","1435709386"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","The problem with first person is that writers inadvertently mold the main character after themselves. They may be intending to write a person very different from themselves, but forget in the heat of of writing that their main character may not know the GRE vocab word they just used in that sentence. Formal phrasing is very common.

This is a symptom of a larger error in characterization. Not surprisingly, writers write what they know, and quite often they write their quirks as their main characters. This is more evident in first person. Protagonists in novels are more likely be introverted than protagonists in television, primarily because television writers work in a cooperative environment and writers work alone.

This is very easy to see in romance novels, one of my favorite genres. The heroine is often an introvert with writer quirks or interests. There is actually nothing wrong with this, as readers are often amateur writers and share similar quirks themselves. The problem comes when the writer intends to create a character with a divergent personality from themselves and fails to do so.

Extroverted character? Failed. Your character frequently retreats inside them self to calm down. Introvert coping mechanism. Male character? Failed. Your character uses feminine language unlikely to be spoken by men. Uneducated character? Failed, because you used the word ""impugn.""

A great example I'm finding of this is Fifty Shades of Grey. It's told in first person, and the narrator uses complex words no one would use in a regular sentence, like taciturn. It's not that an English major like Ana wouldn't know what taciturn would mean, but a person is unlikely to use that in their thoughts or speech, and it is something your reader is going to notice. Even educated people use a lower diction than their education, because they need to be understood by a general audience.

I imagine most writers include these words because they want to be specific or their writing impressive. However, with first person you need to remember that speech is vague, and informal. You can write taciturn in third person, but rarely in first. At the very least, don't litter your writer with that much formal and specific language.

Readers are going to notice failed divergent character traits.","1435709387"

Personally, I think prostitution should be legal and regulated, but on the whole I think it's less healthy than regular sexual relationships not mutated by money in such a direct way. (Although that's a personal view, and I don't think it really matters for the conversation).

A lot of them think the way to spread God's love is by pointing out other's flaws and sins, and taking on this ""holier than thou"" persona that involves shoving the Bible in their face. I feel like this is why people get such a negative view of Christians, and it's not the way I try to live out the ways of Christ.

Honestly, I befriend the atheists, the homosexuals, and the like. Are they going to hell? I don't know. But in all seriousness, their sin is no greater than any of ours,and I have no reason to point fingers at them for this very reason. 

 Most Christians I see these days  just bash non-Christians and just show up to Church every Sunday to sing a few lovely Worship songs and proclaim their faith in Christ and then leave, only to do the same thing next week. But what is that doing? How is that furthering God's Kingdom? Yeah, it's good for our own faith, and good to be with our Christian brothers and sisters (Matthew 18:20) but I feel like the best example of being a Christian is loving everyone and living out that example of Christ in every day experiences.

These factors have led me to take a different view on Church and Christianity. Is Church important? Yes, of course. And my wife and I do regularly attend Sunday Service. But I don't think your a ""bad"" Christian, or going to Hell because you chose not to go to Church, or have a different view on Christianity than others.

The only thing we can gather is that the original sculpture had magisters abusing qunari and then later on, someone modified the sculpture so it looked like humans were being abused instead of qunari. 

However, there are two problems with your logic. First, we don't know what the first artist was trying to depict. Only that their feelings toward the subject matter was negative and they felt ashamed by it. Second, we don't know the motivation behind the removal or when it occurred. And we *can't* know when the second sculptor acted because something was removed instead of added to the sculpture.

There's nothing in that codex that supports the two sculptors were reacting to Tevinter having created the Qunari. It could just as easily be that the first sculptor was reacting negatively to Tevinter's abuse of a new race to Thedas and the second was trying to cover up the early abuses of Tevinter magisters during a time where Tevinter and the Qunari were trying to make peace.","1435709391"

It's a really unhealthy point of mindset. Some people just don't want to be sexual with you and never will. There is nothing unusual about someone being attracted to someone for a while, and then the attraction fades for no reason at all - neither partner has changed, it just goes away.

Relationships aren't so simple that there is one specific answer to sex problems in relationships, or any problem in relationships, really. For example, for LL men the problem can be low testosterone. There is nothing their partner can do - lose weight, offer kinkier sex, whatever - to fix that lack of desire. But for others, the problem is depression, their partners negative reactions to how they initiate, to their body type, etc.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","I'm assuming you've plugged everything in correctly, re-plugged it all in, taken out the cmos battery, pulled the ram, tried to boot it that way, etc. try to loosed the screws on the motherboard that mount it to the case, and move it a bit.  If that doesn't work, Make sure you are grounded. Take it all apart, out of the case. Then rebuild it outside the case (no optical or HDD/SSD. Then try it. If no change, take 1 stick of ram then try it. If no change, take out the other stick and put back in the original stick then try it. If no change, take out all the ram then try it (it should do a certain number of beeps). The put back in the ram then try it. If no change, take out the video card, then try it. If no change, unplug and take out everything (except the CPU and power switch, unless you can use a screwdriver to touch the two pins of the power switch, that'll turn it on just like pushing the power button) , then take out the bios battery, and unplug the PSU from the WALL, then try it (yes I know there is no power, but the fans may move a little while the power is dispensed) then try it. Put wait at least 30 seconds and put the bios battery back in.  Take out the CPU, then try it.(should hear beeps) If no change, Put back in the CPU GPU and ram and try it. If no change, try any variation you can think of. (Forget the HDD/SSD/Optical, those won't make it not boot). Sure enough, unless there is something legitimately wrong. it will get working again. If nothing works, you probably do indeed have a bad motherboard. Usually, you just have to start it with the RAM out, then it'll work once you put the ram back in. Once it's working, build it back proper in the case, hook it all up, including SATA devices and it'll be fine in the case. This has worked hundred of times for me. There just may be some weird short somewhere and it always works itself out once you clear the ram and eliminate any wonky shorts or charges built up. Once it gets up and running out of the case, you'll be good. ","1435709392"

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","I'm still young (student) but I think various money managing video games are what has given me my aptitude with finance, apart from frugality my parents certainly didn't teach it. I racked up some HUGE hours on what others would view as some pretty lame money related browser games. My primary game required more grinding than anything you've ever played before, talking years to level and get decent cash reserves. The weird thing is that even though at the time I was earning money to purchase mythical creatures and magical artifacts if you think about it the underlying principle is actually very similar to the accumulation phase of FI. 

&amp;nbsp;

Various games taught me how to use realistic marketplaces and how to profit from others by buying and selling

&amp;nbsp;


Even stupid novelty games like cookie clicker, and adventure capitalist (google if interested) show the incredible effects of compound interest in a way that even children can understand.

&amp;nbsp;


There's the old theory that if you spend 10,000 hours doing something you get pretty good at it and well I  racked up 12,000+ hours in a money oriented browser game plus countless weeks of time on various other market based games, MMOs etc.  

&amp;nbsp;


Now i'm older this has translated into a natural affinity for financial matters and a strong, and completely self taught, understanding of stock markets, investment and business. Today i'm the guy who gets kicks out of reading about tax law or the terms and conditions on various mortgages. I also make a reasonable part time wage by using statistical mathematics to relieve online bookmakers of their profits.

&amp;nbsp;


People laughed when I would spend up to 14 hours a day grinding stupid games but now its led me to the skills that will one day make me a millionaire the joke is on them.

&amp;nbsp;



TL;DR: When you spend your teenage years playing finance related browser games and market based MMOs you unintentionally learn a lot about money management.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Question: do you see any signs of interest from her? In any case, girls can be fairly oblivious to hints as well, so the best way to do it is probably to just tell the truth, that you've been developing feelings for her, and you would like to know if she feels anything for you. If she doesn't feel the same way, since you guys have been friends for such a long time, hopefully it won't become awkward or anything. 

Although, I have to say that since she's going to be a freshman at college in august, and especially since she's going to be out of state, you might want to consider: what if she wants to be free to explore in college? Would you be able to endure a long distance relationship knowing that she will probably be very busy in college and consequently have less time for you?

Also, sorry if my advice isn't that helpful. It's not like I have that much life experience either but I guess this is just my perspective.","1435709396"

Rather than depicting soldiers as valiant heroes, they're seen as pawns directed by forces beyond their control, who are gradually worn down by the harsh reality of war.

The archetype of hero soldier versus evil enemy is subverted in these kind of stories. 

The war is the primary antagonist, not enemy forces, and the protagonists are as much victim and villain as they are hero.

All in all its a much more nuanced and realistic perspective on the war than the general ""all Allied soldiers were heroes because Hitler was evil (and lets not think about helping Stalin)""","1435709397"

"osugame","t5_2s3lm","Ok, your question made me curious, so here's some back of the envelope maths to get a ballpark estimate.

In [this](http://strawpoll.me/4727115/r) poll, 58% of people preferred using MX Red switches, making it by far and away the most popular type, so I'll work it out for them.

.

The [datasheet for MX switches](http://cherrycorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mx_cat.pdf) tells us that the force required to depress a red key switch increases from 40-80cN (grams force) over the 4mm of travel before bottoming out.

Work done = force x distance

As the graph on the datasheet is a force/travel graph, the area under the graph is equal to the work done.

We can find out this area by integrating the graphs equation 'y=10x+40' within the domain 0&lt;=x&lt;=4.

This gives us the equation

'[integral_0\^4{40+10 x, {x, 0, 4}} dx = 240](http://puu.sh/iINmX/49db5f0df3.jpg)'

There are simpler ways of working this out with a straight line graph, but it's a good example of an application of integration, so I'm leaving it in. =]


The output '240' that we got from that, is the work done to press the switch all the way down, but it's not in joules (J), because the units used to calculate it were 'cN' (100^th of a Newton), and 'mm' (1000^th of a meter), the output is going to be 100x1000 times smaller than 240J.

This leaves us with 2.4x10^-3\J per press... or at least it would, *if* compressing the spring was all that we had to do.

As it is, we also have to accelerate the key before it hits the bottom and that energy is changed in to heat, vibrations and clacking.

Streaming at 180bpm ingame (360 presses per min as the values are most commonly halved when mapping) means pressing the 'z' and 'x' keys 6 times per second, or 3 times per second per key. 

Each key press involves pressing, releasing and accelerating your finger back down. I would estimate that between 1/3 and 1/6 of that time is actually the keypress its self, so I'm going to ball park guess that it's around 1/10 of a second for each press for ease of calculation.

If we assume the speed is fairly constant throughout the press, the speed of the key will be 4mm over 1/10 of a second, giving us 0.04ms^-1

The equation for kinetic energy is '1/2 mv^2 '. With the mass of the keycap and stem combined coming to around 0.002Kg that gives us...

Kinetic energy = 1/2 x 0.002 x 0.04^2 = 1.6x10^-6 J

That's not much... Even compared to just compressing the spring, that's not much, like 1500 times less 'not much'.

But we're trying to get fit here or something, right? So we may as well include it. Every little helps and all that.

2.4x10^-3 + 1.6x10^-6 = 2.4016x10^-3 J

.

Now the human body isn't 100% efficient, nothing is. A ballpark figure for humans is that we're roughly 25% efficient at converting our food in to mechanical output.

So the amount of food energy we need to burn to press the keys is going to be around 4 times the value we had before.

2.4016x10^-3 x 4 = **9.6064x10^-3 J per press**


*Ding ding ding!*  
It looks like we finally have a value for the energy used per key press! 

.

Now, how many keypresses do we do?

Sampling 10 random maps within the 5* range I got an average objects/second of ~3.6. You can see my data [here](http://puu.sh/iIQPR/ab5b78da20.png) if you're interested.

Assuming you play non-stop, which you will be unless you're a filthy casual, you're going to wrack up just shy of 13,000 keypresses an hour!

Multiplying this by the energy per keypress we worked out earlier, we get a value of 125J per hour purely by clicking!

A calorie is roughly 4.2J, so we will have burned roughly 30 calories in an hour's clacking! Small calories that is, dietary calories are 1000 times larger, so at this rate it's going to take just over a year and a half of constant play to offset a regular hamburger, so you better get playing!

EDIT: Lots of you have questions about the calculations, sorry I can't get back to all of you! [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/3bo3pp/how_many_calories_does_playing_osu_burn/csojlgn) one of my responses that I hope will answer some of your questions!

EDIT 2: If anyone has something like a cycling heart rate monitor/calorie counter, or even better a HR monitor and spirometer, I'd love to hear your much more valid results!
I will see if I can find my pulse oximeter later and do some testing myself!","1435709397"

From him, his ""apology"":


""On The 12th of December an editorial was published that I wrote regarding a series of lawsuits pertaining to the United States machine gun ban of 1986. I based my opinions upon patterns I have observed over the years pertaining to firearm legislation, the historical evolution of the inner workings of the Unites States legal system, and series of personal experiences with our judicial system.
When we say no politics here on TFB we mean that rather than be bombarded with political opinions or propaganda, you will see little but firearm related information and the best media coverage we can provide. However, what we will do is follow interesting developments in litigation and legal questions that are pertinent to our great pastime.


The editorial I wrote was entitled “Why The Machinegun Ban Will Not Go Away”. I argued that despite new and interesting developments regarding challenges to the Hughes Amendment (or what some may colloquially refer to as the machine gun ban), there is little chance of it going away. This ban is shrouded in controversy due to questionable legality and the way it was passed, but it is unfortunately the law of the land.


Many of you believe that I was taking an elitist approach towards this issue, implying that I believe there should be a financial requirement to practicing the second amendment, when in fact I have published that I would like to see this ban lifted on at least five separate occasions. Some said I was taking a defeatist attitude; This is valid. My lack of optimism for this ban being overturned and my lack of faith in the judicial system overturning it resulted directly in me explaining why in my article. I believe firmly that restrictions should be eased on these firearms, and those implying I am simply trying to maintain my investments and praying for the ban to stay are incorrect.
As for my statement regarding the lawyer handling and filing the lawsuits: I deal with litigation constantly and am generally suspicious of lawyers, especially when it involves a class action lawsuit or asking for public donations. I apologize to Mr. Stamboulieh if he is sincere in his efforts to repeal the ban, which I believe he is. Shortly after the article went live, he contacted me via email to assure me that his goal is in fact this simple – to repeal the ban. Of course the courts will decide on this in the future and I do wish him and his camp luck in their endeavor. Having opened a dialogue with Mr. Stamboulieh, he has proven to be both passionate and sincere.


As for the closing of the comments of the article: That was not my call to make. This now is my most commented upon article I have ever written, and the task of moderation was simply too much for the staff to bear, so they made the call. With any luck, this video will have answered some of your questions or at least addressed some of your grievances.


Firearm ownership is a right in the United States, and I have always believed this. If my editorial offended you in a way that I did not intend then I do apologize, and I hope that we can maintain your readership. We do this because we love this, and I would like to thank those who have continued to follow our humble blog over the years. At the very least I can assure everyone watching this video that our intentions will always be noble and that our duty to the truth is unwavering.""","1435709397"

At one point I had some similar sentiments to you, but having trained there for some time now I don't hold that same view point anymore, and I'll try to explain why.

Our instructor has a core curriculum that he tries to teach his students, so that when all else fails you can fall back on that core. That's not to say that other styles are ineffective, it's just that his curriculum is what he is effective at teaching and implementing (he's said it himself, at other styles he's a high blue at best and he's not confident teaching them). That being said, I'd have to say that my normal style that I've adopted from having trained at a lot of other gyms is radically different from what he teaches, but I can't say that he's ever discouraged me from it. In fact after class he'll teach me some more ""weird"" moves that explicitly fall out of his curriculum, because he thinks they'd fit well into my game, even though they're not techniques that he would do himself.

Now having developed that core base that I can fall back on has helped my game a lot. That base is what allows me to experiment better, because when I experiment and fuck up, then I can return to my core base and start over.

I think it's unfortunate that you had the experience there that you did, and I can understand how you came to that conclusion. It sounds like you visited a few years ago, and I only started training here in the past 2 years, but from what I've been told the instructor has become a lot less strict about these kinds of things in the past few years. Honestly, of all the gyms I've trained at, Smash has had the best environment for me. Multiple black belt instructors, a large female student base so that my girlfriend can train as well, and a good mix of competitors and non competitors with low ego.","1435709398"

It would seem that modern society is informed about tobacco and it's effect in general but there is nothing that supports that argument.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Despite what the other posts suggests, there are known biological mechanisms to explain intelligence. The factors are many and the effects vary. For ELI5 I'll try to avoid jargon or explain them. I will also assume a healthy well nourished person. Here are some of the simple ones that people may vary in:

The speed of neuron communication. Neurons are brain cells, the ""thinking cells"", your brain is made up on a network of roughly 100 billion neurons (and many other cells which). How well they communicate with each other is a factor to determining how fast a person thinks. There is a variation between how fast neurons communicate between person to person, but this variation is very small. The communication is a electrical signal sent via a chain of chemical reaction (which is actually quite slow). There is a genetic component which explains the variation to this communication speed but other things such as myelin sheath is an important factor to consider. The myelin sheath is an insulating material around the axons (parts of a neuron which is the 'wire' that signals travel down) and the health of the myelin sheath makes a large difference to how fast signals travel down the axon. People whose myelin sheaths are damaged or thinned have major cognitive deficits.

Another thing which affects the speed is the size of the brain. There comes a point where having a big brain actually slows processing because it takes longer for signals to travel from place to place. When you consider 100 billion neurons trying to co-ordinate, taking slightly longer can make a noticeable difference. This is one of the reasons why brain size is not perfectly correlated with intelligence.

The next thing is the number of neurons. The more neurons you have, generally the more processing power you have. This is one of the reasons why brain size IS somewhat correlated with intelligence.

The most important thing however is how well connected the neurons are. How many connections each neuron has depends on the type of neuron and where in the brain it is. Some neurons have up to 1000 connections with other neurons. The more connected neurons are, generally the smarter a person is. We observe that destroying connections do lead to cognitive deficits.

There are genetic components to this as with most things when it comes to variations between people. For example some people have genes which makes their neurons interact with neurotransmitters differently. Neurotransmitters are brain chemicals that neurons use to communicate with each other, you may have heard of dopamine or serotonin which are common examples. How neurons interact with neurotransmitters is incredibly complex, but we do have a decent understanding of the basics. How your neurons interact with them are mostly genetically determined. For example, we know that schizophrenia has a strong genetic basis, and those with schizophrenia have a dopamine related problem. We also know that schizophrenia has many associated cognitive deficits but is also implicated in creative thinking.

There are many many other things to consider when it comes to biological reasons why people people are smarter than others. I can't list them all, but other things to consider are the quality of glial cells (support cells) and relative sizes and quality of brain structure.","1435709399"

I have a couple friends who only smoke weed and tobacco mixed, so he just empties some of a cig and then chops it up with scissors to get a finer grind. He smokes it out of his bong, calls it maul hoots (I think it's nasty though haha).

I buy pipe tobacco for smoking out of my pipe, but once in a blue moon I will mix it with my weed and roll a spliff. The pipe tobacco comes in fairly large pieces that wouldn't fare well in a joint, so I would chop it up a bit more with scissors.

Again, I believe that guy literally meant that you should just use scissors if you want to cut up tobacco not a grinder.

http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/free-windows-10-upgrade-for-insider-preview-users/    

Even if you could install Windows 10 (and you can) it likely wouldn't be considered legitimately licensed and you'd have to tie it to a Microsoft Account which would be a huge pain in the ass.    

You might be eligible for this:     

https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/solutions/cloud-partner-program-benefits.aspx     

I haven't looked at the requirements for a while and they keep on changing them (it also used to be 10x licenses). Microsoft has a few ways to get under-20 licenses of Windows for free (\*not hassle free, just monetarily free). Might be worthwhile looking into that. The Action Pack is still available but I don't think a ""small factory"" would qualify.     

In general it is an internal political problem, but one you might be able to work around.   

You could also check eBay or some trusted reseller for Windows 7/8 licenses. Just be careful you aren't buying MSDN/Technet resold keys, they're worthless and illegitimate. Your license key should be physically part of a sticker or similar.    ","1435709401"

* Giving away your freedom to be more secure will end with no freedom at all.
* Keeping your freedom *to make others more insecure* ends with no security at all.

You need both of them, and must understand when you need to sacrifice one for the other. The important distinction is that you must shouldn't need to sacrifice your freedom to avoid getting hurt, but that requires that you (and everyone) sacrifice their freedom to hurt other people.

I don't think anyone would agree that me having a range filled with rabid raccoon that I leave out in the park every afternoon would be a good idea. I have my freedom to set rabid animals in places were they might bite other people taken away for a greater security.

Another example would be that, even though I am ""free to do whatever I want"" in my house, however I am not free to actually light my house on fire. I could do it legally, but I'd need to get permission (which is not what people would consider ""being free""). And this is not due to ""insurance fraud"" which, if it happened, would be something extra, but due to endangerment of our neighbors.

You are as free to be as long as it doesn't take away other's freedoms. You have to sacrifice those. The fact is that your freedom to not get your child a vaccine could lead to another child loosing their freedom to live, means that this is probably not a freedom you should have.

Officials have abused this logic instead to argue that some nebulous threat means you should give away your freedoms. This is absurd, security is supposed to allow you to keep more freedoms, not less!","1435709402"

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","My DM recently changed shortrests to 20 minutes. Our party is frequently on time-sensitive missions, and one hour always seemed like way too much time to spend idling around, recuperating from minor wounds.

Unfortunately, in our first session with the new shortrest rule, we took three shortrests... One following each of three minor dust-ups. It was only when our DM had us run a gauntlet (three floors of enemies guarding a BBEG) that we broke out of the ""nova-then-shortrest"" cycle. 

Part of me loves the 20 minute shortrests, as it makes my Battlemaster far more exciting to play. Now, I can make use of Superiority Dice against creatures that aren't necessarily top-threats. Similarly, our Warlock is no longer stuck with cantrips after the first scuffle of the day. However, I think there is definitely potential for abuse in a 20 minute shortrest system. 

For this reason, I've been thinking of suggesting a small change to my DM:

* 20 minutes for the first shortrest of the day
* 40 minutes for the second
* 60 minutes for any subsequent short rests

I think this would prevent some of the shortrest abuse, while simultaneously helping to ensure that Battlemasters, Warlocks, and Monks aren't resource-starved during those stretches when an hour shortrest is impossible. Naturally, I would advise that lengthier rests see elevated encounter rates. Enemy patrols interrupting a 20 minute rest may be unlikely, but with each additional increment of time, the chances of discovery and ambush should grow. ","1435709403"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Ok, lets break this down. Its all right here(thanks Ziazan for the link): http://imgur.com/a/lcMfB#0

Encounter one (slide 1): To me it seems like Batman is warning Deathstroke. He kicks him by surpirse, takes his gun and pushes him back, telling Slade that there won't be assassins in Gotham. Slade then rushes Batman and injures him.

Encounter 2 (slide 5): Batman beats the hell out of Slade and continues to tell him that there wouldn't be assassins in Gotham, Deathstroke gets ONE hit in, seriously, a single hit, and goes back to sniping. Batman pursues on.

Encounter 3 (slide 8): Batman beats on Deathstroke more, Slade says he's through playing around, Batman one hit KOs him.

I don't get how everyone sees this as Deathstroke owning Batman 3 times. 

He rushes Batman/beats him (seems like a rush to me, Bats seems to be trying to talk him down and get him to go away rather than fight)

Batman beats the hell out of DS, Slade hits bats once and escapes. 

Batman beats him up more and then one hits him after slade gets serious

&gt; 
&gt; The company I'm buying the mouthguard from has a mouthpiece with that design on it that I like, with that image, but they can no longer imitate it for me because they've tightened up their copyright policy. 
&gt; 
&gt; They said they would use it if I got permission from the copyright owner of that image. The problem is I can't find who that is. I've tried googling it but didn't get too many results. I found a marketing company that was given authority over his likeness but that search result was from 2004. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm here because I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice. Is there like a database of copyrights I can use? Or a person I can  contact to get that info?

For example we know that teams believe Boogie is available. We know there was drama on the Stauskas pick. We know they fired a promising coach, ostensibly because the GM didn't pick him. The GM and another top man Mullin left the organization, after hiring the current coach, Karl. Now a new regime is in place. We have heard reports that Vlade was unable even to properly scout many prospects due to his recent.

The front office is extremely, extremely, dysfunctional. We knew this before the results became apparent (Malone, Mullin, and the GM all leaving). We know it now. Almost by definition a dysfunctional front office would be having these leaks because that is like the opposite of functional. You probably have people there that have been apart of three different regimes or two different owners. Most have been apart of at least two. There is no loyalty there and clearly not a strong unity of purpose. 

As a 49ers fan I too wanted to believe the media was making this shit up. Despite their love for the dramatic, when you have such a variety of sources reporting dysfunction on a variety of levels you have to accept the pattern is there.","1435709406"

I haven't done much experimentation yet, not beyond little experiments with the law of assumption, synchronicity, lucid dreams and stuff, and I haven't seen much impressive results. I've had some unpleasant results with the original method of jumping, that was before I knew this sub or the concept of dimensional jumping, and without attempting to jump or change reality or anything else, using only a mirror, I experienced something like involuntarily moving toward the mirror and releasing some angry related to nothing, eventually I read certain disapproval by some occultists about doing that experiment careless without the adequate preparation, something about possibly releasing the shadow improperly, under the risk of ending in a mental asylum. 
Because of that I was really surprised when I found this sub that even add a candle to the process (which with the knowledge of some doctrines that use candles for rituals and its assertions about the effects of a candle light in the ""spiritual realm"", it makes me think that maybe it could turn the experiment even more dangerous), so I wonder if the majority of the people here really try the method the way its described in the original post.

&gt;Hey, would just like to say, as I seem to be the only one who hasn't had a say in this :D, that the bhopping in the intro is only for illustration purposes! It seems some are upset because it doesn't seem like normal bhopping. You're quite right, it isn't! It's clearly recorded in my own private server, after several retakes, purely to illustrate what I had learnt so far with bhopping and it's potential. I felt it was obvious land / air costs / air accel / tick rate different etc. are different to normal, you can see they are just from the footage. I did feel saying that I was learning (whilst the clip was playing :D) and that I was struggling in matchmaking (because these console commands are not enabled there) pointed this out. If people have an issue with those console scripts im not sure why they dont when I use similar ones to illustrate grenades / noclip / give myself inf ammo :D. In the end I feel these only demonstrate things better so will continue to demonstrate that way in my private server :) I was also using a g700s for the clip as it has an infinite scroll wheel (you bind jump to scroll wheel to make sure you don't loose speed), which doesn't bug most of the time, whether this helps you guys do entirely pointelss bhops in matchmaking, I hope it does :D Happy Hunting!

&gt;(Some people also seem worried because another YouTube got autoflagged for reuploading part of this video :D Dont worry! I messaged him soon as I saw the flag to see if I could sort it, as it's a network autoflag thing I don't have immediate control over. I'm surprised he didn't screenshot the message so people worried could know it was being fixed hopefully! I must be an interesting video title for other people to speculate on :D)

Except that's pretty much *never* how WMATA runs their trains on the weekend. It's like they just refuse to make even token attempts at basic train spacing.

It's even better when the YL is running only to Mt. Vernon, and the GL is running every 20 minutes, and they keep having the northbound YL pull into L'Enfant *right* behind the GL train, making you wait the full 20 minutes for the next train.

However, sure, I don't think anyone would argue with running the SL the full run off-peak if during rush hour it stopped at EFC or WFC. At rush hour that lets you run more trains on both the SL and the OL/BL, making service better for everyone.","1435709410"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The problem with adding auto attacks back in is that you can't auto attack while casting, and in WM you should always be casting.  So it makes sense that we can't auto attack.  

Actually, I disagree with you on one point; WM *should* be a big enough boost that we should always have it on whenever possible.  Otherwise it's not worth using at all, except for when you need burst (and overall dps isn't the important factor).  

I think the reason sidewinder doesn't change the math right now is the fact that it's bugged and can be used outside of WM, even though the TT says otherwise.  If you took that away, I'm guessing that WM played well would indeed be a boost in DPS.  But then again, SW is on a 60 second CD, so it can't possible be a big increase.  I'm inclined to agree that gear may play a larger role than we're seeing right now, especially once we start gearing at Alex levels and above.  Remember, this is the just the ""starting"" gear at level 60.  Each patch will increase the iLvL, and stats will start to matter much more again.  The best of what we're wearing right now is basically equivalent to what Darklight was to level 50.  As some have noted, secondary stats are currently not having much of an impact, and I suspect that's because SE is paving the way for much higher amounts of those stats in the future.  

Basically, there's two ways to look at how WM *should* be.  It's either a turret mode that is a substantial dps boost while you're in it, or it's a ""stance"" that gives access to abilities that are useful enough to make up for the disadvantages.  I had assumed at first that it was meant to be a turret mode, and I'm still thinking that's the case, given the nature of abilities like IJ and the fact that EA is on a short 15 second CD.  I think SE intended for it to be a big enough DPS boost that players would want to be in it as much as possible, with the tradeoff being the lack of mobility.  The problem is that whatever gains we may see on a dummy don't translate well to real fights, and are so insignificant that the only use people can see for it is for the opener or for special circumstances where high bust is needed.  If it were meant to be a ""stance"", then the abilities it opens up need to be much more powerful than what we have, because as it is staying in WM is simply not worth it most of the time.  And we would need to be able to toggle it on and off at will to make the most of it.

I think what would make the most sense to ""fix"" it would be to do two things: increase the damage buff to 30% and reduce all the cast timers (including that on WM itself) to 1 second.  That would make it feel far less clunky and make staying in the stance worthwhile, while allowing us to leave it when needed and get back into it quickly.","1435709412"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The supreme court didn't say it was created for hunting, recreation, or self defense, just that it protects those traditionally lawful uses of guns.

On what constitutional basis can they say this? They can't just make it up.

&gt;It was created so that if necessary the ordinary civilians can form a militia to defend themselves and their freedom.

Again, it was not created for personal self-defense. It was created to protect the Union.

&gt;It was definitely an individual right, because if individuals couldn't possess and use guns legally then they wouldn't be able to form and effective militia if necessary.

It absolutely was not. It was a right created for the people as a whole, not for every individual.

&gt;There is no revisionist history here,

The absolutely is. There is a massive revision of history. As the ex-chief justice of the Supreme Court Warren E. Burger said, a staunch conservative, the Second Amendment ""has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud—I repeat the word 'fraud'—on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime."" He also said ""the Second Amendment doesn't guarantee the right to have firearms at all."" The purpose of the Second Amendment was ""to ensure that the 'state armies'—'the militia'—would be maintained for the defense of the state.""

&gt; Or do you simply think it is unneccessary for us to be able to form such a militia, and that the second amendment is outdated and no longer needed?

I don't ""simply"" think it. If you think you and loosely formed group of people could take on the U.S. military, even with military style guns, you're nuts. If they ever wanted to, they would drone you before you even knew it was coming. They could roll up on you with tanks. Or they could blast you with sonic weapons that would have you on your knees crying and puking. That's not to say you're in any way a wimp. It's just the reality of the situation.","1435709413"

&amp;nbsp;

^1 Assuming this ringworld has virtually no eccentricity to its orbit, and the star isn't variable, and the night shadows are equal in length, weather and climate should be consistent day after day for millennia. This means predictable rain, which can be collected for drinking. Drinking the blood of sea life might also be an option...

^2 As above, an unchanging climate means the growing season would never end. A number of small fruiting plants could be grown in sequence so that as one nears the end of its harvest cycle, another is nearly ready to begin.

- Both are selfish decisions.

- Both scenarios involve someone blaming their employer, because the employer failed to provide some benefit.
- Both are cases where people act in a way that violates human decency and deflects blame for that behavior.
- Pathologically speaking, spreading a cold to someone who has compromised respiratory health and is immuno-compromised could be fatal.

Him? Yes, you'll see why...

Daily he'd show up and just sit, and stare. One day, probably a weekend morning, while she was sleeping in and still recovering from the night before she woke up to the sound of splashing. 

The squirrel had jumped on to the screen, spread eagle and was pissing through it. She screamed, threw something at the screen to scare him off and she never saw him again.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt; Let's forget the fact that there is historical evidence of an established Jewish country in the area. 

There's historical evidence that Native Americans inhabited many cities, does that mean they are allowed to go take over those lands? The Arabs have historical evidence of Arabs in Spain, does that mean the Arabs can demand Spain? There's evidence that we all originate in Ethiopia too, *does that mean we can all demand our land in Ethiopia?* 

&gt;Let's also forget the fact that ""Palestine"" is not a people, it's a name for an area. 

[The world has already recognized the Palestinian people and their rights to self-determination in the 1970s] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3236), and now today there is an international consensus on that. Already over 138 countries have recognized the State of Palestine. 

&gt;Let's also forget the fact that Palestinians are treated worse if not murdered by their Hamas brothers in Gaza, their friends up north in Syria, to the east in Jordan which declines to assimilate them. Arabs in the West Bank arguably have the best life in the region. 

Red herring. Two wrongs don't make a right.

&gt;Let's forgot that if the situation was reversed as it's been in many Muslim countries Jews would be forced to leave and not accommodated by any means. 

Actually it was the Zionists who pushed 80% of the Palestinians out first. Then those remaining in Israel were subject to military law and were *different* than Jews *by law* until 1965, and the state still favors Jews today. Most the time Jews were being pushed out of Arab countries; the Zionists had already expelled either expelled the Palestinians or denied their rights.

No way to verify the domain owner also means you could have setup the DH side first (override DNS with hosts file to verify). Not a bad idea, particularly with a dynamic site, to make sure everything is working with the new host before changing DNS.

For the record you can have DH host a site/email without making them the name server. You could keep DNS with namecheap and point records to dreamhost. Usually better to do what you did and move the name servers to the host, that way the host can update if needed (e.g. they move you to a different server).

You can't go on stage saying things like ""this is an overclocker's dream"" and have the voltage and memory clock locked.

I don't know exactly what they're doing at AMD, but if they are planning to take the new memory architecture to the next level on their next generation then they should have waited. 

What about GCN 1.2? They took too long to release it. It didn't deserve all the hype they drummed up (at least have the thing unlocked for overclockers) It was supposed to trade blows with the highest end, not just cards in its price range. Review consensus is that it trades blows with the 980Ti, but everyone waiting for that kind of performance already got the 980Ti.

AMD really needs to pull something out of a hat. Not only do they need to release a *really* powerful flagship next generation either before or at the same time as Nvidia.

In seven years imaging trauma patients, and many, many gun shot wounds, I've never seen anyone shot with a wadcutter. In my (anecdotal) experience, .22 is most common, then various centerfire round nose bullets, then proper defensive hollow points.

So basically, it's a bullet, but not a terribly common one. And given the innumerable variety of foreign bodies one sees inside of people when working in radiology, this is not a shape I would jump right to the conclusion that it is a bullet.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Short sarky answer - Despite telly portrayals Medicine is not an exact science.  In other news: managers are hired to hit targets, water is wet, etc...

Longer answer:  I don't know what the reporters were expecting at the end of 4 weeks training?  To be let loose to go off script with what has to be assumed to be bare minimal medical knowledge.  The differential for ""chest pain"" is a full spectrum of stuff, from innocuous pains to serious stuff like heart attacks and aortic dissections.  The system has presumably been designed by clinicians to triage those apart as best you can over the phone - all without the help of fancy tests and scans as well as the chance for physical contact - with staff who by and large are not clinicall trained.  We (as a country) has opted for a triage system on the cheap to field initial presentations - well, ta da, this is what we get.  You can't be surprised at the outcome here...?!

The article also does a good job in conveying the reporters' feelings on realising how alone and scary clinical uncertainty feels (and it's a horrible feeling that will keep surprising you) and then taking this essential part of what medicine is to use it as an attack on the NHS.  This comes through the way that they treat getting an ambulance to anyone with chest pain as a ""win"" - thus offloading clinical anxiety onto someone else - and getting that the feeling that even if something bad happened - *it wasn't your fault because you sent an ambulance* - unfortunately, the reporters didn't get to see the side of medicine that shows that despite doing everything to the best of your ability - shitty stuff will still happen to people and that people still die regardless of what you do.  Efficient and effective medicine is in doing what is right, not always things that massages your conscience.  For example - we could CT Head everyone who comes in with a head injury - *y'aknow - just in case*.  Whilst I'd be happier knowing that the patient almost 100% doesn't have a bleed - I have to take it as clinical judgement and probability (based on robust NICE guidelines on who to scan or not).

The article does highlight a couple of good points though - the fiddling of data is deplorable - but you have to remember that the NHS is an organisation run by and staffed with *humans* - and like everyone else, there will be people who would happily fiddle data to meet targets and hide problems for personal gain.

The other point highlighted is just how short staffed we are across the board - people are very quick to dismiss any public sector discontent as ""you should be grateful for what you got, cos I pay your wages"" etc... but there's a breaking point when enough staff go off sick or leave for other professions/countries that means that we are no longer able to run the service that we want, but only to firefight the needs that we can.

When she saw the wall or more importantly from the article:

We had a steamy night of amazing sex, but when I woke up the next morning, he was gone.
I was heartbroken and humiliated.

So she had what she thought she wanted, a nice doctor (high SMV) and then he did to her what she was doing to dudes and it made her feel like shit and humiliated. AFTER that she decided that she wanted to settle down. Lets not omit that part.

Why would the dude settle for this?

Well since she was bought out, she had a much higher position than she is letting on. You dont buy out a stewardess. I am sure she was fun,

I think 8300 IP would have covered several basic rune page layouts and that is a fixed cost.  Basically, in the time it takes you to grind out one HOTS champion you can have the Runes and most of another top tier champion completed.

There is a bigger picture but if we are splitting hairs you can also argue that the cheapest champions are 1/4 the cost of HOTS as well with a lot of midrange options.  I'm just narrowing it down to one aspect, the ""top tier"" champions and the hours it takes to get one in each game.","1435709429"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","We were ready. Our plan was in motion.

When the President had signed the order, all those years ago, our grandparents had flown all the way out here. Millions of miles from Earth, millions of miles from America. But back then, America was good to colonists here. They lived a fairly simple life, mostly maintaining rovers and making sure everything was where it was supposed to be. There were a few disasters, sure, but nothing catastrophic, nothing that required teams going in and saving people. At least, not after they landed. But now, everything had changed. Other countries on Earth had colonized this planet, which I was fine with, but other people were very upset about. But now, Our colony and a couple others had attempted to declare independence from America. This was not a good idea. We were terrorists now. 

They had decided to declare independence after the American government had asked them to do more rigorous work. I can understand their concerns, what the Americans were asking us to do was not safe, and our only compensation was being allowed to live. I was ready to help the colony fight the Americans.

Our leader, a strong General, had gathered delegates in the capital. They agreed upon a message to send to America. A document with a ridiculous title. Our declaration of independence. This document, made freely available to everyone in the colonies involved, detailed our grievances, and made it clear that we would not be controlled by their tyranny. As soon as this message was sent out, we knew our time was limited. We knew we had to act imminently.

I worked in gathering intelligence, learning what was going on in America and the world, how they felt about our actions. We needed to know what was going on down there, so we would be prepared up here. I figured out where the news was coming from, and listened to it. I wrote down anything that had to do with us. That was my job.

Other people in this operation had other jobs, such as figuring out good places to hide and what to do when they inevitably came. We assumed that we would have the upper hand, because we knew what Mars looked like, we knew where we could hide, and how to attack. But a few years ago, the Americans had sent a rover. It was only supposed to do its job for a few months, but in the spirit of Spirit, it kept going and going and going. One of my friends had the job of disabling it, but in a way that made it look like an accident. I'm glad It wasn't me.

A few months passed with what was basically silence, then I heard from the President again. ""The Martians have attacked our equipment and issued a statement of war. We will not take this lightly. Us in America and on Earth will fight these terrorists. We will not let them get away with this. They will not listen to reason. They will not accept a diplomatic solution.""

The President then went on to detail the plans to attack us here, and then we all knew that they would be here soon. We were ready, and we would be prepared when they finally came.

Months later, a shuttle landed next to our colony. A bunch of American soldiers came out, and we fought them. They tried to invade our homes, but we put a stop to it. A lot of us died fighting them, but we won. A lot of them died, but some of them were captured. We destroyed their shuttle so that they couldn't go back.

We sent messages to America, and they responded. We negotiated, and they were not willing to give us our freedom. They knew we had hostages, and we could use that. Eventually, the Americans told us that they wouldn't make us do anything else after this. We wouldn't be under their laws, and we could start our own government. They agreed to do this and we agreed to send their soldiers back and allow people to immigrate here from America. The Americans told us that they would send a shuttle with immigrants, and we would send the soldiers back in that shuttle. We voted on this decision, and agreed that it was fair.

A year later, the shuttle came.  A bunch of people, wearing orange jumpsuits, came out of it.","1435709429"

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","The body is resonant (albeit not very much if it's a solid body). This creates an interaction with the string causing minor boosts and cancellations of certain harmonics. In other words, the woods vibrations affects the strings vibration for the same reason that two pickups (or any two sound sources) mixed together will 'scoop' certain frequencies while boosting others.

Wood structure and density differences can have an effect on this. It's not a simple matter of 'pine does x sound' or 'ash does x sound' though. Some types of wood like ash are highly varied in their density and weight and resonant tone. Others like maple are more consistent (but still never identical). 

Also neck structure and stiffness will have an effect on the tone (I'm convinced it effects the tone more than the body material and shape). This is why some guitars (especially fender basses) have 'dead spots' on the neck where the sustain is reduced on certain notes compared with others.

This is more audible with brighter pickups and dynamic pickups (e.g. low output single coils) than bassy ones more compressed ones (high output humbuckers), and becomes less of a factor the more you distort the signal.

So tone wood is a thing, but not much of a thing compared with amps, pickups, snug glue joins, a well fastened bridge...

Most guitarists won't care much about the small difference body types make, unless one is comparing extremes (e.g. a hollow steel body compared with a mahogany one). Others will analyse every part of their tone. Which is why this argument never gets resolved. Human hearing and subjectivity is the biggest variable of all.

Im talking about a system where you must allow yourself to be conscripted to get a government job OR, and this is the one that gets me, allow yourself to be conscripted so you can get an education. 


That's a system that is inherently built to funnel individuals who can't afford an education into allowing themselves for conscription. 


Also it doesn't matter when the last conscription was, we can't see 5-10 years in the future, conscription isn't some regular event that takes place every X amount of years.

A more direct option would be to check out either organisations in your area that assist people with disabilities- I'm sure there would be PLENTY of grateful people there who would love a volunteer to give some company to the large number of lonely people in the community. Or you could look up forums directly online of illness that cause people to be in wheelchairs or whatever else you felt interested in helping with, and start by asking there how they would recommend you make such an offer- you would probably get some requests.

"sewing","t5_2sczp","I usually trace out the first draft from the clothing with something flimsier and less expensive--usually random paper I have lying around. This way, if I need to make obvious alterations to the pattern (true up an edge, etc.), I can do it before I get a sturdier pattern (wastes less good paper). This may not be necessary for you depending on 1) how old the garment is that you are making a pattern from, 2) how many times you have worn the garment, 3) how much stretch/give the fabric has, and 4) how good you are at getting the initial traced pattern true to grain. 

Older garments, garments that have been worn a lot, and fabrics that give and stretch may have been stretched out of the shape that they originally were when they were cut from a pattern themselves. For example, a pattern piece drafted off the front of a pair of jeans might be crooked at the knee due to the cotton stretching over the knee with wear. Therefore, after tracing off this pattern, it must be ""trued up"" such that it the new pattern piece is straight, matching the grain of the new denim you plan to use to make the duplicate jeans. 

Also consider that your favorite old shirt/pants may have stretched significantly with wear or may stretch after wearing versus just out of the wash. For example, again with jeans, if you draft a pattern off an old pair of jeans and cut the new jeans out of new, unworn denim, it may stretch more than you think (the old denim has stretched almost to the max, but the new denim still has room to stretch). In a similar manner, pay attention to fiber content (is there spandex, elastine, etc. in the new fabric that isn't in the old), which can make your newly sewn replicate fit differently than the original. If your jeans fit way too tight out of the wash, but feel better after a week of wear, remember to cut your new pattern off the stretched-out size (but take account for stretching: see above). 

Many of these points could be brought up with just regular sewing, but I find with patterns drafted off favorite clothing, people are less tolerant of having to make a toile first. (""The original fit, so why doesn't the new!"") Just be patient, and keep in mind that you may need to alter your pattern. ","1435709433"

So if the thought process you mention in your post is something you experience quite often, that might be something worth looking into. 

Regardless, that sort of blow to her self-esteem is going to be tough to come back from. I'm sure she *knows* she's not objectively the most beautiful woman in the world. But you want your boyfriend to think you are. Being made to feel unsexy by your partner is something that's pretty hard to recover from. I think if you've got any chance of getting past this you need to be complimenting the hell out of her, and make them genuine, specific compliments. A generic ""you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!"" is probably going to feel false to her now. Also: don't just tell, show. You can compliment her every five minutes but if you don't show through your actions that you think she's sexy and beautiful it's not going to be enough.  ","1435709437"

But in that regard, I dont think its the story you focus on, as that is a miniscule part of levelling up, but instead the open world stuff. Thats perhaps where the issue lies.

Even if they don't trust you, if you have other girls backing you up (or, perhaps better, if you back up other girls), they should at least consider what you have to say. And if they don't, you might want to decide if they're really worth being friends with.

That said, in the mean time perhaps you could consider arranging to spend some time with the other girl, just the two of you. That way she wouldn't be completely cut off from *all* of her friends, and you'd have someone more likely to be on your side if any later drama develops.","1435709440"

At that point, they thought it might just be too early, maybe dates were off, etc., so I went back the next week to see if there was progress.  Unfortunately for me, there was still no fetal pole or yolk sac, only the gestational sac (which had grown slightly, but not significantly).  Ultimately, it was what they call a ""blighted ovum.""  However, during this ordeal I did a ton of research, reading zillions of forum posts by other women, and I really think it really could go either way.  There are plenty of positive outcomes that happen due to the ultrasound simply being too early.  I will hope for the best for you.","1435709440"

I have heard that it's possible to modify the game to allow for true 3D (3D minus PS1 issues) and then have a modified emulator that takes advantage of that.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","To add to my previous responses now that I am on a real PC and not a cell phone:

Getting a co-op job, especially your first one, can be very challenging.  I have had several classmates and friends apply for as many as 25 positions with only a few interviews granted, and no job.  An eight month co-op is a great opportunity to show that you can really develop in a position.

A good exercise would be to set goals for specific skill development at this co-op, and then evaluate yourself on how you did or did not achieve them.  Even if it is something as simple as diligence regarding paperwork or time management.  It is very likely that you have to do something like this for the school side of the co-op already.  Any examples of documentation that you produce, that you are allowed to take with you, are a great way of showing a future employer that you are able to write decent reports.  This is an often overlooked skill in my opinion.  Being able to convey information to others in a concise and clear manner is very useful.

You can also document the project you worked on an identify general and specific skills used for your resume/CV.  It is very likely that you will get asked in future interviews what you learned from previous experience, and a detailed answer will go a long way.  Don't be afraid to reference non-technical aspects, such as personal interactions and incidences where you contributed to a project, it will show that you are capable of cooperating with others.

I wish you luck in your decision!

Since, y'know, everyone is gonna talk about their favorite ships and  such, I raise [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/b0881bd68a5de527a50827429708a3fe/tumblr_nq2qjogJ421uvnmxpo1_1280.jpg). The dynamic between Kumiko and Reina was just too...great? I don't really know how to describe it in words, but just watching them both on the screen at the same time was just amazing. Nothing against Shuuichi x Kumiko, but they just didn't have that same...magic to them y'know?

Hibike Euphonium is one of the few shows to actually make me just so anxious. While waiting for the results to the contest in the last episode, watching the auditions, watching the teacher announce who was going to be in the performance, just...everything.
I absolutely adored this show all the way through, and it made my Tuesdays every week.","1435709449"

His ball handling was really huge in multiple playoff series when teams game planned harder.

I have no doubt that Ibaka can hit more 10-12 footers than dray, and he is for sure a better shooter. But dray only launches 3s and shoots inside the restricted area.

The individuals acting out with horrible behavior are totally taking advantage of your emotional attachment.

After a while, after enough BS, it's important to recognize that ""good"" can be lost.  Sure, with hard work, a person can be good again...  a bad person can have the potential to be ""good""...  but they're still bad, and you still need to be careful.

Each to their own, I'm sure there are absolutely women out there who have a list like this, probably in an area where guys like this exist (hedge fund managers? Wall street? a Real Housewives' set?) but these are not realistic for most women. 

I've been married for a long time, and I'm not dating. But what I'd want for my friends- is just a guy who has his shit together and is nice to them. Debt happens. People with their shit together chip away at it. They might have a car, or a truck, or they might not need a car because they're in a super bike friendly city and don't need one. Maybe they have child support, or not. If they do- just have your shit together and don't be all tangled with your ex. 

A good friend of my husband's does not have a job, is not looking, and has no intention to look. I've told him- that's probably going to be a deal breaker for a lot of women (he's 31, with a little inheritance.)

The Kahr is a bit more of a handful but it's perfectly manageable.  I like .40 as a round because it does have a nice niche in the market.  It penetrates more then 9mm (excluding +p) and carries with more ammo then .45.  

I like .40 as I like the bigger hole yet still more rounds.  Also I like that even during the ammo crunch I could find it on Walmart or my LGS's shelves.  The cost over 9mm is negligible to be as a box of 20 9mm SD JHPs are about 25 bucks on the shelf and .40 is between 2 and 5 bucks more.  I do not reload so I don't worry about the brittle brass issues that are claimed in many .40 handguns.

He leaves her to be discovered while he runs off *with her heart* and challenges Batman to find him before the device keeping her heart functioning stops beating, leaving doctors incapable of replacing it and saving her life.](/spoiler)

It's very much a comic book story, it's not grounded in reality, but the themes in it are dark, desperate, and horrifying. Most of the story features Batman desperately trying to reach Hush, while wrestling with the very same horror's he deals with in Arkham Knight ""It's all my fault"", ""this wouldn't have happened if I kept my distance"" etc. etc.

Dini's quite capable of doing dark stories, and he's never shied away from them. In the cartoons he goes lighter because it's for a younger audience, in his comics he often delves into very dark themes.","1435709455"

Democrats who tried to out-Republican Republicans in their districts got their asses handed to them in the last election. Sanders' views aren't that different from what American people want. But the people don't know that. It's as you said - in the political and especially media landscape, Sanders is portrayed as an extremist, fringe element. And he doesn't have nearly the weight (recognition) other names have.  
That's not a fault of Sanders, but one of the media landscape and the two party system of the US. And I do actually think that Hillary winning the Democratic nomination will disenfranchise a good number of D voters while doing very little to appeal to republicans or independents. It could easily hand the Rs the election. Then again it is a two party system and even with low turnout from Ds, the drive to keep Republican crazies out might just be strong enough.","1435709460"

Die Hard 2 effectively acknowledges the implausibilities inherent in its premise, allowing them to move on with the story. I will admit, having Willis repeat his catchphrase from the first movie is cheesy, but Die Hard as a whole works as an unironically good action flick.

Live Free or Die Hard? Well the title is definitely cheesy as hell. I think it's pretty good, though obviously not as good as the first two. There's too much CG in place of practical effects for my taste (like the car that flips through the air and almost crushes Willis and Long). The scale of the action is too big for the franchise, but I see it as a sort of bridge between '80s/'90s action and the excess of modern blockbusters. Even though it turns McClain into a sort of superhero figure, it manages to have some humanizing moments too. The daughter and how she's used is annoying, though.

For example maybe i do not need healing but the tank does, i could place the asylum centered around the tank rather than having to move near the tank, place the asylum and move back and end up taking damage from the boss's aoe attack.

Maybe a completely new ability or spell that is effectively an ice asylum, but doesn't heal the caster and doesn't share cooldowns with other healing abilities. It wouldn't be as powerful (5-10% healing instead of up to 40%) and it would have diminishing returns if taking too much healing in a short period of time.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I'm going to go off some assumptions here. Either the people you spoke to were describing old testament (or Judaism) in which there is no real agreed upon afterlife, or the people you spoke to were focusing on the word 'great' in the sentence ""described in great detail"" as all descriptions in the bible about heaven are sort of vague descriptions of a place in which God is praised and everything is good/perfect. 


Everyone here could maybe provide better more accurate responses if you linked to your post so we could read your original question as well as the responses. I assume there was some sort of miscommunication as to either the question being asked or the details of the responses given. 

I went through your history and discovered this post, which is the one I'm assuming you are referring to. 



http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3behtn/hell_is_never_mentioned_in_the_bible_wut/


If that is the thread you are referring to then it seems the arguments are focusing on ""great detail"". The bible mentions heaven but it seems to describe the peripherals, the things related to heaven rather than heaven itself. Those arguing with you are trying to communicate that heaven itself it never fully realised in an apt description, the things described are new Jerusalem on earth, visions of God's throne, and people ascending to heaven in different manners. 


In Christian doctrine this makes some sense as heaven would be a ""perfect"" place beyond our understanding, thus any descriptions wouldn't be presented in great detail but instead in minor glimpses and vague descriptions. ","1435709467"

The best possible result is that it is a waste of money, but it also has the potential to have the opposite than intended effect and lead to negative views of the agency creating it. 

It's like propaganda that calls everyone and anyone *Hitler* or *Stalin*, just because the names sounds scary. It's so amateur that it's not *really* propaganda, it's more like someone with more budget than knowledge saying:

&gt;Hey, I know what will *really* scare them!

Also in terms of PC's being captured, I tend to find that if the monsters are more likely to capture PC's than the PC's are likely to capture the monsters, it basically makes the monsters the good guys (they capture instead of kill, while the PC's don't). It's not a solution, unless your PC's happen to be inclined to largely capture enemies rather than kill (it's possible, but a lot of players seem to think they should be able to kill wontonly, but then some special thing should save them and merely capture them when they are all knocked down by combat)","1435709468"

The studs themselves can lead to bruising due to being a hard surface, but generally it's the fact that all of the player's force is concentrated to the bottom of their boot that causes the sprains, strains and fractures of large bones and serious, career-ending injuries that are associated with bad tackles.

That white space was the part that symbolized the ""heaven ordained supremacy"" bullshit, not the battle flag.

I 100% agree that the Confederate flag is a symbol of oppression, I'm just saying the quote had absolutely nothing to do with the design of the flag you see today. It already existed for almost two years before Thompson ever designed the version that your quote is about, and was designed by some dude named William Porcher Miles. The design of it had nothing to do with white supremacy, and he actually made the cross a diagonal St. Andrew's Cross specifically so Southern Jews wouldn't feel excluded.

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","&gt;Tanabe is quick to point out that he isn’t in charge of all of Metroid. That’s Nintendo producer Yoshio Sakamoto. So while it’s still possible that a Wii U Metroid is in the offing, it just won’t be from Tanabe’s Prime offshoot series.

God. The way they treat Prime like a spin off is downright insulting, it's as if it doesn't deserve to be held in the same regard as the 2D titles. 

And then there's Sakamoto being the only hand on Metroid that bugs me. The man's sexist mind is literally poison on the series, and yet Nintendo leaves him in charge. Japanese respect is so weird. They were so willing to throw Gunpei Yokoi under the bus for the Virtual Boy mistake, but they let the Metroid brand be damaged by letting Sakamoto have the full reins? Sheesh.

Oh well, I'm sure the game will be good at least. I really do want it to sell well at least, because I don't want Nintendo to be scared of change. Next time though, they should be more mindful of the visuals.","1435709474"

"mormon","t5_2qky2","I think you are misunderstanding the frustration.   Its a frustration that I have personally experienced over the last 7 years.  It is my experience that when Mormons engage in conversation with exMormons there is little or no attempt to understand the indvidual exMormon perspective.   

I already understand the Mormon perspective.  I understand why people believe.   However even with this understanding when engaging with an individual I like to deepen my understanding of why that individual believes as it varies quite a bit from member to member.  

In all the conversations I have had over the years if asked I could a give a detailed accounting of the beliefs of hundreds of Mormons.  What they believe.  What events in their life were influential to their beliefs.... etc... etc..  Why do I know this?  Because I ask.  I ask a lot of detailed questions. I want to understand as much as one can through conversation.  

In fact, it has been my experience that many Mormons haven't thought about their core epistemology or methodologies.  One of the goals I have when conversing with a Mormon is to help them arrive at their own bedrock of belief (even if that foundation is different than mine and reaches a different conclusion than mine).  

Now. How many Mormons in the last 7 years (friends, family, church leaders etc...) have made an attempt to understand my core beliefs.  What I believe, why, what is the methodology I utilize to reach the conclusions, what are my values, etc... etc... 

I have attempted to have this conversations with hundreds of Mormons (usually after they initiated the conversation) but (and this is entirely subjective) I have only ever known ONE Mormon that has attempted to understand the core of my beliefs.  My aunt.  Why did she take this inititiative whereas nobody in my immediate or extended family has?  Nobody from my ward?  My mission?  I have made it very clear that I am an open book on this topic.  These conversations have been started by me and by others,  but they never go anywhere.  

Why then did my aunt?   Because she was taking a class that asked her to do just that.  Find someone that has beliefs that contradict yours and try to understand them.  This was a college course she was taking.  Her first thought was me and she knew I would be receptive.   But without this class she never would have taken the initiative.  

I am not trying to argue that there are no Mormons that desire understanding the beliefs of someone that contradicts their own, but I am saying that this characteristic (based on my subjective experience) is extremely common outside of Mormonism and extremely rare inside of Mormonism.   

So how do these conversations with Mormons usually go there isn't a professor explaining to them how to do it?   They try to tell you why you don't believe.  When my sister was confronted with my atheism her knee jerk response was to probe into my sex life.   My parents tried to call me to repentance.   Church leaders asked me to pray.   Whenever my differing belief was a topic of discussion with a Mormon that conversation would quickly steer away from me explaining my position to them explaining me my position and offering a solution.  Books were constantly recommended to me by people that assumed I had a problem with the history of the church.  Conference talks were sent to me.  Testimonies were bared.   

Initially these conversations were very frustrating but I have since learned to just accept that this is normal Mormon behavior.  Mormons propensity to understand a worldview that contradicts their own is very low.  I don't think this is a Mormon unique trait I just think that it is something that especially apples to Mormons.   

Reddit is a great place because the rare Mormon that does desire this type of conversation occasionally does pop up.  But I have never experienced in the real world from a Mormon.  I have with many Christians (usually the more liberal ones), many atheists, agnostics, sikhs (yes even them, the few that I have met were very interested in deep conversations), jews (especially jews) etc... etc... 

Mormons?  Not so much.   And its to bad because a huge chunk of the people that interact with ever day ever week are Mormon.  I work with Mormons (live in Salt Lake) nearly all of my extended family is Mormon, all of my immediate family is Mormon etc...  

But none of them are interested in introspective deep conversation.   I luckily have found enough people to satisfy this itch in my real life and internet life but the desire persists that MAYBE just maybe a parent, a cousin, a former mission companion, highschool friend, will show some desire to understand.  But won't hold my breath.   My attempts with my friends and family have always reminded me of their deep deep desire that I return to the religion.  I do not desire that they leave (at least not in the same way).   ","1435709478"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","&gt;Not Catholic, so I'm not who you're addressing here. Nevertheless, I want to say that you seem to be placing too much emphasis on the action of the Supreme Court -- their legal and official designation of traditionalist Catholics like yourself as bigots (as you see it) -- at the expense of acknowledging the societal conditions that made that action possible. While I wouldn't want to understate the importance of the ruling, I do think we should keep in mind that the United States is still a democracy (or it is, at least, pertaining to this issue), and what is legal and official can only follow on the heels of what is sanctioned by the public, even if only implicitly.

As I said elsewhere, it's a feedback loop. The Court wouldn't have done what it did without a public concept, but the Court pushed forward an idea it didn't have to and in a way that has significant effects.

And no, the Court is not democratic. It's not a democracy as concerns this issue. It's explicitly not. And the only democratic action that can override this would be a constitutional amendment, which is unheard of. But what happened here was absolutely not sanctioned by the public. In fact, the ruling overruled over *half* of the states' laws on gay marriage.

&gt;Yes, there has been a large measure of judicial activism on gay marriage, but let's face it: if the public felt greatly passionate about the trajectory of gay marriage over the past decade, we would have seen the pitchforks by now. 

They passed laws to protected marriage in almost every state. Did you want them to be violent...? There's only so much they can do.

&gt;There would be a widespread movement to have the Constitution amended, and perhaps to have the offending judges impeached.

Passing a constitutional amendment on anything is nearly impossible. By design. For *any* issue.

&gt;But we haven't seen that, and the reason is that Kennedy's opinion (along with similar opinions by his colleagues at the state level) has only articulated a conception of homosexuality that has become increasingly shared.

Sort of. The particular legal justification is not shared by that many people. But the idea that they should be able to get married is, I agree.

&gt;I doubt you would really disagree with any of this. I bring it up only because it's easy to lose sight of who your ire should really be directed at here: namely, your fellow citizens who have created an environment in which the Court's decision could become possible. 

I wasn't directing anything at the Court as such (though the opinion itself was legally abominable; one of the absolute worst). I was simply explaining the effect of the ruling. It pushes the average joes that way, the middle folks, into viewing anti-gay marriage people as bigots. That's all the point was.

&gt;It's unlikely that many opinions were fundamentally altered by the Court's decision, and so realistically, if Catholics such as yourself are perceived as bigots in the eyes of society, then it is to an extent no greater or lesser than two weeks ago. (Again, this is not to understate the influence the Court's decision will have -- it's only to say that public opinion is the main driving force behind this issue.

This simply isn't true. People in the middle really didn't have strong opinions on it. Obviously people who were against gay marriage aren't suddenly going to change. But their children and grandchildren will in no way hold the same views as them. That was my point.","1435709479"

The Tripelennamine though... I would be /very/ interested in trying that. After reading more about it, it sounds rather grand. 

So, if you ever get the chance to try Pentazocine, for novelity sake, sure. As a recreational drug... not really. Actually, it only took me nearly a decade to remember this, it /might/ be a worthwhile drug, as I forgot it was a mixed antagonist/agonist, and... I was addicted through-out that time (Near the beginning of the addiction that lasted well 7 more years) So everytime I took it, it was throwing me into withdrawal's... Or at least very acute withdrawals. Which would explain why I always threw-up on it, and I always just thought I just did too much, I only did try it 4-5 times because I just couldn't find a dose that didn't make me sick... I was an absolutely idiotic teenager, and I guess adult since it took me over a decade to put two and two together.

"AFL","t5_2qhoy","A whack to afl commentators regarding ducking. I watched the Hawthorn v Essenodn game the other day and I was baffled by the way they talked about Puopolo. They said what he does is not ducking, he just carefully lowers his height to evade the tackle. Yet this is the exact same thing Lindsay Thomas was crucified for after his game against Essendon.

If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a bloody duck.

For the record I have no issue with the way Puopolo or Thomas go about their football. They get to the ball first, and they have the right to try and evade the tackle. If they get a sloppy tackle in the meanwhile, well that's the tackler's problem, and not the ball carrier.

But I want some consistency from those in the AFL world, and that's never going to happen with these new ducking rules.

Frees are now given or not given based on the reputation of the ball carrier and not the act of ducking. If you cop a high arm and you have the ducking tag by the public you will not receive a free, whilst blatant ducks are still being called as head high.

But here's the problem with this...

There's been people fighting against this flag from before someone entered a church.  So are we really going to claim that they should condemn all the symbols that they may not even know about?  

From what it looks like, this is going to get personal because the flag means two different things to two different groups.  It's why I said in my original statement ""Welcome back to the Civil Rights Era"" because you're going to see this play out with a lot of emotion on both sides about what the symbol means.

That's why I emphasize so much to look at the history.  It at least helps to explain the parts that need understanding about how that symbol came to be that way.  I can't say much more than that.","1435709487"

I'll grant one thing, though -- they have relaxed their old policy of permanent quarantine.  Until 1994, if you got HIV, you were locked up permanently.  Now, it's two months, followed by monitoring to make sure you don't give it to anyone else, and any violation is what puts you back in prison.

&gt; While Cuba's successful HIV/AIDS strategies are virtually unmatched anywhere else in the world, many ethical issues are raised by the country's policies. The most controversial part of the program is the mandatory quarantining of every HIV positive individual for eight weeks, even if this policy is legally founded. Patients who leave after these eight weeks and engage in unsafe sex will find themselves in permanent quarantine. This sanatoria policy along with mandatory HIV testing of pregnant women and those infected with other sexually transmitted diseases, and provision of names of all sexual partners of those infected with HIV, violate many individual rights.

You probably cannot sue DFAS successfully, but he can contact:

- His Base Inspector General
- His own First Sergeant
- His own Commander
- The Commander of the Finance unit.
- His Congressman.

This is coming from the view of an Enlisted person, so if he's an officer the First Shirt might be skipped over.  I can't see DFAS blowing off anyone above the rank of Captain though, so I'm assuming Enlisted.  From that point of view, the First Shirt in specific is supposed to help him deal with exactly this sort of issue.

All of these people are responsible for addressing morale issues, which this most certainly qualifies as.  If everything is properly documented, they will usually be reasonable, take your side, and light a fire under someone's ass.

Nothing gets the gears turning like a high-ranking officer whose troop is in danger of being non-deployable because *someone else* is fucking up.  In case you're wondering, yes, a $3600 pay discrepancy will put your father in danger of being non-deployable.

"SFGiants","t5_2s5xr","Yeah, I totally saw where you were coming from, I just wanted to say why I didn't like him, haha, which definitely weren't for personal reasons. He seems like a stand-up guy. Slight correction on that point, [they traded two prospects for McGehee](http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/12/marlins-giants-closing-in-on-mcgehee-trade.html) and then signed him to that contract to avoid arbitration, not just solely as an FA signing.

Yeah, I get it. This sub and fans in general are often quick to dump on a player when he hits a rough patch, often a player who doesn't deserve it at all. There's a guy in here, I forget his username, who takes every chance he can get to shit on Posey, like when Posey goes into a small slump, haha. It's amazing how eager people are to turn on someone. As someone who's been defending Belt for a long time now and defended Brandon Hicks until he was sent back down, I know that all too well. Definitely his numbers would improve a bit, I guess I just don't think they'd ever get that great. But this has to be like one of the worst starts to a season he was capable of, haha. Yeah, all MLB players are a million times better than me at baseball, but I also don't think that's a reason we can't criticize them. I hate when people say ""well you can't play that sport as well as Player X, so you're not allowed to criticize them"". That's such BS. He really has been a professional throughout this whole thing, so props to him on that.","1435709487"

"prolife","t5_2qscv","&gt; She is imposing her will on the bodily integrity of the child by halting a development that it would naturally go through. 

I don't understand how this is true at all. In my illustration the fetus-slave drug does not violate the bodily integrity of the fetus. It only modifies the body of the mother. The fetus-slave drug modifies the body of the fetus as much as the induce-labor drug.

According to your principle that:

&gt; everyone should be able to determine what they do with their body and how their body is used

which you used to support your assertion that abortion via induced labor is justifiable. Then, it doesn't matter what happens to the body of the fetus because it is secondary to the choice of the woman to ""determine what [she] does with [her] own body.""

Now, however, you're saying that principle doesn't justify the case in my illustration but it does for induce labor. You claim they are different because:

&gt; She is imposing her will on the bodily integrity of the child

So you're saying the bodily integrity rights of the fetus trump the autonomy and integrity rights of the woman.

It seems inconsistent to me to say the bodily integrity rights of the fetus trump the autonomy and bodily integrity rights of the woman in my illustration but to turn around and say that the fundamental right to life does not trump the autonomy and bodily integrity of the woman.

Do you not see the inconsistency here?

You also make another point that I'm not so sure about. You say that:

&gt; She is imposing her will on the bodily integrity of the child by halting a development that it would naturally go through.

It seems to me that the natural course of development for the fetus is to gestate for 9 months. So if bodily integrity can be violated by halting the natural development then surely inducing labor (read: inducing, an imposition on the natural course) is a violation of the bodily integrity of the fetus too.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt; Did you miss the first five minutes of the movie? 

I have to agree with the guy you responded to. This is exactly the reason I find Killian one of the most forgettable villains Marvel has done, because his entire backstory was squeezed into a five minute scene at the beginning of the movie. He felt barely fleshed out or allowed to develop as a character, and he just sort of appeared in the intro, and then the next time we see him he is immediately a deceptive, fishy, and villainous dude. None of that really felt like it developed organically for me. Guy Pearce played him brilliantly as he always plays his roles well, but the character as he was written was simply uninteresting to me.

Im a big Marvel fan and I have this issue with a lot of the movies, where the whole reason the villain is a villain in the first place is because of some very briefly explored reasons. That's partly why I feel Marvel's best villains are on the TV shows. Wilson Fisk had the advantage of having several episodes to develop, and an entire episode of flashbacks detailing his childhood. He was truly understandable in every facet of his character. Calvin Zabo on Agents of SHIELD is another one of my favorites, who is apparently nuts, but also deeply misunderstood by everyone at first until we hear his story revealed over the course of the season. The movies tend to focus more on the protagonists, but sometimes at the expense of spending more time on the villains.","1435709494"

She is concerned that the spacecraft will not be able to make its home in orbit around Pluto and will fly off beyond the Kuiper belt.

I was wondering how long do you expect New Horizons space craft to be operational after the Pluto mission? Could it last decades like he Voyager space craft and still provide useful information?

"FutureFight","t5_37irx","I predict that the 4 characters of these 5 characters to appear in the game: Ant-Man, Wasp, Yellowjack, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Here's why...

The original Kree-Skrull War involved Captain Mar-Vell (the original male version that died of cancer) and the Avengers, when Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Wasp and Goliath (aka Ant-Man) were part of the team. If I remember correctly, Rick Jones was also part of the storyline but I don't foresee him being added right now. Annibus was part of the storyline, but he's probably tied up into the FF properties so I doubt he'll appear in the game. I can see Ronan popping up as a boss in Kree-Skrull War missions.

If they are sticking with the movie tie-in, I think Yellow Jacket stays and Wasp is dropped. If they are sticking to the Kree-Skrull War storyline, they drop Yellow Jacket and keep Wasp.","1435709497"

Since you are doing this for stage, grease paint is the way to go. Oil based so it won't sweat off but cheap grease paint is terrible for streaking and making a mess so get a professional makeup and save yourself time and cleanup. Don't forget to use setting powder or it will get EVERYWHERE! Lastly, get a makeup remover for grease paint of you will end up scrubbing your skin off. 

I prefer Kryolan, but Ben Nye costs less and still considered a professional product. I'm linking the big tub (8oz) of white and the proper setting powder from Amazon, with prime/free shipping as a reference. Most theatrical makeup stores sell Ben Nye if you want to buy local. You can use any non-oil makeup remover, Ben Nye has Quick Cleanse or Bond Off, the latter of which doubles as a prosthetic glue remover.

I don't mean this in terms of 'just be happy/positive!!!!11!11' - I mean systematically observing and analysing these beliefs and schemas - ideally done through cognitive-behavioural therapy or something similar with psychologist/psychiatrist. Which probably sounds like a trite suggestion to OP, but it has helped me. I suffer major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder, and a lot of working on that has involved balancing my misanthropic views (which will never go away and are in fact healthy to some extent) with some positivity.

A mailed fist rose high, a mounting wave of steelclad flesh, and all the Tallhart could do was close his eyes as the blow descended. A tooth flew from his mouth even as stars exploded in his mind, his body crumpling and falling back into unconsciousness. But he would live, when he awoke. He would be able to tell his companions of this fight.

Not so for his foe.

That last act of defiance had spent all there was of Victarion’s strength, and giant fell to his knees, the long length of the blade still lodged firmly into his side. Blood pooled about him even as it ran in scarlet rivulets down the steel of the blade, red and white merged in a macabre yet beautiful image. The battle raged about him, yet muted and distant, and Victarion Volmark raised his eyes to the heavens for the final time.

Then fell, and rose no more.

The reason they claimed is that Home Depot, by far, has the majority of the commercial customers.

However I will say that we do not use Comcast equipment at all.

Edit 2: I just re read your post and I read it wrong. I thought you were talking about o ly in a certain country, not the whole world. If you look at Canada and the states we are more equal then most, compared to a war zone, so if we can be so advance that we don't have war on our side I think that speaks alot for how certain cultures can act completely differently yet having the same goals. What I'm trying to say is Canada can be the first completely equal country with equal rights n everything, without the states being equal even tho we are attached.

However - the breast do attach at the pectoral muscle, so it could be that wearing a bra reduces stress on the pec, allowing it to relax and become soft, thus letting the breasts droop.  If a bra isn't worn, the breasts would only droop from stress that separates them from the pectorals.  Otherwise it might serve to keep the pecs more tense unconsciously, thus firming them up, thus perking up the breasts.  Just speculation.

Alternatively - do bench press/dumbbell fly and wear a bra.  Breast of both worlds!","1435709500"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","Thats my biggest fear, a bunch of companies, modders, and even end users using LiPos who have no clue what they are doing. Li-Ion battery safety is completely different that LiPo battery safety, especially if you are using swapable batteries instead of buit-in batteries. The 200D has a built in balance charger but many people will want to be able to easy swap them out instead of having to charge the device through USB every time it dies. I also have a feeling we are going to see a lot of people just slapping unprotected LiPos right in the mod thinking thats okay. 

But yes, I do agree that Evolv was feeling pressure and just needed to get something out there (a little too) quick. Hopefully they will spend a little more time on the rumored DNA70. 

I think one of the best applications for the DNA200D is one a lot of people will miss and that is making a stationary device utilizing the 12v external power supply. It would make a great at home/desk mod.","1435709501"

But my Engineering Physics program is also the oldest Eng Phys program in the country and is very well established, and as a whole our Engineering program is fairly reputable. I personally would be weary of a 1 year old Eng Phys program at a school that doesn't offer Mechanical engineering.

There are still background checks, so this is not going to allow serial rapists to get jobs as babysitters. What it *is* going to do is help some guy who got arrested for selling pot 20 years ago from living the rest of his life with a scarlet letter, unable to get a decent job.

Instead of drinking 3-4 beers every night, replace it with a glass of wine or 1-2 thicker beers.

I want to be this, but I fear that this means I'm not allowed to criticize your behavior, that I'm ""supposed"" to support specific action on certain political issues, etc.

I'm all for equality, but I don't think the source of equality is the state.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the source of inequality is the state.  It's funny because I think Liberals and Conservatives are pretty much both right on race issues.  The Liberals say we can't ignore it, which is true, so they bring it up **all the time**.  But the Conservatives say, ""Hey, we're just talking about human beings here,"" which is what we want, but they also definitely want to stick their head in the sand about it.

We need the Liberals to remind us of the injustices that take place here, now, in this society, against our friends and neighbors and community members... but I think the Conservatives have a point in that, ideally, we.... *won't*... see race, we'll just see people, and interact with people... as people... no matter their color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, etc.

Exception to this is if they're roaming somewhere with a knock-up. If your team has knock-ups in, abuse that fact. You can get some pretty easy kills if an allied Cho, Mao, Lee etc. knocks someone up and you just ulti onto them, which should get you back in the game after a few kills.

Other than that, I'm not really sure. Zed is an... interesting match up for Yas. My only tip I can give would be as soon as he ultis and you see the dot appear behind you, dash away on a minon (if possible) and wind wall backwards. Should save you from a Q and E, which will remove a huge amount of damage from his ulti, possibly enabling you to win the trade.","1435709503"

I think that's when most converts realize they were deceived or feel ignored and drift away.

Definitely go with her and observe. I would educate yourself with other perspectives and try to be a gentle and reasonable counterpoint to the doctrine you guys hear, especially during the time when the missionaries are selling it. Early awareness of what really happened and of the truth behind the ""I feel it so it must be true"" argument could help both of you avoid a world of frustration in what is basically a cult.

“If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option? If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse. That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves. Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt; BLM's are crying that SMN are going to replace them and all i can think is how BLM replaced SMN's for almost all of 2.0 in a lot of situations merely because of the stigma and the poor gear allocations. 

SMN was considered to be one of the top DPS by many people from 2.0 up until 2.4,  at which point two things were acknowledged:

* Every DPS class aside from SMN/BRD got buffed at one point or another (MNK, BLM, DRG in that order IIRC).  BRD was nerfed and SMN hadn't seen many changes.
* Final Coil's penchant for lengthy periods of sustained DPS combined with poor stat allocation which resulted in SMN running dry on MP very quickly.

I distinctly recall there being a period during second coil where BLMs were never taking the caster slot in pugs because they all wanted the battle res and mobility of a SMN (and binding capabilities for T7) over a BLM.  My static ran two BLM at the time out of preference for the job, and many told us we weren't going to make DPS checks.

tl;dr: SMN was actually considered really good for the majority of ARR.  Only toward the end was it considered underpowered.","1435709509"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","It's just simple math, really:

Take $100k and buy a $500k house. In 10 years at 5% (conservative return for where I live) appreciation you'll have $814,447.31 ($314,447.31 profit).
Take another $100k. Ask a bank to loan you $400k to invest it in stocks. After they tell you where to shove it, invest it in stocks. After 10 years at 10% (an optimistic return) appreciation, you'll have $259,374.25 ($159,374.25 profit). EDIT: Side note: Property taxes in CA on the house would come out to about $65k over 10 years.

After you sell it, I'm pretty sure the difference will cover all you closing costs and repairs. Worst-case scenario if everything goes to hell, you still have a house.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;but I would argue you can attribute this to the influence of declining securities valuations and equity values on the wealth effect

Okay, so the wealth effect says that when the real value of wealth goes up, you spend more of it.  So you're saying that a decline in *some industries* leads to an *overall decline* in wealth.  Again, why does a decline in *some industries* lead to an *aggregate* decline?

&gt;Most people had a significantly smaller portion of their net wealth in the stock market, property and other investment vehicles in the mid twentieth century.

Okay.  Detroit is a hub for American car manufacturers.  All these car manufacturers go belly up.  The price for these manufacturers declines heavily.  If everyone is well diversified, then this should really only affect a few stocks and peoples' assets overall won't see a considerably hit.

So how does one industry and their associated stocks translate over to an aggregate drop in asset prices?

&gt;I don't see how this can be mathematically valid. How can you this be predictive one way and not the other?

Milton Friedman came up with a theory in the 70s called a ""Plucking Model"".  [In 1993, he showed it was valid](http://employees.oxy.edu/mcintyre/Econ361-Spr07/Friedman-Plucking-Model.pdf)  In 2005, [other researchers showed it to be valid as well.](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=870575#PaperDownload)

Mark Thoma has a good discussion of it [here.](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/new_support_for.html)  As Thoma mentions, what's great about Friedman's Plucking model is that it was first theorized and only seriously confirmed decades later.  Many models are created today and tested with data we already have.  This might lead to people trying to make data fit a model.  Instead, Friedman could've been completely wrong with his model but the data confirmed his ideas decades after the fact.  He didn't try to make data fit his model.","1435709511"

That statement wasnt necessarily about the US government, but private companies in the US competing with the government.  If you have a particular example of a specific country in mind i surely wouldnt mind discussing it.

&gt;And? : ) How do either of these counter my previous point:

You dont see how private security agencies operating on significantly lower costs, providing much faster response times, and handling crime in a preventative rather than responsive manner while at the same time being able to be held accountable for their actions might counter your claim of ""this way is better"" while public police departments are literally, blatantly, and shamelessly committing highway robbery and killing people without consequence?  

Also you never gave me the private security agency in the US taking over towns or anything that i asked for.

&gt;As shown, President Roosevelt and his staff found almost all of ""the Jungle"" accusations were on point, even after the facilities had been cleaned with full knowledge they were about to be inspected, and considered that more than enough to justify regulation. Pardon me if I go with Roosevelt and his staff. Seems reasonable to me.

Sure, you could also go with Gabriel Kolkos assessment of roosevelts inspectors "" “two inexperienced Washington bureaucrats who freely admitted they knew nothing” of the meatpacking process.  Inspectors who were a)an economist and b) a civil service lawyer.  As well as later being outed to have gone to chicago with the intention to find fault in order to get their regulation passed.  But hey, when it comes to inspecting meat packing plants, if you choose to put your trust in an economist and a civil service lawyer who have already made up their minds before going then, im not gonna argue with you. 



Or this  "" A 1906 report by the Bureau of Animal Industry refuted Sinclair’s severest allegations, characterizing them as “intentionally misleading and false,” “willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact,” and “utter absurdity.”

&gt;Sounds great on paper, doesn't work in reality. 

Ok, not sure how this relates to 99% of people being able to come away with more money in their later years by investing their money where they see fit rather than being forced to put it into a government fund.

&gt;The politician that replaces the DMV with something better and cheaper would be guaranteed reelection for decades, and so will be eager to hear your private solution.

"ketoscience","t5_2v172","Insulin does more than regulate sugar from your food intake.  Its release can also be triggered by exercise and other circuits.  The biggest thing with keto is that it never spikes.  Your body keeps your blood sugar in a range.  That level doesn't change just because you are on keto.  What changes is that you don't produce mass quantities of insulin for extended periods of time to keep the liver making glycogen and keep fat cells sucking it in.

A spike in insulin stops the release of glucagon from the pancreas.  Glucagon is the signal to the liver to process fatty acids for fuel and also signals fat cells to release energy.

(Keep in mind, most blood work like this is fasting for 8-12 hours which is usually enough time for a healthy person to process carbs and lower the Insulin levels to a normal range, like OP)","1435709516"

I would not at all be apposed to [lewd](#s ""gaging"") Kinu [](#s ""with my ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)""). She's a real looker to say the least. Hottest girl hands down.

If you can, borrow one of your friend's 3DS's and try the MH4U demo since it plays just like the game itself. If you decide you like the demo, then you'll like the game. Then if you decide to buy the 3DS, there are a bunch of other great games you can try out and probably join your friends in.

"haskell","t5_2qh36","You're right, it was stronger language than needed, but I don't think the problem is a willingness to step up to the plate. I won't retread all the BBP stuff, but it applies here. You alluded to my recent attempt to improve syntax, during which Herbert introduced to the discussion a statement about how it would break things due to not being compatible with how cabal has always worked, then opened an issue on cabal to make it work that way. Even assuming he meant it with the best of intentions because of his many valuable contributions, it's the kind of debate tactic that utterly breaks the debate. It clears the plate.

You see arguments that adding syntax that accomplishes something we can already do is not worth it put forth by people who immediately turn around and argue for syntax that accomplishes something we can already do. You see people say things like, ""-1000 if the shed is blue, but +1 if it's red."" You see people hypothesize about the impact of a change on newcomers, rather than hear out those who actually work with newcomers, or just acknowledge that we're trading anecdata and nobody's entirely right or wrong.

I know this is just the way people act on the Internet, but these kinds of responses are not just glib, they stifle the possibility of progress by pushing would-be batters off the plate. So I'd really like to see a committee that represents the larger community, and can actually make changes by simply letting folks have their say, and decisively moving forward without being dragged down by those kinds of arguments. I don't want a committee that is out of touch with the larger community, and I don't want a committee that is perpetually hung by a reluctant minority faction.

I want to see people who appreciate the importance of our new build tools (e.g. the (relatively) new blood in the `cabal-install` team, Halcyon, and stack) and feel the pain of the many paper cuts inflicted by today's GHC given the chance to get the becalmed HMS Haskell moving again!","1435709521"

The way I masterbated was to put something under me and grind. So when making out the hotest thing for me would be dry humping. You said you prefer indirect stimulation. Have you or do you dry hump? You can make it a lot sexier if you both naked or with only your underwear on.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh absolutely. I was 10 for 9/11. The following year was the DC sniper right in my backyard. Then I got to grow up hearing about past disasters like OK City or recent ones like [insert shooting here]. 

The media *loves* to douse us in fear, blow things out of proportion or focus all attention on current crisis until it feels like doomsday, the whole time bringing out the laundry list of previous disasters and shoehorning them in to the conversation however they think it might relate. 

That was a terrible sentence, I'm sorry. But in the end, we're afraid. The second we hear about something happening, like that recent [shooting at the church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting), our first thought is some home grown terrorist. Not necessarily jihad, or Muslim, or anything like that. But the literal definition - someone using violence and murder to make people afraid and spread their message. It may be one of a few dozen fleeting thoughts we have, but it is definitely there. 

I remember the Boston bombing and not really feeling a sense of surprise but more of a ""here we go again. Right on schedule."" We don't get bombings every day, obviously, that's not what I mean. Just that we get some big commotion the media turns into WORLD CHANGING EVENTS and you simply cannot escape it.

So yeah, it feels easy to believe that sending a bunch of troops over to the troublemaker's front door will keep them busy and less able to stir anything up over here.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","**The short answer**

Go on PS /GIMP and selected your black &amp; white cloud layer (or it might be the layer underneath...). Get the paint brush, set its tolerance to about 20% and opacity to about 20%, and to default black /white colours. Get a brush type that is a collection of dots. Apply the colour of your land mass or the color of the ocean to add /subtract land from the coastline respectively. The result should be immediate.

**The slightly longer answer**

Change the brush style to suit the rock type or prevailing window direction. A softer, rounder brush can be used to get long stretches of uninterrupted coastline whilst the rough scattered brush should be used for rugged, hard coastlines.

Original Post:

**Miscommunication with housemates might lead to legal problems. I'd appreciate any advice on my situation**

&gt; My current situation is that I have a lease that ends Late August. I wanted to move early so that I can relocated for a new job. At the beginning of June I investigated my options by communicating with housemates(I have 2 housemates who are a couple) and landlord. In my lease/contract I'm not allowed to sublet. However, after speaking with my landlord, he gave me permission to use a subletter on the condition that my housemates agree to it. This was still early June and I talked to my housemate, the girl, and she said something along the lines of ""I don't care if you get a subletter as long as someone is in the room paying rent"". Unfortunately I don't have a text of recorded phone call of this but she approved a subletter so I went ahead and found new housing along with a subletter for my old place to move in July 1st. I gave my notice of trying to move ahead of time and using a subletter in early June so it was plenty of notice.
&gt; 
&gt; Fast forward to today and I get a phone call from my landlord stating that my housemates told him that they were not ok with using a subletter for my room so I would be violating my contract since he wanted me to get permission from my housemates.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow is the 1st of July and I'm confused because they had giving me consent to use a subletter in early June and now they're saying the opposite thing. I'm in a rough spot because actions technically violate my contract but my landlord gave me permission on the condition that my housemates were ok with it. My housemates stated they were ok with it in early June but apparently they told my landlord that they were not over the past week.
&gt; 
&gt; Housemates never spoke to me about not being ok with subletter and I asked them a couple of times if it was fine and they said yes. There were several times where they could have stated they were not ok with a subletter over the course of the month but they never stated not being ok with it.
&gt; 
&gt; This is now a he-said she-said conflict and I don't know if I have legal ground to stand on since my actions would violate the lease but I feel I followed my landlords wishes and had proper communication and consent with my housemates. I don't have any proof(text or signed agreement) that my housemates agreed to a subletter other than my girlfriend as a witness and one person who came to view the place as a possible subletter where I had him talk to my housemates and they spoke about housemate expectations, implying that my housemates were fine with a subletter.
&gt; 
&gt; let me know how my prospects look and what I should do. I'm in the process of having us all meet and go over this in person. Thanks","1435709525"

Yes, Steam won't make any utter shit game (and there's QUITE A LOT of those lately on Steam) famous, but it will significantly help decent games succeed and thrive, and like I said, Scrolls had all the required parameters for that. Where it failed was exposure, which is where Steam would've come in.

Literally half the people in this thread had never heard of the game or never knew it came out, that right there shows you that the issue was exposure. Yet, much smaller and less polished games have had far more exposure than Scrolls had, thanks to Steam.

To say that it would've succeeded with or without Steam if it was good is an extremely naive way of looking at things. It's absolutely not true and you know it.

Heck, even Minecraft, if it hadn't gotten lucky, may very well have forever been a small game no one ever noticed. It's all about exposure and hitting that critical mass, which Scrolls clearly failed to do.","1435709528"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Nah, tons of players will have inevitably not played in Season 2 now (that was three years ago).

ADCs are really shafted and have been since 4.9. I personally just switched to mid lane, but for those that want to keep playing AD, it's pretty hellish.

It was okay at the beginning of this season with the caster ADC trifecta of Corki, Graves, and Lucian. It was also okay at Worlds with all the champions that rushed either Triforce or Bork. It's because those champions and builds inherently do things with one-two items. But since we can't run those champions or builds in this meta, we have to either be a utility role that doesn't have very much control over the game (probably less than support and jungler, and certainly less than the solo laners), or wait until 4 items to be useful.

No other role requires that much to be useful.

ADC was at it's healthiest when it had one big power spike and then linear scaling pre 4.9. This was Greaves + BT, then linear scaling from there. There was the option of running a hyper carry that would never get this spike (Vayne, Twitch), but you'd get more late game power. I'm not saying everything was viable, but it wasn't overbearing, and it wasn't constricting. 

There needs to be a way to get that powercurve back, because as it is, AD is pretty atrocious to play without that smooth powercurve.","1435709534"

That doesnt make them right wing, I can call myself a tiger, doesnt make me a tiger.

&gt; At the start of this mini thread some guy with no clue was blaming socialists when it's actually right wing overspenders (greece spent a fuckton on it's military and cronyism in the 5 ruling families who operated the place until Syrzia got in).

If the party was actually really right wing they would have balanced the budget and paid down the debt, not stacked billions upon billions on the existing debt, none of these previous greek parties were right wing.

&gt; I just corrected him. I didn't say ""yay socialism"" or anything like that. I just put the blame where it lies - with right wing and neo liberal stooges who fucked up every bit as badly as any socialist govt in a democracy has ever done.

Calling something ""neo-liberal"" doesnt make it ""neo-liberal"", what kind of a ""neo-liberal"" lets a gigantic deficit continue?

Basically to keep combat quick, it's easy to hit things. Damage stacks up quickly. Kicks at the can matter so single bosses are stupid easy, while twenty stirges is a death sentence.  Getting good magic items is one of the most fun parts of gaming but with this math they quickly destroy the math of balanced encounters.  Overall, if I had more time I'd probably go searching for a better system with lower damage, more misses, and a better magic item system.

2067 kcal Goal, a 0% deficit. (1414 min, 2067 max)
20g Carbohydrates
100g Protein (79g min, 130g max)
176g Fat (104g min, 176g max)

I am not sure why you would have to cut your protein in half. Eating over your Macro protein goal is fine, just don't do it in insane amounts. The key is to make it to at or above the goal. In regards to your fat goal that is a lot less important whether you are above or below it. Just use your fat Macro for reference.  

I go by this: Carbs are a limit. Protein is a goal. Fat is to satiate.

Also remember to get your electrolytes! If I do not meet my protein goal or get enough electrolytes my body definitely lets me know. 

I got my Macros through the Keto Calc: http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/ 

when calculating the deficit (the % of calories you aim to cut to lose weight) everyone recommends 20% is the sweet spot*

* This doesn't apply to me because I do zero carb living for health and not to lose weight. So my deficit is 0 (basically maintaining weight). But I have heard others (in r/keto) say that just because you are in ketosis doesn't mean you are guaranteed to lose weight. How many calories you eat does play a role.

Cheating is breaking promises or expectations previously set in a relationship. It does not only apply to monogamy. This is not a discussion about monogamy. This is about a failure to live up to previously agreed upon promises and expectations. A man is as good as his word, and people who cheat give up on that- monogamy, open relationship, whatever. A relationship of any kind is built on trust, and this is a matter of deciding if it was wrong to put trust in this person. If a person wants to change the nature of the relationship, that is fine. That is normal, natural even. Choosing the most amoralistic and hurtful method of doing so is not OK. There are a multitude of options- and peoples choices say a lot.","1435709539"
"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","E3 correspondents whom I trust(such as VaatiVidya) have stated that Miyazaki said, *in person* that Dark Souls 3 is not the last souls game. 

I very much doubt that open worlds is where Miyazaki wants to take the series. The man seems to be very much aware of the current state of the industry, and of what makes his own products sell. Making Souls, a series known among many things for its tight, cohesive and brilliant level design an open world game like what 90% of the competition does sounds unreal. 

What strikes me as odd (if this articvle is true) is that the *developer* seems to be pushing for mass appeal, whereas the *publisher* is trying to maintain the series integrity. Would make a lot more sense if you switch those two roles around. Not that I'm questioning your Italian, it's certainly better than what I can deduce from Google Translate. 

Another thing is the ""Dark Souls 2 should have been open world but was changed a few months before release,"" because the game shows absolutely no signs of that at all. Indeed, the game rather shows signs of being designed with zones, intended for separation by loading screens, but was later stitched together for a seamless, *more traditional soulslike experience.* (I mean ffs, how did the top of a windmill have an elevator that went *up* to a giant lava castle?) 

Personally, I think Dark Souls with an open world is tone-deaf and downright dumb. It'd be like replacing the action-RPG combat system with a turn-based CCG. I'm quite frankly *sick* of open world fantasy RPGs these days. I don't care that a game world is the size of the fucking Moon, what I care about is how it is designed, how it works with content and content distribution. Lordran was a masterpiece of design that I had a lot more fun with exploring that I did with the long horseback treks from rock texture to rock texture in Skyrim, or Dragon Age Inquisiton, or even the Witcher 3(that's right I went there), because it's all just a bunch of loosely connected stuff to do, and these games, while good in their own right(I'd be lying if I said I hadn't sunk 400 hours into Skyrim alone), are an inch deep and a lightyear wide. Dark Souls and Bloodborne's worlds are small, but every little detail has a purpose, and considerable thought behind it. 

The thought of an open world Dark Souls does **not** excite me. It terrifies me. 
I remember when people got excited about an online Elder Scrolls, too.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Its not called ""anti-labour Act"". The author just decided to make that shit up. 

This explains it and seems perfectly reasonable to me. It makes transparent spending done by groups that have special tax exemption. It also allows union members to see the spending done with their own dues. I can see the hesitation to disclose special construction contracts and union secrecy in Quebec. Nothing going on with special secret construction contracts and bidding processes in Quebec.

&gt; 1.What would it do? The bill would require unions, labour trusts and employee associations to disclose any transaction of more than $5,000, along with the names of the payer and payee, to the Canada Revenue Agency, which would post the information to its website. That rule could apply to anyone who receives cash from a union, including private contractors hired to do work, such as construction, maintenance, or photocopying. Unions would also have to disclose any executive or officer who earns more than $100,000 (similar to provincial ""sunshine"" salary disclosure lists), and publicly explain the details of their spending on political activities.

&gt; 2.What's the rationale? Conservative MP Russ Hiebert, wants unions to disclose the details of their spending because they benefit from tax deductions under the Income Tax Act, including the ability for members to deduct union dues on their taxes. If unions are benefiting financially from taxpayer-subsidized benefits, proponents say it is only fair for unions and labour groups to be transparent and accountable for their spending beyond their membership.

I condemn both. This is not a game. If you were a network engineer working for, say, Google or Belgacom or Gemalto you would get that. This isn't a game, it's a crime. Or what is known as a ""state crime against democracy"" (SCAD)

&gt; The United States the most spied on country in the world.

If you follow the judicial and legal history of the rules under which NSA operatives operate, and you'd stop excluding domestic as well international  mass surveillance from the equation (mass surveiling citizens from foreign countries), I doubt anyone can match the statistics as published in BOUNDLESS INFORMANT.

&gt; Where is the Guardian condemning this espionage? 

Here, for example:

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/03/china-cyber-hacking-campaign

As for Chavez and the Guardian, that's a correspondent, who in his explanation does *exactly* what I expected he would do: praise as well as deeply criticize Chavez. So I'm not sure how you think this proves what you said, and you said:

&gt; ""This is beyond amateurish by a left wing rag whose editors publicly back people like Hugo Chavez.""

They didn't ""publicly back"" Hugo Chavez, they had an internal debate, *according to this correspondent* and they presumably let him do his job. 

So what if we actually go to the Guardian? What did they say in his obituary, for example?

&gt; **The debate continued as to whether Chávez could fairly be described as a dictator, but a democrat he most certainly was not. A hero to many, especially among the poor, for his populist social programmes, he assiduously fomented class hatred and used his control of the judiciary to persecute and jail his political opponents, many of whom were forced into exile.**

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/hugo-chavez

&gt; Journalist allegedly working for Russian intelligence services

Yes, like any other media organization they have had controversies. This is apparently the best you can come up with:

&gt; After a period as features editor, Gott became literary editor of The Guardian, but **resigned from the latter post in 1994** after it was alleged in The Spectator that he had been an ""agent of influence"" for the KGB, claims which he rejected, arguing that ""Like many other journalists, diplomats and politicians, I lunched with Russians during the cold war"". He asserted that his resignation was ""a debt of honour to my paper, not an admission of guilt"", because his failure to inform his editor of three trips abroad to meet with KGB officials at their expense had caused embarrassment to the paper during its investigation of Jonathan Aitken.^[6]

20 years ago... One editor...

&gt; The source of the allegation that he had been an agent was KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. In his resignation letter Gott admitted ""I took red gold, even if it was only in the form of expenses for myself and my partner. That, in the circumstances, was culpable stupidity, though at the time it seemed more like an enjoyable joke"". One issue was whether during the 1980s, the KGB, would have thought Gott's information worth £10,000. Kim Philby's biographer Phillip Knightley highlighted the limited value of outsider Gott as compared to insider, Aldrich Ames concluding that Gott would have been lucky to get his bus fare back. Rupert Allason pointed out valuable activities such as talent-spotting and finding people who did have highly classified access.^[7]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gott

So he took some expenses, this is the best they have? 

The KGB can ""deem"" the Guardian ""highly susceptible to penetration"" *according to one source*, yet the Guardian employs hundreds of journalists and editors and all you've got an *allegation* on is one, and he said his error was having his expenses paid when he met with KGB sources. Apart from that, the Guardian is accused of having too many journalists and editors from Oxford and Cambridge... you think these people, educated among the British elite ... are probable/susceptible KGB targets? Elite private schoolers? A leftist bent, sure, but the same goes for George Orwell, a *democratic socialist* who wrote *Animal Farm*.

Now, moving on, to what this is really about: **quality of journalism**:

&gt; **The Guardian has been awarded the National Newspaper of the Year in 1999, 2006,^[158] 2011^[159] and 2014^[14] by the British Press Awards, and ""Front Page of the Year"" in 2002 (""A declaration of war"", 12 September 2001).^[158][160] It was also co-winner of the World's Best-designed Newspaper as awarded by the Society for News Design (2006).**

&gt; **Guardian journalists have won a range of British Press Awards**, including:^[158]

&gt; * ""Reporter of the Year"" (Nick Davies, 2000; Paul Lewis, 2010);
&gt; * ""Foreign Reporter of the Year"" (James Meek, 2004; Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, 2008);
&gt; * ""Columnist of the Year"" (Polly Toynbee, 2007; Charlie Brooker, 2009);

&gt; * Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism (Nick Davies, 1999; Chris McGreal, 2003; Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, 2005; Ian Cobain, 2009).

&gt; **The guardian.co.uk website won the Best Newspaper category three years running in 2005, 2006 and 2007 Webby Awards, beating (in 2005) The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Variety.**^[161] It has been the winner for six years in a row of the British Press Awards for Best Electronic Daily Newspaper.^[162] The site won an Eppy award from the US-based magazine Editor &amp; Publisher in 2000 for the best-designed newspaper online service.^[163] The website is known for its commentary on sporting events, particularly its over-by-over cricket commentary.

&gt; **In 2007 the newspaper was ranked first in a study on transparency that analysed 25 mainstream English-language media vehicles**, which was conducted by the International Center for Media and the Public Agenda of the University of Maryland.^[164] It scored 3.8 out of a possible 4.0.

&gt; **The Guardian and The Washington Post shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for public service reporting for their coverage of the NSA's and GCHQ's worldwide electronic surveillance program and the documents leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden.**^[165]

But that's not including the context of the stuck out belly, posture, and the context of them having a fitness blog makes me wonder how much of this isn't bloat and then dehydrating as well as other tricks to make the loss of weight more significantly than it really was.

"rangers","t5_2rnpb","Exactly, it was a fluke.

If you evaluate them from towards the end of December on, Hunwick scored as many goals in fewer games (I think its 2 each from December 20th but I'd have to check to be exact).

So now someone would want to make the argument that being defensemen, the offensive production can be whatever as long as they defend.

Thats when you turn to the fancy stats and look at Corsi, high scoring chances, positioning charts from War On Ice, the better O/worse O charts that you see on Own The Puck.

Once you look at them you realize not only are they, over their careers, virtually equal offensively but Hunwick is BETTER (substantially so) defensively. You could see it in the playoffs too. Yes, Klein was coming off a broken arm but Hunwick was getting bounced in and out of the lineup all season and he never had a problem performing when asked.

So once you establish that Hunwick is a superior all around defenseman you look at the contracts and you scratch your head at the fact that Klein made five times as much last year than Hunwick.

I mean I think the evidence is pretty clear. I'm not saying Klein is bad, he's not. But Hunwick is better, and Klein is getting paid too much to be our 6th best defender (was 7th best until Hunwick became a free agent).","1435709550"

Like they'll get huge lifting weights etc. Also like helping with form checks when I can. Plus r/fitness is mostly ""if you're not doing ""x"" program Jesus kills a puppy every time you work out and you'll never see any gainz"" etc etc and it's a lot of bashing.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I overheard an entire conversation at lunch one day where two gentlemen were discussing what their church had been talking about Sunday. Aliens and the Anti-Christ. They were saying that the Anti-Christ will come in the form of Aliens. 

""They'll show up and wow us with their technology, cure our diseases, end world hunger, make the world a better place for all of us. Then they'll tell us there really is no god, and the universe is just a big chaotic place of mass, energy, and mostly empty space. But that's the devil's trick.

Once we've all turned away from god, accepted that there is no god and religion doesn't matter... that's when he's won. That's when all our souls are lost. So it'll be up to the true Christians to fight against these demons when they come. To make sure we never turn our hearts from god.""

These were also not redneck hillbilly types... these were well dress men wearing expensive shoes and watches, eating lunch in a moderately upscale restaurant in a business district of a semi-major metropolitan area. And this was the stuff they talked about in church apparently.","1435709551"

I have a lot of people asking me about my natural status and whatnot, along with what kind of gains you can expect to make as natural athlete with numerous years of experience already under your belt. These pics are basically 1 year apart. I was 1 week out from my last show on the right and the left was taken a couple weeks ago. I'm about 5'10 160-165 on the right and 186-188 on the left. Eating about 1700-1800 cals on the right and 3600-3700 on the left, I really took my time with reverse dieting. I've been lifting consistently for close to 7 years now, so at this point I'm not really able to add a shit ton of mass in a year, the gains obviously slow down considerably. Hopefully this gives some merit to my natural status, as you can see I don't blow the **** up in an offseason like a lot of assisted athletes can.","1435709551"

Where  are those who can say they have benefitted from this ""practice""?

It's a thicket that nobody dares go into and nobody has come out of.

Bankei encourages people to not do Zazen prayer-meditation which he claimed destroyed his health.

When we try to find evidence supporting the modern day ""hautou"" practice we get nowhere.  When we try to find sitting meditation in the Zen lineage texts we get lots of Zen Masters rejecting it as a practice and then acknowledging it as ordinary.  Sitting quietly for a few minutes never hurt anybody.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","It has not an been an easy task for me to find a perfect foundation! Personally I have had a hell of a time finding one that didn't oxidize/go orange on me. A great first step is to get colour matched at a MAC store or a Sephora but I have had several different answers from both places so it is never 100%. 

A perfect foundation will work with both your skin tone and your skin type. It can truly feel like searching for the Holy Grail! Ask yourself a few questions first... 

- What kind of coverage do I like? Full, medium or sheer? 
- What kind of skin do I have? Oily, combination, dry, dehydrated...? 
- What's my budget? 
- What kind of finish would I like? Dewey, matte, satin, natural? 
- What is my undertone? Definitely the most important IMO, if you don't have the undertones right the foundation will never look quite right. [Here is a good starting article](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/makeup-tips/_/makeup-tips-tricks-skin-tone-categories) and another way (not foolproof) is to look at your veins. If they are more blue, you are likely cool and if they are more green you are likely warm (yellow undertone + blue vein = green!)

- Cool (pink, red or bluish undertones), Warm (yellow, peachy, golden undertones), Neutral (a mix of warm and cool undertones)

- How light/dark am I? this can purely be trial and error, getting a few samples after being colour matched can really help you narrow it down. 

I personally believe in spending good money on a foundation but that doesn't have to be the case for everyone! L'oreal True Match is my favourite drugstore foundation and Revlon Colourstay is an honourable mention but I can't say I'd ever repurchase it as for me it was just alright. Most drugstore foundations have just looked *off* when they oxidize which is why I tend to stick to the mid-high end foundations. If you do find a high end foundation that matches you, you can always enter it into the [foundation matrix](http://findation.com/) and maybe find something else to match :) 

I wish you the best of luck, and might I suggest a Korean BB cream if you're not looking for much coverage? You have to get them online but they have better coverage and better ingredients than North American ones. They tend to lean more towards lighter skin tones but I believe the Missha one has darker shades if you need! Happy Hunting xo","1435709556"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I was shotcaller for a number of teams in 5s and I will say: Shotcalling isn't necessarily telling people where or when to be somewhere. Like, a jungler is responsible for his own ganks and a support should decide when it is an option to roam. The shotcaller should never say ""you should gank top now"" because the jungler(as a jungler) knows whether his goals from the gank are achievable. The only thing a shot-caller has control over is objectives and how to play around them. If the shotcaller feels farming till 50 then fighting is optimal then you do that, but different players have different methods. This also is different on a team-by-team basis so it's hard to say that much. Just what I experienced. People come up with ideas and the shotcaller often will agree with them, it's just their say is the final say. Anyone can make calls, it's just the shotcaller decides to commit to it.","1435709563"

Fear is not innate, you develop it after experiences in the past that, some of the time, you cannot remember. But your body and your memory record it and that’s why when you scared you can really feel your body’s reactions. When you’re suddenly scared, you may want to run away, to scream, you shiver, you have goose bumps, you may cry and sweat and your heart beats so hard. Sometimes you can also faint, and a few times, well thanks god these one are rare, you can die.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Children are constitutionally guaranteed a public education. Holding their education hostage until their parents ""consent"" to unwanted medical procedures (which carry the risk of death) is ridiculously unethical and unnecessary.

Children are also constitutionally guaranteed protection by the state, and a small number of unvaccinated kids could compomise that. Right to life &gt; right to education

&gt;Saying that the unpredictable but devastating vaccine reactions that a small percentage of children experience is worth it or necessary for the greater good is called Child Sacrifice.

No, it's common sense. The predictable and far more devestating disease reactions these vaccines prevent is a far greater endangerment. Refusing to lessen the risk of your child dying is Child Sacrifice.

&gt;This isn't true. I know a lot of very educated/non-religious people who do not vaccine because of the side effects that can and do happen to children.

They may be educated in something, but they sure as shit aren't smart (maybe informed is a better word). If they were they'd value the lives of their children more.


&gt;Why should they allow the government to choose what percent of risk is high enough for their children? I think it should be up to the parents to decide what percent of risk of death/injury is low enough for them to decide to vaccinate or not.

Because the government has a duty of care towards it's citizens, and children in particular. Parents don't always make good decisions for their children, and most of the time children must live with these decisions. But the government has the right to intervene when those decisions greatly affect the safety of that child and others around it. If you saw a parent sharing a cigarette or swig of vodka with their toddler you wouldn't say 'welp, it's up to the parent to decide the health risks of their child', so why should it different for vaccinations?","1435709566"

He said he is very disturbed by a trend in the U.S. in which music programs are usually the first thing on the chopping block when schools don’t have enough money.

"funny","t5_2qh33","You are right to be scared because of the fact that does make it seem like that's what intent is. However, your fear is for nothing because it is a common misunderstanding of law. 

But in actuality, in a court case, you can't use the ""words of the defendant"" alone to show intent of a serious action. You need something to corroborate it. ""action"".

If you say you will do XYZ, and then not do it. You won't get convicted for XYZ. 

But if you take the steps to do XYZ. Such as gathering materials. Scouting the location. Bringing together the funding. 

That proves intent. 

Same reason why no one who said blablabla on the internet gets convicted. It's not enough to prosecute. He could just say he was joking. And 1st amendment protects him.

To prove intent, you need to show a ""pattern of actions"" or ""cascade of steps"" to complete the action. 

He purchased the weapons, he had the motive, he agreed to the plan on video-tape, in a very serious meeting. 

That's proving intent. It's not just ""on someone's word"".

So don't be afraid of the ""proving intent"" part. It is never one singular evidence. It is never 'he said this and we believe he intended to go through with it.'

The prosecutor will not argue ""such and such said he would murder someone, and that proves intent and so its attempted murder.""

For colored belts, I take the absence of a tap as tacit permission for me to continue, albeit at an even, gradual increase of pressure (no rapid snapping). For white belts, I let go early because they may not know to tap. 

In a tournament, I'll do the same provided I feel in control of the situation. If I get stacked during an armbar in the gym, I'll maintain an even increase of pressure because I can always just reset and try again. In competition, I'll rip the arm off its hinge if he doesn't tap. I'll protect my opponent in any way possible - short of giving up the win. ","1435709571"

There are 125million+ steam accounts.
[Kotaku story feb 2015](http://kotaku.com/there-are-over-125-million-steam-accounts-1687820875)

[Steam survey results](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey)
2.41% have a GTX970
0.66% have a GTX980

That's already over 4 million PCs that meet the specs, and then there are ATI cards that would meet the min spec, other nvidia cards that meet the spec or come close (e.g. 780Ti, 980Ti), the influx of PC gamers who are already intending to upgrade once the VR hardware is on the market, and the people who jump in with slightly lesser hardware (i used to go OK with an overclocked 560Ti with the DK2), and the potential for people to just buy a second lower-spec GPU if all this promised GPU-per eye business works out.

10million users with a sufficient PC seems like a reasonable guestimate for this time next year, and that is not even considering people who would go out and buy a whole new PC just to jump into VR.

Not a huge market, but not tiny either. Already 100k+ oculus development kits sold, surely a million first generation units sold isn't unrealistic? ","1435709575"

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","Oh fuck, funny story. 

So, I got really sad one day over a period where I was, shall we say, a bottom feeder. Little to do, few to talk to, and maybe a handful of emotion. 

We had a bag of my favourite chip snack, and I decided to whinge the day. Took the bag, a 1,5l bottle of coke, a binkie, to my room, turned on some of my favourite kurtjmac, and cried. For maybe an hour, maybe more maybe less. 

Now, my favourite chip snack happens to be Flaming Hot Cheetos, and are actually quite spicy when you kill a bag in 45ish minutes (bag was out before the crying ended). 

And, let me say this: this wasn't one of those pouty cries, this was one of those ""I want out now"" cries. So, the river was pouring. 

I go to wipe my tears away with my forefingers, and low and behold, Flaming Hot Cheeto dust gets into my fucking eye. 

So, here I am, infront of my computer under a blanket, crying my eyes out in pain and sadness, with snot, tears, and Cheeto-dew gathering on my face. 

I run up the stairs, (have a basement room), past my mother who is on the couch questioning her life choices, and up another flight of stairs straight into the bathoom, and rip off my clothes. 

Now, I don't know if you've ever showered, but if you have, you probably know that it's painfully cold to jump into one without waiting a sec for it to warm up. 

And painful it was. I jump in (run, really), and hit my head against the tile wall, all while water colder than a witches tit is blasting my honkie ass. 

When the eye pain, head pain, soul pain, and self-esteem pain finaly settles and I finish showering, I look at my clothes to realized they are all covered in Flaming Cheeto dust, and I would have to pull new ones on. 

Luckily the fucking stars alined and I crosed the hall to my own room without sustaining traumatic injuring, and pulled some clean clothes on. ","1435709575"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; I believe that **unnecessary** pain and suffering are inherently bad.
&gt; 
&gt; And if you live in a modern, agricultural society, you do not **need** to eat meat in order to live a healthy and athletic life.

So, if you value art and consider cooking to be an art, you might consider eating meat to be necessary: alternatively, you might say that you value cookery, but not quite that much - not the parts that involve meat: avoiding suffering trumps art, in that respect. You could also, if you wished, cease to value athleticism: it's not *necessary* that people be *very* physically fit to avoid suffering - in fact participating in sport increases the chances that you might hurt yourself. This is all a bit of a mess. So I just don't attach values to things in such a piecemeal fashion.

That's not to say that I think analysing everything in terms of knowledge production is a perfect solution that cuts through every dilemma, or that one should have no other values. I just think it's very useful and nearly always compatible with other values, if they're adjusted slightly, which makes the whole system more coherent. (One question is: why value knowledge production anyway? - and to answer that you need to fall back on a set of other values.)","1435709576"
