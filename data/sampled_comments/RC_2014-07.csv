"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","Well, to be fair (though I'm pretty sure this is not what she means), money devalues certain things becuase it adds a thrid iteminto a trade. So say you are a poor farmer in Thirdworldistan. You could trade 3 ears of corn for 3 packs of sugar. When money is thrown into the mix, now you cannot trade your corn, you must first sell your corn for money to buy your sugar with. So you sell your corn for 5 bucks but a 3 packs of sugar costs 6 dollars. 

The capitalist system actually did hurt tribal areas because it closed off trading routes. NO trading routes means no wealth or information. It's why ares in Kenya, the Middle East and so for which were very rich and prosperous in the Middle Ages went to shit when Europe moved to a capitalist system ahead of them.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One day, my boyfriend in high school ran away from home because his mother wanted to take him to Mexico, and he thought it was to abandon him there with his abusive father. He ran to my house. They caught up with him right under my bedroom window, and I ran outside when I heard the shouting.

His mother was trying to grab his shoulders, his grandmother was standing a few feet off looking worried, and his sister was crying and telling him to get into the car. I walk up to him and hug him, and he hugs me and starts sobbing. His family goes quiet and lets us stand there for a few minutes.

I walk him to the car and put him in the backseat. His mother gets in the driver's seat. His sister pulls me a few feet off and thanks me for calming him down. She tells me they haven't told him yet (because of how he reacts when he's upset), but he has to go to Mexico with them because this morning, his grandmother died in her home there.

Me and his grandmother had spent many hours together becoming friends despite her speaking no English and me little Spanish. She left me a pair of pearl earrings.

TWIST ENDING: His mother actually did leave him there with his dad after the funeral, so fuck her.
DOUBLE TWIST: He kept tabs on me for years, eventually approached and rekindled a friendship, though I was engaged to someone else, and when I wouldn't be with him, he raped me and tried to stab me repeatedly.

&gt;These monsters have survived confrontations with Hunters before, when you face them they will show visible signs of scarring, maybe their tails are already chopped off and they have a healed over stump in its place

Oh great, that's a whole bunch of new part models to code.

&gt;They'll actively try to dodge the hunter's attacks, if the hunter starts up a spirit combo with their longsword the monster will react and try to move away from the final hit. If a gunner is pointing their weapon at a veteran Great Jaggi for example, it'll do that large backhop it does except as a sidestep instead to stay out of the hunter's line of sight and away from the shooty end. Etc.

Oh look, now we have to make the A.I. more complicated for a very specific set of circumstances.

It's a neat idea, but because of the additional code it would require, it would end up taking a bunch of content out of the game for a feature a lot of the longtime fans of the series might never even see, or it would end up taking longer to make, and do we really want to increase the time between releases when it is already so long?","1404172808"

My suspicion on reading through all 3 pages of that thread.. is that you've got some corruption (in the iMessage application) .. but I'm not sure how that would ONLY effect the OSX and iPad.. but not the iPhone. 

That's really strange. 

Don't be dismayed/discouraged that Apple doesn't know the answer to this. Their software/OS is incredibly complex and not everyone can know everything. The great thing however about being alive now (in 2014).. is that EVERYTHING is on the Internet... so this problem most definitely CAN BE SOLVED.. you just have to keep digging and be persistent.

"asktrp","t5_2y2sm","&gt; Because it's ridiculously easy for women to get laid so if they give it up easily, they're probably not that high quality.

How does this logic only apply to women and not also men?

The sad part is that, in the end, we all have urges.  Women's sexuality is suppressed because men fear raising another man's children.  This is much less of an issue nowadays that we have paternity tests.  However, this double standard has a major disadvantage *for men*.  Namely, we all get a lot less sex because women are taught that their sexuality is somehow more valuable, and finite (consequently, a man's sexuality is infinite, and thus, worthless).  The double standard represses women from acting on their natural urges, even when there is no logical reason to do so.

I have an example: once I brought a woman back to my place after a hot first date.  She wanted to fuck me, *bad*.  And of course, I was happy to oblige.  But she stopped it and said, ""I don't want to be a slut...""

*Wat??*

""How can you be a slut if nobody is judging you??  I'm certainly not judging you.  And how can you be a slut, but not me?  I want to fuck right now too!""  This logic didn't phase her.  Thing is, society tells women day in &amp; day out that they can't be percieved as ""too easy.""  So they hold back because of this ever-present shadowy judgemental force.

But don't worry, I fucked her the next day.  You know... because its scientifically proven that waiting 24 hours reduces your sluttiness by 97.2%.

&gt; And I treated her extremely well.

Ok, so be it.  The way I interpreted your story seemed like you were being controlling.  Still, my words are valid for anyone who does try to control someone.  Again, nevermind the moral/philosophical arguments...on the practical side of things, those behaviors ultimately drive someone away.

&gt; Fake it til you make it though, right?

In order to convince your parents, if you are serious about this, offer to pay a little each month.

Never mind that Glass can't record that long anyway (due to time recording limits and — even if the artificial time limits are removed — battery restraints), nobody can hold their head still enough for long enough to make an even remotely usable copy.

Cams that you find online are typically done in East Asia or Russia, where you can bet such ridiculous laws are *not* going to be passed or enforced. Even then, cams are more often than not barely watchable.

The fear of Glass being used to record a film is stupid, and banning someone from wearing their prescription glasses in a cinema is discriminatory against anyone who wears glasses and doesn't always carry around a second pair (which is a fairly ridiculous notion).","1404172815"

Also run ""sysstat -x 10""  through the CLI and keep an eye on the CPU, CP time, cp type, and disk util.  Especially during and after a snapmirror update.   Disk util will go up during and after a snapmirror.  It should go back to ""normal"" afterwards.  If not it might be the snapmirror frequency as others have mentioned.

I agree that helmet, jacket and gloves are the highest priority, but I'd suggest that if you can't afford leather trousers, it's a good idea to get at least some kevlar jeans. Hood jeans seem to be well recommended, but cost about £100. I have some Oxford jeans that I got from Ghostbikes for £45 inc p&amp;p. Definitely not as good as leather, but better than nothing.

Have a look at [Sharp](http://sharp.direct.gov.uk) for some solid information on safety of different helmets, and some indicative prices. You can shave the budget there and still get a safe helmet. The down side may be things like noise and ventilation, but even so, they should be acceptable for that.

It's probably going to be necessary to budget a bit more for a jacket unless you hit a sale. It should be cow hide, thick enough so that it bends rather than folds or crumples when you flex it, and stitched at seven stiches per inch. Armour at the elbows is valuable, and most jackets have it now.

"creepyPMs","t5_2ug83","I was in an FWB type relationship off and on for over 8 years. It wasn't ever some super romance, but we really had the friends part down pretty nicely. Then I had gastric bypass surgery. I got sick from complications. I was in and out of the hospital for two years, with a grand total of five surgeries. I had bad muscle atrophy and all kinds of stuff, too much to list. Instead of compassion, my ""friend"" would constantly get pissy when I wouldn't run to him to give him sex. Guilting me and cutting me down any time I did force myself to go hook up (when I did it was never because I wanted it, I was sick, but out of guilt and a sense of obligation.) I don't even know why I put up with that as long as I did.... Then when I lost the weight and got healthier he would constantly throw in my face that I had been sick and not pleased him enough thru my illness. When I was big he had never said anything about me physically, he wasn't overly complimentary, but never degrading. Once I was thin he would talk about my skin being loose. Tell me what I should be doing to tone it better. Telling me I'd always be ugly if I didn't have reconstructive surgery on my stomach. (I'm disfigured for lack of a better term from all the surgeries.) It just got to be way too much and I told him off. It's been about two yearsish since I told him off. I really communicated with him most on yahoo and the occasional call on my land line. Never called each others cells, really. Since he's the only person I talk to on yahoo I just deleted the app. Then a fb friend couldn't send me photos thru her fb app so I redownloaded yahoo to use for that purpose a few months back. He had left like four offline messages and as soon as he saw me on started sending more. The four messages he left were like winkies, and ""boo."" No apologies anything. With every fiber I wanted to verbally abuse him, but I just ignored. OH and at one point he literally just came to my house, out of the blue. Showed up on my door step. My mom and I had been talking on the porch, I asked her to stay and told him to get off the property and if he showed with out warning again I'd contact the police. 


Anyways, it's not exactly what you went thru, but I get the hurt when a FWB acts up like that and tries to push boundaries and stuff. I'm sorry you went thru that. He's an asshole. ","1404172819"

Uh, because when they pay taxes to the government, they aren't earmarked for services they specifically disagree with == less burdensome.

The burden is still there, but it's less burdensome than the contraception mandate.

GDP is created from supply and demand, and the things that are created (whether products or services) will still be created whether there's UBI or not. An extreme example would be if UBI payments equaled GDP, that wouldn't mean that all the things that the people in the US made (labor, gains, output, etc.) would be gone, they wouldn't be used up.

It's useful to use GDP to compare to things like taxes or the debt or the costs of wars, or paying for a program. But in that case GDP is being used like a yard stick - the ruler doesn't go away when we measure something with it.

(and in fact, there's nothing even cataclysmic or impossible about UBI equalling GDP)","1404172822"

"Assistance","t5_2s25d","I'm not a garage sale expert or anything and you probably shouldn't ask me about haggling! One time I saw a box of yarn at a garage sale that I wanted to get for my mom but it didn't have a price on it. So I go to ask the lady how much it was and I was preparing what price would be too much--I thought I would offer $5 but $7.50 would be the max I would want to pay. So I ask her, and she says, Make an offer. So I do so good and I offer straight out $5...and she just stares at me for a millisecond too long so I blurt out ...or $10. And she immediately says $10 sounds good. So I had to pay $10 for a box of yarn that I would max pay $7.50 for. So anyway, my advice about haggling is don't do that. But yeah, bring cash (usually they have gone to the bank and can break larger bills but it may be less likely if you go later in the day). I don't know about trying stuff on but it might not hurt to ask! Sometimes if a shirt's only a dollar I figure it's worth the risk. You might try to know ahead of time what looks good on you so if you can't try it on you're less likely to get something you hate.","1404172823"

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","The problem with using a single current source to drive LEDs, is that the current will be split amongst the three emitters as you turn each one on, thus dropping the overall brightness. This is why you'll need 3 separate current sources, or at least a current mirror (a current source drives three transistors, each mirroring the same current). The problem now with a current mirror, is each LED gets the SAME amount of current, but red/green/blue require different currents to achieve the same brightness, so when you switch all LEDs completely on they won't appear white.

To answer your original question, there are ""high side"" current source topologies, like:
http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/TheTransistorAmplifier/images/Fig71ba.gif
and
http://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/high-side-current-source-with-npn-transistors-possible/

Do you need a constant current source? Usually a resistor is good enough for a single RGB LED, along with PWM switching to adjust the brightness.

Another option could be the the WS2811 LED driver chips: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1378 They give you 3x constant current drivers plus PWM control over a serial interface, and they're very popular.","1404172824"

""On packaged raw meat and poultry products, the nutrition facts are listed based on the product’s raw weight.""

Of course, if you are logging it on MFP, you can choose to add raw or cooked meat. But 100g of cooked chicken will have more calories than 100g raw chicken, since raw chicken loses water during cooking, thus losing volume. 

The same goes for most foods. The nutritional value for rice, pasta, dried beans, etc. will specify that it's for the raw weight. These gain volume during cooking, as they absorb water.","1404172825"

Arsenal need a striker and they will be problematic, Chelsea have bought Fabregas and apparently Costa, City I'm sure will pick up players. We have a weaker squad that we are improving, they have really good squads they are improving. 

I think even if we get like 5 - 6 top player it will take at least a season to bed them in and get them playing well. I'd love to be proved wrong but I think top 4 should be our target this season. One player is great, but adding Vidal won't put us top 4 to first by himself.

She would have left untouched the laws that prohibited the same acts regardless of the sex of the people involved.

With the military technology we have, a draft wouldn't even be useful enough to implement unless there were troops on the ground in the US or neighboring country. Don't overestimate the power of the US. There have been much more powerful countries come before us and crumbled. We are an extremely young country when it comes to the big picture. We are powerful now, but the tables can always change. An unexpected medical epidemic, economic collapse, mass technology failure,or major natural disaster could put the US in an unexpected prone position for attack. That is when a draft would be a possibility. It seems unlikely, but we should always have a plan if the shit hits the fan. If political corruption gets so bad that the draft is used irresponsibly, laws won't stop the ones in power and would be grounds for civil war.","1404172829"

Than, it doesn’t matter how do you feel or that the accident happened in 1996. Personal experience is a very poor indicator to make a judgement call in this case. Police it is not only the friendly folks walking on the street and hanging out tickets for minor misconducts. That, probably maximum what majority of us would experience during the lifetime.  
By design it is a government institution to enforce government will.  There should be a mechanism for those, who are the subject of these enforcement, the people, to argue their case. If you don’t agree with you speeding ticket, you can go to court, for example. Situation with this girl showed, that in the serious cases of the police misconduct in the state of Victoria there is no such option left. 

You pointed out that the accident was in 1996. Yep, that’s fine. It was long time ago. Many things has changed for good since then. However you missed the point that the decision by the UNHRC was made only about a month ago. 18 years! And the people who are involved in this case are still in the force and promoted. 

Trying to see everything via prism of personal experience, in what, obviously, we are all limited, is a mistake. Think about, the limitations of the rights of the protesters [recently implemented in Victoria](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/victorian-anti-protest-laws-pass-lower-house), increase in militarisation of the police and 18 years of waiting time to get the justice. I would say, the central tendency of changes are alarming at least.","1404172830"

It's definitely as ""bad"" as it appears in the video...

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I don't know about tabloidesque. There just doesn't seem to be any substance.

1. How the fuck is ""So we sort of assume that you’re not part of an oil company"" an attempt to discredit you? In context it's perfectly clear why he said that.

2. You never established that Lush actually took any oil money. At worst, it's money inherited upon the death of someone who made money in oil.

3. If you think that a vegetarian soap seller who eats fish is newsworthy hypocrisy, you shouldn't be a journalist.

4. As far as I can tell from your own article, the man in America isn't the CEO (I think you were talking to the CEO on the phone). And it's neither surprising nor remarkable that a businessman involved in a company that markets itself as green isn't actually an environmentalist.

5. That's not a dig. I worry for your comprehension skills if you don't get the point he's making there.

6. If that's a job offer then I'm a banana, as Private Eye would say.","1404172830"

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","I work for the mosquito control in the US and I'm about 99.9% sure that females are the only ones that bite all animals. As for malaria there isn't currently any cases of it in the u.s not even imported diseases. Now for WNV yes it is very commonly currently the state I work for we are hitting the starting point of the season. As if last Friday we found our first infected mosquito so most likely two weeks from now we will have our first case. But a disease to watch out for at the moment is chickengunya at the moment it is not a major problem because the vector is only found in aedes agyptie which are mostly found in New Orleans, LA but can easily mutate and be able to be transmitted threw aedes albopictus which are commonly found all over the United States.

"india","t5_2qh1q","Petrol prices *could* go down- getting rid of the subsidy increases its price, thereby reducing its demand, a trend that *could* result in a secular decline for petrol (kind of like what we saw in America where a few month-long period of high gas prices just exploded the hybrid/high mileage car market). Of course, if India gets back on the growth engine, this probably won't happen. 

This is a painful solution, but the only long term solution I can foresee regarding high gas prices is letting gas prices rise up as high as possible- force people to think twice about gas-guzzling SUVs and the like and consider fuel efficient alternatives. During the big gas crises of the 1970s, Japan spearheaded the assault on producing low cost, high mileage cars while America continued producing those really wavy, gas-guzzling Detroit cars.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Ugh. What the FUCK happened!"" I said, waking up in the inside of a dumpster. My head hurt, and my ears were bleeding. A quick check left a swatch of blood on my hand, which I wiped off on my shirt, albiet torn and stained with even more blood. ""God damn, those mafia types really miss their money. Still don't know what happened."" Checking my pants, I still had my wallet. ""God i'm hungry. Might as well get a bite to eat."" So I walked down the streets, and I noticed a horde of emergence vehicles storming down the streets. Curious, but not curious enough to see whats up. I had more urgent matters to attend to, such as my growling stomach. Thankfully, there was Dunkin Donuts down the street. Bashful of my torn clothes, I put my head down as I walked in. But oddly enough, no one was inclined to stare at the ragged, mishappen gentleman waltzing into the Dunkin Donuts they happen to be eating at. Not one to complain, I walked up to the register, where the lady there gave me an odd look. ""Two donuts and a small coffee, black."" I handed her a twenty, and she gave me a jumbled mess of bills and coins, still shocked at the disheveled looking man who just asked for a breakfast. With donuts and coffee in hand, I took a seat, and stared at the T.V, not believing my eyes. There I was, or at least, there my body was, being shoved into a body bag by paramedics. Right next to that dumpster where I woke up. A raspy voice called out to me, ""Dave, it happened."" I swung around, and there he was. Death, in all of his hooded glory, scythe propped up on the table. ""So, I guess my time is up. I cheated you enough times. And to think we were such good friends,"" I said with a hint of regret. I didn't want to leave this Earth, not yet at least. ""Yes, we were. You played the game well, but you lost, and and now you pay the iron price. To be honest, I thought you were going to die a more glamorous death. But killed by some goons in a dying criminal organization?"" Death let out a loud guffaw, but no one seemed to care. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I thought I was gonna die that time in Afghanistan. That was one hell of an ambush. But loansharks, what have I become!"" The tinge of sarcasm was hardly overlookable. ""Yeah, and I was right there too. But your time is up. Come, i'll put in a good word for you. This is the end of a fun game, my friend."" And with a swing of his scythe, the River Styx loomed below, and I fell, Death looming over me. They say you see I white light when you die, and that white light is Death's bony skull, whiter than a dove.

Corporations are legal entities designed to limit liability to individuals - that's a fact.  

But why do corporations get to have freedoms normally reserved for individuals, and at the same time they can't be incarcerated or put on death row?  Corporations are made up of individuals that are already endowed with all the rights of normal people.  Seems to me that shareholders and owners are double dipping in the rights bucket.  

Corporations aren't people, they have no soul and usually no conscience.  They are exceptionally greedy, wreak havoc on the environment at times, and will destroy jobs on a whim if it saves profits.  They are obviously not religious if they act as they do and have no soul.  It's ridiculous to give religious rights to a corporation.

Amumu and Nautilus however, still suffer from the same problems that they did before; their early game is awful, the changes to tank junglers actually mean that their early game is slightly worse than it was before, which leaves the aforementioned champions way to vulnerable to early counterjungling; keep in mind that just because tank junglers were buffed doesnt mean that you wont see aggressive early game picks like evelynn, elise, Vi, J4 and the ever annoying lee sin. Nautilus also suffers from the fact that if you pop his shield he literally does 0 damage and until that changes i wouldn't expect to be seeing much of him.","1404172840"

Have you tried replacing coffee with tea (even mint tea if you're trying to eliminate the caffeine variable)? If you don't even like coffee, it could even be a placebo effect like your brain is saying, ""I'm taking my medicine!"" and responds positively.

That said, caffeine is a stimulant and that's standard treatment for ADHD so it could be an example of self-medicating when your emotional reserves are getting low. But if it's cyclic like you're describing, I'd start    at looking at hormones and when it occurs.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Valid point but that issue doesn't seem to be as apparent as you'd think.  There are countless ways to play this deck out so you have to play with the cards you got post mulligan.  If you didn't get images, wyrms, lepers, juggler, then you have to accept the fact you aren't putting early damage into him.  Which means your win condition changes later game.  If you don't have those early rush cards, it means you either have a sick burst combo or lots of card draw... either isn't very bad.  If you don't get the early rush then it performs much like a typical giant freeze deck.

I think the vods cover about 15 games, most of which I won.  You can see how I typically am like ""SHIT, this is gona be rough"" after a mulligan, but with the variety in the deck combined with the fact your opponent doesn't know what you have, make it quite successful.","1404172843"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Caliber isn't what makes a gun easy or hard to shoot, generally speaking.

I feel like you're trying to talk down to me on this one. I've been shooting for 10 years, so please don't. But, I digress, caliber affects recoil.. which can make it harder to shoot. I hate shooting .45 because it's ""snappy"" compared to my 9mm. Some might like having a .45 instead. I said 9mm/45 because they are usually the ""go-tos"" for home protection (aside from a 12ga or 20ga with slugs.)

&gt;If a stalker sees you with a gun and sees where you keep it, they may either steal the gun and commit a crime or even use the gun against you, as they know where it is, too.

Well, assuming you're over 21 (the legal age to buy a handgun in the first place) you could also get a CWP, and keep it with you, or you can carry it in your car without needing a CWP. (I.E. it's always with you.) If you're home you can keep it on a bedside table, or right next to you if you're not in bed. That way it's always by you. I personally keep mine within arms reach..

&gt;Definitely a shitty situation and it sounds like it is still ongoing. The fact that the guy has a young girl living upstairs makes me wonder whether he isn't actually the target here. I'd just get a dog.

Dogs are a good investment. If he knows you have a dog he can bring a nice juicy steak for him, that'll shut him up real fast- Unless you get a trained guard dog, which will run you a lot more than a handgun. If I had to pick one or the other I would stick with a handgun, though, If you could, I would get both.","1404172843"

&gt;""With a vivid fan base, we hope that the \#98 team will bring even more fans to watch NASCAR racing every week,"" said team owner Phil Parsons.

&gt;Along with new fans comes new sponsors, with a crowd-funded effort to help Ron Paul campaign for his 2016 Presidential election. Other sponsors will also be on the 98 car, like Staples, Mountain Dew, Doritos, the hit movie ""Getaway,"" and the Adventurebilt Hat Company, producer of the world's finest fedoras. 

&gt;""I'm really grateful of all the attention that our efforts have brought to PPR,"" Josh Wise said in a recent press conference. ""One day while training, I became enlightened by my own intelligence, so I'm really glad that /r/circlejerk chose me."" PPR also stated that they would consider changing the team's number from 98 to 69 in order to secure the sponsorship deal.

The good games, the close games seemed to always end on who deployed the better tactics. Didn't mean they kept the tactics throughout the entire game, but the deployment of them set up the finish.

If you have audio in there you could try exporting the project as AAF (File -&gt; Export -&gt; Project as AAF file). AAF is a ""cross-platform"" project format - think of it as a stripped-down Logic project. You get the audio tracks, region position/length and that's about it. But if your corrupt tracks will play at all, you can load the AAF back into Logic, save it as a Logic project and then try re-importing the corrupt tracks from that.

1. With the expection of a tattoo that might make me believe that I was in for poor service or a rough time, I'm not sure if I could care less if the person serving me or working on my house/car/dog/body has tattoos. it has NO impact on their ability to set my dog's busted leg, inject me with a needed drug or cook a burger. Why would I care about what these people look like so long as they do good work and don't cheat me on the bill? I don't think a tattoo is much different from a fashion choice. The hostess at my favorite restaurant dresses like a cheap escort -- the kind that works in Vegas. But she's nice, polite and always gets me a table a little sooner than she should because I'm a regular. I may not like how she looks, but it really has no impact on her ability to recognize me as a regular customer and get me seated in record time.

2. no comment.

3. Again, how does a tattoo or a whole bunch of them have anything to do with my Manager's ability to make decisions for my department? I mean, if he had oh... some half-fish, half-girl mess on his arm and he wasn't Navy I might have some questions about his ability to make a good decision, but if I otherwise saw no indication of cloudy logic i don't know that a tattoo would necessarily count as one. If he was a total scatterbrain that consistently made bad decisions, then his tattoos might be the result of that, but they alone do not confirm or deny decision-making prowess. Furthermore, tastes vary. My boss might think geisha with swords on both arms is TOTALLY THE MOST AWESOME THING. Whatever. 

4. Why is it childish to write a story on your skin? People wear permanent jewelry, they show their scars and they look like they do all the time. How is a tattoo different? Really, there's not much substance to your rant here. HOW is a tattoo childish?

(I get the impression you feel like his decision to get a tattoo is somehow invalidating to your idea of common sense. Trust me, unless it is in direct reaction to you, someone elses' life choice cannot invalidate your own. That's like arguing that my choice to not have kids is a judgement on your decision to have kids, or my desire to not smoke at a party is somehow a judgement on those that do. You can construe it that way, but it's going to make you pretty unhappy.)

There is no notion that prayers to god himself cannot be received. In fact. The entire mass can be construed a prayer, and it isn't to Mary. 

The idea of praying to saints, is better understood as praying with saints. In the same way you might ask a dedicated church goer in your life to pray for you, so too can you ask a saint in heaven, of which Mary is an obvious choice.","1404172851"

"blackberry","t5_2qnpz","I've been using the Z10 for several months now and recently got a Q10. I skipped the Z30 because I personally find it too big and inconvenient for easy handling and one-handed usage.

I am almost inclined to say to the prospective BlackBerry owners that they can't go wrong with the Z10, but it's mediocre battery life is a big drawback. Heck, it's one of the main reasons why I got the Q10. However, when I swapped the Z10's 1,800mAh default battery to a third-party 4,500mAh battery I found the frankenstein Z10 to be perfect. The Z10 is now a heavily discounted phone that you can get for really good prices, and I think you should give it a try.

Of course, since you're coming from Android and if you're currently using larger devices like the Galaxy S5 or the HTC One, you may find the Z30 a good fit. Frankly I find that there is absolutely no drawbacks to the Z30 other than the larger size.

Hope it helps.","1404172851"

One weird thing I changed that worked from me (climbed from bronze IV to Diamond V, currently Plat IV because I trolled myself, don't ask lol) Is to think of the game in percentages, and try to get whoever has the highest % to win you the game ahead, and put whoever on the other team that may lose you the game behind.

every action everyone takes affects the likelihood of winning, but you can only control yourself.

A good example is having a xin jungle, and being a mid lulu even though my mid lulu isn't that strong, but always having wards down in the enemies jungle so xin ended up counter jungling the entire game and was 4/0/2 7 minutes in. It was basically a 5v4 after that.

also a good thing to try is find hypercarries and master them, especially if they are ""under the radar"" so to speak. nasus is still just as viable, jungle olaf is crazy strong still, kogmaw and tristana are both beasts bot lane, and syndra in mid never gets banned but is always a threat.","1404172858"

[[Cauldron of Souls]] is always a viable option, especially if you're running a bunch of the sac slivers. 

I wouldn't recommend Akroma's or Eldrazi. Sliver decks want to play fast and keep their creatures on the field. Akroma's doesn't protect you from wraths (which is really the only thing that hoses you) and Monument forces you to sacrifice your anthems.

We were always frugal - bought what we needed and saved the rest, rather than just spending all the money we had. Neither of us has had that mindset where we had to trick ourselves into saving money. I think our parents instilled that in us.

There definitely was a change when we prioritized this. We started worrying more, thinking about money more, trying harder to save. We went from spending $4000/month on a combined income of $7000, to spending about $2800. It still shocks me that we did that, but it's come with no reduction in happiness for either of us. Reduced internet speeds, cut extra data plans, started making wine instead of buying 2 bottles a week, stopped eating out so much, stopped buying so many games, that kind of thing.

We currently have about $300k in liquid investments (90% stocks), and about $100k of equity in our condo.

Parents roll their eyes at us when we say we want to retire at 40. Guess I'll have to prove it before they believe. Nobody else knows.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","This has always been my experience as well, as well for my friends.  When police respond to a male/female conflict, primary aggressor policies are going to stack the deck against the guy, even if she weighs more than him.  All she has to do when the police show is start up the waterworks and claim that after she tried to engage him with some fun, joking banter and playfulness that he slapped her and called her fat.

I wouldn't expect the police to review any video.  That's the guy's job and he can get a lawyer, get the video, and take it to the judge.  The cops are not concerned with who did it, just preventing it continuing.  By taking the guy away, they know she won't slap him again (or he won't slap her again).  It's generally more challenging, annoying, and difficult to arrest her because they would have to call a female cop to search her, plus deal with her histrionics.  If they arrest the guy, they have resolved the situation with as little work as possible.

Do not call the police over someone getting slapped unless you are **completely** certain who the police will see as the bad guy.  Even then, don't expect them to realize that is the case right away when they have a sobbing, incoherent woman to deal with.","1404172863"

White Lion sucks.

I still have the emails of which include the message that shows they only really  tried to resolve my issue after I left them awful feedback. They had an excuse of course, and ""asked"" if I would edit my feedback once they sent my cards. I agreed because what else can you do? If Chris wants to dispute these facts I can pull up tcg player show the order dates the messages emails etc.

For fun you can check the messages.

"westerospowers","t5_31la9","King Leonen stood at one end of the wide, flat field. At the far end stood an army of northmen, and, at their head, Lord Gregor Snow. Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-dragger that he was the man had a reputation as a fierce warrior. This fight should be interesting.

He called to his squire and the boy brought him a goblet of Arbor gold in one hand and *Dragonsbane* in t'other. He drained the goblet in one go and drew the sword, shrugging his buckler into place on his forearm. He called to the Northman:

**""Lady Snow? You there? We going to start this or what?""**

In answer, his opponent picked up his own blade, castle-forged steel, and lowered the visor on his helm. Slowly - deathly slow - the two advanced towards one another.

Cries on both sides of the field picked up as the lords met for the first time. Leonen struck first, his blade scoring the front of Snow's breastplate. Snow was quick though, and struck back with a powerful blow crosswise. The swing came from Leonen's right - his sword arm - and he stepped back hastily to avoid the cut. Nonetheless, the blow crunched heavily as it hit the Westerman's mail hauberk. Leonen felt hot blood well from the base of his ribs and he bit back a curse.

He swung again, diagonally this time and gave the Northman a hearty wallop upside the greathelm. Snow parried the next swing and slammed full-force into Leonen's shield; denting the iron and cracking the oak. Leonen pushed back with the buckler and the bigger Northman lost his balance, tumbling heavily into the dust.

Leonen, pressing his advantage, swung overhand and swore loudly as Snow rolled to the side, *Dragonsbane* thudding into the hard-packed ground and shivering sideways. Gregor cut back and would have taken Leonen's head off, were it not for a well-timed duck. As it stood, a red line scored across Leonen's cheek and began bleeding profusely. Leonen found his feet and the two men backed off, circling like jackals. The crowd roared once more as the two came together again, crashing like thunder.

Leonen caught another heavy blow with his buckler and cried out as the shield split with a crack. Cursing, he swung the shield like a weapon and dented Snow's greathelm again, nearly knocking off the thing. Snow replied with rage:

**Just... fucking... DIE!**

A downward cut struck Leonen just above the left elbow - a quickly caught and delivered upward swing was dodged - barely. A final overhand slash meant to split Leonen lengthwise would never find its' mark. Leonen thrust upward with all his strength, driving his blade through the vulnerable opening beneath Snow's sternum. He felt the weight of the big Northman slacken and withdrew his blade, watching the form of his foe slump to the ground; lifeless.","1404172875"

"funny","t5_2qh33","When I was visiting Bombay a few years ago, I found the ""Ask the Sexpert"" section in their papers hilarious. I was only there for 4-5 days and in that time, there was a guy who wanted masturbation instructions, a woman who received a Dildo from an american friend and had no idea how to use it, a man who couldn't stop jizzing into his own mouth(and swallowing) and wondered if he would get pregnant, a boy who was worried that masturbation(or ""Shagging with the hands"" as he put it) was detrimental to his health because he ""Felt weak when a liquid strongly came out"", a guy who wanted advice to convince people and his mother that it was totally fine to suck on his mother's nipples like a child(he was in his mid 30's) and was upset that his friends thought it was disgusting, a man who couldn't please his woman by SCRATCHING her insides and needed scratching tips, etc. It was so ridiculous I struggled to believe it was real, but apparently because many Indians live in such conservative societies, especially the more traditional families, there isn't ""sex ed"" per say. ""The talk"" doesn't happen either so people are genuinely pretty clueless. I wish I collected those clippings. ","1404172876"

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","&gt; not really sure this would be the best choice for a singer songwriter trying to mix some songs he's made. 

I feel that maybe the others programs would have more option for what I do... but Ableton Live is so easy to me to use and I guess you can do pretty much the basic stuff there. For my level of expertice, I guess is good. But it would be probably good to start using another DAW and compare, I dont know whitch yet... where I work (music related) some people use Sonar and others Nuendo.

&gt; Anyway, go watch all of these videos You could also watch these for a more general overview from one of the best mixers in the busienss.

Great thanks. I tried in the pass recording/mixing/adding effects videos, but there were to slow for me, or show me things that worked for things that I dont do or seek. Thats why I asked here. Maybe some of you could tell me some things that were so related to what I'm working with that I could test them inmidiately, and then pay more attention and learn more about them.

I will try theese and see, thanks!","1404172876"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Almost every item you buy is immediately gold efficient. At 2500 HP I can pick up an Atma's Impaler and (assuming I can properly use the crit chance) its gold efficiency will be ~117%. At this point in the game one could choose to finish an item instead, like maybe you turned a Ruby Chrystal into a Warmog's Armor. This also scales with health, and at this point in the game has a 125% gold efficiency. For the gold you just paid you actually got 145% efficiency. Finishing other items (like a Bloodthirster) give even more efficiency, and these mid-game power spikes carry through into late game. 

That's what Atma's lacks. It's not significant enough of a power spike mid game, and it doesn't bring as much to late game.","1404172884"

"LifeAfterNarcissism","t5_30biu","First, you will never smash the tape to pieces. You will only be able to shorten the playtime more and more until you just hear a single note. A blip. But I think it will always be there somewhat. 

I think the first thing is to build awareness. Notice when the tape is playing. What does it feel like in your body when it's playing? What does it say?

I like to tell on the tape. I'll give a quick example. My NPDdad was constantly shaming me around food. Tonight for dinner we had a baked pasta dish with turkey meatballs. I know from my hand-dandy LoseIt! app that a portion is about 340 calories. High in carbs but it's not an excessive meal. I was shaking some parm. cheese on it and I remembered my dad saying ""just shake some fat on your food!"" when I was a kid. I looked at the nutrition facts and showed my SO and told him what was going on with me. He said ""remember when he said avocados are bad for you?"" We laughed. He doesn't know much about nutrition! 

So there's one example. 

Sometimes, when I need the big guns, I will actually do a little gesture I made up where I push my hands out from my heart to ""push"" the inner critic away with an exhale and then put my hands over my heart with an inhale and say ""I got this. I'm ok. I'm good enough."" or whatever I need to hear at that moment. It's a little cheesy, but eventually I did it enough that my body is trained to start calming down immediately when I push my hands out!

I hope something in there is helpful! :)

It wasn't until years later that I realized how messed up the whole thing was for a parent to lean on their kid for support ('emotional incest' I believe they call it in the lingo?).  I still find it hard to this day to bring up anything about myself in conversation with him because I'm so used to him just prattling on about his problems.  In the end, I feel you on that aspect...it sucks to have your issues subjugated so your parents can make you *their* surrogate parent.

As far as advice, I wouldn't spend too much time trying to change the nature of the relationship with your parents other than to establish some boundaries as to what you are and what you aren't willing to accept as far as their encroachment into your life.  I would also strongly suggest to start looking for outlets to get your own needs expressed and met.  It sounds as though that was probably something you never got, and it would be a shame for that to continue or-- worse-- be passed on to the next generation.  Hope that helps.

What about keeping known criminals/terrorists under active surveillance. 

What is very clear is one of two things... 
Either the PA can't control their citizens and this is gross negligence... 
or 
They are complicit in these crimes and don't belong in power.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; I stuck with the same point I've always made, which is that if all things are equal, a woman isn't really going to be strong enough to cause substantial damage

This is precisely what I have been consistent in disagreeing with. The assumption that women will not cause ""substantial damage"" is not warranted. 

I'm not even sure your comment makes sense. You say *if all things are equal,* and then go right on to assume that they *aren't* equal (""a woman isn't really going to be strong enough...""). If you only mean *some* things, which things?

&gt;it's you use the force necessary to defend yourself and nothing more.  

It seems to me you said something a little different, initially. Specifically, you said that women are ""not going to cause *enough* damage to justify attacking back"" (emphasis mine). You grant that a woman *will* cause damage, but imply the man should just take it because he is only capable of using ""force greater than necessary."" That's two assumptions I disagree with: 1) women can't cause ""enough"" damage to justify a response, and 2) men can't vary their own  use of force in self-defense. Yet, you're OK with him restraining her, which *is* using force, and will likely cause bruising and other injuries.

As a fellow Korean, I mean no offense in saying this, I'm just trying to be honest.

A record of 6-5 is pretty much shit for someone who aspires of going to the Olympics, unless you started as a scrub and got with a good trainer and just won 6 straight.

Boxing requires qualification, so there are no walk-ons.  To qualify for your chosen region, you will have to be better then everyone in your weight, and most of those guys have been getting ready for Rio since London ended.

The use of self-defense must also match the level of the threat in question.  In other words, a person can only employ as much force as required to remove the threat.  If the threat involves deadly force, the person defending themselves can use deadly force to counteract the threat.  If, however, the threat involves only minor force and the person claiming self-defense uses force that could cause grievous bodily harm or death, the claim of self-defense will fail.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Before anyone tries to give you ideas for ""VMO strengthening"", this is a concept that is true in theory but there aren't any quad exercises that will strengthen the VMO better than one another. It is a rather old concept and the current concept in treatment *also includes* hip strengthening. I'd hate to elaborate more as no one can give specific advises over the internet.

&gt; I can't remember many of the exercises he had me do, but even when I was doing them consistently I never saw much improvement. 

If conservative treatment has failed, then you should address this with your PT and especially an orthopedic doctor (not just a regular one). It is not uncommon for people to undergo surgeries such as a ""lateral retinacular release"" and/or in more severe cases a ""tibial tubercle osteotomy"", both typically have good outcomes but will require some time to rehabilitate. You should really discuss this with an orthopedic doctor since conservative treatment has failed and you continue to have difficulties with daily life and activities.

edit - it's probably not a bad idea to search for ""patella subluxation"" or something along the lines and see if you can find the same exercises that you did when you were still seeing a PT.","1404172899"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Not if you're just trying get a hold of the basics, though. As a new player, you're better off learning the game as a whole more than learning about heroes. Especially considering how small the selection of heroes in lower tiers is, it's okay to not know every interaction of every spell in the game. Having a big pool of heroes may increase your knowledge. But your mechanical skill remains stagnant for the most part. Because you're consistently jumping from doing one thing to another. Having about 10-15 heroes that you play constantly however, trains your mechanical skill as well as teaching you basic interactions in the game. That said however, after you've become experienced in the game, pigeon holing yourself is the last thing you should do.","1404172900"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I find that spin isn't that vital depending on team lineup, if they don't have a lot of disables, I won't need the extra cd, and crit works for killing faster, getting that 2nd big item up.  Conversely, if we have a strong tower push lineup, healing ward doesn't need to be maxed that quickly.  The spin/omni combo at level 6 is highly overrated IMO, the likelihood of catching a single opponent by himself, far enough away from creeps and other heroes so that you can kill him with an omni isn't that high.  Hopefully, you have a teammate ganking with you, and can secure the kill without having to spin/boots chase.

But every game is slightly different, there's definitely times I wish I had dropped 2 points into stats, but I find it's less often than I wish I would have had 1 more crit fall in the opponent.

I don't find that the likelihood of having crit maxed out is *that* rare, not everyone goes by the in-game guides that blindly.","1404172903"

Also, depending on the age range, sometimes (and this is shocking, so hold on to your hats, folks) women can be immature. But so can men, especially when they see some women being honest about their preferences and assume that 1) it's all women and 2) they are being shallow. If a man said he wanted to date girls who were blonde or under 5'7"", he would just say it like #sorrynotsorry, and people would say, wow he is really honest and forward.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","The sad truth is that elemental arrow itself is pretty lackluster, so most builds revolve around different skills with gear to support it. It's a great bow from lower levels up until about Torment 1/2, where most mobs are starting to have too much HP for it to be viable time-wise.

The lacklusterness is mainly because of 3 reasons:

1. The choice of elemental rune is poor. The only fire rune adds a fear, so fire builds usually take the unruned skill. Frost is pretty good in packs, but rely on positioning and is not well-supported as an element thanks to a lack of frost runes on other skills. The other skills are too slow and only adds utility, not damage.

2. The damage per hatred is cost efficient, but at higher levels of resource cost reduction, elemental arrow falls completely behind the other skills. 

3. Elemental arrow is currently bugged when using sentries and 6p Marauder. The attack speed is locked at 1.00 APS unless the sentry can be spawned out of combat.


If I could change it, I would either make it increase the damage of elemental arrow by 100%, let it be affected by all your combined elemental damage, or remove the resource regen and make it simply shoot every type of elemental arrow per shot. If Wand of Woh can triple the damage of a 616% wepdmg skill, then surely the Kridershot could quadruple a 300% one.","1404172908"

She had just grabbed one of her party cds.  After the song which was supposed to be on repeat. Nut bush city limits started blaring. It was pretty funny.

Later my mother in law wanted to a speech. I was not keen for this, she was spectacularly pissed, it was the first time she had been in a room with her ex husband in 10 years. They had a bitter divorce. I do mean bitter. Also the first time meeting his wife. It was a long torturous rambling. Eventually a friend of mine just started clapping and everyone followed. She went and sat down and got even drunker.

There was a hold up at a store a few doors down and as a couple of guys were leaving they got thrown to the ground and frisked. They matched a description.  They were let go.

Imagine an all you can eat buffet filled with a dizzying array of fried delicious goodness, plump dumplings in all shapes and sizes and, mango pancakes. This buffet however is not like your normal ""Oh man. Now I need to get up, **AGAIN!**, to get more incredible food to stuff my face with *sigh*. 

But that's not the case with the glorious Yumcha. No with Yumcha the magnificent, Yumcha the **ALL MIGHTY!** the food comes to you laden on carts so plentiful, so multitudinous, they almost seem infinite. Racing around the room these bearers of earthly delights are never far away, always happy, always excited to help you in your goal to exceed the maximum load limit on the elevator to the ground floor. This only begins to encapsulate the near divine that is Yumcha and don't even get me started on the ambrosia that is mango pancakes as words will fail me. 

This is what Bulma being the brains behind the operation would do and with their speed and Japanese influence I can imagine that this would be a truly wonderful Yumcha, a Yumcha that would put all others to **SHAME!**

No it would have been what was required by the actual process of democracy.

Apparently the leaders of Hamas and Fatah wanted it until now.

The policy permits scripts running on pages originating from the same site – a combination of [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme), [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname), and [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking\))  – to access each other's [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) with no specific restrictions, but prevents access to [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) on different sites.  The same-origin policy also applies to [XMLHttpRequest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) and to [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

&gt;This mechanism bears a particular significance for modern web applications that extensively depend on [HTTP cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to maintain authenticated user sessions, as servers act based on the HTTP cookie information to reveal sensitive information or take state-changing actions. A strict separation between content provided by unrelated sites must be maintained on the client side to prevent the loss of data confidentiality or integrity.

Me: ""What is this?!?!""   

Him: ""Crack.""

Me: ""You smoke crack?!?""

Compare to a state like New York. His functional STATE tax rate could easily be over 10% at his level of income, especially if he lives in New York City.

Another fun fact -- professional athletes have some pretty complicated taxes. Income is considered earned in the state where you played the game. That means returns have to be filed all over the country. Given this, the best teams to play for (tax-wise) are in Texas.  You play 41 games at home, away games against other Texas teams, and against Memphis.","1404172921"

I am very sympathetic to the gay rights movement and have personal ties to it through family and friends. My sister is gay, and if I told her that we should nuke the gays, she would roll her eyes, tell me to shut up and stop trolling. I think the significance of that statement is overblown. One may argue that it should not be used in a professional environment, but neither should cock monster (another term I think is over blown).

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Not counting playoffs for either in baseball a player would have to play 16.2 seasons to hit Cal's record.
Not counting playoffs a football player would have to play 18.5 seasons to match Favre's record.  Also note that Favre's record is starting the game not just playing in it which adds another bit of difficulty.

From google the average NFL career lasts 3.3 season and average baseball one lasts 5.6 seasons.

It seems unlikely that either record will be broken in the modern era but considering baseball players have longer average careers and less seasons to play I still think that is more likely.

I don't have the baseball stats broken down but adding in playoff starts makes Favre's record equivalent to 20 regular seasons.  Favre had 297 consecutive starts in the regular season, to put that in perspective there are only 10 other players ever to even play 297 regular season games and only 1 other player that wasn't a kicker (Jerry Rice).  Manning would have to play for 3.5 more seasons to hit 297 total, not counting consecutive.  From what I can find there are 34 baseball players to have played enough games to meet or exceed Cal's consecutive record.  From the numbers it seems more common and more likely for a baseball player to have a long enough career to challenge the record.

Shit might be a harsh word but considering the quality that we've seen in this world cup, it was a bit of a disappointing hattrick. Compare it to Shaqiri's or the brace of James or Messi and there's a remarkable difference between the quality of the goals.","1404172925"

I love it. It does the job nicely for pre-set home coffee when I'm not making lattes at work. I almost went with a different brand because it had higher ratings, but after reading the reviews I saw it required differently-shaped filters, and I didn't want the 150+ filters I already had to go to waste. So that's another plus, it takes normal home-machine filters (which are usually cheapest).

I much, much prefer my thermal carafe to the glass ones more commonly used. There's not only no more ""oops, left the machine(burner) on and the glass pot has coffee sludge burned into it AGAIN"" issues, but as a fellow barista, you probably also understand that continually cooking your coffee messes up the flavor. I firmly believe there's nothing wrong with a good percolator for home use, especially for the convenience of programming it to have your coffee ready when you want it. A solid coffee will survive being percolated, never fear.","1404172925"

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","I think Brandchan is right about drywall and electrical ground. I think it's the headaches that make houses seem old. Ungrounded electrical systems, knob and tube wiring, lead paint, asbestos... all expensive health/safety hazards... and once you go back before the post-WW2 housing boom, the construction methods are way less standardized and the way the foundations and framing were done are considered structurally unsound by today's standards. This probably matters more in the US than England because we have hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes in much of the country, and the building codes are aimed at making houses able to withstand those forces.

Anything from before 1900 I'd call really old, and 300 years is more like historic preservation status. Many states didn't even exist 300 years ago. Areas that are now densely populated were wilderness. This is more true the further west you go. I live in Oregon and 300 years ago, it was mostly still Native Americans living here.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Honestly I always liked Riot but lately I just don't know what they are trying to accomplish. It's almost as if Riot is the next Blizzard.

Just to mention the things I hate about Riot's recent decisions and changes.

- Nerfing every champion until they are unplayable (Olaf, Zac and now Kha'zhix )
- Buff timers, Dragon ard Baron timers aren't okay either but more acceptable.
- Spreading S4 Worlds over SEA and KR.
- BT changes = unplayable which led to a nerf across BT dependent champions like Graves.
- Shifting Early-mid game to mid-Lategame.
- LCS / Challenger formats is horrible compared to OGN Champions and NLB.
ONLY THE PLAYOFFS MATTER.
- Entertainment over the integrity of LoL as a legimate E-Sports ( SK vs. Gambit (NEVER FORGET) London LCS (0:2 Gambit due VISA issues)

Honestly I'm fed up with Riot's decisions and will quit the game. They always promise stuff which take forever. The visual update is nice but not enough. There are so many things wrong with the current game that it will either take 2-3 years to fix all of them.

- Replay
- Shen disabled for almost over a year
- 20-25 Champions are out of +120 viable - 6 bans = 14-19 champions in competetive play.
- EU servers took forever to fix (2-3 years)
- 80-110 ms is a normal ping in NA
- Riot's LCS will slowly kill LoL because the amateur scene can't or hardly grow due to the fact that the LCS is closed enviroment.
Results = LCS teams can't go to KR and participate in OGN Champions which just increases the gap between Korean and western teams, which will be obvious in international events where KR teams stomps everyone else resulting in less exciting games due to a clear winner.
Examples:
KT B won IEM Katowice without losing once. 
SKT T1K won Allstars Paris without dropping a single game.

- Amateur teams can't make a living unless they get into LCS which hurts the NA EU scene overall because it decreases the motivation of Challenger players.

You might be able to get some detail by playing with layer opacity and blend modes (I'd start with ""Luminosity"" blend mode at 50%). Edge glow I'm less sure about.

So far, no issues whatsoever with Pangu with the devices I jailbroke which are iPhone 5S, 5, 4S, iPad Air, iPad Mini Retina, iPad 3 and 4.

With evasi0n, there were some cases where apps were incorrectly stashed.  As a result, certain app were missing.  This was the majority of the reason with problems encountered with evasi0n.

So far, Pangu has been one the smoothest jailbreaks, but to be fair, there were a greater number of iOS 6 backups transitioning to iOS 7 with evasi0n.

It seems that too many people who encounter issues performing their jailbreak are too quick to blame the jailbreak rather than to look for issues that may have been introduced in their setups.  Fact is, the majority of people have used Pangu without a hitch.  More so than this subreddit portrays in fact.

Lucas always wanted to make a movie based on these serials that he grew up on thus Indy was born.  It was natural that one of these was going to to have aliens in it.  Even the titles of the films shows this pattern.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Hey, so first off, as the other poster said, less deaths, more CS, especially as an AD carry. Your builds seem a little questionable. On Jinx, IE -&gt; Shiv/PD -&gt; LW -&gt; BOTRK tends to be the best. Ghostblade, while a strong item, simply doesn't fit with jinx's playstyle. You should only be buying it on ADCs that need to maximize AA damage for a few seconds - think Twitch, Quinn and Lucian. Also, Zephyr is almost never worth it on Quinn, and definitely not as early as you're getting it.

Your summoners are also a little questionable. You really should have heal on an ADC. You shouldn't be in range to use it in team fights, and in fights in bottom lane, you need to prioritize staying alive to keep doing damage, and heal helps with this. Heal also scales better into keeping you safe in the late game, which is very important.

This is all I can help with with just seeing your match history. Feel free to ask questions if you're confused about anything.","1404172939"

"canada","t5_2qh68","A lot of people here seem to be missing the crucial fact that a Basic Income would **replace** a lot of government programs that are already spending a whack of money (or foregoing tax revenue, in the case of tax deductions and tax credits).

In fact, my preferred idea for implementing BI would be to **phase** it in.  Don't jump straight to $20k or whatever. Do it in stages.  For example:

* An easy first stage is to start by taking your ~$12,000 basic deduction — **and** the corresponding spouse deduction, which you get if your spouse has no income (and gets clawed back if she makes a bit) — from your T1 tax form.  The lowest federal tax bracket is 15%, so right now, if you make more than $12k/yr, that deduction nets you $1800/yr. = $150/mo.  So right there, start with $1800/yr. for everybody.  The added cost would just be providing that income for those people who **don't** already make $12k/yr.
* Next, means-tested tax credits.  The maximum you can get for the GST credit, for example, is $265/quarter = $1060/yr.  Add that to the $1800 above, and now you can start with $2860/yr.
* Lather, rinse, and repeat for things like the Child Tax Credit (maybe use that as the basis for a child BI, paid to the mom or appropriate custodial guardian, say), and anything else on our tax forms that's either ""almost universal"" or ""meant to help poor people"".

So with this start, you now have comparatively little extra spending, much of which will now be saved with simpler tax forms.

Next, add in EI, work with the provinces on integrating it with their income tax systems and welfare systems etc., and just keep going a bit at a time.","1404172940"

"BitcoinMining","t5_2skbb","Sorry to be so misleading, I don't actually mine or buy. I've been studying and analyzing the hell out of BTC since last November, and I can't come up with enough reasons to jump in. I don't mind putting some thoughts out there to get some thinking going. Being in the U.S., I really don't feel like writing down the amount of BTC and assigning a daily average price to all BTC mined every day. 

Remember, all BTC mined is taxable in the current tax year as income and is also taxable again when you spend it, assuming the BTC you were holding has increased in value while you were holding it. Imagine trying to figure out how much all the BTC you spend was worth when you mined it, considering you'd mine about $1 a day (all at a different price)?

If that sounds like a nightmare to you, that's why I don't mine and why I certainly don't mine with the intent of spending. You have to report the day, quantity and value of all BTC you've mined (and already paid tax on as income) when you spend it. Yes it sounds easier than setting up a monthly buy, but still a reporting nightmare.","1404172941"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I have seen the so called 'history,' and I have read the actual court transcripts for many cases, and I am not impressed. 

a. There is zero evidence that child sexual abuse is any more prevalent within Jehovah's Witnesses than in any other group or association in the world. It happens yes -- sexual abuse can happen at anytime and anywhere. But simply saying that it happens is much different than saying that it is chronic or above average within a certain group, which requires heavy proof. 

b. You hear a lot of stories simply because the ones telling them are extremely vocal; and the most vocal ones with stories tend to coalesce into a seemingly significant group merely because they share a common former life style and a common focus of antagonism. But it is an illusion of significance simply because the vast majority of victims do not share such common bonds and therefore do not speak with a loud unified voice. You are also grouping stories together spanning 10-40 years, which can balloon the total number.

If you look at any nationwide childhood sexual abuse statistics, you will see my point clearly: 

1. 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys is a victim of child sexual abuse;
2. Self-report studies show that 20% of adult females and 5-10% of adult males recall a childhood sexual assault or sexual abuse incident;
3. During a one-year period in the U.S., 16% of youth ages 14 to 17 had been sexually victimized;
4. Over the course of their lifetime, 28% of U.S. youth ages 14 to 17 had been sexually victimized;

c. Also something to keep in mind: up until the Conti ruling a couple of years ago, the Jehovah's Witnesses had *never* in their 100 year history had a summary civil judgment levied against them. Their running record was $0.00, as compared to the 10's of millions that the Mormons, Catholics and Baptists have paid out to victims. And even that Conti case is in appeal right now, and is very likely to be overturned (I've read the entire case from front to back). That will return the Witnesses once again to $0.00 in summary judgments. That is the ""long history"" you should be looking at. ","1404172942"

Here's [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/rDoY2p4.png) as well as a [Larger](http://i.imgur.com/qw99cFH.png) version that is magnified by 4x.  Be sure to zoom in if your browser downscales the larger image.

Here's how I achieved this, and it can able be made playable if you use the Windows Magnifier (best solution I've found thus far.)

**EDIT:** *Actually, I just realized I made this far more complicated than it needed to be!  Don't follow any of the steps below.  Instead, just switch to windowed and resize the window as small as it allows.  It will be 400x240.*

- ~~In your user folder, in **AppData\Roaming\Yacht Club Games\Shovel Knight\** open **render.bin** in any text editor.~~

- ~~Change the **width** and **height** values to **400** and **240** respectively, and make sure **fullscreen** is set to **0**.~~

The game doesn't seem to mind at all running at this resolution and the pixel ratio is perfect in all instances that I saw in my testing.  I'm not going to detail how to use Magnifier to zoom in on the game window, as it should be self-explanatory.  Enjoy! :)

However, so is the overreach of people claiming that this isn't that big of a deal. The precedence is there for religious control of a medical issue... which opens the door to vaccines, blood transfusions, anesthesia, and other more popular forms of birth control. 

There is a lot of overreaction by both sides. Ultimately, this needs to be seen as an overall bad precedence that sets religious institutions up for receiving many benefits without having to pay for costs. It also opens up a giant black hole of a loophole that would allow corporations to attempt to opt out of things based on a belief.","1404172945"

Second, getting rid of the tax exempt status isn't that easy. Because heath insurance has been so entwined with employment, workers have made salary concessions in order to ensure better healthcare based on that tax deduction. To simply remove it is the equivalent of cutting those people's salaries. 

Finally, if everyone could get a better plan on the open market then this mandate wouldn't be needed. I'd feel better about this ruling if Obamacare had the public option and it was open to everyone. Then we could be guaranteed that everyone had the option of a healthcare plan that suited their needs.

A lot of the generalizations about the player's opinions felt disproportionate and exaggerated. On a side note, Riot's major issue with the Curse Voice client was that it was not accessible to all players, prominently in its closed beta form. Riot did not want to create a conundrum similar to WoW, where certain third party add-ons became necessary to maintain a competitive level. As a result, Riot reinforced their policy on third party programs to accommodate their own control over the features in their own game. The article tries to make out Riot as having sinister intentions in their creation of jungle buff timers and a possible voice chat feature. This is far from the truth, as Riot is simply wanting to maintain all features of their own game to be within their own client; all players have the ability to access features given by Riot, not requiring additional research into third party programs. I think Riot is making the absolute correct decision in their third party policy, as well as their development of these features.","1404172950"

If they genuinely thought so they wouldn't allow themselves to be paid for in a situation in which I am culturally obligated due to 'patriarchy.' Also, I disagree with your assessment. I don't think feminists are genuinely interested in equality. If you notice, none of the theory or advocacy calls for proactive action against benevolent sexism.

&gt;he idly wondered how long it would be until lunch.

I think the ""idly"" isn't necessary when you've already established that he's daydreaming rather than paying attention to his duties. 

&gt;Taras indicated a patch of relatively open space to one side of the road

Relatively open how? Is it the only clearing in the forest? Is it just a nice spot with some shade? Brief description here that's a little more specific would work better, I think.

&gt;Her eyes tightened beneath her helmet.

Dude, what? Do you mean her eyes narrowed? She assumed a displeased expression maybe? Eyes tightening just sounds bizarre to me, unless the person has a migraine or a hangover.

&gt;near the edge of the makeshift camp

Makeshift camp? I thought they were only stopping for like ten minutes--that's hardly enough to consider it a camp.

&gt;his dried rations – jerky and a few handfuls of dried fruit.

Lose the first ""dried;"" the two types of food make that obvious.

&gt;At least he could eat in peace.

In peace from what, his superior expressing concern for her subordinates and letting them take a break? I was going to say this makes him a little unsympathetic to me, but after consideration, if he's meant to mature as a person throughout the story, it works. 

Pinion seems whiny. Dunno whether he's meant to or not. The next few paragraphs after he shows up seem a little dry. 

&gt;rumors of its use echoed with words like powerful and miraculous

Rumors of its use? You just told us that it was used by people who believed it had certain properties. Do you mean rumors of its effects? As for the descriptions, miraculous is fine, but powerful feels a little...bland, obvious, maybe.

&gt;folks in the lower ones, having little else to believe in, clung to such fancies like handfuls of coins.

This metaphor doesn't quite work. The lower classes clung to their belief in magical healing just like they clung to the large amounts of money that, by definition, they don't have?

&gt;He paused as if for dramatic effect.

No no no. I'm not going to claim that a sentence like this can never work, but IMO it doesn't work here. At this point, though, I'm assuming that you intend Pinion to be a whiny gossip and base any further comments about him on that. 

&gt;“Gods above, all I really give a scag about is delivering this parcel in one chaffing piece.”

The slang in this sentence, it doesn't really work unless you're going for comedy. 

&gt;This made Stonewall drop his eyes to the apple core in his grip

I thought he only had dried fruit? Or are whole dried apples actually a thing?

Okay, so I read to the end, but only because it was short. 

Was the talking boring?

Sort of. For me, it wasn't the fact that it was told through dialogue, it was that the way the characters talk--kind of a mixture of formal/oldfashioned and modern--didn't quite feel like it worked, but most of all it was that they all seemed to talk the same way. What I got for characterization was this: Pinion makes a lot of dramatic gestures and complains a lot and spreads rumors. Not all that likeable, but it works. Stonewall, on the other hand, kind of seems like he lacks both personality and awareness--I realize the latter is for the sake of providing info to the reader, but his continual questions, even regarding information he was told, such as the mage's name, make it seem like he has no idea what he's going, and when he's not asking questions, he's just responding to Pinion in dull platitudes.

The slang I've already commented on a bit. It's easy enough to figure out the meaning, just some of it sounds a little ridiculous.

Did I want to keep reading? Eh, not particularly after about the first page, but I also don't read a lot of the sword-and-sorcery stuff, so it could just be that.","1404172954"

And then there's the running around in Guayaquil, which is 3 hours away from where I live, and La Libertad and various hardware stores trying to find all of the parts to make my makeshift brewing setup. And I just bought a fridge a few weeks ago to make into a fermentation fridge because it's too hot here to ferment without it. So all in all, about a year of running around, planning, reading, building, sourcing, and finally got my grains and hops delivered today by bus from Quito, and getting a fresh batch of US-05 off of my buddy's latest IPA brew tonight so I can wash and store that, and I have some dry packs from the US to do some other types of beers. Making a saison this weekend, then who knows... unfortunately I'm limited to only a few types of grains and hops and yeasts, so I will make do with other ingredients from Ecuador to try some interesting things. Looking forward to learning all about this stuff and making some tasty brews!","1404172958"
"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","What if that nazi officer was a Buddha who could venerate anne frank?

There are many things we do not know, so it is very important to honestly acknowledge things that are factual and just so.

From my experience, that which is just so is what the Buddha said. Everything the Buddha said I cannot verify BUT, the things he said and which I have experienced for myself are true.

Using this as the foundation, I read his words and regard them as the truth.

One of the things he said was that you must speak truth in all aspects.

You must speak truth if you are kidnapped by people selling kidneys, and they ask you: ""Do you have aids?"" - Speak the truth;

You must speak truth if you harbor Anne Frank, although I recommend that you either stay silent or not get into the position of getting questioned by a nazi officer.

Yes, you would knowingly put an individual in great harm for truth. Delusion is much more painful then any pain you can experience in truth.

Do you think I am fat?

Speak the truth. Say yes if you think the asker is fat, and say no if you think the asker is not fat. Venerate them with truth, because those who live in delusion suffer much more

Truth is a child growing, delusion is a man who is spending all his money on luxeries without an income.","1404172958"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Keep in mind that the trivalent flu vaccine is made up of different strains that are predicted to be circulating throughout the population in the coming flu season, so it's not always representative of what you might actually be exposed to. The Trivalent Influenza Vaccina (TIV) is the injectable form of the vaccine consisting of killed flu virus containing two Influenza A strains, as well as one Influenza B strain, but in the future I believe they'll be including another flu B, to make the vaccine quadrivalent. The Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) or ""FluMist"", is already quadrivalent.

As for your question, the HA (hemagglutinin) or NA (neuraminidase) proteins obviously differ between the strains that are used in each version of the vaccine, but it doesn't really matter whether these proteins are drifted or shifted, since the strains included are predicted from those already circulating in the southern hemisphere. Those particular strains have been sequenced and their HA and NA subtypes are known. Using a reverse genetics approach, the viruses for the vaccine can be produced *in vitro* with a different influenza backbone, but will still include the HA or NA proteins from the strains predicted to be circulating. Generally there is a combination of HA and NA subtypes, like H1N1, or H5N1 - something like that, though again it depends on what's been predicted to circulate. Hope that helps, but feel free to ask if you need clarification.","1404172962"

A teacher told him he wasn't good enough so now he has to beat John Cena for all the girls that weren't pretty enough to be prom queen? What? His message was built up to be this huge sinister ordeal, when really it has no real impact on anything anywhere.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In 2011 we had year 10 school camp. Camp ran Monday to Friday, and Monday to Wednesday was our campout. Our class was split in half, and we had cross Mount Barney National Park. One half of the group started at the east side travelling west, and the other (my group) vide versa. Because this was our last compulsory camp we as a group were given a map and the power to choose how we go across. Late the first day, we had a choice, go up the ridge line or follow the creek. The rain clouds were coming in heavy and we knew we were about to get drenched, so taking the high ground seemed reasonable. Whilst trying to get my raincoat on, I slipped over (the weight of a heavy backpack didn’t help) the rocks and slit about 3 meters,(10FT) until my lower body was completely suspended over the rock face. I had a fairly good grip on a rock and the instructors really quickly helped me up, but if I had fallen I would have died, or at least broken my back.

"AsianMasculinity","t5_30c2m","Im Asian Canadian, in med school, gonna be a doctor soon.

I can echo the original poster's feelings. I mean it's natural that when people become older and successful, they start to wonder whether women are dating them for their wealth/status or ""the real them on the inside."" I've come to accept that people want things from me, not for the me on the inside if that even exists. It's an utilitarian and pragmatic world we live in.

Cracked sums it up well: http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/

RE: Asian women who had their fun with white cocks and now wanna settle for an Asian man. Again I echo the original poster and I am in full support of his decision to be suspicious of Asian women in general. Yes it's stereotyping but we all live with it everyday. Coming from the other side tho - in college I had zero interest in Asian women and hooked up with white girls mostly. I feel ashamed to say that at the time I felt it was the ""Canadian"" thing to do to date interracially. In one instance, I was at a white frat party and an asian girl came up to me, saying that her parents would be proud to see her date an asian guy and sat next to me. Then this blonde that I chatted with in the subway earlier sat next to the asian girl. I tapped her on the shoulder and just started flirting with the blonde with the asian girl between us. I didnt even notice when she left. (I didnt get the blonde in the end)

Now say the reverse happened: asian guy hits up asian girl, who ignores him and flirts with the blond dude sitting next to him. If that happened to me I doubt my confidence can handle that. I'd be mad angry. Some of us would be calling her a whore, sellout, whatever. If I met her now, I'd judge her mad hard. And I do expect asian women now to judge me based on my past too - hence they will never find out in the first place ;)

TBH I am ok with my asian bros doing non-asians but it's not okay to see asian women do non-asians. Be honest and say yes to double standards because how else can we get advantages and win at life?

I was given [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Ultimate-Student-Cookbook-Chicken/dp/1554076021) book for Christmas and I've really enjoyed it for when I'm trying to mix things up. It is full of very simple recipes and even teaches you things as basic as how to boil noodles :D

However, most of my go-to dinners are pasta or rice dishes, fresh fruits, frozen vegetables, and stews. Breakfast and lunch are easier because one can almost always turn to eggs--they're cheap *and* healthy! I have a big appetite so I make large portions and save the leftovers in Tupperware so I can have microwave lunches and dinners the next day or three.

If any of this sounds like the kind of thing you're interested in, I would be more than happy to share more specifics on recipes and whatnot. They're all simple; I'm usually drunk when I cook so I know they aren't too demanding!","1404172974"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Sadly, I wasn't privy to the specifics on that, only that I know it happened. What little I know, it has something to do with having assigned 100% of the ownership of the company (leaving no shares in reserve with the company) and investing their own money in a different proportion than the assignments (ie. one guy invested 50% of the money but only get 25% ownership). This much I know more or less, and I believe it triggered an IRS taxable event wherein the other members had to pay some tax on the money the other guy invested, or some such...

...then, they either sold their own shares to raise money for the company, or maybe devalued their own shares by having the company issue more, or something. That, I'm less clear on, but it wound up causing some (or all?) of them having to pay taxes on a big series of funding the company took in.

This is (one of the reasons) why we deal in stock _options,_ not actual shares. The other is that it allows us to incentivize them (eg. you only get them after you meet your goals, stick around long enough, etc).

We also always always always issue a shit-ton of extra shares that remain in the company account until we sell them to an investor.","1404172977"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have 2, from my bf and his friend, both in Korea 

My bf's story: So, in Korea all guys are required to serve about 2 years in the military. In the army at night, in each building, while everyone is sleeping, 1 person must stand in the hallway on each floor to keep watch for 2 hours and then switches with someone else after his 2 hours. The guy in the hallway stands at the only entrance/exit to make sure whoever leaves their room has their name, number, and time written down by the hallway person. There’s only 1 exit/entrance and that’s where the stairs are and where the hallway person has to stand. At the end of the hall there’s only 1 bathroom with no windows. 

So, one night my bf had to do this. It was summer and hot so they had all the door opens so if someone leaves their room you’d only hear their footsteps or see them.  He was tired and wasn’t paying attention that much but he heard someone walking down the hallway. So the guy comes to him and my bf writes down the guy’s name and number.  So my bf keeps standing and standing and 15 minutes go by so he starts to worry. In the army, sometimes guys will commit suicide; which was my bf’s fear. So he kept waiting. Finally it hit 30 minutes and the guy hasn’t came from the bathroom and checked with him. So my bf’s obligation is to go check bathroom - while scared shitless. So he goes into the fucking slightly dark bathroom at night and he’s pushing all the bathroom stall doors open one by one and there was nothing. With each door he opens; his heart beats harder. He checked all the stalls - no one was in that bathroom. That guy never left the bathroom and there’s no way he could’ve left since there was no window. SO scared as shit, he goes to wake up a friend to finish watching the hallway with him and tells him what happened. 

The next day, my bf goes to see some officer or something in the office and told him the situation. The officer has the list of people from last night and checked the computer. There was no one with that name in that building nor that number in the army itself. Also, the manager said he’s heard that there’s been weird things that have been happening in the building and has heard the same story before. However, soldiers are constantly changing around different buildings so my bf didn’t stay there long. This story still gives my bf shivers down his spine til this day.

Mutual friend's story: So in Korea, it’s pretty common to go a valley - a river at a mountain - for vacation/camping. So my bf's and my friend, Tae, and his 2 friends decided to go together to a valley. One of the guys said he was gonna invite some girl friends. While they were at the valley, 3 girls that are friends of one of the guys came. One girl was actually kind of shy and didn’t say much but Tae and his friend talked to her and thought she was really sweet. So evening was coming and they were going to make some food. However, Tae and his friend noticed that the quiet girl was gone for a while.  So they got worried that she got lost somewhere and asked the third guy if he knows where she  is - he didn’t know. So then Tae and his friend asked the 2 girls where was the other girl.  The 2 girls were like “what girl? who’s &lt;girl’s name&gt;?” They had no idea who or what the guys were talking about and the girls said only 2 of them came together. Tae said now that he looks back, the other 2 girls never talked to her; just the guys. Tae said everyone was freaked out the whole time after that.","1404172978"

My mom got so uneasy she left and as she walked out the door she got hit by a wave of dizziness and confusion, last thing she remembers was the cab driver asking if she was ok and looking back into the bar at this creep smiling at her and standing up as if he was coming over. Luckily this Sikh cab driver got the same vibes from this dude so when he came over the cab driver told this guy to fuck off and made sure my mom got home safely. It's scary to think what could have happened if she didn't listen to her gut or if the Cab driver wasn't brave enough to stand up to this creep even with the extremely racist sentiments at the time.","1404172979"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","If the cumulative strength gains of killing normal humans stack then I have a decent plan for this. The martial art I will be trained in is the one I already know, Freestyle Wrestling.

Go to a shitty 3rd world country, kill two or three random people and leave. Travel to a country with underground to the death fights. Use the strength of those people to win, kill your opponents. This gains me additional martial experience and skill, as well as stacking my strength up discretely. I keep at it until I can lift over 5 tons.


The smart play is to go for villains. My first target is Batroc, his striking skills are needed. At this point I am a significantly super-human master martial artist.


Now its time to go vigilante. All those seedy motherfuckers I met in the underground fights, and all their gangs. That's my new target. Lethal force on everybody. This results in renown, and probably an additional 5+ tons of strength. 



I am now a 10 tonner. I would almost certainly be on SHIELD's radar by now.
Now I have to go after people with real powers to get significant returns without having SHIELD come knocking. I need to kill Cat, I think I can do it with my current strength level and martial proficiencies. Once completed I take his martial prowess, enabling Ki usage. Now I can throw down with big boys. First on the list is Absorbing Man, I can snap his neck. With his abilities and the Adamantium-esque dagger along with Chi, I am insanely durable. I can start going for real baddies now. I hunt down Mystiques operations, and finish what Magneto started. That gives me, shapeshifting, invulnerability and a healing factor. 

At this point, SHIELD and the Avengers have to pick me up. My rampage is too big for them to leave it alone. I explain to them my position on villains, they respectfully disagree. I am held in custody, probably for a while. I cooperate, exercise, and read. I bide my time, and then escape when the chance presents itself. 

At this juncture I go villain. I kill any heroes on my way out of the prison, and immediately go for Tony Stark. I can absolutely kill him with my powerset, as my ability to receive damage is far beyond his ability to hurt me. I take his intelligence. I build a device to travel the multiverse. I go hunting Spiders first. Travel to a dimension, kill their Spider-man, gain his strength or spider sense, move on. Once I become a 200 tonner, I switch to Hulk hunting. Traveling around killing Hulks and She-hulks.

I am now, Adamantium, Kung-fu, Spider-sense ULTRAHULK. I return to 616 Earth and kill Doom, Valeria Richards and Reed Richards. I take their intelligence. I use their intellect to improve my dimensional travel. I go Thor hunting. After I kill 5 or 6 and finish Thor hunting, I go Surfer hunting. Then Thanos hunting. Then I kill the Council of Reed. I use my Thanos + Reed mind to go Odin hunting, and Galactus hunting.

I could probably easily trick most people who haven't been trained in anatomy into thinking a pig heart is the heart of an adult human. Does that mean that adult humans only have the same rights as a pig?

Most laypeople out there don't know much about fetal development. I've seen pro-choice people flat out deny things that are scientifically true about fetal development or make claims without any evidence (like claiming that a six week old embryo is just a ball of cells, which is very easily shown to be false if you look into it at all). 

Humans *are* animals, so it is actually not surprising they have many superficial similarities both as embryo and also as adults. ","1404172982"

ASOS. ""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?"" Beric Donarrion.

I asked them how much research they've done on cannabis and both replied with none. I was just beyond words at that point.. How can people feel so strongly about something that they know literally nothing about. Also, neither of them have tried it so they're not speaking from experience.

I used to be very against marijuana all throughout middle and high school, then I started looking it up online, reading through studies, finding out how much bull shit was really out there and now I got mad at myself for being so stupidly ignorant.

"WireWrapping","t5_2z89v","Good question! 

And part of it depends on your location and what type of area you live in. In the town I'm in, for a 4 hour $50 class, people would probably expect more than they would in say a larger city (my ""city"" has only 2000ish people). Are you supplying tools, or do the students have to bring their own. I would assume that you will be supplying the wires and stones at least, as they (in theory) wouldn't know the first thing about that. That's why they will be coming to you. $50 isn't really a lot, depending on a person's mentality, they might not be expecting too terribly much at all. But you never really know.

Assume they know nothing and are incapable of learning it (that comes from my bf who was a part-time lecturer in college). Some will, and some won't. Try to gear the class to the lowest common denominator. Bring multiple ideas for patterns ranging in complication, you should be able to gauge what most of the students will be able to do in the first 30 minutes or so. Start by explaining the tools, wires and stones. Talk about some of the various methods that could go into a single piece (pictures are a beautiful thing!). Keep an eye on them to see if they are really understanding what you are talking about.

Prepare for the student that says they know what they are doing. They could be of the personality to question everything you do and compare it to ""how I learned it from so-and-so"". There are two types of this person, the one that actually does know what they are doing, in which case you can learn from them as much as you are teaching the others. And then there's the Know-it-all that doesn't know crap and will just make the class more trying for everyone else.

You can hope for the type of person that either does know a little bit, or picks it up fast, and will be more help than hindrance to others. The quiet one that just helps others in a meaningful way.

Don't get metaphysical unless they ask. While that will draw some in, it will put more of them off. 

Bring handouts! With pictures if you can! And lots and lots of step-by-step instructions. Something they can look at later, and say ""oh, yeah, I remember that!"". 

Pre-cut everything you can. But bring spools of supplies to replace the stuff the students will wreck. And make sure you have enough tools for everyone to use at the same time. You don't want to end up having a line for tools, it makes them impatient and they can get cranky. ;) Unless they are supposed to bring their own tools, that is. Then have enough tools for everyone anyway! You might think that they know what they are doing, but they may not.

If it's an option; bring enough for multiple projects for each student. Some of them may want to buy more stuff right there on site. 

Make sure you've written up a list of things you need to discuss, and the order in which to do so. But try to keep your lecture to one hour or less. It will take longer than you plan. And you want to leave plenty of time for them to be crafty on their own at the end. Don't forget to give them a break half way through! ;) 

When you think you know how to approach the lesson, try it out on a friend. Or a few if you can get them all to sit still long enough! :)

How many students will there be? If you can, try to keep it to ten or less, maybe only 5-7. Any more than that will make it hard to do real one-on-one with them. And will overwhelm a first-time instructor! :)

And above all else: Breathe. It'll be over before you know it! ;)","1404172993"

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","Yes, you can use many parts that you already own, depending on how old your computer is!

The most commonly re-used parts are the case, optical(DVD) drive, hard drives and power supply.

If you already have a case you can definitely use it, as long as it is a standard ATX or mATX computer case. How would you check that? Well, basically, if your computer is a 'slim' or otherwise compact style computer, then you won't be able to re-use the case as it probably uses custom parts and things. On the other hand, if it's a basic, bulky-ish tower, you'll almost certainly be able to use it. 

You can still buy the case I've selected if you like. It is probably more compact than your current case, and looks nicer too. It has had very good reviews from several review websites. Possibly the best mATX case there is.

How do you choose a case to buy? Well that's a hard question because a case isn't like a video card or CPU where you can just choose the fastest one your budget allows. Instead you have to look at several factors.

1. Will my parts fit inside the case? This is most important if you have several hard drives, a larger motherboard or a huge video card. Fortunately most of your parts are rather compact, so you should be able to choose any mATX or ATX case. Don't get a Micro ITX case though, as your motherboard won't fit in it.

2. Peripherals. Most of the time you won't be wanting to reach behind your computer to plug stuff in. Therefore, you really need to have all the plugs you need on the front panel of the case. When buying a case, make sure it has the basics, like USB3.0 and Audio in/out. If you need firewire, make sure your case has a port for it.

3. Build quality. Many cases nowadays go for the 'clone trooper' look, which means sticking pieces of white plastic onto a metal chassis until it looks vaguely star wars esque. If you dig that kind of stuff, fine. Unfortunately, cheap white plastic tends to fade into a yellow-ish tinge and often crack or fall off when moving the computer. I personally prefer a aluminium based, simple case that functions well rather than looking crazy.

4. Most important, looks. Might seem weird, because when it comes to most things, people tell you don't for the looks right? Well for computer cases, looks are probably the most important factor for choosing. The most popular computer cases, such as those by NZXT, the Fractal Design R4 and the Corsair 350D look nice and have good build quality. They are the ones I usually recommend for a full size build. The Bitfenix Prodigy is the one I recommend for mATX builds.

Therefore, since cases are most subjective, you can basically get whatever one you want. Just make sure it has the features you want, and your parts will fit inside.

If you do have a DVD drive already, I'd recommend re-using it. I did not add a DVD drive to my build because not many people use them these days. Still, since you already own it, just plug it in and install it.

If you have a hard drive in your old computer, you can simply install it inside this new one so that you can access your old files without having to transfer them to the new drive.

"everymanshouldknow","t5_2u82c","See here's where I think you're wrong. TRP deals almost exclusively with the plight of the heterosexual western culture male. In the past I've seen some posts from gay men and bisexual men but those are very few and very far between. The core concept of the TRP is that women have an unfair advantage over men in the sense that affirmative action and feminism has ruined western women. That does not sound even remotely close to a LGBT issue at all. 

I will agree that like all lifestyle philosophy you can take it how you want and get out of it what you put into it but the overall message is 99% geared towards straight men. This isn't to say that *all* men can't benefit from being proactive about being a better male specimen but that the meat and potatoes of it is for one group.","1404172998"
"cigars","t5_2r090","So I had the pleasure of verifying /u/SpacemanPete and after receiving a message from him today that he tried the LP T52 that I sent to him I figured I'd try one of the sticks he sent me.  

I'm far from a Tat whore, more of a Joya de Nicaragua whore to be honest, but I figured I'd fire up the Tatuaje 10th Annisersary - Bon  Chasseur he sent.  

I've been getting more into Tats lately, I really enjoyed the 7th Natural and the 2013 Black, so I was rather curious about this one.  
I was greeted by a nice pepper blast and some supper sweet flavors on the retrohale which really surprised me.  A nice tight ash that held on for a bit longer than the picture shows.  

I'm about halfway through at this writing and the flavors/pepper have calmed down a bit and I'm getting all sorts of nutty sweetness.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I met my SO online, and we've been long distance for a while now (although we are actively working to close the distance). I never had to go on stupid little dates or meet him for coffee and pretend to be happy all the time. From the beginning, we were honest with each other and I was particularly forthcoming with details about my intense thought patterns. He didn't mind.

That's not to say that in my first message I say ""hey I'm depressed let's be friends."" But when we really got to talking, I was able to reach out to him. I would approach in in a way that was more like, ""I've been having some dark thoughts. Can we talk about it?"" It helped me understand my depression because I had to formulate the feelings into concrete words, forcing me to really think about what was happening in my mind.

Since I never had to put on the mask, we were able to build our relationship on openness and honesty--including honesty about my emotional problems. I still talk to him about all the bad feels, and he's told me it only makes him want to be closer because he wants to support me in all the rough times.

In the end, I'm lucky. He's good to me. But the key was that by talking online for so long, we could be more open with each other. As you might have noticed, hiding behind a keyboard can sometimes lead to astonishing honesty in people. For us, it worked.","1404173000"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","The 10% rule has leeway if the mods are ok with it, so if a content creator is posting only their own domains and content but has cleared it with the mods before, then the admins are ok with it. Of course, this doesn't mean posting only your own content to multiple subreddits is ok, unless it's once again cleared by the mods of every one of those subreddits. This is why comic creators can post mostly nothing but their own comics and not be banned, because the mods are ok with it so the admins allow it. 

Outside of that, there aren't really any rules other than:

Don't ask for upvotes on your content, whether elsewhere on reddit or off-site. If you link your reddit post in a tweet asking for upvotes, that's a ban. 

Don't manipulate votes with alt accounts or a group of accounts. You can surely send a link of your submission to a friend just to show them, and they could upvote on it if they wanted to, but when you have ten ""friends"" that upvote your submission when it's only a minute old, then that's a ban. 

This is all in the rules at the bottom of every page, and there's a link to PM the admins if a content creator needs further information. 

And, if any account looks suspicious, always report it to the admins. I've gotten a few frontpage spammers banned this way, people who never commented and only submitted links to Vice or Mother Jones.","1404173001"

&gt; ""My thing is if they want to come, they can come,"" Rose said. 

&gt; ""I love Melo's game,"" Rose said. ""He's a great player. Takes the game serious. He's consistent. He shoots the ball great. I love his heart.

&gt; ""I can play with anybody, no matter who it is. I believe I can play with anyone if they step on the court with me.""

He trusts the FO to make decisions and that's all there is to how Derrick feels about it.

Food for thought:
Remember when Dwight screwed over Stan Van Gundy in Orlando? Gilbert Arenas stopped getting paid until last season for his unfortunate play.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","&gt; Suarez is the only one being actively punished by FIFA , everyone else is being punished BY him and his actions.

That's such a weak way to respond though.  Sure, Suarez is getting punished but so is a completely innocent team while the team involved in the guilt escapes relatively easily.

You keep saying that it's an extraordinary offense so it requires an extraordinary punishment and I have agreed.  I make no excuses for his actions and I've even said I'd be okay with a longer ban so long as it applied to the right place.

Bans are done relative to the 'league' they occur in.  CL bans don't affect league bans, league bans don't affect internationals, etc.  In this instance, it was on international duty that this occurred yet the majority of missed games will happen not for Uruguay, but for Liverpool.

It doesn't make sense and I don't think you've been able to answer it because it simply is an insane ruling.  Do you have any real argument as to why the ban shouldn't only apply to international games?  If it was only to international games surely you wouldn't be arguing it should apply to Liverpool right?  I don't think anyone would make that argument.","1404173003"

One issue should have been clear to me from your pseudo-code. For each input scan line, how many times is your algorithm moving the input file cursor back to the beginning of the scan line? `n-1`? `n`? `n+1`?

Is that the right number?

Your other issues concern header adjustments. If `peek` said your header fields were correct, you may not have picked the right files to test. There are a couple of problems, both having to do with padding.

Resize `small.bmp` by a factor of 3, then use the staff solution to do the same. Compare the results using `peek`, in particular `biSizeImage` and `bfSize`? What might explain why yours are smaller than the staff's?

$2000-$2,500 to buy and $60-$100 per month to lease.

Depends on foot traffic and how often you want to go back to the ATM. Every ATM is going to have a different pattern and will most likely need $2k-$3k extra on holidays.

Maintenance would probably be the biggest one, but I doubt they break very often. Processing fees depend on the processor you network with.","1404173004"

I'm not saying that employees are underpaid nor that they should be underpaid nor that employers should underpay their employees. Pay increases aren't suggestive of anything anyway. First of all, salaries are generally assigned on the basis of the cost of living in the place where the operation is being held. Second of all, pay raises are fake employee pleasing mechanisms if one pays close attention. Let me give you a perfect example that is generally true for the entire US workforce...

My aunt worked at the New York City branch of the Swiss based bank UBS(United Bank of Switzerland). When she began working at the bank in 1990, she was assigned a $40,000 salary with a 2.5% annual pay increase which is completely consistent with the national average. 24 years later in 2014, her salary has gone up to ~$72,000(80% increase from her original salary). The truth, however, is that she received no pay raise whatsoever. It turns out that $40,000 in 1990 is almost exactly the same as $72,000 in 2014. Cost of living has adjusted to inflation as well and there you go. She is still in the same spot she was in 24 years ago. This is and has been the case for the absolute majority of the US workforce and the world's work force really. It really has nothing to do with ""they like me &amp; want to keep me"" and neither does it have anything to do with them being nice(generally speaking).

&gt; The only reason we're even having this discussion in the first place is because for some odd reason, we've decided health insurance is an employer concern.

Well, actually, you replied to a comment that asked ""Why would employers pay their employees more?"" to which you responded ""To retain good talent"". Then I came in and questioned/argued whether or not that was true. I really don't have much of anything to say about the health insurance conversation.","1404173006"

**[Resolute Archangel:](http://i.imgur.com/ua2c0CV.png)** At 7 mana she's darn expensive, especially for white.  A 4/4 flier is nothing to sneeze at, but you're not getting enough body for the cost.  By the time she's cast you are almost certainly gonna get a bump in life, but how much?  **C**

**[Mercurial Pretender:](http://i.imgur.com/pXU8i3I.png)**  At 5 mana he (it?) is one of the cheaper ones, but he's the least powerful of the bunch by far.  He cannot be cast unless you have another creature on the board, and he's only really worth casting if you have a sweet creature (read: cmc 5+) out there to copy.  Yes, you can save him from removal and cycle him back in when you have a better copy target, but that's all very expensive and slow to do.  **D-**

**[Indulgent Tormentor:](http://i.imgur.com/XQxAi9w.png)** NOW we're talking.  This bad boy only cost 5 and he hits hard in the air.  In addition to that, every upkeep your opponent gets to decide which of 3 nice bonuses you get.  Most of the time I'm sure it will be 3 life, sometimes a small creature, and rarely a free card. Much better than Mogis and my top pick of the lot.  **A-**

**[Siege Dragon:](http://i.imgur.com/2CP2vVV.png)**  Oh man, do I like a good dragon in limited!  They're almost always a guaranteed win if you can get them out and this guy is no exception.  Not quite as good as Stormbreath Dragon or Forgestoker Dragon, but better than Spawn of Thraxes.  The destroy all walls enter ability is fine, but probably won't be too relevant in most games.  The real power of this card is the one sided earthquake when he attacks.  Brutal.  **B+**

**[Phytotitan:](http://i.imgur.com/LL8FaGS.png)**  At 6 mana in green, this might be the fastest one to hit the battlefield.  While 7 damage is scary, his little tiny butt is vulnerable to almost any chump blocker.  Yes, he will come back again and again to take out chumps, but without trample this guy will never be the threat you want him to be.  And when he dies, you basically have to wait 2 turns to use him again.  No thanks. **C-**","1404173006"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Except that it's overflowing with Africans. Aside from that one reason...

I think we should stop all aid to Africa, and let nature takes its course. All of it. Every last penny. Stop it all. No more money. No more food. No more water. No more condoms.

All the aid we've been giving them has developed a group of people on planet Earth that are emotionally dead, the aid has stifled the imagination of generations in Africa, and has created a group of people that are 100% dependent upon the charity of others, and unable to stand on their own two feet.

They clearly do not want a civilization to be proud of, nor seem to be able or willing to put in the work in order to maintain such a civilization.

Ebola is currently expanding in parts of Africa. I very much doubt that an outbreak of Ebola would get very far in parts of Europe, Japan, North America, Australia or New Zealand. It would be stopped in a hospital, and never get outside.

Not all cultures are equal on planet Earth. From one end of Africa to the other, there's plenty of opportunities for growth and economic development: Lumber, Agriculture, Wildlife, Beaches, the list goes on and on and on and on. They can't get their acts together to fix their problems, and I say we should just leave them alone to fix their own problems.

Once before I was born my mum and dad were fishing at a river.  A family was fishing a ways down the bank from them - a man, his wife, and their two young daughters.  Suddenly my parents hear the wife and kids screaming.  The father had stepped out into the water or something and got swept away by a big wave.  My dad, being a certified lifeguard, immediately ran over and jumped in after him, but couldn't find him.  The little girls were screaming ""please save my daddy!"" but there wasn't anything my dad could do without drowning himself.

He never came up.  My parents had to wait there as they combed the river for his body, since they were witnesses to the whole thing.  The wife and kids were destroyed, standing there sobbing having just witnessed their husband/father disappear and drown to death.  I have no idea if they ever found the body.

The first time my parents told me this story they brought it up completely casually during a family party.  They described it extremely vividly and I was absolutely horrified.  Still gives me chills to this day when I think about it.","1404173010"

I know the OP says they both shouldn't do it later on in the post but that's not the way society really works. Especially in eastern cultures.  Why is a balancing of the scales not welcomed?  I understand that it could be considered abuse, but it's no less abuse when a woman does it to a man.  Men are just raised to expect it I guess, they are hardened to it maybe.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","""You will see Germans, even under fire, running with the rifle in the right hand and held down at arm's length at the balance point. It allows for free movement and speed. Do not be misled by the Reibert's drawing of the ""Hinlegen„ as that drawing shows the rifle in position after the left hand has taken the fore stock to free up the right hand for breaking the fall (check out http://www.dererstezug.com/hinlegen.htm as this describes the motion correctly and with period drawings). A lot of people mistake those drawings to think that the rifle is held in the left hand, but this is not so (it would require swinging the rifle around the body in an awkward way, and makes no sense). Also, study pictures of German soldiers in basic training, and you will see the young fellows (prior farmers and city boys who've never held a firearm) doing exactly what is taught, and you'll see the rifle held on all accounts as per the textbook: in the right hand!""

--http://www.dererstezug.com/

Sums it up nicely, but yes that movement is SO German infantry it cannot be mistaken and was so rare to see a German not doing it during combat. Also, they based everything around the action of the machine gun, not the rifleman. Their bolt-action rifles were meant for precision shooting only, early in the war discipline was rather high and rifleman were not to fire until given the order, for instance, when the MG was in position. Red Orchestra also simulates firing distances better than most games (Arma might take the cake on engagement distances, but RO is still amazing). ","1404173014"

I did respond to your arguments. I can attack you at the same time if I so choose. I so chose.

There is enough demand for the job. Its just that illegal aliens can work for a quarter of the cost that real Americans cost. And yes, they make the products cheaper. They also increase unemployment. And you're basically saying that you're for sweatshops, as long as its located in the US.

How are they trying to follow the law when being here is breaking the law to begin with. There is a reason that they're called illegal aliens. Its because they came here illegally. I blame both the owners and the aliens who can work for way cheaper than the average worker.

They do not out way the cost in any way. They increase unemployment, and they use a ton of resources. Many places and services are not allowed to ask for proof of citizenship. So they get free medical care, schooling, etc, that they do not pay into.

We have one of the easiest systems for coming here legal. Don't pull the, if only it were legal bs. They chose to come here illegal. They should be forced back until they come here the legal way. It is not our responsibility to take care of all of them. ","1404173018"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Except the issue still stands they have data on how it personally affected games when it comes to how many players are currently using/opting to use a voice chat like system. 

Then there is also this ""There have also been a few concerning studies about gender cues and voice chat in other popular, competitive online games. For example, a published paper from Ohio University showed that just giving a cue or sign that you're a woman on voice chat leads to 300% more negative comments compared to a male voice, or no voice at all.""

Really it comes down to Riot opted to survey how much players wanted this, they then did their homework on data concerning voice chat that is publicly available, and then looked at various models of voice chat already being used in game by players 

""It's super easy for us to identify the use of voice chat through a few different approaches. One, for some apps we can detect whether they interacted with the LOL client in some way. Two, we can confirm this with a end-of-game survey asking players if they used voice chat in the current match (and studies have shown that players are pretty honest with these types of surveys, especially if it's a neutral activity and not something viewed as socially undesirable). Three, we can analyze chat logs to determine the exchanging of voice chat information. Using combinations of these heuristics and others, we can figure out who in the set of 10 players is using voice chat. ""

The 126% is the thing everyone is quoting, but really Lyte said far more valuable things to critique/quote. This wasn't just a single look at FPS games, or just simply looking at other studies and bringing that up, they did look at how players perceived and felt during matches in which they met conditions Riot was aiming for (full voice chat party, 2 player voice chat party, text and voice chat party, ect.

Intellectual property, *whether you agree or not*, is still property.  Creating stuff is work, and the people involved deserve recompense.  Unless you would prefer the arts to disappear.

And yeah, it's also true that an instance of piracy may lead to increased exposure and sales.  And the creator may even feel that this outweighs the loss of one sale due to piracy.  However that doesn't somehow erase the definition of the term.  Piracy would not be rampant if it wasn't so easy.  It's not an act of necessity - it's an act of greed and laziness.

c) My price is actually lower than Gainesville coins. Currently, their rolls of quarters are $177.35+$11.25 shipping, for a total of $188.60, or over $1.50 per face value more than my shipping-inclusive asking price here.

Either way. I think Frozen is a better movie if i judge it as an animated film, the Wind Rises is obviously miles ahead in plot and it like every Ghibli movie the animation and the music is superb without taking much attention from the movie itself.

Why would that matter or indicate whether or not she's noticed him? Of course she's noticed him: he isn't attractive. She knows he's there, she's acknowledged he's there just by her very statement. Is she a nice person? Probably not. Is she unkind for saying such a thing? Certainly. 

What's frustrating about this little argument we're having is that you're missing the point. Whether he was ignored or not isn't the point, whether he was hurt or not isn't the point. A woman was mean to him at a bar, intentionally or unintentionally - how very devastating for him.

What you aren't realizing is that there are entire groups of people who are absolutely invisible. They aren't given a second thought because they don't even *register*. 

As a general rule, women see men, whether or not they want to fuck them. Women cannot afford to not see men.

Conversely, a woman is nearly invisible if she is not attractive. Men do not see her, their eyes gloss over her. She is a shadow. And this is where it gets particularly cruel for women. A woman who is not attractive does not exist, but a woman who is is a target. Why was she dressed like that unless she wanted attention? 

What a fine line they must walk to simply exist.","1404173025"

**Critical reception:**

&gt; After its premiere at Sundance, The Lifeguard received generally unfavorable reviews. Peter Debruge of Variety stated\: ""Drowning in self-pity is about as fun to watch as it sounds, which will mean difficulty getting people interested for any but prurient reasons."" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter\: ""Not even a checklist of indie film attributes can inject a sense of originality into this familiar narrative."" Jordan Hoffman of Film.com gave the film a 2\.7\/10 and stated\: ""The Lifeguard is a painfully dull (alleged) drama utterly lacking in originality or self-awareness.""

The Ukrainian people decided on their own that this was worth the risk of angering the cranky old bear, but the old bear decided that this offense to it's pride wouldn't stand, and so armed invasion, land-stealing and what for all intents appears to be state-sponsored insurrection has ensued on top of avoidable loss of Ukranian lives and livelihood.

So, for instance, Jessico Lynch has been through Skyrim and the Fallouts, as well as other universes. I never really set out to do this, but I find myself playing these characters similarly in every game. They always look as close as I can get to the original: Caynia always has pale skin and with silver hair pulled back, even if she isn't a human.

She does say that doggystyle hurts her if I go too deep and I'd attribute that to hitting the cervix. This kind of (for me, anyways) reinforces that I have the ""perfectly sized"" dick for her which is nice.

Unless she's lying for both sides for no reason, I'd put that as a -1 for size queens in the tally.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Advocating drug vaccines is short sighted. It doesn't address the underlying issues of addiction. In my experience, if you take an addict's drugs away and don't actually provide treatment for the underlying issues they'll just find something else to get high with. Even if somehow you took away the ability to use any drugs, the addict will use sex, masturbation, food, gambling, or any number of other behaviorally addictive activities to feel okay with themselves. Barring this, many untreated, but not using, addicts end up killing themselves because they can't deal with life without their medicine. Hell, the same thing happens when tolerance gets so high that the drugs don't work anymore. Addiction is a far more systemic and complicated disorder than many seem to realize.

That said: I suppose it could be used as an adjunct treatment like natrexone is. I would expect that, unless heroin is the only opiate that this vaccine works on, it would present the same risks as the extended release natrexone injections. Emergency pain management in the case of severe injuries would be greatly hindered if not made impossible, and frankly, I don't care if you're an addict, if you just got your leg lopped off I'm not going to let you suffer without the relief of opiates.","1404173037"

Halfway through the alley I saw some weirdness in a shadow, but I couldn't tell what it was. As I passed it I was kind of keeping an eye on it because I was trying to figure out if the weirdness was because of something lurking in there (and if so, if I should be scared) and suddenly out of the shadow this angry voice said ""Shit, you ain't never seen a black person before?"" Which scared the ever-loving crap out of me.

At no point had my thought been, 'Gee I'd better keep an eye on that black guy.' I didn't know what I was looking at, just that something wasn't quite right and I would feel better if I knew what it was. Also, what the fuck was this guy doing just standing in the shadows like that? So, excuse me for being afraid of creepy-ass people who lurk in shadows. I didn't realize that was racist.","1404173039"

I don't disagree with anything said by others, but if you are serious about living abroad, you can make it happen. Try looking into internships for next summer NOW! And perhaps one of them will let you have a job for a year or two. If at that time you still feel like becoming a doctor (please keep in mind in a recent survey an overwhelming majority of doctors said they would not recommend the job to others) you can do so easily and with a new set of skills. If you realize you really like it or even want to become a doctor while studying in Germany, well that option is open too!

I guess what I'm saying is it's not the end. You are just getting more time to prepare :)

Also, there is nothing in any of the laws about consent. The only thing specified is obstruction of the right to ""live,"" which is not defined.

&gt;___Lysistrata___ (/laɪˈsɪstrətə/ or /ˌlɪsəˈstrɑːtə/; [Attic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek): Λυσιστράτη, ""Army-disbander"") is a [comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_comedy) by [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes). Originally performed in [classical Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Athens) in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War). Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to [withhold sexual privileges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_strike) from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace — a strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. The dramatic structure represents a shift away from the conventions of [Old Comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Comedy), a trend typical of the author's career.  It was produced in the same year as *[Thesmophoriazusae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesmophoriazusae)*, another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the [Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition).

Students already know who has more money than them by looking at their clothes and their cell phones, their jewelry, the vehicle they are driven to school in (or drive themselves), or smaller things like whether they bring their own lunch to school, whether they pay cash for lunch or get it free, etc., etc. 

Additionally, most public schools serve students within a very narrow range of incomes. Granted, some poor students go to school with rich students, and vise versa, but school districts being based on neighborhood, and neighborhoods being based on socio-economic status, the extreme social division doesn't seem to me to be a very wide problem; and if it is a problem, it's a problem with or without the BYOD rule, as I've already shown, and as I think you already know.","1404173045"

8-Year-Old Accidentally Exercises Second Amendment Rights

NORFOLK, VA—Gun owners nationwide are applauding the patriotic, though accidental, exercise of Second Amendment rights by 8-year-old Timothy Cummings Tuesday.

""Timothy is a symbol of American heroism,"" said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre from Cummings' bedside at Norfolk General Hospital, where the boy is in serious but stable condition from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""While praying for his recovery, we should all thank God that his inalienable right to keep and bear arms has not been infringed.""

I don't understand this, how is it immature? I think the reason some people share your pov is just because they don't understand the thought process of many people who have tattoos. 

People get tattoos for themselves, not to be perceived a certain way by others, to be ""badass"" or to show off

When you set out on a goal(like getting a tattoo) its because you can visualize yourself having already completed that goal in your minds eye. You feel like that person in your head is you, you use that as inspiration for your physical body to try and make your insides and outsides match. Your entire life your physical self will chase after your imagination in the form of completing goals. Can you blame someone for attempting to be themselves? What if they need that to feel true to themselves in order to be happy?

"EatCheapAndHealthy","t5_2vvpi","This is not the cheapest way so it probably won't fit well with your budget, but to help wean you off fast food you can start off with some ready-made, or nearly ready-made foods from the store.  They may not be as healthy as homemade foods, and some of them may even be unhealthy, but it should help you break the habit of going to a fast food restaurant for meals when you have something easy you can grab at home.  Then work in small steps to up your cooking game which will bring you towards both cheaper and healthier options.

Costco in my area has semi-healthy (high in sodium, it's processed food) frozen vegetarian lasagna for about $2/serving.  I usually keep some frozen meals on hand even if they're not super healthy because it helps be avoid getting back into the habit of eating out.  Canned soup is another option, split pea being my preferred as it's hearty and reasonably healthy.

Trader Joes has good hummuses which with a bag of baby carrots and other veggies, maybe some whole wheat toast too, can make for a decent and flexible meal or snack.  The great thing about carrots and hummus is you just have to grab it from the fridge and put it on a plate (even that is technically optional, you can eat hummus with carrots straight from the tub).

Pasta is not terribly healthy as a full meal, but a pound of pasta, a 15 oz can of drained and risned garbanzo beans, and a jar of spaghetti sauce (TJ's is a good source of cheap and good sauces) becomes a lot more balanced and is pretty cheap.  You can get 4 pretty large meals out of that, depending on how much you eat.

Burritos or burrito bowls made with canned refried beans, quinoa or rice, cheese (grate a few days worth at a time into a tupperware from a block to save money), and jarred salsa are reasonably easy, cheap, tasty, and nutritious.  Quinoa is pretty cheap at Costco, tasty, and cooks in 15-20 min.  Trader joes has brown jasmine rice which is my preferred rice, but it takes about 40 min to cook.

For fruit and veg I generally eat a banana with cereal at breakfast, some kind of raw vegetable (usually baby cut carrots) with hummus at lunch, and microwaved frozen vegetables at dinner.  For frozen mixed vegetables I microwave them then add a bit of butter (fat should be part of your diet, and just a bit of butter can really amp up the flavor), something acidic: about a quarter of a lemon or lime if I have it or else rice vinegar which I always have on hand, salt, and maybe a bit of hot sauce if I feel like it.

Anyway those are some suggestions (some of which you may have already received).  Keep in mind that some of this is high in sodium and not the healthiest option, but I think these are pretty easy to start with and provide a base for better food that you can cook once you get in the groove of making your own food instead of eating out.  

Edit: and for beverages, maybe you can redirect your addition to tea which is healthier, but still provides at least some caffeine which may help you wean yourself off of soda.  Cotsco has decent green tea for about 12c/bag.  You can brew it hot, or cold brew it by throwing it into a pitcher or wide mouth water bottle in the fridge and it will take about an hour.","1404173050"

That brings me to my next choice: Original Duals. At least in a Legacy Masters set or something. Their price is stupid and completely unreasonable. No one should have to pay $400 for a single blue/black land.

Back to main point: Yes, I understand not every deck needs Goyf. But the vast majority of eternal decks with Green run it.","1404173051"

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","The /trigger command was introduced to overcome the OP and character length issues, though it requires a lot more maintenance. The objective itself would need the 'trigger' objective-type, which will automatically be disabled for all players.

    /scoreboard objectives add OBJECTIVE trigger

In order for the player to manually change their score (such as clicking in a book), you'd use the 'enable' function. Once they click, the objective for that player becomes disabled. It would probably work best in this scenario if the command was run at all times:

    /scoreboard players enable @a OBJECTIVE

The /trigger command to run upon clicking:

    /trigger &lt;objective&gt; &lt;set|add&gt; &lt;value&gt;
    /trigger OBJECTIVE set 1

And you would have a separate clock to detect that change in score, performing the following commands:

    /tp @a[score_OBJECTIVE_min=1] X Y Z

But he doesn't go after the film critics who've praised it, nor does he go after Netflix, which carries it; he goes after me for writing a news item about it. 

Mel Gibson once made a film that featured the graphic torture of a guy named Jesus. Most action films involve numerous characters being killed, sometimes graphically. Cronenberg's Scanners showed a guy's head exploding. I don't want to see any of those films censored either.

Eh, it's alright. It's the first season, so a lot of teams were allowed to join in on the 2nd week, which kind of screws up ranking but not by much.

A lot of people are forfeiting/dropping their team, which is something out of UGC's control, but it's telling in the lack of motivation the players feel in competing.

The two match format is a little weird though. When you go 1-1 you feel like you lost, even if it's a draw. Likewise, I'm sure going 0-2 would feel like a loss as well, so really you lose 2/3 times (on average) not half the time. Not sure why we don't have a Bo3.

In my 1000 point list the xv8 gets bumped to commander status, I picked up stealth suits with the fb, and added a 3rd broadside. As of now my adjusted 750 point list is as follows:

Ethereal

2x : 10 fw with rifles, in a fish with dpods

1 xv8 with tl plas and fb

1 hammerhead with rail, sub and dpods

2x: 1 broadside with SMS and hymp

I was a competitive olympic weightlifter for a bit over 3 years, and one of the things that really struck me was the huge psychology behind doing lifts that last seconds or less. You really have to trick your mind to get it to accept hundreds of pounds being thrown over your head. The psychology definitely bleeds into physical changes in the body - for example with the weightlifting, human bodies have a lot more physical strength than the psychological ""governor"" allows. Presumably so that people don't exert so much energy in short or long bursts that it dangerously depletes energy reserves, or damages tendons and bones.

Have you ever done any research on these physical aspects and how psychological training can push back that nervous system ""governor""?","1404173059"

I've seen people get so high they have all of those symptoms you just mentioned.

&gt;I love my work, and am extremely ambitious when it comes to things I am passionate about. I don't like being mediocre with anything I'm involved in. If I'm gonna spend time on something I want to be the best at it and do it right.

* Oh shit, another guy that defines himself by his work. BORING.
* You are ambitious about ""things""
* I don't like being mediocre -&gt; I have a huge ego
* If I'm gonna spend time -&gt; Selfish 

**Conclusion:** Boring, egotistical, selfish.

&gt;In my free time I love going out and trying new things, recently a friend and I went skydiving for the first time. I have a real sense of adventure and enjoy extreme experiences from time to time. I love having an idea of whats going on in my near future but spur of the moment activities are always fun!

* Oh shit a fun story!
* Extreme activities? Guh. That's a lot of work. He's probably hyper and unsettled.
* You're **telling** me some information about yourself, but I'm not buying it. Every asshole with a profile thinks that they are ""fun"" ""interesting"" and ""funny""

**Conclusion:** Another bland guy.

The problem is that you've **SAID** you're an awesome guy, but you've **SHOWN** that you're bland.

**Better self summary:** *Apparently, there are no sharks with lasers on their heads permitted at a concert in 30 of the 50 states. As a show designer for some big name concerts, this is important information for me to have. Sharks with lasers are out. Robots with lasers are in.*

*While not in a heated negotiation about what hue of blue to go with for the night, I love meeting new people and going on zany adventures. The last bucket list adventure was to learn to scuba dive. There's something special about the serenity down under.*

---

&gt;I'm a laser designer and pyro technician for touring concerts. I've worked hard to get where I am and want to will go much farther in this industry. It's quite interesting, you need to be part electrician, part chemist, part plumber, part engineer, part performer, part programer and a lot else. Each day poses new challenges which you have to over come and put on the show.
&gt;
&gt;About a Year ago I finished a 3 year stint in Las Vegas where I worked for a few of the major shows on the strip. I fixed robotic lights and ran the lights during the show.

* You make this sound arrogant and are bragging about all the cool stuff you are good at
* You are talking about your job in the first section so should downplay it here.
* Capitalized Year? 
* More work. Work. work.

**Conclusion?:** This guy has nothing going on in his life other than work and money. Boring!

**A better what I'm doing section:** *I'm a laser designer and pyro technician for touring concerts. Best case scenario: people tweet about the rad lights. Worst case scenario: I get to see a free concert. This does mean that our dates will not be at concerts. The bar has been raised!*

*Speaking of adventure (did you bring it up, or did I?), I'm having a fling with Scuba diving. I am also teaching my golden retriever to retrieve (didn't realize these guys were ""some assembly required"").*

Malware traffic looks MUCH different from legitimate traffic, in terms of volume, traffic patterns, ports, protocols, geography, you name it. Also, it's fairly well-known that no-IP hosts huge amounts of malware, you can't have been on the internet very long if you haven't seen something bad at a no-ip address. It's nearly impossible for No-IP to not have known that their services were being used for lots and lots and lots of malware.

Comparing DNS records to free speech is nonsense. DNS is just a system which helps you get somewhere, not unlike how an address and a road help you get to a house. If a house is being used by mobsters to discreetly murder their victims, the police are totally legitimate in blocking off the road/driveway leading to that house (amongst other things). We're not talking about censoring ideas here, we're talking about stopping actively malicious traffic. You have a right to say whatever you want up until the point when you shout ""FIRE"" in a movie theater, or in the case of the internet, until you send traffic which violates the rights of other internet users.

"physicsgifs","t5_2vkmo","Not vacuums, but short lived pockets of water in it's vapor state.

A way to think of it is to apply it to your tea kettle. Heat energy is transferred to the water via the bottom of the kettle.  The heated water undergoes a state change into vapor.  This vapor bubble is compressed by the surrounding water while simultaneously losing energy to the cooler water above it.  The pressure of the surrounding water now collapses the bubble, compressing the remaining vapor.

Energy from the compression is then released in different forms, most notably as sound when boiling water in your kettle.  You will hear the pings of the cavitation grow in intensity as the water warms, then suddenly drop as the water vapor can overcome the water pressure and surface tension forces holding the bubbles to the bottom of kettle.  

Then of course you hear the screaming of the kettle as the water vapor is forced through a small opening.","1404173062"

Maybe of free market thought and academia, but certainly not of policy. 

&gt;It's wrong to see subsidies as a ""whim"" of governments. In many countries subsidies happen to either make life easier for poor people, or a way to increase the amount of disposable income people have - money they will inject back into the economy to buy goods and services.

Which is true, but the long term effects of subsidies are always perverse. In this case, the petrol subsidy very obviously seems to benefit India's already well off, not its motor vehicle-less masses. Regarding your latter point, injecting money back into the economy - the keystone of Keynesian economics - isn't quite the solution in an overstressed, inflationary economy. Supply side reforms are.

Regarding inequality... well, we can go back and forth on that forever. I do see it as a noble goal, albeit an impractical one. India's government is better off focusing on growth.","1404173062"

I run AP quints and blues, hp scaling yellows, and mpen marks. I go dorans ring--&gt;roa--&gt; tank. Sometimes I build liandry's after roa if I win lane hard. I go heavy damage early due to the strong lane dominance I have, then build tanky for late game. What's your thoughts on my build? Also if you don't mind, why do you like the hextech so much on nunu, since he has his Q?

"blackladies","t5_2vk9t","&gt; Eh I don't think complexion should be that much of an issue if she could play the role well. A Black girl is a Black girl as far as I'm concerned.

But as far as Hollywood is concerned, ""good hair"" and light-skinned is acceptable black beauty.

That is what they cast in lead ""black girl"" roles.

Would Zoe Saldana and Paula Patton be getting as many lead roles if they looked like Nia Long or Gabrielle Union?

I think everyone can agree the answer to that is ""fuck no"", because they haven't gotten the roles.

It is possible to acknowledge the very real problem of colorism in Hollywood without attacking a young actor who isn't the one with the power who is perpetuating it.

...But to pretend that complexion and hair texture aren't issues is a blatant lie.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Remember that scene from *300* where Leonidas kicks the messenger down the well, and the entire convoy was stunned. That's essentially where ""diplomatic immunity"" comes from (and yeah it is that old of a concept).

When someone is trying to work out mutually beneficial terms between nations, it's considered morally wrong to punish them because you don't like the country or it's policies. A part of it is contractual ""good faith"" but it also has to do with the unnecessary harming people who are actively trying to aid, or prevent further harm between nations.

We have laws to protect diplomats not only because of this reasoning, but also to show that we are willing to negotiate with foreign states. Yet often diplomats will abuse the privilege—this isn't a failing of law, but rather a failing of individuals protected by it who are abusing it. So though we cannot punish them, we can request they leave or be removed/replaced by their representative nation; and most nations hate when their diplomats are behaving in this manner, especially if they are currently working or needing to work with the country the diplomat is occupying.

Many foreign political theorists advocate for globally mandated diplomatic immunity that is enforced by a transnational body (like the International Court of Justice), who has the legitimate power to do arraign violators (unlike the International Court of Justice). This belief is considered foundational for continuing peace in globalization.","1404173064"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"confessions","t5_2qq6g","Have you tried talking to him about it?  A little conversation could easily go a long way in answering the questions you have about his feelings for these shows.

For example, I too enjoy watching anime shows.  Like you said at the end, a lot of the stories are cool!  There are things that can be written into those shows, or ideas that can be explored, that simply can't be done in a live action format.  Because the physical acting is handled by the animators it frees the voice actors to perfect their craft of delivering lines with the perfect emotion and stress to fit the scene, something sorely lacking in live action media that focuses on physical delivery before most anything else.

However, I do realize that sometimes in watching these shows, even the very best of them, I'm going to come across cultural differences in attitudes towards things like sex and the age of consent.  Hell, here in the US we have different attitudes on this subject between ourselves and Europe who share far more cultural similarities with us than we do with Japan.  It can be uncomfortable to watch, it can take away from the quality of the show, and maybe even sometimes it can enhance it depending on exactly what is being said by that content being in the show in the first place.  That being the case, if I like a show for every other part of it except the ""fan service"" I've simply had to learn to ignore it.  Your boyfriend probably does the same.  Its a shame, but a lot of these shows *are* made for teenagers, so just like any live action show or movie targeting teenagers, the characters are going to be in that same age range.  We do it here in the US too, hiring only attractive young girls and guys to play those parts.  It just so happens that Japan has a different standard for how they can be appropriately portrayed.

I think its okay for you to feel the way you do.  You have questions about how your boyfriend feels, about his medium of choice which is animated rather than the more traditional live-action one.  I suggest that you talk to him about it and hear what he has to say.  The more you know about how he feels the less you will have to question.  Hopefully it all works out.","1404173072"

&gt;Bitcoin will enable Facebook to provide remittance, banking and person-to-person money transfer services to its users. 

Why would Facebook a company with over a billion users implement a crypto currency it didn't control which has a user base of around 1 million(probably much less).  If they introduced their own cryptocoin tomorrow and integrated it into the site it would dwarf bitcoin in a hour.

&gt;Some 60,000 online retailers already accept Bitcoin today and more get on board every day.

And more get offline every day after seeing no bitcoin sales for months.

&gt;3. Western Union and MoneyGram’s existing remittance businesses will be decimated.

People said that when US banks started buying up banks in Mexico.  In the end they realized there is no need to drop the prices.  Bitcoin is the same transferring the bitcoin is cheap but you still have to find someone on the other side near you to give you cash and that is where the fees will appear.

&gt; Bitcoin will fuel new, innovative micropayment-based online business models. 

Micropayments have been tried time and time again.  People will pay for tv episodes and stuff in games but those are the only two things which have show any adoption by the public.  People don't want micropayments for their news stories, etc and when it comes to $1 things sold through marketplaces the overhead from the credit cards/etc isn't really that bad in the end.","1404173073"

The other possibility is that there are a LOT more people on one side of the argument to make mistakes (which people do) than there are people on the other side of the argument. Because there are so many (by most counts 95-99% of the people who know what they're talking about) people who believe in man-created climate change, and so few people finding statistics who believe the opposite, there are just fewer people to make mistakes on, what I can assume is your side of the argument.

If you're willing to give it a shot, check out the movie Perfect Blue. It's a serious creeper-thriller in anime format, and was successful enough an anime to be remade into a live-action film.

Grave of the Fireflies is another serious anime that was remade is live-action. It's an adult drama, with serious subjects, and one of the greatest tearjerkers of the 20th century. If you can sit through the entire movie and not shed a tear, you're truly a monster.","1404173078"

Part of the reason we have been waiting is because of our economic situation plus the fact I don't want to deal with little screaming people.  Hell we are considered rich by most and easily in the top 5-10% and we can afford it but I don't see us being comfortable enough.

Derrick comes back and doesn't explode. Melo signs. Boozer and Dunleavy are gone. Mirotic may or may not be here.  But Taj and Jo definitely are. 

And Dougie McBuckets becomes the ignored, undefended sharpshooting odd man out. 

Opponents defend the big names outside and Noah inside and somehow Doug is always open. He shoots for 12-14 a game with a handful of assists. The Bulls get the first seed again,  just like a couple of years ago and the extra publicity pushes McD past Jabari and Wiggins who are putting up similar numbers for worse teams.

Long term, Jabari and Wiggins end up being obviously better but for year one McBuckets makes the biggest splash and gets hisself a ROY.

Star Trek Prime has potential for paying more attention to Rand and Chapel, but for single feature film it's hard enough to give all the ""classic seven"" enough screen time as is. It'd be easier with a series.

The ad hominem fallacy is committed by saying ""You are wrong because of who you are."" Privilege-checking explicitly brings who people are into a discussion, rather than just their ideas.

Ad hominem is used as sort of a euphemism for insult these days, in the same way people say ""begs the question"" as a bizarre alternative for ""raises the question"". That people have tried to change the original meanings doesn't make the original meanings wrong.

I'd recommend not using the word ""privilege"". In general, if you phrase whatever you're trying to say without buzzwords, it will be more comprehensible and more palatable to an audience that isn't immersed in those buzzwords.","1404173083"

What many people don't really get is what happens when the sales of smaller print run paper books start to slump that step too far.  Once that happens, and it will in a year to three's time, it will no longer be commercially viable to print those books at all, except via really big suppliers like Amazon who print on demand. Those small print run titles will then spread to bigger print run titles and the slide will start to escalate.

Paper is dying. It may be five or it may be fifteen before it becomes similar to vinyl but it will happen. Paper fetishists will not be numerous enough to save them and though big people like Amazon will prolong that tail with best sellers and print on demand, it will happen.

Keep in mind also that this article and almost all articles in the mainstream media completely turn a blind eye to the indie eBook market and the self pubbed eBook market which is now huge and gobbling up more and more of the market.

I wear these hypebrands because I personally think I'll get looks from people and I like the attention I get.

I didn't really like Tyler the Creator or any of them kooks, but since they've been really hyped up I've kinda forced myself to listen to them just to see what the hype is about. 

Mind you, I'm not a loud guy or a mischievous guy. I like the skate scene and all the hooligans running around town square screaming obnoxious shit, I wanted to be them when I was younger. Im 22 now and I still dress with all the hype brands even if they don't have the labels slapped everywhere. 

Now here comes the sad truth, I wanted the attention but all I got was envy and attention from hype neck beards. Girls would look the other way cause they don't know whats the dopest brand or whats expensive, to them I'm just like any other fool that wears OBEY or The Hundreds.

"funny","t5_2qh33","When I was 11 or so I was spending the summer with my father in Texas. He rented the back-half of a house on Lake Austin, and it was 4th of July.

He had bought some fireworks for us to shoot off the dock. Lake Austin (or most of it?) is pretty narrow and long, more like a dammed up river. (Or exactly like a dammed river, I don't remember) The opposite shore was within slingshot distance, and was basically a very steep hill with no development at all, or even trees. That steep.

We had shot most of the fireworks. Every so often someone would shoot something that was fairly loud, and you could hear lots of cheering in the distance (from many directions) after those.

""Go inside and get the .44.""

I should do that. Immediately. I went inside and got the .44, came back, and tried to hand it to him.

""No, you shoot it.""

""Where should I aim? The other bank?""

""Sure, that sounds fin... wait, shoot this spider."" Sure enough, between two of the pilings the dock was built around, there was a spider web, with a spider in the center.

I took careful aim from the impressive distance of zero feet away, squeezed one eye shut, and squeezed the trigger.

**BLAAAAAAAAM AAAAAM AAAAAM Aaaaam** aaaam aaam *aam *aam* *aam*

Silence immediately after the shot. Then, during the fading echoes, the most raucous boisterous cheering yet.

""DAD! DAD! WHERE DID THE SPIDER GO?!?"", I said, under the stern guidance of my keen intellect.

""I don't know, next county?""","1404173087"

That the culture of the drug rep had nothing at all to do with decisions made by management? For example, when a manager at a pharmaceutical company [told](http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/omkara/2011/mar/27/dark-secrets-drug-industry-exposed/) a prospective hire: "" If altruism is what motivates you, then you better join the peace corp, however, if money is what motivates you, let me tell you how you can retire a millionaire from this job young lady.""

If you gave up a kill however just play really passive and ask your jungler for help. Dont panic - it wont help you at all but make you play even worse. Always think that things could be worse than you dying once.

2) Play a support you can make as much impact as possible with. Something like Morgana or Zyra just needs the adc not to sleep and even if he does you are pretty good off trading alone. ","1404173096"

&gt;One study of **1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected DFSAs** in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, **451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs tested for.** A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected DFSAs found **less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB.** A three-year study in the UK found two percent of 1,014 rape victims had sedatives detected in their urine 12 hours after the assault. A 2009 Australian study found that of **97 instances of patients admitted to hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked**, tests were **unable to identify a single case where a sedative drug was likely to have been illegally placed in a drink** in a pub or nightclub, with 9 plausible cases from within the study. In contrast, **the mean blood ethanol concentration (BAC) of patients at the time of presentation was 0.096%.**

The population of people used in these studies had already been narrowed down to those people who believed their drinks had been spiked. This means out of all the sexual assaults, only a fraction of a fraction could be attributed to drink spiking.","1404173100"

"Endo","t5_2s8ot","It sounds like you totally need a second opinion. Dr. Mangal seems like a good surgeon, just using techniques that are a bit older. Dr. Eads, who is using new tech like the Da Vinci, may offer you different options. 

Surgery is a great thing, but you want to be comfortable with the treatment plan going in. See what Dr. Eads has to say and even share with him these other procedures Mangal wants to gauge his opinion on them. Then go back to have that discussion with Dr. Mangal. 

Also, remember that you can nix procedures you don't want or don't feel comfortable with and still have your surgery for excision. 

You can have him take out the nerve cutting and uterine suspension - and you can double check that when you get to the hospital too. you'll have to initial forms with all the procedures on it, they'll ask you a million times what you are having done so you can tell them then too. You even meet everyone in the surgical room so you can make your wishes known then also.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Well as a Muslim woman, you should know how much pressure muslim women receive to get married ASAP. They have been asking her about it and bringing her potential husbands since she was 16 I think, and considering everything she's been through, she had to grow the hell up really quick. 

Secondly, this isn't a matter of her being some kind of hypocrite just because she isn't very religious. It's very black and white; if she marries out of her religion, she loses everything. Her mom, siblings, cousins, friends, hell even the entire community will shun her and to top it off, she brings shame on the family name. Immaturity would be not being considerate of any of those things and running off with a guy because she doesn't like her culture. 

Lastly, I don't know what Muslim denomination you were raised in, but being 21 and unmarried in Muslim culture can be seen as a red flag. She gets told off and given lectures by Muslims she doesn't even know about getting married on a daily basis, sometimes even 3 times a day. Every week, she gets at least 1 marriage proposal because according to them, ""you need to hurry up and get married before you get old and no one wants you anymore.""

If anything, I thought a Muslim female would understand the severity of the situation and the incredible amount of pressure she is under, but she bends over backwards to be with me. If anything, I don't think she is the one here that needs to ""grow the hell up"".","1404173103"

&gt; Also -- notice how you gave up on finding a factual claim you've disproven?

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;  Why does there have to be all this vitriol between the sexes?

I think this happens when a person's gender is the main component of their sense of self identity.

It's the kind of thinking that leads to statements like *Why do men always have to...* or *Why are women always acting like...*

People often similarly use their race, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, sect --even things like weight status, sports organizations, preferred music genres-- to similarly interpret discussion as either team-friendly or an attack on the team = attack on one's self = must be virulently defended against.

I suspect that this kit is a temporary repair kit, not a ""runway in a bag"".

Regular runway lights are white, and there needs to be hundreds at the correct spacing to give the correct visual cues for landing at night. 
Temporary runways to be used at night can be made from flare pots or retro-reflective markers. 

The red lights would most likely be those used for runway closures. When a taxiway or runway is closed for maintenance, repair, painting, etc, red lights are used to make it obvious at night. 

There's a chance that this could be used for daytime only or helicopter ops at smaller airstrips as well. Post this to /r/aviation. I'm sure someone there will have seen a kit like this before.

I don't know how much more clear to make this, you don't reject someone by inviting them back to your place and taking them to your bed because 99.9999999% of the time this means mutual interest. I accept the fact that you didn't want to have sex with him, I believe you. And I believe you weren't trying to give that body language or those social cues intentionally either.  However, actions speak louder than words and the actions you gave, given by everyone else hint at being interested in him. When I want to have sex with someone im going to invite them to my place and invite them to my bed.

I'm going to do it regardless of her shape. I dressed as Rita Skeeter and Lady amalthea and I am considering doing a burlesque costume next year. However, I will say this, there is nothing wrong with being fat but ADMIT IT, ACKNOWLEDGE IT and take it into consideration. Dance tights are your friend. If your boobs are big you'd better have support for those suckers and body tape is a god send. Keep these things in mind when you cosplay because although there is nothing wrong with cosplaying anything you want to be, if you're big you do have to work a bit harder. But its worth it and you know what? This entire situation is a good example that when you are big it doesn't matter WHO you cosplay, people are going to run their mouth, so you might as well cosplay whoever the hell you want from the get go.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","For all the people saying the way to improving blitz ratings is through playing more long games, is that from your own personal experience? The reason I ask is because it seems to contradict my own. I went from a relatively weak player to ~1800 by playing mostly blitz. When I first started I played mostly correspondence (1800s level), and lost game after game in blitz. However, over time I built more and more experience playing blitz. I had to rearrange my thought processes and become more efficient.

For anyone who argues that I would be a much stronger player if I had in fact played longer time controls, I disagree. Blitz differs from longer time controls considerably. Due to time limitations, players need to know almost instantaneously whether tactics exist. Time weighs much more heavily against material. This requires different ways of thinking and approaches to chess than is required from someone who only plays long time controls. It calls for a much more structured and efficient thought process than longer time controls.","1404173112"

That price is not by any criteria justifiable. 

&gt;Add the requirements for long distance flights (powerful batteries and good range radio) and you've no doubt got a copter worth at least 20 grand.

If you buy batteries in some web page called something like ""everything for your multicopter"" then yes, you will pay 3-4 times market price of the battery. But even then you will not get even to $5k mark total if it's DIY project.

&gt;The page also mentions anti GPS interference tools and other anti-jamming measures. I have yet to see a drone for 8000$ with this feature. How much do you think these features cost?

From what I understood - it's a simple algorithm which contrast latest data from GPS with it's memory. 

&gt;And a good camera can cost over 10 000$, so there's also that.

They need to do cinematic video-landscapes of Donetsk region or what? You just try to justify completely unjustifiable costs.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The cysts don't really harm the liver. They actually just attach to the outside and can go unnoticed for over 20 years, until they become large enough to exert pressure on surrounding tissue. The biggest concerns are the possibility that the cysts could rupture within the body, resulting in anaphylaxis, so treatment is recommended. Surgical removal used to be the best choice, but anti-parasitic drugs such as albendazole and mebendazole are often used today. Another great method is PAIR, which means puncturing the cyst, aspirating the fluid out, injecting the cysts with hypertonic saline (to lyse any remaining parasitic cells), and reaspirating the saline out.

The ""bubbles"" that you see can't cause the parasite to further infect the person. In order for a human to become infected, they must ingest unhatched eggs. The hydatid cyst cannot form more organisms.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, besides the fact that it is very very bad for you to be over-weight and it might literally save their life if they decide to lose weight because we call them fat, (i.e. buckle to our peer pressure), it does affect our lives. See, society is a system, and the system was designed to accomodate average sized people. So when someone is perversly over-weight, it inconveniences other people. A really obvious example is airplanes. If you are over-flowing into my seat due to your size, it's inconvenient for me. So ultimately, it's both disruptive and extremely unhealthy. As for why I am so harsh, it's out of neccesity. Our American culture ENCOURAGES obesity. Those of us that are healthy are fighting billions of dollars in brainwashing and ad campaigns. So we are going to use peer pressure until you buckle and get healthy.","1404173116"

I really don't know how the conversation came about, but my aunt, who is a nun, told us all about her head priests encounter with demons. One of the stories involved the head priest removing the demon from a kid and the demon kept calling the priest at night saying he would pay for his actions. After the story I get a phone call from a blocked number in front of all my family members, I decide to let the call go to voicemail. Whoever or whatever left a message left a really creepy voicemail, to this day I don't know who left it. The voice mail it self was a creepy raspy voice that said, "" hey when am I gonna see you?!"" My family members heard that and instantly were creeped out. Before she left my aunt have me a rosary to fend off demons, when she returned from her trip. My mom had heard she randomly became deaf in one ear.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Your mother jerks off pigs. 

   She gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig, her fingers tracing along it's belly until she finds it's cock. She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting. ""Oh fucking jesus god yes.."" she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep.

"StreetFights","t5_2r1v2","Yeah man, I used to freestyle when I was younger, the ultimate spot back in my day (lol) was at Project Blowed in Leimert Park in L.A., home to AceyAlone and Freestyle Fellowship, Abstract Rude and Tribe Unique as well as a host of other dope underground MCs, bands and DJs. 

I got into that scene after gangster rap swept our neighborhoods, and the best part was that people weren't fighting and they were truly focused on the music and art. When I found people like Pharcyde and AceyAlone, I knew what part of the genre I wanted to be a part of. Of course there were douchebags and fights here and there, but for the most part they were interested in art and poetry, good vocabularies and higher education, spirituality and all that good shit. It was an awesome time and an awesome place. It helped foster my love for jazz, funk and soul music and I transitioned into playing trumpet and percussion from there. Still love me some good hip hop, but for me it was mostly a springboard to the rest of the world of music.

Its really cool to see the scene has grown so much and that lyrical skill is still the determining factor in your dopeness, rather than your gear, your bankroll, etc. No matter how old I get I'll still enjoy watching a dude get lyrically ripped to shreds. ;)

Railgun S has so far been more action/mystery and there's been at least one fight so far, but I haven't gotten very far in. It still has its slice of lifey episodes where it feels like not a whole lot happens. It's far more interesting though, and I'm really enjoying it.

For Ateneo, well they have a new program. They somewhat imitated CSB, they call it Information Design which is pretty much like Multimedia Arts.

What is Hamas doing now? Are you talking about the kidnapping that there is no evidence that they took part in? Or are you talking about the rockets coming from Gaza that they are arresting people for? Or are you talking about the fact that they DIDN'T retaliate after Israel killed a 10 year old kid in Gaza just a month and a half ago?

The most popular measure of inflation over the last century or so is the Consumer Price Index. This index measures a certain set of consumer goods over time and estimates inflation based on the changing prices.

The tricky part is that spending habits change. In 1960, people weren't buying electronics or nearly as many services, the value and availability of higher education was much different, and the healthcare system was a different animal altogether. Essentially, it's hard to accurately estimate inflation the longer you go back. But CPI is about as accurate an index as you're going to find here, because it measures buying power.","1404173120"

If you see one or two squares, start over!

When you clearly see three squares, keep your head still, and the hidden image will magically appear. Once you perceive the hidden image and depth, you can look around the entire 3D image.

"NetflixBestOf","t5_2ro0h","[**Movie Poster**](http://i.imgur.com/Fer4YRQ.jpg)

Recipient of two Oscars, Best Supporting Actor, Michael Caine &amp; Best Adapted Screenplay, John Irving, this is a great film from 1999, based on the 1985 novel of the same title, that has a lovely atmosphere that really draws you in to the world on the screen. It is a quietly beautiful period film that has very nice pacing. It is an emotional tale that deals with many of the challenges and problems of the day.

Set in beautiful World War 2 era Maine, Tobey Maguire, orphan Homer Wells, plays a young man who must find himself as a man despite never having a real family. Michael Caine plays the role of Doctor Wilbur Larch, the caretaker of the orphanage and maverick doctor; he is a man with a huge heart who does anything and everything necessary to care for the children in his establishment and the women who come to him in dire need of compassion and care. Charlize Theron plays Candy Kendall, a beautiful, though lonely, young woman who helps Homer experience the world outside the walls of the orphanage for the first time.

[**IMDB:** 7.4](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124315)

[**Rotten Tomatoes:** 71%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cider_house_rules/)

[**MetaCritic:** 75%](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cider-house-rules)

**Run Time:** 126 minutes

**Director:** Lasse Hallström 

**Writer:** John Irving (Wrote the original, best selling, novel and the screenplay, which is awesome, ensuring the film finds the same voice as the original source material)

**Cast:** Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd, Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kieran Culken, Erik Per Sullivan, J.K. Simmons, Paz de la Huerta","1404173128"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Star Wars X-wing and Star Trek: Attack Wing seem like the obvious options here if you're mainly interested in the gaming side of a tabletop strategy game. They both play extremily fast for a miniature game, and the players are always involved (in Warhammer, you're sit around waiting for half of the time, which is a lot in a 3 hour game). 

I originally prefered star wars over trek: the models are better (both sculpts and paintjobs), and I really prefer the star wars setting over star trek. I settled on Star Trek however: I wanted to repaint the miniatures anyway (and a quick ink wash makes them look as good as the x-wing mini's), and most people were playing trek instead of x-wing. In addition, for star trek you only need 2-4 mini's for a normal sized game, and for x-wing you tend to need quite a bit more.  Also, the star trek mini's come with a lot of upgrades, crew members, captains and other such options, and with constructing your fleet being such a big part of the game, I felt that this allows for far more variability and replayability with the same amount of mini's bought.

Hope this helps?","1404173129"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I'm 5'0 and it took me a long, long time to find my first perfect bike. I ride about a 43cm bike now. I went into a bike shop near the end of spring or summer and they had a huge clearance - bought my '12 SE Draft for $200 less than original price.

Also I had a beautiful mid-80s Centurion Ironman that fit me *amazingly* well but it passed on into bike heaven.

Take her with you to look at the bikes - she might have long legs or a short torso so the fit can definitely vary person to person. A ladies frame (step through) can be a bit of a help, it's a lot easier to get on and off without smashing important bits or having to swing legs over.

Good luck!","1404173134"

Now, we're not talking tri-omni God here, but, the powers of the deities attacking earth to bring about the ""new Jerusalem"" are limited to the scope of the imaginations of the old &amp; new testaments.

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","&gt;Again, people often make the ""we live longer"" argument, but plenty of people in the ancient and prehistoric world lived until old age. Not to mention, they don't find much cancer in the ancient remains of children

Sure, plenty did, but that ignores the extremely high infant and youth mortality rates. A lot of people had to be shed off in order for a few to grow old, which is why the general average human lifespan appears so short for prehistoric times.

I'm very much confused by the relationship of anarcho-primitivism to technology. Perhaps you can shed some light on that. But personally, I couldn't prefer a world where only one baby out of five survives into old age. Frankly I think that's a very harsh reality to impose on people in general, and women in particular, in their efforts to reproduce the species.

&gt;We know we eat worse and get less exercise, and we know we have more pollution and chemical exposure, but then it's fingers in our ears and ""la la la"" when someone claims that industrialism and the modern lifestyle are to blame. 

Is it, or is it just our organization of society? What if we constructed cities in which the urban zones were linked in high density to the commercial zones, and the roadways developed in such a way, and the culture encouraged in such a way, that riding bicycles was the norm? I'm an avid proponent of bicycles over cars, and I can see that the incentives for their use are highly contingent upon the way cities are planned and designed. Technology can grant us the potential to rely more on human powered transportation if designed intelligently, which has the added bonus of reducing our sedentarism.","1404173141"

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","Since stating an honest opinion that isn't a glowing one about how great bioware is or that DA2 is nothing less than a masterpiece, I'll choose my words carefully. First thing first, Mass Effect is probably my favorite game series, and because I like it so much the mediocre ending hurt a lot more than it should have. Its kind of like being a super fan of some sports team/book series/movie series but also being super critical of a disappointment because you are so invested into it.

As for my trepidation to buy on release or not is mostly because the DLC never goes on sale ever (for PC), that DA2 was a disappointment (tho not a bad game and just shy of being a good game), the hard stance bioware took defending the ending to me3 left me pretty bitter, and that they have no reputation to trade off anymore since being bought out by EA. Those are my reasons, they may be bitter and not fair but that's how I feel.

Trust and Respect are earned, and right now bioware to me has little of either. Though that is changing, the youtube Voice Actor vids and this character reveals and interviews change that. With those I can plainly see the effort, care, and intent of the game they are making and it's pleasing to see. The trust and respect are being slowly rebuilt. This is all my opinion and claim to speak for no one but myself.

As for waiting for a sale, you can't really infer anything there, if I don't buy something at release it usually means I am not swayed by the hype or that interested/invested into what's being sold and that I don't think its worth the 60$. Waiting for a sale just makes sense to me if I am not interested in the hype. In fact I rarely do buy anything at release, I've not gotten anything on release since Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim, and Mass Effect 3. 

As for ""missing out,"" that is no big deal for me I have come late into a lot of series like The Witcher, Darksiders, Bioshock and it has not negatively affected my enjoyment at all. Its the same for book series as well, I did not get into reading the A Song of Ice and Fire series until I seen the first episode of the first season. I did not get into the Dark Tower series until it was well over and I also did not get into the Dresden Files until this year. Its no big deal at all and being into it at release has zero affect on how much I will or will not enjoy it.

Thank you for the alternate perspective, it gave me a lot to think on. Like I said before, I am more inclined to pick it up on release because I can see the effort and care being put into the game, its not a money grab with a year and half development cycle with Day 1 Companion and Story DLC.","1404173143"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm interested that 90% of your sources are zerohedge, a blog written anonymously, with little oversight and, frankly, less evidence which is under investigation for plagariasm, and is accused of many of the market manipulations it decries.

If you yell about a disaster frequently enough, eventually one will happen; never mind the 98% of the time they're wrong, that one time they're right will sure make you feel good.

Also, people generally realize that the New Deal, while not ending the Depression, managed to help people stave off the worst of its effects. And it's amazing that you can look at that unemployment trend and not see the downward trend; people didn't immediately go back to work, but they DID go back to work. We were well into recovery when WW2 cemented the recovery; as you noted, largely on federal spending. We then entered a boom economy, production soared, and we paid down our debt, solidifying that recovery.

&gt;Deflation in consumer prices is a result of a successful market,

So...the Great Depression was actually a successful market, given that it was heavily deflationary? Deflating prices indicate a widespread inability to purchase products. That's what deflation is, an excess of supply and a lack of demand. This is basic economics.

I would disagree with your friends. There are plenty of new innovations and there is always more to learn. I'd suggest heading to your school's library and asking where they keep the civil journals and proceedings. Flip through the tables of contents of some newer issues to get a sense of what's going on. I promise you'll have more ideas than you can handle.

This is what it means that the proof rests upon an assumption. You are also appealing to popularity.

&gt;""well KP can't be right because it entails omniscience! And clearly there aren't any omniscient beings!""

I never said that either. It is easy to see that a truth is truth whether we know of it or not - that is the nature of truth.  Once we know of a truth, it is simply a truth added to the set of all truths we know.  Fitch's paradox adds in an assertion to the property of truth that it has to be known in order for it to be a truth. In some ways, this makes sense but I don't think this is a correct assumption to be made.","1404173147"

"biology","t5_2qhn7","Dude...there are some pretty fucking rad proteins out there! Let me add a couple to what people have already said:

**Proteasome protein complexes/ubiquitin** - grim reaper of proteins essentially! Pretty cool how they work together, with the cell, to figure which proteins in the cell need to be recycled. But what degrades a giant proteasome? (who watches the Watchmen?) [some evidence](http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/17880920/Caspase-7-mediated-cleavage-of-proteasome-subunits-during-apoptosis) shows that apoptotic enzymes might be involved in breaking them down in pieces.

**Carbonic anhydrase** - incredibly important in our bodies, since they help keep blood pH at its optimal. But what intrigues me is that they contain a zinc atom at the core of its structure. Another cool fact: highly conserved among all animals, but in certain marine diatoms in the Indian Ocean, carbonic anhydrase can take up cadmium instead, due to zinc deficiency. Probably a catabolite repression activity. Only example of it in the world!

**Pikachurin** - how awesome is that? It's named after Pikachu! This protein is important in the interactions between bipolar dendrites and ribbon synapses found in photoreceptors. 

And there are so many more. Proteins rock.","1404173149"

"blackberry","t5_2qnpz","I'm afraid it's not even a contest. BlackBerry Z30 hands down. No it's and or buts. I too was using a bold 9900 and boy am I glad I didn't go for the q10. 

Few things I like about my z30:

* Remarkable battery life [almost always get a day and a half of normal use or about a day of intense use]
* Surround sound speakers that absolutely fill up a room - still surprised how a device so small can produce a sound this big!
* Beautiful 5"" 720p amoled screen 
* Ample screen size which means you can see more of what you're doing at any time and the screen size makes the keyboard a joy to 
  use. I typed this whole post mostly not even looking at the keyboard!
* To me the z30 takes better pics than my old z10 
* Better processor and GPU, so games run buttery smooth and android apps run flawlessly and almost no lag when using the phone  
  on a day to day basis
* I find the device to be a stunner in the looks department, and it looks all business with the screen taking centre stage
* Paratek antenna means I get reception where most people wouldn't and sometimes even in elevators
* Try a bbm call over z30 speakers (speaker mode) and prepare to have your jaw hit the floor :O [feels like the person is really there]
* Headphones can be used as antennas for built in radio tuner, which is great to listen to music for those with no internet connection 
   or low cap data plans
* USB OTG support, so in essence it can can read USB files on the go. I have USB files with all my movies and I just use an adapter 
  to attach and I am good to go on a long flight
* Miracast

Pair bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the phone and using a microHDMI to HDMI cable, attach to monitor and VOILA. You have yourself a mini desktop computer. Only gripe is no landscape support when on the app screen.","1404173153"

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","I find that I have some limited freedom to directly affect my own mental state. Sometimes, I can choose to not follow negative patterns and follow positive patterns instead. I don't have absolute freedom to change everything though.

Indirect ways like going outside on a beautiful day or some kinds of physical exertion can be more powerful, allowing changes that I cannot do directly. Getting motivation to do such things can be a problem though.

No change is truly permanent. Over time, I can only change tendencies for particular patterns to occur.

Interactions with unfamiliar people offline can push me into a negative state even if I was formerly in a positive state. This is perhaps the main reason why I stay FA. For example, I can feel good going out for a walk in a park, but then if I tried to socialize that could bring me down. Moderate positive states don't really carry over, and people can trigger all sorts of negativity. Only rare exceptionally positive states are strong enough to remain.","1404173153"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The proportions of characters can inform the mechanics of the game, like how the art style in Wind Waker fit a Link with that head-body ratio while other art styles probably would not have worked as well, yes, correct. I can't find a link to it now, but I recall someone related to the production saying that if Link had had other proportions in that game, it would have changed his relations with the environment and it would have taken him longer to walk between two points across a field. That touches both cadence and level design and certainly leaves a mark on the gameplay.

But it's still the case that I can have an isolated opinion about whether I think I like the art style or not.

You are assuming either that I'm attempting a deep analysis about the game through the art style or that based on my opinion about the art style, I am choosing not to play it (""incorrect to dismiss the game based solely on looking at some screenshots"", ""inability to get past""), neither of which are true. You are extrapolating opinions and jumping to conclusions. If I was interested in dismissing a game after looking at screenshots, why would I watch Let's Plays of it?

I am simply making a statement that I don't like how the art style looks. I will concede that I can't be sure that the art style isn't informing one or the other decision making some part of the game work, and point out that I didn't at any point say it didn't.","1404173154"

I'm willing to put money down that Hextall will be in on him.  He has a mess of massive contracts connected to mediocre blueliners to clean up and Del Zotto, like you said, is a much cheaper solution (take a look at our cap status.)  Complaints from NYR and NSH say he wasn't given the chance to play an offensive style game, which is what he's bred for.  And his Corsi-for percentage sucked (scary, I know, but has improved with each season in the NHL.). He has a few seasons under his belt but not enough to be deemed a true veteran d-man.  Plus, most D unless they're elite, don't reach full potential until mid to late 20's.  He's got speed, offensive upside, and would fit perfectly well into our new system which tries to implement defenseman on the rush.

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","You hit the nail on the head there. Once I learned to just keep my fly in the water after a ""botched"" cast instead of picking out up and making another one,  my hookup/landed ratio went through the roof. However there are places I've fished, some of them here on the upper Texas coast believe it or not, where that 70' Hail Mary shot to a pinhead was a necessity to present that fly to a large fish in super shallow, gin clear water. 

The biggest points I try to iterate on my more advanced repeat students are more about accuracy, presentation and timing in the casting stroke than going for raw distance. I feel that one you're consistent with you placement at close to medium range, then you can start perfecting that double haul and start accurately shooting backing to the rod tip. ","1404173159"
"ultrahardcore","t5_2tswi","2v2v2 Late night to4 aussi game hosted by (idk it was late and a lot of people host on that server) Half of my team left after about 5 minutes of the game because they didn't realize that there would be that much lag. I was alone with 1 teammate with half a heart. We got together after he healed up and we got enchanted and then tried to get some gold. By the time we were ready to fight it was meetup. We were up against a team consisting of the hosts so they had the upper hand in gear and they were not lagging, and another team that had showed up late in the game. We were spread out trying to get the advantage since we could barely bow because it was laggy and they were too far to sword rush. I got low but got the host's team really low and they other team died. I was shot so it was my teammate versus the last 2 people on that team. We won by BTC but it was an awesome battle, I usually love the battles where multiple teams are fighting but nobody is there to backstab, and when it goes on for a long amount of time but stays intense.

Kids are suppose to give your life more meaning and make you happy, not be some kind of bolt chained to your leg and make you lonely. Kids are way smarter than we give them credit for, and they often perceive events parents don't even tell them about. What's important is to talk to your daugher and have an open communication. That said, maybe tell your date to hold back on the father/step-father role until you know he is a keeper.

No one deserves to be alone, kids or not. What you could take into consideration when looking for a partner though, is how well your date and your daughter goes together when they eventually meet frequently. Your needs are important, but in that relationship your daughter also gets a step-father/extra guardian. But don't overthink it.

"fantasybaseball","t5_2quxe","Hate to break it to you, but that's not a good draft.  At some point, the blame ends up on the manager who drafted such a team.  The idea is to not pay for career years (Davis, Bailey, Myers), draft safely early on (no Jay Bruce or Wil Myers), and pay attention to aging trends (Pedroia, ISO decline).  Minor is always homer-friendly, but with a ton of BABIP variance, so not the safest pick.  Cain is as buy low as it gets, and there's one to be genuinely frustrated about.  Cain and Longoria are the only ones that were good picks relative to their ADP and had a reasonable expectation to be valuable.  I don't mean this in a condescending way, but there are good picks and not so good picks.  Good teams maximize their good picks. 

In redraft, you're kind of boned.  In keeper, see who will ""buy low"" or what name value those guys have.","1404173160"

As long as they're there, I think the project as a whole is moving in a direction that will benefit gamers. As soon as they leave, we know Facebook has fucked it up.

""Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist. Born in the Philippines and raised in the United States from the age of 12, he was part of The Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2008 for their coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings online and in print.[2] Vargas has also worked for The San Francisco Chronicle, The Philadelphia Daily News, and The Huffington Post.[3]
In a June 2011 essay in The New York Times Magazine, Vargas revealed his status as an ""undocumented immigrant""[3] in an effort to promote dialogue about the immigration system in the US. It was also a way to advocate for the DREAM Act, which would help children in similar circumstances have a path to citizenship. A year later, a day after the publication of his Time cover story about his continued uncertainty regarding his status, the Obama administration announced its halt to the deportation of undocumented immigrants under age 30 eligible for the DREAM Act; Vargas himself does not qualify due to his age.[4]""

I didn't make a boot order but here are some highlights:

*Rob C. and Courtney in the same tribe with Phillip Shepherd = hilarity.

*I'm not sure if Coach and Phillip become best friends or sworn enemies but either way it will be great.  

*Brandon Hantz starts to lust for Shannon and doesn't know how to handle it. He tells Shannon, and Shannon flips out. A fistfight ensues and they are both booted 

*Corrine makes a bunch of statements in early confessionals about how mean and badass she is, but then proceeds to do nothing until her statement at FTC.

*Lex makes stupid decisions and then plays the victim.

*Somehow Parvati manages not to be the first one eliminated and makes a huge late game run only to be taken down by the dragonslayer.

*Amanda makes final three, but at FTC Probst intervenes and says ""Amanda why even bother?"" and pulls her from the game right there on the spot.

*Rob and Courtney are the final two. The best FTC ever ensues, and Rob wins.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The biggest problem with micro-financing that I've seen is the difficulty of default.  And the difficulty to default - as your article notes - is because (shockingly) poor people carry a big credit risk.

The idea behind microfinancing was that it would be a tool for getting more mileage out of a charitable gift.  Rather than giving an impoverished mother $50 to fund a business, you give her a $50 loan and let her pay it back as she can.  Then you've got your $50 back, and you can make another loan.  But baked into the idea was this idea that if the $50 *didn't* get paid back, it was no reason to panic.  This was, after all, charity money.

Credit became harmful when charities became commercial enterprises and what was intended as a humanitarian operation turned into loan sharking.  Microloans were intended to *replace* the practice of loan sharking, not merely establish new management.

**TL;DR;** It isn't the credit that's the problem here, it's the creditors.","1404173166"

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I understand that it's better to get the hunter the kill. I get all of that. It's irrelevant. Unless you're in a situation where you are already **guaranteed** the kill, I'm going to keep hitting it. If the enemy is stunned and one shot, I'll hold off, but if they're still moving and the kill relies on a skill shot (including a basic attack) then I don't care.

This is a game of skillshots and sometimes the jukes are real. Anyone who mains support knows that usually the person you're angry at the most is the person you're supporting. Frankly, for all I know you're going to jump in the air with Anhur and try to 360 no-scope the kill with an impale only to miss, proceed to choke on all of your basic attacks then let the kill get away.

I get that the kill should go on the hunter but the fact of the matter is that the actual kill itself is not worth **that** much, and is **never** worth enough to risk losing it. The gold and XP difference between an assist and a kill is negligible compared to the gold and XP difference that comes from the time that the enemy player misses in lane and the advantage that comes from having one less opponent to worry about for 20-60 seconds. If you're hung up on the difference between a kill and an assist and your character's name isn't Xbalanque, then you're doing it wrong.

There are situations where I'm going to give a little more slack. If I'm supporting an Xbal I'll try extra hard to let him get it, for example. If a Kali is nearby and it's her target then I'll do my best to let it happen if she needs the heal, but there is **no** situation where I'm going to hold my damage back until I am no longer guaranteed to get the kill.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Been mugged twice, both in parks late at night, so there's a lesson there.  The first time I was with a bunch of friends in my neighbourhood park.  First guy came up and asked for a smoke. None of us had one, he chatted with us for a minute then another buddy of his came over. This repeated till there were about 6 or 7 of them, and they surrounded me in particular blocking my friends from helping.  After demanding my wallet the shortest guy hit me with what I assume was a lock in a sock in the ribs.  One of the guys near me basically said we don't want to hurt you but we will, and I let them take my wallet.  

Second time was downtown with just one buddy of mine, we were smoking a joint when a guy on a bike rode up and again asked for a cigarette. Not having one he rode off, and ignorant of gangster mentality I told him to have a good night. 10 minutes later and were just finishing the joint, and getting ready to head out, when the same guy appears on a bike again.  Getting off he withdrew a hockey stick with a hunting knife duct taped to the end of it.  He put it right against my stomach and demanded everything.  Got my iPod my wallet, and some other assorted things.  Scariest part was he kept saying that it wasn't enough and getting in my face with the huge spear.  He didn't rob my friend because I was the one who had told him to have a good night. Apparently he took it as me being dismissive and disrespectful.

"futurebeatproducers","t5_2t5r3","ahahha, okay, you've kinda set my expectations with a track called ""Call of Hooty"" and an owl staring at me...this'd better pay off!

okay we got them spacey filter sweeps, fun...

what the, the gooey synth and beat that come in at ~0:48...are those in the same tempo as the spacey intro? :X something sounds off-kilter, in the bad way :X

okay now a little blast-off...

and we're zooming around space, nice nice. the backing beat supports the track really nicely...but it kinda feels like the goo synth and the dreamy space synth are crowding each other...

woah what the, big giant tamborine at ~2:33...what happened there? 

okay now it's soothing out a bit...and in comes a new snare and we (literally) blast off again...

hey now, i like this part a lot! the goo synth like distracts from things around the ~3:05 mark

so far I feel the track hasn't justified such a goof-ass title, though

okay we're still going...this is starting to feel like a like a live got-a-new-keyboard goof around...

yeah that big ole tamborine has got to go

okay, this thing could lose like 2-3 minute easily...I really like the structure of 'moments', you know, first this part and then this other part and it's all a big journey but this feels like stream-of-consciousness ideas

lots of potential here, just needs a lot of sanding and nailing and polishing!

i'm sorry to say, though, that it needs a new title. just didn't deliver on that front :I","1404173177"

He is also a work horse, can play a lot of minutes, can score goals, every time he goes on the ice, momentum seems to go to the Canucks. One of the MVP's of the team last year in my opinion.

"Needafriend","t5_2qtp9","I've definitely found actual friends here. And I wouldn't say that I've had to ""sift through replies from perverts"". I've never had a really overtly creepy message, although it's clear that some guys are immediately flirty/asking for pictures/whatever. I just don't respond or stop responding if it's like that. For me, it hasn't been a big problem (that doesn't mean that's true fore everyone, of course). 

The bigger issue I had the first time I posted was that it seemed like a lot of people messaged without even reading my post, just because I was female. It felt like people didn't really want to get to know me, but they already had this idea of who I was. Things I say would sort of get twisted, and dating would be brought up. It was honestly pretty upsetting to me because I was looking for friends. I posted about not having any close friends - having all these shallow relationships. And it just felt like a confirmation of that (that I'd never have good friends - it's either small talk-y or all about a relationship and not even a relationship with me as an individual but just a random internet girl). The whole thing made me feel pretty bad, pretty overwhelmed. I felt like I had to either ignore people or explicitly ""reject them"" or whatever. And that was hard when I was trying to make friends. 

I had a really good experience with my more recent post, though. I was more detailed, more explicit about what I was looking for. And I think that made a difference. I do think a lot of guys just feel more comfortable talking to girls. There definitely are people with ulterior motives (whether they're creepy or more relationship based), but there's also a lot of people who aren't like that. And I would say I've made some really good friends from here. It hasn't been that long (so maybe it won't last/be long term), but I've had very good conversations and I really hope to stay in touch/stay close.

"aww","t5_2qh1o","What are you basing this position on?

Animals in CAFOs live in restricted cages filled with their own excrement, are exposed to so many infections they require constant antibiotics, and pumped with hormones to grow to abnormal proportions.  It's essentially a concentration camp for animals, except even more efficient.  If that's not far removed from your lifestyle you have my sympathies.  

Contrast the horror of a CAFO to that of life in the wilds, or simply on an open terrain, where they can exercise and live freely and it's obvious which is the preferable and more ethical choice.

I am in no means a strong deck builder (Rank 5 with Kolento Druid/Miracle), but I've been testing this, subverting the proposed draw with coldlights. I've found a lot of it comes down to top decks late into the game with the mass amounts of 3 costs cards synergizing with the yolo 2 far sights.

It's definitely harder (more hrs) without the career, but not impossible.  You must have grown up knowing that you'd have to work a job, right?  Even as a kid we knew that writers didn't make much.  We knew that our teachers didn'nt make much.  I'm sorry that you're realizing this now all at once.  But I guess that's how it was for me as well.

  What lifestyle sacrifices are you referencing?  We can plan this shit out, instead of saying that its impossible.  We can spend time attacking the issue, instead of using absolute words like never and sacrifice completely.

And 40hr/week isn't that bad.  You have the weekends and the evenings too.  And the mornings if you're an early bird.  I really do try and enjoy myself each and every day.  At your job you can make friends and feel like you're a part of a community.  You can complain about your job with your peers!  I was stuck in school my whole childhood so its not much of an adjustment.  Make time to do what you love and really really enjoy it while you're doing it.

What would you do if you could spend your time however you wanted to right now?  Does it involve watching movies? or going camping?  YOu can fit a large part of your FI fantasy into your current everyday life.  I love rock climbing and go every single weekend.  If I was FI, I would go every other day.  I realize this, and am that much happier when I'm out there on my weekends.

Also there's no way to say this without being a little rude, so I apologize for potentially offending you, but check out this article:

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; Look in any major city in north america and you're going to find a limitless supply of men in various MMA, Krav Maga, BJJ etc courses seeking to find an outlet for that innate urge that has been ruthlessly quashed everywhere else. Sadly, most of those classes tend to be ""belt mill"" shitholes, but the demand for the martial is definitely there.

True. I'm a practitioner of Krav myself, tho I find it a bit odd to say that this ""innate urge"" to beat shit to a pulp must be male in nature. There are several women in my class, after all.

But I think that's the real irony of fight club. Men who feel disposable form a place where they no longer feel disposable, and then create a new movement where they are more disposable than ever. I think it's easy to say ""if they just stuck with basement fighting everything would have been great"" but I think the seeds of self destruction were always there. Tyler never wanted people to talk about fight club because he wanted to maintain its integrity as his own little echo chamber of pro-male aphorisms. It was a circle jerk, a fun one for a bit, but a circle jerk nonetheless. And then it grew beyond his control...","1404173190"

"canada","t5_2qh68","I completely realize productivity drives the economy (though demand is a huge factor in that), but what's happened in the last 40 years (and greatly accelerated in the last 20) is that productivity has become more and more decoupled from labour. Since the 70s, productivity has skyrocketed and wages have stagnated (the two were essentially in lockstep prior to this). With the rise of globalization and automation (likely to be the more important of the two in coming decades), this phenomenon is only going to get more pronounced. 

The fact of the matter is that we need less and less people to meet higher and higher levels of demand. Foxxconn intends to replace a million human workers with robots. WhatsApp is valued at around $20 billion but employs only 55 people - that's over $300 million per employee in ""productivity"".  Humans are becoming increasingly less necessary, particularly for rote tasks, but even more complicated tasks are not immune to automation. A recent study placed 47% of all current jobs at high risk of automation in the next couple decades. Since this is the case, we need to start coming up with alternative methods of allocating resources, or we will have massive structural poverty (which is bad for everyone, including the rich who require people to have money to buy their products). Basic Income is a good start at solving the problems we are already facing and which will only become more pronounced over time.","1404173194"

Too often success is believed to be predicated on some birthright of natural talent and intelligence rather than working hard enough to maximize the what you have.

You're exactly right. I conflated my lack of effort with a lack of of capacity in some areas, as I'd coasted on natural ability for most of my schooling, so I never put in the effort (because after all, I was just no good at maths), and I regret it immensely. 

It's why I try to avoid praising my children as smart, (I had a lot of adults telling me as a child how smart I was, and it went to my head) but instead praise them for persistence, and effort, and always celebrate when their hard work pays off.","1404173195"

But it isn't an S-corp, it is a C-Corp. What would you do if there was A at 40%, and 10,000 people making up the remaining 20%?

&gt; I mean I'm sure smarter people than me have thought about better ways to do it, I just want to see a solution that prevents something which is clearly an unfair system with no societal benefit whatsoever.

These aren't simple loopholes, they are incredibly complex and trying simple solutions will just create even more obtuse workarounds.

I would point out the two bigger issues are the disparity in international  tax law. Having a more consistent rate would eliminate the benefit (although getting that to happen is laughably impossible for political reasons).

The other issue is investors themselves. In order to distribute dividends you have to undo all these loopholes and pay the US government its due. However since all the major companies are value based, they don't have to worry about that. While it would still be an effective tax deferring mechanism, at least it wouldn't be an avoidance one anymore.

BTW now the benefit is you just bring over your money when you are ready to spend it, so you match your profits and expenses to avoid paying any tax on that money. Again this would be worthless if not for the huge amount of capital expenditure the big players do all the time.","1404173199"

"running","t5_2qlit","Hi folks, this is Sterling Noren from RunFreeMovie here. Dash and Flint alerted me to this thread and I wanted to thank you for your feedback and suggestions regarding our Kickstarter fundraising campaign. 

Regarding the prize structure I did my best to research other Kickstarter documentaries and the rewards they offered and tried to come up with something similar. I know that $50 for a film rental is a steep price to pay, but please remember that these are thank-you gifts for a contribution to the project, and not meant to be purchases of a product. We will take your suggestions into consideration but I know that Kickstarter has some strict rules about changing prizes mid-campaign.

About the ""risk"" of the project I can only say that the risk of completing this film is minimal if we reach our goal, for the reason that it has already been shot and mostly edited. The money we raise is to pay ourselves back for the work we have already done, and pay for final production costs and marketing. If we don't raise our goal, we will still finish the movie, although it won't be as good as it can be, nor will it be seen by as many people.

I might add that all of this work so far has been done at our own personal expense without any budget whatsoever. This is not a complaint at all, merely pointing out the reality of the project and the thousands of hours of time that have gone into it.

As for the quality the promotional video, all of the feedback you mention  is on the level and appreciated. We (the filmmakers) did not create that video. It was made by a close friend of the people that were filmed. Although it is not reflective of the quality of the movie, I really want to thank the filmmaker who made the video for us, because I couldn't be at the race where that video was filmed. 

As for the quality of the film we are making, I encourage you to watch the movie trailer, and the additional 'online extras' that we are posting on Vimeo. I think they are true examples of the quality level of the film.

Were doing our best to tell a story that means a lot to all of us, with minimal support so far. We think it is worth it. I hope you do to.

Thanks for your suggestions!","1404173203"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hey! I LIVE IN VANCOUVER! I have some good tips for you.

Never buy brand new construction, it will fall apart on you quickly and it's overhyped. Go for something older and renovated, it's more solid and holds up better. Just speaking from experience of having an ex who fell into this trap *three separate times*. If you insist on it, wait for people to have lived there for a little while so you can talk to people about the building/complex/area. Also, new roads make getting pizza or anything a bit of a nightmare sometimes. 

Get to know your neighbours, know what their jobs are, maybe who comes and goes, so you know to look out for suspicious activity. 

Always check your outlets. Bring along some christmas lights and plug 'em into each outlet. If they light up, you're good! Get someone to check out the wiring.

Always check your foundation for cracks and stuff because a lot of construction here can be unstable after a while because a lot of it is built on what was previously marshland. We had this problem previously.

Also, if you're picking out an older home, maybe check out its history. Often you'll find out really cool stuff like hidden rooms, previous occupants, etc etc that can boost the value of your home.","1404173204"
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","That's quite the biased comment. Wouldn't you agree that there are tons of people in every branch of the military who are nothing more than frat boys with automatic weapons? It has nothing to do with them being part of PMC companies, and everything to do with them being young men. We know for a fact that many American military members were doing terrible things in Iraq too. 

As you even admit, your guys were getting kicked out for bad conduct. To suggest that you know anything about ""most"" PMC's is simply ignorant. How many of them have you met? How many ""bad apples"" do we have evidence of compared to how many exist? Most is just not factual. You have nothing to back that up.

Many PMC's come from the American armed forces. It wouldn't be a stretch to think that at least half of PMC's are formed US armed forces members. This proves that your comment is just biased and not based on fact. Or do you want to suggest that these PMC's were all angels in the american armed forces and only turned bad because they became PMC's? Oh wait, we go back again to your comment, and can see you even admit your own members have bad conduct.

So why are we discussing PMC's? Just say ""most young male American's in Iraq with machine guns acted like young male American's with machine guns, because that is what they are.""

"sex","t5_2qh3p","You may be over-building here.  And that can keep you in your head, constantly trying to guess-work your way through a problem you don't understand.  It's a stress-response.  When anxious, you become hyper aware, and are constantly on the lookout for danger.

Yeah, like a meerkat.  Unfortunately, that's kinda the opposite of what helps in sex.  You almost want tunnel-vision for sex.  And, that frustration can create a self-perpetuating situation.

So, what to do? First, take it slow.  Explore with clothes on, if that makes you comfortable.  Don't get crazy unless it sounds exciting and fun (you could go blindfolded if you want, but that is probably extreme).  If you want to go naked, make it pitch damned black.  Have something that drowns out certain sensory issues: are you acutely aware of every little noise when you are meerkatting?  Then turn on a box fan, get music cranking, create perpetual sounds that will drown out the common little clicks and pings of everyday life.  'Normal' sex (i.e. whatever you consider normal) with that for surroundings.  

And it's important to determine WHAT you enjoy.  Do you like taking charge? Are you egalitarian? Do you like to lay back and let your partner make decisions? Do you switch? None of this is traditional dom/sub, either.  It's much more tame than that.  I prefer eating pussy over getting a bj.  I just don't like laying back and 'taking'; I grow self-conscious.  I like 'doing' acts, and I like egalitarian choices.  I'm most in my element at those times.  What about you?

It doesn't sound from your post like you were a big 'contributor' in your previous sex life, meaning he was dominant and explored his sexuality while yours didn't get much attention.  Whether he ignored it or you weren't comfortable trusting it with him or both, you sound like you got experience without really exploring your own personal views.  So... now is the time for that.  

And take all the time you need.  Sex is supposed to be fun! It was totally designed that way.  So don't stress; go where you feel, not where you think. :)

Good luck! No one deserves to pressure you; not your ex, not your current, and most importantly not yourself.  No judgment, just enjoyment!","1404173205"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay, this was at night in an apartment complex with a giant yard and me and one of my friends. We were waiting for my friend's sisters to come back out after they had got done with whatever they were doing inside. We built forts out of wood, so we had a lot of random pieces of wood laying around. We lied on two pieces of long plywood on top of a smaller chunk of wood to make the top part of it rise up when we lay on it. Think like a see-saw. We were gonna watch the stars because you could see them very well that night. We started watching and tried to find the little and big dipper as usual. I saw light behind me as if there were a bright stadium behind us. The thing is, there was a canal behind us and a telephone pole which was in the corner of my other neighbor's yard. The light was so bright that I couldn't even see what was causing it; white and no other color tint. It was no flashlight to the face if that's what you think. It shone for at least 6 seconds before I got the hell outta there. I was the first to see it and there was nothing in the backyard that would really cause that. My only guess was Aliens. No, but seriously the two things highly possible was that it had something to do with the telephone pole, or someone walking on the other side of the fence which connected to the walkway near the canal had caused it somehow. It's one of the most baffling things since it's not very common people have stories of bright light appearing behind you like that. I think maybe the telephone pole wires got chewed through by a rat and it caused it somehow, but we heard no noise from it, and if there was, that rat died quietly.","1404173210"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt;She is discriminating against religious people by forcing them to pay for what these religious people feel is murder! Their issue with the IUDs is it can kill a developing thing/baby/fetus. She's forcing them to pay for murder (in their eyes).

This has been upheld multiple times.  If you are not forced to partake in the act, your right to religion is safe.  This is why Quakers have to pay taxes that go to the military, but cannot be forced into joining the military.  There is not one other instance where this idea is supported except in the Hobby Lobby.  That's pretty much the definition of hypocrisy.

There is nothing in the bible that says or even could be linked to the ethics of paying for someone else's abortion.  It is only able to connect bible verses to the act of abortion.  Not even birth control.  IUDs and Plan B are not abortions in anyway, yet still companies can refuse to provide them.

&gt;I mentioned the jew-muslim thing to show how ridiculous her statements are and show how it's rationalization. How it'll set a precedent.

I've already explained this.  The basis of the supreme court's decision is that we cannot force a company to go against certain religious beliefs.  She's pointing out the distinction without a difference.  She's saying, ""if this is allowed, why isn't this allowed?""  It's not relevant to how many people are up in arms about it, because her whole point is that no one would agree with it.

&gt;to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices,

You are not at all connecting this important part of satire to her being post-wall.  Don't bother responding until you connect them.

Also don't bother responding until you proves she's contradicting herself.  Disagreeing with you is not hamstering or rationalizing. ","1404173211"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; This logic only works if we consider sex a ""reckless habit.""

It endangers you. No more than, say, driving, and obviously there are many awesome reason to do it. But you don't have to.

&gt; Even if you oppose premarital/casual sex, plenty of married couple use contraception to avoid any/more children that they don't want/can't afford to support/etc.

Of course I don't oppose casual sex, that'd be silly. That being said, I would rather government maybe subsidize the product or allow it being pushed through for near free prices through planned parenthood or whatever.

This would move it away from a healthcare (where it doesn't really belong) to a more sensible area of the government where it can be discussed more properly in context rather than constantly getting dragged up in conversations which allow people to blur the blindingly obvious answer to the question of ""should we kill and/or bankrupt poor people if they get sick?""

&gt; It's a relatively inexpensive treatment that can prevent a much larger, more problematic, more expensive condition from happening later on.

Wouldn't bicycle helmets fit this criteria too. Why doesn't health insurance buy those too?

I agree that there's a good case for government intervention, but I do find that lumping it in with healthcare makes little sense.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So this happened to my mom and her siblings when she was young. Anyway, here we go.

When my mother and her brothers, Kirk and Patrick, were sleeping next to each other in the basement when she was very young (around age 7 or so), she had a rather vivid dream about someone she referred to as the Bed Girl. In the dream, she and Kirk and Pat were jumping up and down on the bed in the basement. They were having a good time and it was pretty dimly lit. After a short while, their mother walks down the stairs with a candle and looks at them with warning. ""You'd better quit jumping on the bed or the Bed Girl is going to get you."" 

She went back up the stairs and my mom continued jumping on the bed. Not a few moments later, a woman's hand begins coming up from beneath the bed. Her fingernails are blood red and her skin is ghostly white. She rises from beneath the bed and reveals herself, pasty white face with blood red lipstick and sheer black hair. 

My mother here's awake, terrified. Both of her brothers are sitting up as well and my mom proceeds to tell them the dream she just had. It turns out they all had the exact same mother fucking dream. Their mom coming downstairs. Bed Girl. Everything.

Nothing too creepy but still is pretty interesting.

TL;DR: My mom had a nightmare while sleeping next to her brothers and woke up realizing they all had the exact same dream.","1404173213"

I affixed 1"" sheets of Styrofoam to all the walls.  I then ruffed up all the Styrofoam with a knife, digging craters and creating cracks.  Then came 25 gallons of joint compound over about 5 different applications.  The final two applications I textured with rubber gloved hands, then sanded down.  Next came a paint-gun and flat gray paint, followed by a sponge application of terracotta, dark granite, and cream colors.  Then flat gray got sponged back onto those colors.  A black wash and a white dry-brush finished off the walls.

The door, light fixture, windowsill, and prop shelf were all hand-made out of 100 year old, rough-cut cedar.

The lamp was a lucky find at a thrift store and the skeleton, ""Art"", was found on Craigslist.  Most of the weapons were found at the estate auction of a B-rated fantasy movie director.  Also of note is an original D&amp;D Red Box, still sealed.

"needadvice","t5_2r367","Pot doesn't get you as fucked up as tranquilizers, opiates, and many other kinds of drugs. If your mom has been smoking for years, she's an experienced smoker, and sharing a spliff with her friend is not going to incapacitate her to the point that she couldn't take care of it if your younger brother has to go to the emergency room or something.

If you think she's been a shitty mom to you all this time and you attribute it to her weed smoking, then okay, you have a pretty solid basis for objection to her smoking. However,  if she keeps the family's basic needs more or less covered (no small task for a single mother) and just enjoys this one vice and it's been harmless as an influence in your life, maybe cut her some slack.

Personally I don't think it's good for parents to smoke out in the presence of their minor children, and I don't think they should tell their kids that they smoke until the kids really are grown up and out on their own - exactly because of this kind of scenario. It puts the kid both in a situation where they have to deal with that knowledge, and it may also mean you end up with a teenage kid who thinks he's morally superior to you - and that's no picnic. :D 

But you're pretty much of age where you can take care of yourself. You don't say how old your brother is, but if he's not very small and dependent on her I'd think it's okay for her to take a couple hours off to enjoy herself every once in a while, as long as she's leaving him in the care of a responsible person while she does it. 

Whether you do or don't want to babysit in general might be a separate discussion; maybe with your business you don't really have time for it (or you don't enjoy doing it) - that'd be valid regardless of why she was asking you to watch him.","1404173218"

"CrappyDesign","t5_2sa3m","&gt; There are countably infinite finite-length passwords.

Please describe how you can count infinity.

&gt; The point remains though that restricting the password set doesn't necessarily make it less secure.

Let me try to explain. Even though, with only simple restrictions and an infinite length of characters, you will reach the higher digit passwords faster. If you use the password H0RsETra1NeR11 for everything, restricting the amount of passwords doesn't really help, as you are going to skip more passwords and get to his faster.

Imagine passwords are numbers. There is an infinite amount of numbers, but one and only one will be your password. Only one of these numbers can unlock your account. Requirements: Your number must be at least 5 digits long and cannot have the same character repeated more than twice (like in the picture above. Ok, cool. So, let's get cracking!

We know that it must be 8 digits long, so we can rule out 0-9999999. That's 1,000,000 numbers ruled out. We also know that you could only have 99887766554433221100 as a maximum password value, due to the rule about repeating characters, so we have quite a lot in the range total. Now, let's start near our maximum value. We better just eliminate 100000000000000000-100099999999999999, because they all have more than two zeros. We have hardly even started and we already eliminated 100,000,000 times more combos than the minimum length did, and put a cap on the number limit. This has VASTLY reduced the password security.

What I think we SHOULD do is say ""We highly recommend you put a number and letter in your password and make it as long as you're comfortable with"". This way it won't reduce the number of combinations, but most people should feel safe about their security still.","1404173219"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt; Many of the secular arguments could be applied to support forcing vegetarianism on society.

I'm not sure about *forcing* per-se, but there are definitely Utilitarians who make that assertion. [Peter Singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer#Vegetarianism_and_ethics_of_food_consumption), who has been mentioned elsewhere on this thread, would definitely make the argument that vegetarianism is more ethically self-consistent than meat-eating. I'll refrain from offering my thoughts on the subject since they are tangential at best.

&gt; What makes humans special is our level of self-aware consciousness. Even a new born still lacks that ability.

Now that I'm back on my laptop, I can actually read the site (I was merely aware of it before).

They make [the following four claims](http://www.secularprolife.org/#!abortion/cimp):

&gt; The secular pro-life position rests on the following premises:

&gt; 1. The fetus is a human being.

&gt; 2. There is no consistent, objective distinction between ""person"" and ""human being.""

&gt; 3. Human beings possess human rights.

&gt; 4. Bodily integrity is not sufficient to justify most abortions.

Your point would seem to fall somewhat under points 1 and 2. They would probably define ""human being"" as *homo sapien*- that is, a member of the species regardless of developmental stage. While making as few assumptions as possible about your position, you appear to define ""human being"" as what they call ""person"".

I'm not particularly skilled at playing devils advocate, but I'll give it a go. The issue with *your* position (from the best way I can understand *their* position) is that it is essentially arbitrary. Why would we choose to define ""person"" that way? And what happens when that justification backfires - would you *really* want people to be able to perform some kind of limited post-natal abortion?

In essence, they would (probably) argue, your criteria don't make sense in that you don't apply them consistently. Would you stab somebody who is in a coma, or otherwise unaware of what you're doing to them?

(EDIT: I don't think I emphasized well enough here their insistence on the idea that all human beings are people because they all contain the possibility of engaging in rational and moral discourse. That is, there is no difference between different states, like 'self-aware' or 'comatose' or 'mentally retarded' because they feel that all *homo sapiens* have the *innate possibility* of engaging in rational activity, and hence are people. See [one of their blog posts](http://blog.secularprolife.org/2013/02/arguments-against-fetal-personhood.html) for an idea of what I mean by this).

As for my views, I would say that you should try to align your actions to another person's desires, in that what is important is that we have desires, and that we suffer when our desires are not met, and feel pleasure when our desires are met. As long as your desires don't involve causing pain in others, we should try to give you pleasure by fulfilling your desires (this opinion is a consequence of my very vaguely Utilitarian line of personal moral sentiment). A person who goes under anaesthesia before surgery *desires* to wake up afterword (or, at least they had that desire at one point) and my dog has a certain innate desire to avoid pain (if I were to kick him, he would run away to avoid being kicked again)- a fetus is not capable of desiring things, so we don't really have to consider it.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","&gt; Unless I am misreading.

You did.

Let's assume that all rights are properly assigned through a binding collaboration agreement. That avoids most of the big legal failures when someone leaves the project and either neglects or refuses to grant all the rights to the remaining individuals. We are not dealing with ownership, we are ONLY dealing with income and distribution of **revenue** like the article suggests.  Or maybe **profits**.

Revenue is a difficult one. Should it be revenue or profits? (hint: neither).  If we base it off revenue then somebody is going to need to chip in for the costs of a web site, somebody needs to pay for any marketing, somebody needs to pay the legal fees for organizing the business, somebody is going to need to do the paperwork. Working off of profit is slightly better, but then you can get into Hollywood accounting where mega-blockbusters fail to make a profit. 

So we'll assume the person running the group is very generous, is running the royalties directly from revenue, and is covering all the expenses and effort from their own funds.

With that collaboration agreement, it states that each unit of work (left vaguely defined) receives a point. He wrote that at the end of the project the points are tallied and percentage is divided up based on the tally.

The article is very vague on those units of work.  

Exactly how do you define a unit of work?  Let's say the game's title artwork required two weeks of effort and some seriously awesome creative talent. That is a single piece of artwork, is it one unit?  Someone needed to model and texture several small pebbles taking about 45 minutes, is that also one unit? Does the original submitter lose credits if someone makes a change, or do both people get credits? Is concept art worth a unit of work? If I touch a single pixel, is that a unit of work?  If I revert a change, is that a unit of work?

Moving on to code, if I write a comprehensive piece of functionality in 1,000 lines, is that one unit? If another bad programmer writes a buggy system requiring 10,000 lines is that also one unit? If I go back later and rewrite the system down to 2,000 lines, removing 8,000 lines of bug-riddled code, is that a unit? Or is that negative units?  When bugs come in, does fixing a bug count as a unit? Does it count against the person who submitted the bug?

What about units of work for less measurable things. What is a unit of work for game design? What is a unit of work for testing? What is a unit of work for a producer or a team lead? What is a unit of work for hiring someone and training them? What is the unit of work for buddy checks and code reviews?

Do I get credit for adding bugs into the code base? Do I get credit for submitting work I know will need to be redone? Do I get credit for work not directly submitted, like meetings and planning and maintenance and other non-development tasks?

Whatever they come up with for assigning points, it must be clear and objective enough that a judge can review it (or order someone to audit it) and be able to come up with values that can be audited and corrected. So lets assume that we have units of work all figured out in a clear, non-biased, objective way.  


So we'll move on.  **We will assume a precise definition of work units is addressed**. 

Our team knows that for every unit of work they submit --- they have been carefully crafted so there is no dispute --- they will be rewarded relative to the number of units they submit against the number everyone submits.

Assuming everybody on the team is completely honest and forthright and has no greed or other interests, they will focus their entire effort on what will most benefit the project. Their goal will be to make the project succeed and they won't be motivated by financial reward.  The powerhouse developer might be able to craft 53% of the points because they are unmarried and unemployed living in a basement and drinking 5-hour energy every 3 hours. Another person is a college student putting in 3 hours a day, they'll get 24%. Someone working on the project a few evenings per week might get 14% of the points. And then you have your idea guy who submitted a few things here and there, coming out with 9%. The team is okay with this distribution (53/24/14/9). 

Now we add a few more people, and we'll come up with a distribution of (21, 12, 19, 8, 4, 16, 18, 2) and everybody is okay with that.


But then somebody both smart and greedy joins the team. They make a very meticulous reading over the carefully crafted definition of a unit of work. Then they start submitting lots of units of work. Everything they do is a unit of work. They are able to submit ten times, twenty times, or even fifty times the units of work that others contribute. 

At the end of the project when the tallies come in, this one crafty individual will have an insanely high number of units of work submitted relative to others. Suddenly it looks like (93%, 0.8, 1.3, 0.4, 0.6...). The person followed all the rules, and since they were carefully crafted inside the binding agreement they must be enforced.

Or conversely, let's say someone comes in mid project. They review the units of work already submitted, and they do the math. They realize that even if they do many great things their units of work will be inconsequential relative to the number of units submitted. They realize that no matter what they do they'll have so many zeros in front that there will be no substantial financial reward.

Every time someone submits a unit of work, it does not increase the value, but instead by definition it dilutes the value of every other unit of work that has been done. 

It now becomes my **incentive to maximize my units of work** rather than to contribute to the project, and I am also given an **incentive to sabotage everyone else** to minimize dilution.

A balanced system comes unraveled very quickly.  You might be able to have two like-minded individuals who can balance the work and the payment.  You might even find a group of three of them.  But four? five? ten? The more people are involved the less likely everyone will have pure goals and an equal burden. It just doesn't work in the real world.  Some people will have more incentive. Some people will have more productivity. Some people will be a drag. And all it takes is one person doing something slightly suspicious and the entire system is unraveled.

It is far better to make payment discretionary. The best discretionary payment is a salary or hourly rate. If that isn't an option, make those discretionary payments out of the profits. Tell them you will try to make it fair and balanced, but ultimately the distribution of money is arbitrarily decided by the project owners.","1404173222"

&gt;Salvia is not 'fun' in the way that alcohol or cannabis can be. If you try to party with salvia you probably will not have a good experience. Salvia is a consciousness-changing herb that can be used in a vision quest, or in a healing ritual. In the right setting, salvia makes it possible to see visions. It is an herb with a long tradition of sacred use. It is useful for deep meditation. It is best taken in a quiet, nearly dark room; either alone, or with one or two good friends present.

2. Alignment Neutral Good. You might want pure good weapons
3. 18(16)/16(6)/14(10)/8(0)/8(0)/8(0)
4. Not many points. Balance, 1 point in tumble.

The idea is you're going for the strength for your damage. The 16 dexterity is because you will eventually need 17 for manyshot. You can pick that up by spending one of your level up points, but it's probably not too hard to get a +1 tome in dexterity. While you're there, you'll probably get two weapon fighting too, because greater two weapon fighting also needs 17 dex, and you'll want a melee option for when you're not shooting. 

It needs a bunch of feats. Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, Many Shot. Power Attack, Bow Strength. Two Weapon Fighting, Improved TWF, Greater TWF. That's 8 at the start before you add anything interesting. On the plus side fighter gives you feats which you need.

Now, this regular is a special breed of asshole: he regularly comes in and tells us to turn down the radio so he can shop. He's that guy -- anyway, I didn't really know what to do and there were so many people, and the kid was separated from his mother. I just had a bad feeling. I had helped her earlier and knew she was in the pharmacy, so I briskly stepped between the two and put my hands on the boy's shoulders, told him his mom was looking for him, and brought him over to the pharmacy. Didn't acknowledge the guy, didn't even look at him; it surprised me that, in stepping between the two, I actually heard nothing from the guy: no rude noises, no goodbyes to the kid. He just turned and walked away. That's when I felt more confident in my decision. When I brought him over to his mom, I told her what happened and she thanked me. A short while later, I was working and she calls the store, asking to speak with me. This time she's nearly in tears, saying her son was scared and didn't know what to do, offering me money, I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I heard her talk. 

If you get a bad feeling about a stranger and a kid -- don't wait to do something about it. Many abductions take place over the holidays because shopping centers are so crowded and it's easy to separate child and mother. I knew this guy had anger issues (among other general issues), and this kid didn't need to be alone with him. ","1404173225"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","In order to get convicted of raping someone because they're drunk they have to be so drunk that they are unable to consent.  This doesn't mean stumbling around and slurring their words.  This doesn't even mean black-out drunk if the person is still moving around and can have meaningful conversation (by this I don't mean *intelligent* conversation, I mean that you are capable to understanding the words coming out of their mouths).  In order to be convicted of rape the victim typically has to be so drunk as to be rendered unconscious.  

An unconscious person can't drive, so they can't be convicted of drunk driving.  They are physically incapable of getting behind the wheel of a car and steering it.  So there really isn't a double standard *legally* (many people consider having sex with someone who is plastered but willing to be rape, that doesn't mean you'll go to jail for it).  Legally speaking if you're drunk enough to be considered a rape victim you're also too drunk to actually drive, meaning you won't get a DUI in that state.  

As far as other legal issues go, if you do things like sign a contract while drunk you may have standing to get it dismissed.  My understanding of that is rather weak, so it would be wise to consult a real lawyer if you're curious about that.","1404173226"

* I know my parents like it when I sometimes just spend a day with them for no reason. When they invite me to dinner I end up staying pretty late, and we get to talk about more personal stuff rather than just casual joking/chitchat
* Make something for her rather than buy it (unless she hates that kind of thing)

Some Asian parents will say what she's saying no matter what you do. Try to find out what she actually means, because I personally doubt that she actually thinks you've ""never done anything for her"".

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Every needs to know that natural gas makes up for about 40% of energy generation, and that fracking is one of the few industries in America that is thriving. Though there are problems, they pale in comparison to the problems caused by oil and coal. 

Renewables are expensive. Wind and solar are heavily subsidized and NOT YET a viable(meaning cheap enough) alternative to fossil fuels. People like to point out that Germany has 50% of it's electricity produced through solar, but it's important to remember that Germany is the size of Texas, and it's not only power generation that is important, but transportation of that power. 

Also, Mr. Ruffalo's comment about it being relatively new is very silly. It was invented in 1947. It's just used more widely today than before. If you think about it, ALL energy generation is relatively new. 200 years ago we didn't have any of this stuff. 

It's important to understand that criticism of fracking is most likely coming from other energy industries like coal and oil that can increase their profit if natural gas becomes more rare. If we reduce fracking, it will only cause energy prices to rise and cause more reliance on coal and oil. Energy isn't free. We have to pick our poison. ","1404173234"

Ironic because statements like ""physical theories are nothing but tools..."" are themselves philosophical arguments that are similar in nature to the arguments among physicists and philosophers over quantum foundations.

Do you think logic and Occam's razor has no place in physics? Because that is all this debate is about. Do we as physicists believe in fairies? After all, they can be made perfectly compatible with the current framework in a way that it makes no different testable predictions. Which theory should we choose then? The one with fairies or the one without? Or should we throw up our hands and say that this is philosophy, and so in the search for future theories of physics, we should give equal-time consideration to those theories that incorporate fairies? Or should we actually think critically and logically about how to spend our time?

Different interpretations of QM yield different problems/solutions with regard to QFT and QG and TOE, and point in different directions for future theory, and therefore the question of which camp is right determines the efficacy of future searches for predictive, scientific theories of nature.","1404173234"

- 4 lanes, that are reduced to 2 while on a bend while people are unnecessarily trying to merge, makes traffic worse.

- Reducing the speed limit from 100 to 60/80 for the construction zone that doesn't contain any construction workers or reduce the number of available lanes for 6 months out of the year, makes traffic worse.

- Setting up photo radar on a highway in sections where the speed limit should and could be anywhere between 120-130, makes traffic worse.

- The city creating roadways that they know will need to have the lanes increased 5-10 years down the road, resulting in further construction and a higher overall cost because they didn't want to do it properly the first time, makes traffic worse.

- Not having a carpool lanes or a sections where you're not allowed to try and make that last minute merge over 3 lanes, makes traffic worse.","1404173236"

"Asexual","t5_2rhee","Sexuality is fluid. It changes at different times of your life for different emotional, psychological, and physiological reasons. Some lucky people's sexuality stays mostly constant through their adult lives, but most people aren't so lucky. 

If you feel that the label of asexual suits you now, that's okay. If you find your libido somewhere down the line, that's okay. If you wake up tomorrow and you are the gayest man who ever lived and want nothing more than to be plugged at both ends every waking second, guess what, that's just as okay. 

Just whatever you do, don't change any aspect of yourself to try and fit a label. While you're at it, don't feel obligated to need a label. And definitely don't feel obligated to a label you've already chosen. It's okay to change, just as okay as it is not to. ","1404173237"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ones with good characters and a good over-all story arc.

[Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/?ref_=sr_1) for drama and [Wonderfalls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361256/?ref_=sr_1) for comedy.

Firefly - Five hundred years in the future, in a distant solar system, a renegade crew aboard a small spacecraft try to survive on the outer rim of the system, taking whatever jobs come their way while evading warring factions, savages, and government agents. No aliens, no faster than light travel, no sound in space, yet every bit as fantastic as anyone could want.

Created by Joss Whedon and Tim Minear, Firefly remains grounded in character driven stories, with a cast you quickly become attached to - full of sympathetic complex characters with interesting back-stories, witty dialog, beautiful imagery, plots exciting and full of sudden 90 degree turns; all interwoven within a compelling story arc which reveals itself, a little at a time, with just the right mix of realism and epic adventure.

Firefly is the poster child for great series cut way too early. [It is the 12th highest rated TV series of all time, and the highest rated Sci-Fi series ever on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=5000,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;title_type=tv_series), despite having been canceled in its first season - and despite some of the most incompetent programming decisions in the history of TV. The Fox executives did not seem to grasp the concept of a story which continued from episode to episode - now the model for most modern TV dramas. Fox played the episodes out of intended order and did not even show the pilot episode until after they had canceled the series.

Watching Firefly before you die ought to be on everyone's bucket-list.

Wonderfalls - Despite graduating from Brown, Jaye Tyler has managed to disappoint both her parent’s and her own expectations. Now avoiding failure by never trying to succeed, she works as an anonymous retail clerk in a Niagara Falls novelty shop, and lives alone in a trailer park. But the thin comfort of intentionally low expectations can not protect her when inanimate animals begin talking to her, telling her what to do, and driving her to distraction until she does as they say. 

Wonderfalls starred the brilliant and beautiful Canadian actress [Caroline Dhavernas](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1445763072/tt0361256). It was created by Bryan Fuller, the creator of Pushing Daisies and Dead Like Me; Todd Holland, director from Malcolm In The Middle; and Tim Minear of Firefly fame (long time Joss Whedon collaborator) who helped produce, direct and write not only for Firefly, but for Angel, Drive, Dollhouse, and Terriers as well.

Wonderfalls, is one of the best comedy series ever made, and one of the most truly unique shows ever on TV, yet almost no one has heard of it, because like Firefly, Wonderfalls was the next to suffer at the tender mercy of Fox's incompetent marketing.

Like they did with Firefly, once again with Wonderfalls, Fox managed to seize defeat from the jaws of victory, by starting the series mid-season with little advertising, and intentionally mislabeling Wonderfalls as a drama instead of a comedy (they did this because they were selling the show to their advertisers as the new Joan of Arcadia). They played the episodes out of order, changed the show time with little reason or notice, and then canceled Wonderfalls after only 4 episodes, without even bothering to show the other 9 episodes they already had made - because again like Firefly, 'Wonderfalls failed to gather a following'.

Like Pushing Daisies, Wonderfalls has tremendous charm, beautiful imagery and a wonderful sense of humor, and like Firefly, Wonderfalls has a great cast, sympathetic characters, brilliant dialog, and plenty of 90 degree plot twists. 

Btw Jewel Staite (Kaylee from Firefly) is a guest star in some of the episodes and Lee Pace (yes the pie-man from Pushing Daisies) is a regular on the series. This is a must watch for Firefly fans and Pushing Daisies fans as well.

And like Firefly, Wonderfalls was canceled by Fox - so you know it had to be good.

"oilandgasworkers","t5_2w8br","I've been a well tester for nearly 8 years and have been supervising for the last 3-4 years now and I enjoy the job a lot. I startyed in the UK north sea and then moved on to west africa.

Some people will write it off as a job for knuckle draggers due to the amount of rig up and the type of equipment. I personally believe that it takes brain and brawn to be a sucesful tester.

One of the best thing things about it is the size of the crew (typically around 10 people for a full package) as you can have a good laugh with your colleagues or not if they are dickheads !

There are several different types of test which all utilise the same equipment but are being performed to achieve different outcomes.
e.g production cleanups, drill stem tests, early production facilities, acid or proppant fracks, bleed offs, and of course the difference between oil and gas wells.

For the first few years it is likely that you will do a lot of rigging up/down and spend your time taking readings of wellhead pressures, temperatures and tank levels.

You will then graduate to running separators and starting to take on elements of crew management. If you are switched on you can start to supervise the whole package after around 5 years.

This will be luck based dependent on the type of jobs you get exposed to, how busy your location is and the career path you follow in your service company.

As you have used field engineer I assume you will be on the graduate path, usually this means you will spend 3-4 years in the field then your company has plans for you in the office. This is not set in stone but seems to be the case for most engineers I know. It is rarer but not impossible for the engineers to end up as well test supervisors.

I think well testing is an excellent introduction to the oil field as you get to see many aspects and work along side many other disciplines.","1404173240"

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","Not really *that* uncommon.  There are a handful of European-origin pistols (like the Spanish-made 1911 clone Star Model B, [a.k.a. Samuel L. Jackson's ""Mister 9mm"" in Pulp Fiction,](http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction#Star_Model_B) being another) that have had a dedicated carry population for decades even in this country.  One part due to the surplus low entry cost, and other parts due to the slim, single stack design and reasonably reliable nature of these rugged semi-auto pistols.  Before baby Glocks and its clones, and M&amp;P Shields and Ruger LCP/9s saturated the CC market, the Makarov was right up there near top for a cheap and reliable semi-auto CC recommendation.  

So if you think about it, the Makarov is a more appropriate choice for CC signage, than say a full-sized Beretta 92 which is what is typically depicted, and likely CC'ed by relatively few people.

I have a Bulgarian Makarov, and I've carried it on occasion.  The only reason I really stopped carrying most of my surplus guns, and started carrying a Glock is because I don't care what happens to the Glock.  They are still being made, and very replaceable.","1404173240"

I'm thinking they may actually be going for a [light field display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwCwtBxZM7g), which is my fondest hope.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; The exemptions are for everyone

No, the exemptions are just for those with religious objections. If I run a company and I don't want to pay for birth control for other reasons I'm shit out of luck. Which raises the question of just how religious do you have to be for the company you've invested in to be able to be exempted from laws? I mean, I went to church Christmas before last...

&gt;and someone else steps in and tells them, ""I have altered the deal.""

Yep, business law (and every other area of law) changes all the time. So what? 

&gt;which forces the people who own/run (?) Hobby Lobby to violate their religious beliefs.

So what? There are people who have religious beliefs that white people are superior to black people. It doesn't mean you can get exempted from laws against discrimination. Look, I'm all for protecting religious freedoms when it only affects you. There is an exemption that you don't have to have health care if it's against your religious beliefs. That's great. I support that. 

But as a business investor your religious beliefs shouldn't trump other people's legal protections. 

&gt;What the hell does hiring you to run my register have to do with health care?

&gt; In RoboCop, the year is 2028 and multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years - and it's meant billions for OmniCorp's bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing\: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This one time in Pakistan back in 2002 my entire family and I had went back as a reunion of sort. My family and I were living in our own home and dad usually slept on the roof (roofs in Pakistan are flat and surrounded by walls). One night, he started freaking out all of a sudden and had blood-shot eyes, blabbering random things. A few days later, he told us that he was a seeing a strange black cat on the roof that was apparently ""shape shifting"" My father does not bullshit around so it was genuine. He said he went inside the bathroom on the roof and heard this loud woosh. He turned around after washing his hand and felt a huge gust of wind rushing towards. My dad said he quickly stepped to the side and the wind hit the wall behind him, and after the wind hit the wall, stains of blood were over the wall. He ran outside and saw a trail of blood all around the roof's wall. The next day we all went up stairs to check it out and the blood was fresh, but it wouldn't come off either. On top of that, he had been rigoursly cleaning his shoes, his clothes, his mattress and his blanket because they seemed ""dirty"" (this was all happening in the middle of the night). Then in 2004 we went back to Pakistan (for my grandfather's funeral) and the stains were still on the wall. 2 years later in 2006 we went back for my uncle's wedding and the stains were STILL there. Only recently my aunt (who lives in that house now) said that they had to scrub for hours with soap to get rid of the stains. This still creeps me out and I get goosebumps everytime I think about it. 

Another recent: I went to Pakistan in September-November and a week before Eid, my uncle and his friend had went to the country side to go buy and bring a bull. He said as he was driving down the road (it was around 8 at night, so it was pretty dark) he looked into his side mirror and saw a face. Then when he came home, my little cousin and her mom (around 2 or 3 years old) went to open the door and my Uncle walked in (my cousins dad), as soon as my little cousin saw my uncle she freaked out and started crying really loud. For two days, she didn't go near my uncle and cried non-stop, especially during sun down. ","1404173246"

"everymanshouldknow","t5_2u82c","&gt;I would argue, though, that they're much harder in newer relationships,

Not the op, but I think you're missing the point.

Confidence is about living for yourself and doing things for yourself. When you're doing a nice thing for someone else, you're still essentially doing it for yourself because it's making you happy.

Assholes seem confident because they're living for themselves. They don't pander to the opinions or wants of other people. Many nice guys are complete pushovers in an attempt to seem ""nice"", which ultimately means sacrificing themselves for other people. In practice, this isn't at all altruistic, because their behavior is attempting to illicit some type of equivalent response (e.g. if I'm super nice to her, she'll fall in love with me).

In a party, hook-up situation, confidence is what gets you to move in for the kiss. You don't worry about whether or not see wants you initially. You want to kiss her, so you make the effort and see if she'll meet you halfway. If she doesn't want to, she'll say ""no"". You can genuinely apologize (if you want) and accept her decision. A nice guy will accept that he won't love everyone and therefore, not everyone will love him, and that's okay. I want to note that a genuine, honest compliment without expecting anything in response is very powerful and moving.

See, at the end of the day, it's about realizing that everyone in the world has a choice. The best I can do is to make my choice and live life as I see fit. I can take my shot and see what the response is and then proceed accordingly. 

Good marriages are the result of two people making a conscious decision and putting in the effort to make each others lives better on a daily basis. It's also about taking the time and making the time to appreciate the effort the other person puts in.","1404173253"

If you don't know anyone who has been accused then you and your friends have been very fortunate. But that doesn't mean that you should be in denial that it happens to other people or be unwilling to have some sympathy for those who find themselves being falsely accused.

I'm not denying that there is always going to be a ""he said; she said"" aspect in sexual assault cases. Obviously it's in a rapist's best interest to try to convince everyone that the sex was consensual.

And he's not really taking responsibility for it by saying its math'a fault, that he couldn't help himself and it just happened and it's karma. Like karma just took over his body to do its work, yeah ok.. Apparently he has banned himself from KOTD which sounds stupid.. 

Eminems rap battle project has apparently lost sponsors because diz is involved, and at the very least this type of shit will cause some potential sponsors of rap battle culture to think twice about it. Not to mention that venue is done now, no more battles there which hurts everyone's pockets and credibility. 

I don't think diz really planned it as a set up, but I'm sure he set everything up in case something were to happen and had the possibility in his mind. I don't really care how much math sucks or how much he dared diz to hit him, he should never have stooped to maths level and brought down the credibility and integrity of KOTD. He didn't really make himself look any tougher, and now they really sound like kids on twitter arguing about how much they did or did not beat each other up, or how many punches they landed when they didn't really do any damage, it's a joke. 

KOTD was becoming the league with the most mainstream potential by far, and there were apparantly even industry people there that had to see that side of things and wind up in the middle of a giant brawl. It just makes it look like battling is not ready to go to the next level.  

And now they want to set up a boxing/cage match? Come on that will be a joke and is making this look even more retarded. Even if they can fight in brawls they are not seasoned mma fighters and it will show if you put them in a sanctioned event. As someone who trained mma for a long time, no matter how tough they are in the street, if you put them in there they will look like fish out of water and embarrassing on video when people are used to the skill of real professionals, it will be like celebrity boxing.","1404173254"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;expect to meet girls

Again, that's the problem.  When you ask about ""girls"", there is no answer.  When you bring up a specific girl, the answer is either apparent, or you shouldn't talk to her.  If you're in a bookstore, and you see a girl browsing the sci fi section, you could recommend a book.  If she's in a class with you, you could talk about the class material and whether she finds it interesting.  If she's walking a dog, you could ask her to pet the dog.  If she's wearing a shirt for a band, you could talk about how you like that band.  Hell, I chatted up a beautiful girl while I was in the dentist office with cotton balls in my mouth and while she was working just by noticing her triforce tattoo and asking her which Zelda game was her favorite.  I mean, yeah, the truth was I felt like if I didn't talk to a girl that pretty, I'd regret it the rest of my life, but the truth also is that I fucking love SNES Zelda and was hoping to find another Link to the Past fan.

It's not about ""what you have to do to attract girls"".  It's about seeing someone, having *genuine* interest, and then acting on it.  It's just that in society, genuine interest is very rare, and romantic comedies and TV shows make it seem a lot mote common and easy to elicit than it really is.  Part of playing Hold 'Em is knowing when the hand is just not doing well enough to warrant meeting a raise *before* you see the flop, if you catch my drift.","1404173256"

My best tips for you would be to learn map control. Play 1v5 bots, then play 1v5 intermediate bots once 1v5 beginner bots gets easy. It will teach you to recognize where the pressure is on the map by forcing you to be the only one who can stop it.

Also, Fire up a game with JUST YOU in it and try to get 100% of the farm coming down the lane. See how many you can get in a row without missing. Reset your count every time you miss. Challenge yourself to see how high you can go.

Additionally, practice seeing which walls you can jump over. I'd recommend playing Nidalee in a bot game by yourself and seeing which walls you can jump over. Any wall you can jump with nid, you can jump with shyvana.

Put yourself in a 1v5 intermediate bot game against the main 5 champs you feel like you can't handle and keep doing it until you can win.

Read up on all the items. You can do this at www.mobafire.com
Learn what items do what and think about which ones you feel you could use best on her. Start theorycrafting your own builds based on what YOU know YOU need.

Play a bot game using only one skill. Get all of your kills with that one skill. Do it with your Q one game, your W another game, and your E the next game. This will teach you to be incredibly efficient with ALL of your skills, rather than constantly relying on your full combo.","1404173261"

On another note anyone can change their IP as most people have dynamic ip addresses, &amp; in rare occasions static IP's are given which can still be changed most of the time. Couple that with an inprivate browser and all you have to do is upvote with a unique ip using a mobile device or your modem(changing your MAC/Restarting modem, you can also change your ip simply by putting your phone in &amp; out of airplane mode most of the time they arent adjacent to your location either as their mobile public/nat network ips).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There's always a party somewhere each night (whether or not you're invited is another question).  If you go to all of them then you'll fail out pretty fast, though.

The biggest thing that I don't see a lot of people mentioning is that you're suddenly given a lot more control over your time.  In high school you have to attend classes for a big block of time each weekday or face truancy penalties.  In College many professors don't even take attendance so whether or not you even go to class is based on whether or not you need to (pro tip:  you need to).  You only have a few hours of actual class each day although the work you'll be expected to do outside of class can be a lot more.  It's common for a class with 3 hours/week of classtime to claim that you should be spending twice that each week working on reading, homework, etc (your mileage will vary).

So yeah, there's a party each night and you can go to it if you think it's wise, but the people who are successful at college are the ones who quickly figure out their time management and know when they do have the time to spend a night partying and when they don't.  Few majors are so strenuous that it is impossible to ever party (although that's not everyone's cup of tea), but few are easy enough that you can party every night and not fail out very quickly.

I have no idea how much news you consume, but pass around the sexual deviant thing happens in schools as well.  Teachers who are accused of sexual harassment or assault have ended up sent packing with a positive recommendation in tow or [forced into non-teaching duties](http://nypost.com/2010/02/14/leazy-6-of-rubber-room/).  It is not easy to remove a teacher and it looks bad to have these allegations, so they are moved or there is some shady agreement.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","No, only immune to criminal prosecution in the country of residence, they still have to report to the authority of the country they are from.  

If they commit a crime it's not handled by regular police and court, they take it to the ministry of foreign affairs who takes it up with his/her peer of the other country.  It can easily spark an international conflict.  If it gets really bad they can be deported for trial back home.  

The only way I used it was twice to get out of traffic tickets and once we (3 friends and I, two of us had these cards) were being arrested for thinking we had drugs (we were talking in the street to people that did) so they let us go with a shrug.  Technically as a son of a diplomat I didn't have diplomatic immunity, but I had a card that said that the government asked the police to collaborate with us and before taking any legal action to please contact the ministry of foreign affairs, and no-one will bother for a misdemeanor, let alone on a friday night.  A friend's dad tried it once by going over a red light right in front of a policeman (the car had special number plates), and this was a military dictatorship (chile in the 80's), and the policeman just stared coldly as he went over.

"duolingo","t5_2t6ze","Not completed the entire tree yet (a little more than halfway) but already I can have simple conversations and understand spoken word -- if spoken slowly -- I still need to process the wordsounds and word order so my comprehension is there but still slow.

I supplement my German study with basically all the websites people mention in the comments. When I don't understand something I go through some of the many thorough explanations there are online, like word order, adjective endings, etc. 

So yeah I'm sticking to it, since for me it seems to be working. I think by the end I'll/you'll have a good comprehension. A thing I have noticed is that my word retention from Duolingo is way better than if I try to learn words independent of it. Maybe its the repetition, I don't know. I don't use memrise. 

At the very least, Duolingo (and particularly the ""streak"" feature) get me in the German mindset. I do a couple lessons and suddenly I'm off on a bunch of websites studying things trying to make it clear. So the ""grind"" may be its highest value. Also my pronunciation is really good and I've been told by native Germans the same, so its good for that.

I can see a few ways you might go about that, but generally the conflict has to be moral in nature - as you say it's hard to establish any credible physical threats to him. Meanwhile, I think watching him tie himself up in knots and angst over things where physical power can't help would actually be interesting if done well.","1404173270"

You don't ask her if she wants to bathe, you inform her that she is going to bathe now.  And if you are female, you help her into the shower, and maybe sit on the toilet seat while she bathes, in case she falls or something, and if you are male, your mom, aunts or sister need to do that.  Or one of the nurses.

I understand that she isn't being cooperative with you guys.  But if she ends up with sores or a rash from being unclean?  I worry that you guys might end up facing ~~adult~~ elderly abuse or neglect charges.  So this is something that needs to happen.

And maybe you can find something that makes bath/shower time fun for her.  Pretty scented soaps, maybe something like a scrubbing hand mitt that makes it easier for her to do a good job.  And with any kind of luck at all (but doubtful), maybe having to clean that mess on her backside will make her not have to want to scrub it again.

Do you have anything to help her shower more easily?  Like maybe a showering chair for in the shower, or one of those shower heads that can be held in her hand, so she can move it around her body, instead of standing there and having to move around it?

The AC4 E3 demo was different to the mission that was in the final game.

In itself, this was eventually to be unsustainable, but the turning point for Germany wasn't until its failed invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa).

Allow me to explain:

A commonly-held view, at least enough that I was taught it in school, is that Germany's major fault was opening a two-front war; until that point, they were performing rather admirably.

The issue wasn't nearly this simple.

/u/vonadler provides [a miraculously well-written comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/29gm5p/mussolini_ended_in_disaster_because_he_always/cikqn5r) which explains somewhat how and why Rommel ended up invading Africa, which is an oft-ignored third front to Germany's war. 

Germany is a country that is somewhat tactically disadvantaged, due to being smack-dab in the middle of Europe. At one point, it was being attacked by primarily [England and the US from the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord), [England, the US, and France from the South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign), and [the Soviet Union from the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Campaign_of_1941%E2%80%931942), and at that point, the war was truly bleak, although unwinnable is probably inaccurate.

I'll focus primarily on the German invasion of Russia.

Operation Barbarossa opened up the largest front in military history, and was the source of 95% of all Wehrmacht casualties from 1941-1944, as well as 65% of all Allied casualties for the entire war. [Germany's capturing of over three million Soviet POWs, and their treatment of them](http://ww2stats.com/pow_ger_okh_aok.html) was probably great fuel for the Soviet atrocities that occurred in the back half of their counter-offensive. 

Germany got all the way to Moscow, and could see the spires of the Kremlin, but they took too long. Even though the operation started on 22 June, but the Germans were only within fifteen miles of Moscow by 2 December, wherein, after already having incurred 620,000 wounded and 210,000 dead, Germany was caught by the infamous Russian winter.

Hitler himself would later blame Mussolini's bungling of Greece (and subsequent opening of a third front for Germany) for the Reich's defeat, but in all honesty, it was the losing several million men (4.3 million, by the most recent estimate, though I failed to find a citation for it) that really didn't help him. 

**EDIT:** I just re-read how disjointed this comment is, and in part, that's due to how many moving pieces are in this question. You have to consider a list including but not limited to:

- The United States relative to fighting its own two-front war, both militarily, tactically, and how its own public opinion shaped performance
- The UK after the Battle of Britain, again fighting its own two-front offensive (Africa and France)
- Free France
- The fall of Italy
- Internal politics of Europe as Hitler took direct control of countries, rather than allowing them to be satellites
- The Soviet Union and its own mobilization to launch its counter-offensive
- Germany's crumbling military-industrial complex between the Ardennes offensive and losing Berlin

The list only continues. This is, as I said, not a very easy question to answer.","1404173275"

I agree with those who say that he'll need to stop for his own reasons.  That said, my recovery was spurred by being found out by my partner.  All she did was be clear/honest with me about how she felt.  You must continue to be honest with him about how it makes you feel.  Focus on your emotions, and stay away from claims he can refute, like it being wrong, disgusting, inherently hurtful or mean, etc., even if you believe them.  The fallout from being found out was what gave me extra motivation to take things seriously and seek help instead of just continuing to hide my behavior, and put off making a change.  I had my own reasons for wanting to quit too, but I was in conflict about it, as most addicts are before they make attempts at recovery.  Of course, if any one of a thousand things had been different, it all could have gone very differently.  There's only so much control you have over the situation, especially as the partner. I know that sucks, and I'm really sorry.  Here's what I think you can do: communicate your feelings, make requests, give him information, and let him know you want the two of you to be on the same side and have the two of you agree on the same goals for the relationship.

You may want to try couples counseling.  My personal opinion is that it sounds like there's not actually anything particularly abnormal going on with either of you.  I'm just suggesting it because you're two human beings dealing with something that's so tough to sort through, and it's one that many couples never do.

By the way, addiction vs not addiction is not a black and white line, in my opinion, and it's definitely not defined by frequency. My therapist doesn't apply the word addict to me, but I've relied heavily on addiction-related resources and definitely misused/abused pornography to the detriment of my own well-being and the health of my relationship(s).  It's not particularly useful to me to try and answer the question of whether or not I'm a ""true addict.""  All that matters is I found myself wanting to change something and decided that drawing on various external sources of support and information was the smart way to make that change.

You are the one that said it requires a degree to get a good job. (at least I think) The reason working towards a degree is not the same as working towards a job is that once you complete your goal you end up with a degree and not necessarily a job. If it was working towards a job you would in the end be given a job. That isn't how this works. Not to mention you say ""You go to a university to get a job in your field of study."" Most people don't have a job in their field of study unless it is a masters or higher. That is reality. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean you have to have the ideal job to go with it. In fact you really shouldn't even expect to get a job within your degree. Degrees tend to be markers of an achievement, and not markers of achievement within X field of study. Your logic seems to be based on some sort of idealistic life. 


&gt; Who would choose to ignore education that would lead to making more money be a choice? Unless your a monk I doubt that going to university isn't appealing. The point is to NOT work in fields like labor or low wage jobs.

Where did I say ignore education? Remember we aren't talking about getting an education. We are talking about taking a loan, putting your self in debt, and potentially not having a job just to get an education. There are tons of options as opposed to doing this right out of highschool. You could get a job for one, and who knows maybe that will turn out to be better in 4 years rather than in the field of study you would have chosen. You could start with a community college. Most are super cheap in comparison to any University. 


The bottom line being the scenario you have described here is hardly your only option and a degree in X field of study doesn't mean you have to get a job in that field. In this reality we call life you can't possibly expect to get everything you want exactly the way you want it. That just sets you up for massive disappointment. That is one of the main reason our generation is often referred to as the entitled generation. Most of us want things given to us exactly the way we expect them to be given to us.(e.g. highschool-&gt;college-&gt;degree-&gt;job-&gt;profit)","1404173279"

[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/unemployment-college-graduates-majors_n_3462712.html#slide=2567551) report is more than a year old, and says that unemployment out of college was less than 8%. LESS THAN 8%. Things have gotten better since then, and even within those bounds this is only a little above frictional unemployment, which is especially remarkable considering these workers have the least to offer companies out of all of the potential workforce. Things aren't terrible. I'm sorry for the people who are struggling. But pretending there aren't opportunities out there is just ridiculous. 

People clearly are finding jobs. They might not be ideal jobs, but they're jobs. Keep your head up, keep growing your network, resume, and personal skills, and it'll all be ok. Just don't let yourself go down the path of despair that is thinking you never had a chance.

Power level seems a bit hit, but not bad. No one's going to be putting this in a deck for just the scry ability so it'll only slot into an agressibe that wants a 3/1 with haste. The Scry 4 when it becomes outclassed is a great way to find some reach in your deck to do the last few points of damage.

My major concern is the feel bad problem of when the correct choice is to trade this off in combat meaning that you can't sac it for the scry 4. I realize that the fact that it doesn't always Scry 4 is what keeps the power level sane (making it a death trigger would probably be too much), but it still leads to tough decisions.

Overall, I like the flavor and execution even if I think Wizards would shy away from Scry 4 and away from a self sacrifice ability that doesn't cost mana or require tapping.","1404173281"
"depression","t5_2qqqf","I just... I just don't know what I would like to do.  Nothing has ever truly made me ""happy"".  I have tried everything over the years and I always felt empty and hollow.  I work hard and do my best in whatever I try, usually but not always succeeding, but its just keeping at it without feeling this gaping emptiness surrounding it all.   And I can mask it, and hide it, or just try to ignore it.  And sometimes I feel flashes like I could see myself doing something and then its gone again.  

I just don't know what to look forward to.  I just don't know if there is anything to even look forward at.  Even if I had a direction, and I could see a hint of a path that I could walk, that would be enough I think, but even now, I can't even imagine that.   And I know a lot of this is my fault for not being happy with who I am. And no one wants to be with someone, not in a friendship or romantic capacity with someone who doesn't even like themselves.  

I just keep looking for meaning.  I took a cheap trip for a couple days.  Went hiking alone, and I never do that.  Tried to feel at home in the nature and the wilderness. I walked quietly as I could trying to just feel part of the world.   And all I could think of was how wonderful this WOULD be if I were sharing it with someone, not how wonderful it was that I was here.

A lot of what I saw was more self-improvement stuff.  For example, the top two posts right *now*, are:

[A top ten of some TED talks](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/29hco6/these_are_the_10_ted_talks_every_aspiring_seducer/)
...which lists some TED talks about having better posture, getting motivated, being a leader, overcoming fear, having self-confidence... etc. etc.

and the #2 post is

[Some seriously shy guy talking about how he finally got the nerve to talk to a girl he thought was cute, at some church function](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/29fy20/fr_finally_went_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and/)... which focuses on overcoming his AA (approach anxiety).

I think maybe you were just paying attention to the lame posts about pickup routines or negging, and not noticing that there is much there about self-improvement and to educate guys who simply have no idea how to interact with women in any other way that is not platonic.  And trust me, there are a lot of guys who simply have no idea how to approach or talk to girls at all.  Guys who never had a father figure, guys who just got addicted to porn, just shy guys in general...  there are a lot of ""nice guys"" there who are just frustrated because they're never had any success with women.

"BSG","t5_2qlvu","Loved this episode! A few notes on the events.

* I don't know why, but I love ""suiting up"" scenes and Starbuck's is no different. They always get me excited for what's about to happen next.

* *Love* the visual effects this episode, they're absolutely gorgeous. A few examples: the reflection of the battle in Lee's helmet; the Battlestars firing on the Baseships; vipers destroying the Resurrection Ship; Basestars exploding never gets old.

* Love the shot showing Lee's POV of the battle. RDM talks about the inspiration from for this, which is really fascinating, but I forget what it was at the moment.

* A few subtle moments I loved: Dee's nod to Adama upon hearing Lee is okay; In the background, Tigh and Adama shake hands after the battle;  Adama touching his scar. Not so subtle, but I love callbacks like this. They're reminders that events have lasting affects; Cain's quick  gasp just before Gina shoots her. Michelle Forbes FTW!

* Lots of great, quiet scenes this episode. I love the way Adama and Roslin's conversation acts as a nice, contrasting bookend to their previous conversation for this two parter.

* I loved the edit that jumps straight from Sharon's speech to Adama and directly into battle. Glad they made that editing choice as it was  very effective.

* ""Take your posts."" That might've been the scariest and tense moment of the episode for me.

* Roslin and Adama kiss!

* Adama becomes admiral! I came to the series at the beginning of season three when it originally aired, so I always knew Adama as Admiral, not Commander. When I went back and watched from the beginning, one of the biggest questions I had was how he became Admiral Adama. Here we get the answer, bloody as it may be.

* Lastly, this is something I'll probably bring up later this season, but I think Gina may be my favorite iteration of Number Six. I think she's easily the most complex, different, and sympathetic of her model line and really allowed Tricia Helfer to stretch her muscles as an actress.

"Diablo3Barbarians","t5_2w19t","Right off the bat, the first thing I would do is switch your main-hand to your Thunderfury. This will provide you HoTA a little more oomf as the weapon damage of a sword is higher than the weapon damage of a dagger. Also re-rolling your RoRG to Crit Chance instead of Crit Damage might help get you closer to the generally desired 1:10 CC:CD ratio people use. {edited to 1:10 CC:CD}

Another thing that would help, if you're able, is to craft a few Devastators. This is a mace that rolls +% fire damage which will give your fire attacks a lot more damage than the dagger you're currently using.

By no means do I have a really good Barb, but a build I've had a lot of fun with is combining 4 piece IK and 4 piece Might of the Earth sets. It's a really fun fire build that lets you leap around the battle field doing a lot of damage with Earthquake. I'm able to do T5 pretty easily and if you utilize Rift it Forward (I can explain if needed) you should be able to get enough Blood Shards to gamble the necessary set pieces you need pretty quickly. 

Here's a link to my profile so you can check out the pieces you need to utilize the hybrid set. http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Gurudeva-1175/hero/32145486

Really? No need to explain it to you while you acknowledge that it's a vital service yet question why it's being done? And you pose this question from a business standpoint? Actually, from a business standpoint, it's outrageous that PP should be strong armed into discontinuing this type of service when there is a demand, however small. Also, some businesses have missions. PP provides a legal service. However contentious the discussion about that service is, PP isn't just an alliterative name: It's a concept and the mission of the company which means they will offer all health care options pertinent to that mission.","1404173291"

"NewOrleans","t5_2qhp5","FWIW - I have been in New Orleans for 3 Mardi Gras seasons. Based on my experience, Treme (despite its faults) got a *lot* of the right feel for the city. I think it just scratches the surface of many different issues, but doesn't get very deep into any of them. Thinking of it as ""a brief intro to New Orleans"" might be helpful.


Mardi Gras bookings should be made ""as early as possible, that you won't have to cancel later when someone backs out."" Call the hotel today if you can commit. Not because you can get a better deal (you really can't - hotels are already 2x or 3x as much … they know when Mardi Gras is and plan rates accordingly) but because you'll have more selection and options. (e.g. getting 2 King and 2 double-Queen rooms in the same hotel) Of course if you wait until January, you're totally screwed, so don't wait longer than you must.

If you have relatives within walking or biking distance of what you want to do, that wouldn't mind you &amp; your friends crashing there, that's really ideal. (aka cheapest) But if you're going to have to get in a car (drive, carpool, or cab) from there I would recommend biting the bullet and getting a hotel.

1.  Bigotry does not require oppression.  

2.  It does not require a superiority complex, even those the OP does display this complex with this post.  I am superior to most who live in the Bible Belt.  That is what he is saying.

3.  There is intolerance in this post. Only stupid people in the Bible Belt would believe stuff like this.  It is horrible that I have to live here with these ignorant people. 

&gt;""I live in this region of America and look at what the fuck I found""

No its not.  

It is I live in a religious(Christian) area of American and the fucking idiots down here do shit like this.  I wish I lived somewhere else.


For your education:  The Definition of bigotry.

big·ot noun \ˈbi-gət\
: a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. : a bigoted person; especially : a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)


Hmmmm.


So all you really need is to dislike someone because of their beliefs.

This is what the OP did.



&gt;Then it wouldn't be like saying ""I sure do love living in Alabama"", it would be saying ""I sure do love living in Alabama""

You really do not understand do you.  I was saying if it was like that he would have said that.  He didnt say that so it wasn't like that.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Firstly yes, every country in the Worlds has LAN centre's with the games on them where you can go play your favourite games hell even Britain, now its not that ""Oh! They pay Riot just to have League installed"" that would be ridiculous. What the owners of these cafe's pay for are the right to have all of the champions unlocked so no Grinding iP for that new 6300 champ, they are all there, they also obtain a 20% Ip boost that is what they pay for I do believe this is exclusive to Korea and most the player base use this so that is a rather large revenue on its own to add.

And yes the biggest Market on the Planet once again population doesn't mean everything. Yeah you can have more people playing that is all well and good but growth of a region won't come in and as much as you keep going on about saying well to bluntly put it, ""Fuck having skill, Just play the game, Riot don't care if your Bronze Or High Challenger aslong as you play the game"" No Riot actually want this thing called growth, where the players get better and the team games become closer and more appealing to watch like the OGN is, its very good and entertaining. Whereas sometimes on the LCS its rather stale and people cheer for menial things like wards, no they want to promote teams improving because then spectators enjoy more. The thing you seem to completely and reputably toss aside constantly is the fact that its also what is called a ""Spectator Sport"" where people who otherwise don't play League of Legends will sit and watch it and enjoy it. Now are they going to watch some piss poor team play a 50 minute game where they are scared to push? No.

I never in the slightest attacked your damn character, you either misread what I said or ignored what I said so you were abrupt, rude and plain negligent to what was said, you moaned about oh they got nothing for winning, they got the same as Korea that was my bloody point, instead you what, ""History means nothing"" which I then say actually it does for you now to state I am attacking your character and try to crudely insult me by targeting actions rather than actually say the word you. And you have not once provided evidence, the closest you have came to that is, Oh I was in Asia I seen this. Bravo to you.

One of the reasons League of Legends is so successful and the rise in the numbers playing is the fact it has a goal and something you feel you can achieve as well as the fact it is extremely rewarding to play and learn. There have been countless times I have seen Either Pro players talking about it or some post on Reddit about being careful about wanting to try to be a Pro player, heck this subreddit has been swarmed recently with info on League of Legends scholarship all this aiming to being at the higher tier of League not just your average Joe playing for fun. And your clear distaste for Korea is biasing almost all of what you are typing. And Riot clearly do care if Korea hold all the talent that is why they got it classified as a Sport to allow these Visa's for players to play under the teams otherwise you wouldn't have Cross Region Transfers like Dexter to CLG or Seraph for that matter if they didn't care about this then it would never of had this pushed so early on. In regards to Singapore and Taiwan deserving an investment? If that is the case they should do a nonstop world tour since we all deserve some investments and tournaments, should we tour around every country that any Pro player who competed in WCS has came from is that a fair way of looking at it? No, its stupid and it promotes a ridiculous standard for the teams and players. 

Now unlike with any other sport League when the players practise it is very difficult to prepare for X amount of teams in a short amount of time as discussed in length on Summoning Insight by MonteCristo now yeah you hate Korea pretty damn apparent but this might be a bitter pill for you but guess what?  They outclass every team in the rest of the World on Strategy, not mechanics necessarily but as a team they move as one and do it well other regions don't simply put. That is why they are regarded as the best so compare them to all the other regions and games you like they are the best at this game. Now in regards to the point I said earlier as much as you might not like it SEA challenger is nothing in comparison to Other regions, challenger players even seen in All Stars when Toyz played don't get me wrong not a bad player, but mechanically couldn't keep up with the likes of Bjerg and Froggen. So why promote so much in a region where to be blunt the skill won't grow and the influx of players you might attract to start the game which already has the issue of new players find it extremely difficult to start league due to how established it already is, it kinda seems pointless and short sighted. Whereas say giving Korea exactly what was wanted and what hell they were told in the first place regardless of how you try to manipulate wording was Korea promised to host ""Part of the World Championships"" No. Were they promised to host it in part with other countries? No. So what, give you the idea that because Riot are the owners they can change it? And that it is okay. That is never how things have ever worked its the reason you have things known as Lawyers, because companies who don't specify shit like this usually are persecuted, unless they have some loopholes in the contract they put inplace now, which by the sounds of this was never Korea and someone else hosting the event it was exclusive which is why the uproar regardless of how you try to dull down or manipulate the interpretation of Riots statement. And you also have just stated you dislike KeSPA meaning more Bias over clearly an extreme amount of Bias, because the actions of one previous man in charge of a company or such then you have to treat the company at that standard? Well that isn't how the world works otherwise these things known as World Wars would of had the world not treat with countries before due to the person running them being a bit of a dick as maybe the last person of KeSPA was. The fact is KeSPA is actually not in the wrong here and your points laced heavily in Bias and distaste for Korea really is taking away from the point of the entire bloody thing I posted. Instead your attacking myself and Korea as a whole rather than what I initially said.


Riot never stated that it was a Joint even, a shared event, or that Korea was hosting only part of the event. Now yes you can argue that they never said they were hosting the full even either but it doesn't work that way as ""You get to host The World Championships"" is taken and seen as the full thing. Its like me saying to someone ""I shall take you for Dinner"" and then when we get there and I meant Oh you get a lift there but you are paying. I never stated that and going on what I said you thought you were getting Dinner and not just a lift, sure you can moan at how I worded it or such but it still stands what I said was pretty clear the fact is I wasn't clear enough in my message or that I just decided to change my mind, either of which is not appropriate and shouldn't of happened regardless and is my fault for not saying such as it is with Riot.","1404173293"

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Not photoshopped. On the far left there were two main camps when it came to how to approach the situation in Ukraine. This side, generally made up of your classic Marxist-Leninist/Maoist/Stalinist/USSR went downhill after Khrushchev types, jumped straight in to support anyone who opposes the US/EU under anti-fascist/anti-imperialist grounds while insisting that Russia technically isn't imperialist so it's all okay. These people are not the majority on the left I don't think but people focus on them a bit too much. They tend to be lefty conspiracy theory types that don't trust the bourgeois media and watch too much Russia today and support Assad. At least they tend to group together and stay irrelevant in the corner.

The other more sensible camp, generally made up of Trotskyists and other anti-Stalinist types, take the stance of Russia being close enough to being imperialist to not be supported but also not support EU/US involvement. They basically want everyone to get out of Ukraine and let them sort out their issues themselves. They also don't like the fascists in Ukraine, while understanding that they are not running the place. Ukraine does have a more acute fascism problem than most European countries and they should be dealt with rather than risk letting them grow. The tactics on the ground for this camp is to protest against your side getting involved in Ukraine while your sister organisations on the other side do the same as small European parties shouting at the Russian government and vice versa won't get much done. It's kind of similar to the anti-war movement in WWI and like that movement each side will accuse the protesters of supporting the other side. The main Russian socialist groups in this camp are heavily involved in the Russian LGBT movement too.

OR... The episode where Arin is in the Boo Casino and he can't find out what to do, and after a long-ass time figures it out and get all relieved, only to find that the exit leads to one of those levels where his Flud is stolen and he;d in an obstacle course, which leads him exclaiming, ""AND one of these!?""

I'm also fond of when he has to climb that big scaffolding thing in the bay area and clouds keep knocking him off. Really, when Arin or Dan or Jon are at their most frustrated/annoyed is when I find them funniest. It's why I'd rather they *not* play a game ahead of time. A good example of what I mean is like when Danny got, like, 46 ""Lose a Turns"" in Wheel of Fortune.

**Edit**: Also look at the Nickelodeon Guts episode with Jon and Arin. During the bungee-jump-basketball, they get legitimately heated/pissed at each other.

No, I don't. And I'm well aware of the implications of nihilism.  
Nihilism makes no claims to *subjective* value or meaning.  In other words, nothing about nihilism precludes you from finding value or meaning in a flower, friends, books, skydiving or anything else in life.  
It simply makes the observation that there is no grand plan of the universe.  
Nihilism (at least the mainstream edition) states that life, the universe and everything has no *intrinsic* meaning or value.

While I don't disagree that this is where people flock to religion, I simply, personally, fail to grasp the logic of such behavior.  


But fuck do I enjoy my garden. I've got a mean green thumb, colored by nihilism, enjoyment and enthusiasm.

Firstly, what is meant by ""millennial atheism"" as opposed to just atheism?

Couldn't find anything on Google about ""millennial atheism"".  If it's not on Google, it can't be that widespread a notion.  So my guess is that this is a term invented by a very small group. 

I don't see the usefulness of inventing a category, ""millennial atheists"", that atheists don't use themselves.  If you want to argue with something Dawkins said, just argue your case.  Don't vilify your opponents.

Edit:  Also, as has been said, if ""millennial atheism"" is just another name for atheism, the ideas advanced are all bunk.  And if something else is meant by ""millennial atheism"", you have to start by proving it exists in some tangible form, which it doesn't, IMO.

That being said, your build looks fine. You need to be really careful playing this build. Your very early game is fine (before first back) and this is where you want actual fights. After this, due to you getting a tear and the enemy  getting more damage, you'll probably start losing trades. Play safe, farm at turret.

Mid game is where blue ez really starts to shine. You lack dueling power, but with the hugely reduced cooldown on his E and constant Q -&gt; Iceborn procs, you have huge kiting power. If you play it well, you can duel other ADCs by juking skillshots and staying near max Q range to dish out damage while staying safe.

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","Well first off, there have been multiple deaths of children or pets because their parent/owner have locked them in the car with no AC or windows cracked. I worked a scene in which a child died after being locked in his mothers SUV for 3 hours. So from my perspective, if you can't run an errand without leaving your kid/pet in the car than you need to reevaluate your parenting skills or roll as a pet owner. If I am unable to make contact with the parent/owner than I will smash the window of the car to save that child/pets life if it is in danger, that is my job and my oath. If I make contact than either a warning or arrest is made. I myself do not have kids, but situations like this make my blood boil. I will take the report, photograph the incident if needed and I will fight it out with the parent/owner in court. I will remain 100% professional but will have no sympathy towards a parent who leaves their child in the car and I will tell them the consequences of what could have happened if I did not make it their in time. Now sometimes parents lock their keys and child in the car on accident, that is an understandable mistake. I have had it happen before, but their is no excuse for locking your child in the car on purpose or leaving them in there for a long period of time. Where I am it gets hot quickly and I for one could not sit in a vehicle where I live without and AC on. ","1404173304"

That would be very a very bad foundation for international relationships.

What the host country instead says is ""We trust that your people will behave themselves.  We will not punish crimes without your consent.""

This agreement (and other details) is the [Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations).  Wikipedia summarizes diplomatic immunity as:

&gt; Article 29. Diplomats must not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. They are immune from civil or criminal prosecution, though the sending country may waive this right under Article 32. Under Article 34, they are exempt from most taxes, and under Article 36 they are exempt from most customs duties.

The host has the right to kick people out if they really misbehave.

&gt; Article 9. The host nation at any time and for any reason can declare a particular member of the diplomatic staff to be persona non grata. The sending state must recall this person within a reasonable period of time, or otherwise this person may lose their diplomatic immunity.

For the most part, this works.  Except, [UN representatives have a reputation for not paying NYC parking tickets](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/24/uk-un-fines-newyork-idUSLNE78N00D20110924) that really pisses off the city government.","1404173305"

The other method used for inflation, calculated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) where they look at what people are actually spending their money on, build a basket of goods to represent the average families expenditures for a month, and then check to see how that changes over time.

"DrugNerds","t5_2sk32","Yes you're understanding of DNP is correct.  It disrupts the proton gradient established by mitochondria across the mitochondrial membrane.  As protons flow across the gradient they pass through a protein called ATP synthase, which couples phosphorus and ADP using the energy from the flow of these protons.  DNP allows the protons to flow back across the membrane without passing through ATP synthase.  Overall this means less efficiency and more energy (food) must be consumed to get the same amount of ATP.

A few years ago a guy wrote a book about DNP (99% sure it was called Illegally Thin, I can't remember the author's name), making all sorts of claims about why DNP was banned by the FDA.  I think his main concern was that pharmaceutical companies had a lot to lose if DNP could safely be used as a weight-loss supplement, and therefore bribed the FDA to ban it.  Whether that's true or not, there have been deaths associated with the use of, or accidental exposure to, DNP.  All that excess energy has to go somewhere, and as you already stated, it's heat.  An unstoppable fever basically killing you at a cellular level from the inside doesn't sound very pleasant to me.

If you're thinking about using DNP, make sure you start with an extremely low dose.  In one study, 1mg per kg of body weight led to a 12% increase in metabolic rate for 24 hours.  No one has really researched the long-term effects of DNP use, even at low doses.  If you're going to use it, you're going to be a guinea pig along with a lot of bodybuilders in finding out what those long-term effects may or may not be.

Source:  I wrote a short somewhat informal paper about its use for one of my classes.  If you're interested in reading the rest of the paper (which probably has more useful information and actual citations), let me know and I'll send it to you.","1404173307"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","More and more as I read articles and opinions like these I become sympathetic to Marxism.

It seems like if this guy is trying to rebuild Marxism without realizing that it already exists. I think if he read much by Marx or any influential communist then he'd either have a lot of his questions answered or would refine them and ask better ones, and he wouldn't be so idealistic about it.

&gt; ... What is needed is some sort of interim-, or proto-post scarcity economics.

We have that now

&gt; Then we have the centrally planned systems of Communism and Marxism, not particularly effective, as it turns out.

what

&gt; ... I’ll listen to them again when our schools are decent and our life span starts increasing again magically.

'Natural' lifespan is pretty close to hitting it's peak. A great majority of the increase comes from clean drinking water, enough food to eat, and sanitary living conditions, after that it sort of levels off and stop increasing. There are other valid criticisms of what he was criticizing though and beyond that one point he was pretty much right so I'm being petty.

&gt; ... The key here, to me, is to start thinking about how economics would work when we decouple labor from reward. Does that make a system inherently communist?

Better questions: Why is labour coupled with reward? If we didn't want to be the case, how would we do that? The ""well what if society magically organized and did it this way itself"" is idealism.

&gt; ... It’s not a matter of scarcity; it’s a matter of the organization of labor and capital.

People have known this for a long time.

&gt; ... what if, one day, technology reaches the point that a small number of humans — say, 10 million — can produce all of the food, shelter and energy that the race needs. ... Everyone’s fed and housed and tons of people simply don’t need to work. Right now, we have them working making shit we don’t need. Is that any better than them not working?

Yes, it is for the people who own the machinery that allows society to provide for everyone with 10 million labourers. They own it, why would they give it up? They have social control because they control all of the food and luxury of the world, they can make everyone else do what they want.

If that situation spontaneously appeared now, our existing legal system says that they own it, so they don't have to give the output to everyone else, and it's in their favour to keep everyone working, even if that just means building statues honouring them. 

Historically, ruling classes haven't voluntarily given up power and control, people have taken it from them, so I imagine that that's what would happen. Then they would establish a new legal system that significantly changes private property rights to mean that you can have private property except when it means that someone isn't fed/clothed/cared for (at this point I'm being very speculative but you get what I'm saying).

&gt; ... I give you we’re in some fringe areas of economics here, but I have always wondered: is there any economic proof that we need full employment to reach full satisfaction of needs?

No

&gt; ... Yes yes, of course. We all know that. The problem seems to me that the minute we leave capitalism behind, we only look at the past alternatives of communism, marxism and pure socialism and pooh pooh them.

Except that we don't

&gt; ... Then I got to thinking. Screw the dodgy world of heterodox economics. Let’s go full-on fantastical and look at sci-fi. There IS actually a model out there that deals fairly realistically with a post scarcity economy.

That, and all of the heterodox theory-making he just criticised, is called  idealism. It has serious flaws because it's detached from reality. If they have a solid plan of action of how to implement it, then great, go for it, if it's ""what if we all just held hands"" then it doesn't really work.

A lot of the time when the author said communism, I think they meant socialism. It was a centrally-planned intermediary stage that was supposed to lead to communism. He's basically also trying to figure out how to get to communism, but I understand if people want to call it something other than communism. He's doing it in an idealistic way though, it's ignoring why things are the way they are. If you ignore that then it's hard to make any real progress. It's also hard to make any real progress if you ignore how to get to the idealistic system that you describe. How to get there is a much bigger issue than trying to imagine a system that works.","1404173313"

Another factor is that quality video producers often don't go out of their way to tell users to Like Comment and Subscribe but really this is the most effective way to compel viewers to do so, desperate as it may seem.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","There's 2 arguments at work here. One is that she's still attracted to you enough that she wants to fuck you, which is great. The other is that she is indeed trying to put you into her schedule, which is good in the short term but dangerous over the long run as she gets the idea that she can use her pussy to get you to do what she wants.

I'd recommend not doing it when she plays this game, to enforce the idea that sex happens on your time and that she can't control you with pussy. Turning down sex a couple times should kickstart her being more receptive to when you want it. 

Another option is not to just ask about sex, but really assert it (read the Sex God Method for ideas). Tell her in no uncertain terms you will be fucking her, and her other shit can wait. Works wonders, especially if she's got a submissive streak in her (which, as it turns out, a lot of women do).

Give both a try, see which one works best for your situation.

Many help your body recover faster. This allows players not only to come back faster from injuries in some cases, but means muscles that are intentionally damaged through exercises like resistance training, recover faster allowing them to worker harder and more frequently than they would otherwise.

There's also other PEDs

Stimulants like Adderall for example, that would allow players to focus better which could easily be used to improve the mental side of their game by a larger magnitude as well as increase their metabolism helping them get leaner. They also can increase aggression and reduce fatigue.

Painkillers can allow them to push harder and longer as well as allow them to be less affected by the in practice and in game physical aspects of the game. For example, what good is a big hit on someone if they don't even feel it and get back up and felling no different than if they were arm tackled. It also just allows them to push past their would-be normal pain thresholds. Some also increase blood flow and thus oxygen delivery to muscle tissue.

Sedatives can be used by players to not feel intimidated or nervous 

TL;DR - Their are other kinda of PEDs than just the kind you are thinking of and they, as well as the ones you are thinking of, can provide significant short term benefits ","1404173316"

Speaking of insane,  if you have an untreated mental illness that could potentially put your child at risk of harm then CPS can absolutely ask you to get help or to put your child with someone who can make sure your child will be safe.

&gt;Both types of IUDs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The copper IUD releases copper into the uterus, which works as a spermicide. The Mirena releases a form of the hormone progestin (levonorgestrel) into the uterus. The progestin thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm can't reach the egg and may keep some women from ovulating.

&gt;In the unlikely event that an egg does get fertilized and survives, both IUDs cause inflammation in the uterus that makes it harder for the egg to implant there.

&gt;Depending upon where you are in your cycle, Plan B One-Step may work in one of these ways:

&gt;It may prevent or delay ovulation.

&gt;It may interfere with fertilization of an egg.

&gt;It is also possible that this type of emergency birth control prevents implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus by altering its lining.","1404173320"

"japan","t5_2qh2u","&gt;  that's a technical term. 

It's a highly subjective buzzword that people like yourself like to throw around.

The bottom line is that almost every country in the world has the kind of constitutional interpretation of defense that is now being discussed in Japan. 

You seem to be referring to the United States as a country that engages in ""wars of aggression.""  The most questionable of America's most recent wars was the Iraq War, and despite having a [huge number of allies](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_are_allies_of_the_United_States), only a handful of allied nations contributed combat troops.  

America has many allies who have less constitutional restraints than Japan.  If Japan brings itself into line with global norms on constitutional interpretations of defense, it does not mean that Japan is seeking to participate in wars of aggression.  

It just means that Japan, if asked to contribute combat troops for a questionable American war, will no longer be able to hide behind its constitution.  It will have to do what America's other Allies do all the time: come up with other reasons not to participate in the war.  ","1404173321"

For as long as I can remember, I've always been the type of person who, when wants to go to sleep, does so, and stays that way despite distraction. I've always chalked that up to my extremely clear conscious. As far as talking in my sleep, moving and thrashing about, or ending up in strange locations, never once has that happened until the dream previously described, and to my knowledge, never once has it happened since. I dated and lived with one of my ex-girlfriends for nearly six years, and not once did she EVER mention my sleep behaviors. So I always assumed there were none. This dream, though. It felt SO real. More so than any I have had both prior to, as well as after the fact.

I do however, have the ability to continue a dream after having woken up from it. Regardless of whether I want to. Sometimes it works out well. Others, well... other times I simply fear falling back to sleep. I won't lie... I hide it rather well in public, but mentally, there's a LOT of shit wrong with me.","1404173325"

"wow","t5_2qio8","Arms had always been a game of wack-a-mole for a while.

It was difficult from TBC to part of WotLK (I think Ulduar?). Slam would stop your swing timer, which meant you couldn't generate rage from auto-attacks (white damage). To play efficiently you had to have a SwingTimer addon and hit slam with 1.5s left on the timer so that both Slam and Auto Attack went off at the same time or you would lose a significant amount of rage generation. While being able to keep your rotation and situational awareness of the raid. Trying to balance all three with changes to weapon speeds bases on haste procs and Blood Lust's etc... required LOTS of practice.

For the most part though, your rotation was based around  keeping Rend up for bleeds and smashing Mortal Strike, Overpower, Execute every cooldown. Fairly easy for PvP. Eventually trying to cram everything into Colossus Smash window. Saving Heroic Strike for when you had more than &gt;60 rage at any time.

During Cataclysm, stance dancing and macros became a must for almost every ability. It was what made good warriors Great, and casual players terrible. There was a very clear difference in peoples abilities to play the class. And Blizzard decided it was too hard for a mass amount of players, so they removed most of all the stance dancing requirements.

Arms is difficult because it is always HIGHLY dependent on the weapons top end damage. Either you have amazing gear and clearly outscale everyone by late expansion, or were laughed at every new tier until you could catch up. It was also dependent on your Armor Penetration % for a while.

Although while gearing up or leveling Arms was superior because of the lack of expertise and hit needed to not miss with your offhand weapons.

Trying to level as Fury would result in Miss-Miss-Miss-Dodge-Parry if you attacked enemies +2 higher than yourself. Not to mention needing a second weapon that was often being bid by other players unless you had BoA's.","1404173329"
"politics","t5_2cneq","You can look at each one of these union hurting measures (like today's decision or right to work, etc) as a single minor thing or like you do with your worries about gun rights, you could see every new rule as a slippery slope.

Now, I look at what the right has been saying about unions and government the last 45 years or so with their starve the beast tactics and IMHO, that leads me to believe that they want to destroy unions all the way.  And what all these tiny attacks on government and unions are doing, like the gun laws have done to the 2A supporters, they are creating a backlash of prounion and government program support that will grow those programs and those unions in the future.

So yes, each one of these decision or new laws is an attempt to forbid unions and whether that is true or not, these overreaches are creating a new era of push back that will result in the opposite.  I could literally see stronger unions, consumer unions, universal income and other things come about because these folks (SCOTUS, right wing) went too far.","1404173329"

Circlejerks aren't good for anyone except those involved in the circlejerk. Taking arguments developed inside one and trying to apply them in real-world situations results in embarrassingly defeats, because there's no evolutionary pressure on the arguments - everyone just agrees with each other and silently downvotes any dissenting opinion, so the scenario results in a logical cul-de-sac. 

Like, yes, there are very well-established arguments as to why News Corp are an evil empire pulling the strings of a puppet Coalition government along with the mining lobby and the US Government.

There are lot of things SCOTUS could do to create more freedom/less government intervention in the healthcare system, but they don't look like this.  A ruling like this implicitly accepts and supports the fully-controlled system we have now.","1404173331"

Its not the word possible, Its what you introduce as possible for the actions taken. Now what you said under the possible is: 

""its possible that even after 8 shots he hadn't dropped the knife which would then require the taser to try and trigger that.""

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Why are religious freedoms more important than women's freedoms?

They're not. The contraceptive mandate doesn't deal in any way, shape or form with women's freedoms.

&gt;The supreme court also made a decision recently that protesters outside abortion clinics need no buffer zone between themselves and women.

No, that's completely untrue. The court actually didn't overturn a  Colorado law that mandated a 10 foot floating buffer zone. They only ruled that a 35 foot buffer zone that included public sidewalks was unconstitutional.

&gt;Meanwhile, the supreme court itself has a 50 feet buffer zone.

The buffer zone around the Supreme Court doesn't include public sidewalks, which was the rationale used to overturn the Massachusetts law.

I don't know how many of the 20,000 FSP participants will actually move to NH when they hit their goal but if they want to try and turn NH into Ancapistan I'm not off-put by their trying. It's the only way they'll realize what they've been getting wrong because there is no talking to some of those stubborn fucks.

There was also some talk in their circles a while back about some of them helping start and cooperate with an opposing ideological project in Vermont once they reach their 20,000 participant goal for NH.

I know it's still a *very* small percentage, but the idea of getting pregnant and having to have an IUD removed isn't something I want to deal with. Whereas, with the implant... 

&gt;Prospective follow-up studies of Implanon, which include over 2,467 women-years of exposure, have found ***no pregnancies.***[5][10][13][14][18][19][20] Other studies have found some failures with this method, some attributed to failures of the method itself and others to improper placement, drug interactions, or conception prior to method insertion.[21]
In comparison, tubal sterilization has a failure rate of 0.5% and IUDs have a failure rate of 0.2-0.8%.[17] These statistics suggest that Implanon and Nexplanon are almost ten times more effective at preventing pregnancy than tubal sterilization.

Meditation is release from this cycle. In the moment there is neither pain nor fear. (emotional pain, obvisouly if you have a chronic illness you will still feel physical pain)

Releasing yourself from this cycle of pain and fear through the process of meditation and deeping of your awareness in the moment and staying in the moment allows you to be more productive and be a part of the solution.

It depends on perspective. A teenager would say that she deserves to control her own life and that she is old enough to make her own decisions, and a parent would say that she isn't old enough to understand and make such a big choice. I am 18. I have a younger sister at age 13. I look at her and understand how much she wants to be in control of her own life and I understand that.

"pornfree","t5_2rglh","Quitting porn will definitely help. Porn conditions your brain to appreciate novelty over actual intimate pleasure. Romance is sort of the opposite of novelty in that you live in that moment for the other person. A connection is made that is deeper than any concious desire. Conditioning your brain for visual stimulation and pleasure at the hands of novelty makes this connection impossible. 

I know this connection exists because I've experienced it. But it can only exist once you've put away your desire for/addiction to the novelty of porn. Which is easier said than done. Other parts of your life will improve as well as your brain begins experiencing wholesome pleasure again. 

And don't be afraid if your libido sinks. This is a common withdrawal symptom and should be considered motivation to continue abstaining from porn. It will come back with a fiery vengeance and when it does you'll find yourself panting next to your lady, having had the most intense, meaningful, and loving sex of your life. And you'll know what romance truly is. And you'll know that it is most certainly not porn. ","1404173344"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The first time I took shrooms I ran out of cigarettes at a very inopportune moment and went to the gas station to buy another pack. 

I'd done LSD plenty of times and figured I was in for a little more of the same. 

This is where I learned that the ""peak"" is far different - on LSD it's a fairly gradual come-up with a ""peak"" that lasts quite some time, like an hour or so. 

But on shrooms, the come-up is gradual at first, but the climax hits you like a truck. 

At some point between standing in line and getting to the cashier, I... I lost speech there, for a moment. It was weird, and I guess kind of scary. I thought I had gone insane. I don't know if I could still ""think in words"", it was a flood of information and symbols and stuff. 

I managed to focus all of my energy, chi, whatever and mutter one word, ""Red"". It was enough to get me a pack of Marlboro's (I usually smoke kool menthol's). It took a good 2-3 minutes of (i don't know if you can call it) thought proceessing to make one word happen. I'm real glad it was my friendly neighborhood gas station, because I'm sure otherwise someone would have possibly called the police.

Then, some rock gets launched into space, which just happens to have a sufficiently large sample of biological matter, as well as a composition that allows said sample to survive the force necessary to propel it to escape velocity, the force and heat that occurs at escape velocity when in an atmosphere, the hundreds of thousands of years it would take to travel to Earth, the force and heat that occur with reentry, and the force of impact, and exactly that much protection, so that the biological matter is then exposed to the elements to reform into life.

Furthermore, this rock would have been launched at the correct trajectory and velocity to make the trip to Earth, at exactly the right time in order to make it to Earth at the right time to continue the formation of life.

And you believe that this is not only more likely than terrestrial abiogenesis, but so likely as to be inevitable.","1404173346"

How is ""freedom from abuse when not politically correct"" a liberty rather than a control on free speech? You can say what you like as long as you toe our party line. 

Freedom from patents and intellectual property because you know who loved ensuring creative people get compensated for their work? Hitler.

Freedom from environmental trouble because constantly moving between countries on jets doesn't have any effect on the environment at all. If it did the invisible hand wouldn't allow it.

No taxes because sales taxes don't real.

No health insurance or job because it's literally just assumed you're independently wealthy to the extent that you have no need for any form of income. Only the wealthy deserve to be free.","1404173348"

One day I was sitting at her parents' house with her (I had seen her parents leave with my own eyes) and the two of us were sitting in her kitchen. She was on the computer and I was eating a piece of reheated pizza. All of a sudden I heard someone say hello. The only way I can think of to describe the voice was that of someone with their throat slit, trying to speak...like in a low budget horror film. I looked over at her and asked her what she was doing online and she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, ""I thought that was you."" I then said, ""Hello?"" She stood up so fast and yelled, ""Don't talk to it!"" Then it responded to me in the same exact terrifying voice, ""Hello..."" We both ran out of the house and I have never been back there.

"pkmntcg","t5_2s9kv","With Megaphone now in basically every deck, you need more tools in order to have any chance with this deck. Right now I only count 13 tools, which isn't even enough in a standard tool drop deck. I suggest cutting the Masquerain line down to 1-1, taking out one switch, cut random receiver, cut catcher, take out one level ball, and take out one bicycle. With those cards removed, you can up the current tools to 4 each for a total of 20 and could probably add a couple of Muscle Bands as well to get up to 22. It's a lot to manage, but then you would typically need just 8 tools on the board, allowing you to survive at least one megaphone hit.","1404173352"

After each season, the number of show watchers who decide to read the books increases, and therefor so does the risk of spoilers. I've noticed a huge increase in spoiler trolls this past season than season 3. And season 3 contained, perhaps, the biggest spoiler of them all. So the risk of being spoiled by some asshole is increasing every year. You're best off reading the books yourself. And the show is diverging from the books more and more. From now on the show will probably contain a lot more stuff that will even surprise book readers.

"AdvancedFitness","t5_2s9km","In addition to your losses from menstruation, athletic endeavors can also accelerate the loss of iron :

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency#Athletics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency#Athletics)

Iron from heme sources (AKA, meat) is more completely absorbed than iron from non-heme sources, but not at a tremendously greater rate (5-12% for all vegetarian diet vs 14-18% for a mixed diet, according to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200263?dopt=Abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200263?dopt=Abstract).

Vitamin C helps make iron more easily absorbed, so any sources that also have high vitamin C are a good bet, and if you take a supplement, taking it with some fruit might improve the absorption.

So, I just realized I didn't really answer your question of managing it well (I eat lots of meat) or how challenging it is, but I'm going to post this to provide relevant information (all easily google'd, but meh, saves a some time for people)","1404173354"

Pre-conception would be birth control and whatnot and post-conception would be anything from the morning after pill to abortion. The larger idea that encompasses both is the idea that life is sacred and a gift and that the role of sex is to accept that gift and bring life into the world. 

Thus, both pre and post conception are sort of a way of denying that promise. Though, most people don't really push the pre-conception things as much as the post. With reason.

I was actually considering Mosaic as one of the names because the base unit is the `.tile` class.

In any case, I'll be keeping an eye on your project.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Back story:


A friend of mine and I decided that we were going to take a pretty awesome trip to Italy for 10 days. We got to Venice about 4 days into our trip and after eating lunch we were standing in line waiting for a water taxi. I had been sick, coughing, sneezing, stomach, the works. So I wasn't as upity as I had been. I guess my friend felt like I wasn't enjoying the trip because he made a comment about leaving. I laughed it off as a joke and said ""oh yeah like we're made of that much money"". He just stared at me and said fuck it and walked away. I watched him walk for about 100ft thinking he was joking and was going to turn around and come back. Nothing. I left the line and followed him into the train terminal and he disappeared. Like magic he vanished. For absolutely no reason that I could think of he just left. We were having fun doing touristy things and enjoying Italy and then it was like a switch went off and he flipped. The only thing I could think of doing at that point was to get back in line and get to the hostel. He hadn't charged his phone and it was completely dead leaving me no way to contact him. I reach the hostel, sit my stuff down, and contact my dad. A really good family friend of ours is a retired USCG chief and does travel training to other countries to assist their coast guard. So he made some calls and got an Italian LT to come sit with me for a couple hours to check on me. Side note: Italian CG is super nice &amp; awesome. 


Anyway, I contacted his parents after mine to let them know what happened. They begin freaking out because they had no way of contacting their son. Fast forward to the next morning, my friends step dad works as a detective in NY and was able to get information stating that my friend was already on a flight back to the states and was scheduled to land within the next couple hours. My parents asked if I wanted to come home or finish the trip. With funds low and in a country I had never been to before I felt it was safer to just come home. I sat in the train terminal for 10 hours until the next, and cheapest, train that brought me back to rome and then a connecting train to the airport. I got home the next day.

Meanwhile, my phone bill skyrocketed with all of the phone calls and texts between myself and his family trying to get as much information from me that they could, even though there wasn't much to get. My friends mom met me at my layover and offered me a hotel for the night since my layover was 8 hours. I declined but she got it anyway, drove from NYC to Newark, dropped me at the hotel, gave me a hug and left. She stated that she had been talking to my parents and my friend (he had landed 18 hours prior) telling him he needed to pay my folks back because had he not left, they would not have forked out almost 2K (with phone bill included). He refused. Stopped all contact with me even after I tried reaching him to get him to call his mom. Eventually I learned that he stopped contact with his mom and just hid at his place. 

He is not under a written rule to pay my parents back but his mom was right in the fact that had he not left my parents would not have had to put out the money to get me home. They don't make a lot to begin with and I felt horrible. It took me awhile to pay them back but I feel better knowing that money can be put towards my mom's college tuition. 

TL;DR: friend ditched me in Venice for no reason. Parents put out a good chunk of money to get me back to the states. Friend refused all contact and wouldn't offer to pay even the slightest bit back. Friends mom is a GGG and made the situation better. Go friends mom!","1404173362"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Because it wasn't ""narrowly tailored"".

Alito, writing for the majority, even said that this right couldn't have been all that important because the administration had already exempted religious non-profits.  The administration also had a system in place for employees of those non-profits to receive birth control.

Thus, requiring Hobby Lobby to provide it wasn't Constitutional, as another, less restrictive means, was already available.

Now, the only reason the restriction had to be narrowly tailored in the first place is because SCOTUS said that corporations can exercise religion, which strikes me as ridiculous, but there is a legitimate rationale for including birth control, but excluding blood transfusions.

EDIT: Quote from the decision,

&gt;[The government] could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate. That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHS's stated interests.","1404173368"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Okay, let me give you some background then. I've been a Metro Stars / Red Bulls fan ever since they became a team. I remember going to games at Giants Stadium as a young kid in the mid 1990's. The fans are great and the players are always awesome to root for, but the franchise/management has always been awful. The GM for the team has always had shit for brains. My experience as a MS/RB fan? They always build you up to let you down. So many devastating losses, especially in the playoffs. And this is coming from a Knicks fan.

There are so many great memories I made supporting this team; from tailgating before Metro Stars game, pregame soccer activities in the practice bubble, and getting drunk with friends and family before Red Bulls games in Harrison. I don't regret any of it, but it's time for a change. Another big part of my switch is because NYCFC will be playing 10 miles away from my house. That's a 20 minute drive, opposed to a 70 minute drive (plus the hefty George Washington bridge toll + traffic).

"SanJoseSharks","t5_2rdh2","While i agree that shep is somewhat of a headscratcher, i dont believe he is as bad as you make him out to be. Yes he may take a spot of a younger player, he has had a decent enough season to warrant bringing him back on a team friendly deal. 

1. Remember this was his first full sharks season and he went from 4 to 20 points only playing 60 games (30 last season).

2. In playoffs he performed quite well for a third liner/4th liner. He went above and beyond what is asked for a guy in his position and you cant solely blame the loss for him.

3. We keep saying he may take a spot for a young guy, what if there arent any young guys ready. Remember freddie hamilton, he was meant to be a new good young guy be he didnt work out (lets hope he makes it this year). Also the sharks ideally play 3 top lines instead of the traditional 2 and shep can provide both skill to those three as well as offense to the 4th line. Shep provides insurance because there is no guarantee a young guy can make the roster.

4. And as someone else said he still has time. Plenty of players took a while to blossom and shep could be a candidate for it. There was a reason he was a first round pick because he had skills that could transfer over. Clearly the injury and his bad play has changed him because he seems humbled by his new situation. I still think he could be a solid guy who gives us 10 goals and 20 assists a season.

Just my two cents but to say he is terrible i think is a bit much. I hope he is signed to a team friendly deal because like you said his spot could be used better. *also as a side note, because we retain his rights it allows us to use arbitration if we wish. If shep went on the open market i honestly think he would get bloated contract offers (ex: burish).","1404173383"

You don't appear to understand experiments, either. Yes, the results were negligible. Key word being RESULTS. Facebook didn't know or expect that the results would be negligible when they failed to obtain informed consent to run their experiment. In fact, they had a hypothesis that the results would not be negligible. And still, they failed to even seek informed consent. That's what the outrage is. Intentionally trying to emotionally depress people, with an unknown level of impact, without obtaining informed consent first. The rest of your argument is a red herring.

&gt;Again, the news feed Facebook shows you is already manipulated by Facebook.

Irrelevant, because the other manipulations are not intended to inflict emotional distress or cause some other harm. If the other manipulations were also intended to cause a harm, they would also morally require informed consent. If they were only trying to achieve a more accurate search result, and any harm was simply unpredictable unintentional consequence, that's fine. If they are trying to make people feel better, that's fine. But if they are trying to *intentionally* cause harm, that's not fine. Not without informed consent.","1404173384"

"science","t5_mouw","""Means"" always implies correlation. That's basically how language acquires meaning; by correlations between invocations of symbols with experience. If ""means"" implied causation, then you'd be able to manipulate reality using words without having them be understood by anybody.

For instance, if the word ""red"" is meaningful, and meaning implied causation, then by saying ""red"" you would *cause* redness to happen. But that's not how meaning works. ""Red"" is meaningful because it is used in a correlative manner with reddness.

---

Incidentally, the proper word to use to address the idea of causal meaning (as a subset of meaning in general) is ""implies. So ""implies"" implies causation, and ""means"" implies correlation.","1404173387"

In the city I live in there is a cemetery that has a lot of hills and masoleums. One day myself and a friend were hanging out with these chicks. It was the middle of winter and it was snowing pretty heavy. It was night time and The girls decided that we should go for a walk through the cemetery, get the whole spooky thrill deal going. Anyways we walk across town and get to the cemetery as we enter my friend and I do the whole try and scare the girls bit. We are coming up on a masoleum that has a balcony type thing over a 50 or so foot drop. As we round the corner to the building my friend stops in his tracks. He signals me to look around the corner. On the ledge there is a girl crying. My friend asks if shes okay and she yells ""Go away!"" My friend asks again and she repeats ""Go away!"" So I take a step towards her and she gets up and sprints away around the other side of the building. I start after her when my friend stops me and points at the ground. Now remind you its snowing. I look down and there isnt a single track. Scared out of our minds we grab the girls and high tailed it out of there. I was shaken up pretty badly but after a couple days I calmed down. My friend and I met back up with the girls later that week and decided to see what we could find on line.

He's a terrible owner as far as running a franchise goes, he just has the most disposable income that he's willing to part with.  You act like the value of the franchise increasing is all him that's just the NBA.   Every franchise's value has gone up tremendously.  You can sell any team for over 600m pretty much easily.  (Oh jesus christ, you cited Chris Broussard, that guy knows shit, and is speculating more than you for page hits)

There are teams ""doing it right"" or at least very well.  The Spurs.  You also act like what he's doing is normal or a good way to do business.  It's a horrible way to do business, no owner spends that recklessly.   He spent money on overpaid players, combined them with his injury prone players, and ended up with a mediocre team in the EAST.  (It's pretty hard to be bad in the East)

TL;DR he has had more money to spend than everyone else and overall all franchises in the NBA have tremendously increased in value","1404173391"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

Many predator species populations have dwindled as a result of this obviously, so in order to introduce them in to the wild we would have to breed them in captivity. At which point we would be breeding animals for the expressed purpose of killing off the other animals we 'saved' from our slaughterhouses? This really isn't that ethical consider that our livestock is domesticated, not wild, so the predators would make quick work of them. 

Even if you ignore these considerations, where are we going to find all of the land and resources to support this new wild life? Humans are still going to need to farm food. I'm not prepared to accept condemning people to death by starvation over lofty philosophical principles as an acceptable solution.","1404173398"

Aloe with lidocaine ( I really wanted to get an aloe plant though because I hear it's magical for sunburns).

Coco butter and lots of it to moisturize.

Black tea and oatmeal baths, also baking powder baths for no more than 25-30 minutes.

Ibuprofen. My poor skin hurt so bad and this helped with the sting.

Calamine lotion to help with horrible itching. This was a lifesaver for me.

I even wrapped gauze around my stomach because contact with clothes hurt me so bad I would cry. 

I feel for you. Rest up, take it easy, feel better. It will be over soon!

Edit; realized you asked about your blisters. I had blisters just like yours all over my stomach and chest filled with puss. I just tried leaving them alone and they're all gone now and I have no scars, just a few new freckles.

Brady had a fine year with the amount of poor quality receivers that the Pats fielded but he is not solely responsible for the Patriots success. He had a defense.
Rivers created a Manning-esque offense with a rookie #1 WR, an aging Antonio Gates, Woodhead, and Mathews. Rivers is the glue that held that team together and was the absolute only reason we weren't in the Clowney sweepstakes.","1404173401"

At 10:10 am,[62] Franz Ferdinand's car approached and Čabrinović threw his bomb. The bomb bounced off the folded back convertible cover into the street.[63] The bomb's timed detonator caused it to explode under the next car, putting that car out of action, leaving a 1-foot-diameter (0.30 m), 6.5-inch-deep (170 mm) crater,[62] and wounding 16–20 people.[64]

Čabrinović swallowed his cyanide pill and jumped into the Miljacka river. Čabrinović's suicide attempt failed, as the cyanide only induced vomiting, and the Miljacka was only 13 cm deep due to the hot, dry summer.[65] Police dragged Čabrinović out of the river, and he was severely beaten by the crowd before being taken into custody.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","let me give an example of what i'm talking about, slam is a card that's rated fairly high. slam is used in one of two ways, either to straight up kill a 2 health creature, or to deal 2 damage to contribute to killing a creature and cycle itself.

slam is usually ranked fairly high by just about everyone i know, but i actually think slam is deceptively bad. arena is all about efficiency. mana efficiency, card efficiency. fiery war axe is unanimously an elite warrior card, and i agree, it has a great chance of trading 2 for 1, and trades against 5 opponent mana for our 2 mana. that's game winning efficiency right there.

now to slam, if a person uses slam to kill a threatening creature, they've just used 2 mana to deal 2 dmg to a minion, and that is not that efficient, in fact its sorta bad. if we use slam to deal damage a creature so we can kill it with something else, and the card cycles itself that's not as bad, but in such scenarios we sometime still traded 1 for 1 with the creature damaged by slam. And slam while not wasting a card still only managed to deal 2 dmg to a minion for 2 mana, and is in my opinion still not that great. some would want to compare it to a hero power of deal 2 dmg to a minion for 2 mana and use 0 cards which is incredible, however i'd like to point out that such a hero power can be used to kill a minion. slam would be equivalent (sorta) to a hero power that read (deal 2 dmg to a minion, if it kills it discard a card), i don't think this is that great.","1404173410"

"hockeyplayers","t5_2vs1b","As a winger, don't feel confined to ""your"" side (i.e. right if you're right wing) when your team has the puck. This isn't table hockey. One of the most effective ways to get open, create space, and cause trouble for the other team's defense is to move laterally or diagonally across the ice with and without the puck.

Try to keep your feet moving or at least keep your speed up all the time (e.g. your defense chases the puck into your end and picks it up, you should skate back to your blue line and curl back up the ice looking for a pass instead of hanging out at the other team's blue line without any speed). As a winger, you should honestly be winded within 30-45 seconds of getting on the ice. If you're not, you're really not skating hard enough (but this is true for most beginner level wingers).

When your team is picking up the puck in your end or in the neutral zone, ALWAYS skate back further than you think you should and then curl back up the ice so you can support the puck and create better angles to receive passes. Beginner level wingers are lazy, they think that standing at the blue line is being open, they think gliding at 1/3 speed is getting open, don't be those guys. Move your feet, skate back, curl, move with the puck and support your teammates when they have the puck.

ALWAYS expect the puck to come to you on the next play. Whether it's the other team picking the puck up behind their net, their team forechecking, your team on offense, whatever... expect the puck is coming to you and position yourself accordingly.

most importantly, have fun. in ten years you'll be playing this game and your first game will be a hazy memory. make sure you're playing ten years from now by having fun every time you play.","1404173410"
"letsplay","t5_2qss1","Been a very busy week!  We finished off one series, started a new series, and resumed yet another series, with loads of plans for the future!  And Grant Kirkhope and I are Facebook friends now, which is way neat.

In our **Link's Awakening DX 100% Speedrun**, CJ's pushing hard through the mid-game, taking down the Key Cavern, the Angler's Tunnel, and the Catfish's Maw!  It seems like *FINALLY* we're starting to get a rhythm going, though one has to wonder if this is really a ""speed"" run anymore...  
[**[9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KZGtLcFhv4) | [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQYMjuz-P8o) | [11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFzQpg5ziIM) | [12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXRk3mJL8Nk) | [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIiqI60uALI) | [14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAcDZM-3YA)**]

Meanwhile, in **Skyward Sword**, we're making our way through Faron Woods again, with a few pit stops along the way, including introducing ourselves to the worst vampire since Edward Cullen.  Oh yes.  Also, it's titled ""A Loose, Flapping Opening"", so there's that.  
[**[15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9tpqN6glS8)**]

Over in **Twilight Princess**, we got ourselves into Kakariko Village.  Good news: the kids are here!  Bad news: they're trapped between realms!  No good!  Also, why does it look like everyone ate fucking *uranium*?  
[**[6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eksvg1nCnrs)**]

This week, we held a race we called **Sonic the Hedgehog VS**, where CJ and I faced off in a footrace through the original Sonic the Hedgehog.  How did the race end?  Find out for yourself!  
[**[Complete Race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R9a807P-lc)**] [**[Green Hill Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6tDvZMzVUw) | [Marble Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPa6dNgbMaU) | [Spring Yard Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB8kJD0wrYc) | [Labyrinth Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM6WlsdIs6E) | [Star Light Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuPMGHYBvpE) | [Scrap Brain Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoP_uDUhjps)**]

Following that, we brought back **Pokémon Rivals**, where I continue my journey toward Cyllage City, where I'll be facing off against Grant.  Only one episode's come out in the past week, but we're resuming our daily uploads starting today!  
[**[10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kuI_BOmR6o)**]

Last but not least, we started a **Shovel Knight** series!  Only a few episodes are out so far, but ***holy shit*** is this one of the best retro games we've ever played.  It feels *perfect*, and is way more reminiscent of the NES than any game was ever expected to be.  Amazingly, the game's development only broke the NES limitations in a specific, and very limited, set of ways.  Check it out! We're definitely playing more!

Time and again we are shown that people really are lemmings, and yet we continue to let marketers manipulate the youngest and most impressionable in our society.  The rules that allowed marketing directly to our youth started in the Reagan/Bush Sr. Administrations and there have been a lot of negative results of that since then.

IN SEVENTH GRADE

and they caught me.

She phrased it like ""you were pursuing penis on the internet, weren't you????"" and it was just weird. I didn't feel comfortable at all.

She's a reasonable person but has confirmation bias and generalization to a fault. All gay people are like my cousin. All middle-aged moms are wonderful reasonable people. All this. All that.

She doesn't know any bisexual people besides me so it all defaults to ""gay."" Truth be told, I'm kind of afraid of my family now if this is the reaction from the one who knows and supports me the most.

It was my own stupid fault for bringing it up after the whole fiasco with the attention-seeking cousin. I really feel that I need to have a nice long chat with him and get him to knock it off.

They're from a northern state and I'm more of a Southerner, so I end up with the best of both worlds; a hardline, ""this is how it is"" way of dealing with my problems with an unstoppable motivation, and a deep love of pleasantries, colloquialisms, outdoor adventures, and sweet tea.

I call it my nuclear deterrent option and it works for me about 95% of the time with the five percent being idiots who take it too far, to which I usually just leave the altercation. I am not saying this method works for most people and I am not advocating for violence.

We were just hanging out in her backyard, as we normally would, when I saw a shadow of a large man wearing a hat through the planks in the fence. I quietly told her not to freak out and we stood up and acted like we were going inside. When we got in the door we booked it out of the front door and started sprinting down her drive way. When I looked back at her house THE MOTHER FUCKER WAS STANDING IN HER HOUSE STARING AT US THROUGH A WINDOW as we were running. Thankfully we ran into my parents not even a half of a mile down the road. We called the cops but the guy was already gone. Needless to say I never went back to her house after that.","1404173414"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Additionally, there is a complication with using the word ""Dogma"" in your definition of Millennial Atheism.

&gt;without being questioned or doubted

A great number of individuals arrive at atheism precisely because they are questioning or doubting of their beliefs and the beliefs impressed upon them by others.

Questioning and Doubting has its proof by the fact that many ""Modern"" atheists come from religious backgrounds. They would have had to necessarily be questioning and doubting to move to atheistic beliefs from religious ones.

And then there are some atheists who *return* to religion, often seen within this sub. This is further proof that even atheists who have turned from their religious upbringing continue to question and doubt.

Your article needs proofreading and editing, because you accidentally repeat paragraphs.

&gt;Millennial Atheists believe that the Ultimate Reality is that there is no evidence to justify belief in God, yet, they have obviously not delved too deep into the philosophies and religions of man, for if they had and had a good mind, they’d see the blatent consistencies which lay within them, particularly within the Abrahamic Religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

That is not an argument. It's putting people down, claiming that they are stupid for not understanding and accepting something seemingly obvious to you. It is massively condescending.

&gt;The practice Joint Observances by posting Meme’s in one of their biggest churches

Does that mean Instagram users are religious? Facebook users? Fans of cult TV shows like Firefly? If so, do these people deserve the protections that are reserved for the religious?

&gt;From late Dr. William Joseph Bray Quantum Physics , Eternal Consciousness, Near Death Experiences, Religion, and the Human Soul (Find here for only $2.99) 

Ouch, $2.99. His work has lost a lot of stock if the price has been reduced to that extent. Poor guy. 

&gt;The physical universe, since it has a lower boundary (the Big Bang) is non-infinite. That is a definition.

That is a false assumption. The Big Bang is not necessarily the physical universe's ""lower boundary"" because we have yet to identify that there was nothing prior to the Big Bang. We understand that the Big Bang occurred, but we don't understand what, if anything, came before it. So quickly in this quote Dr. Bray makes a significant mistake.

The rest of the quote seems **dependent** on the Big Bang being the universe's ""lower boundary"". Seeing as how the Big Bang is *not necessarily* the universe's lower boundary, his quote is now rendered flat. 

I hope I have been of use towards the improvement of your article.","1404173421"

"everymanshouldknow","t5_2u82c","I'm not saying objectivism in it's entirety has value. What I intended to convey was that a very specific element of objectivism has value--and has proven to be an integral part of human nature that is overall beneficial.

Objectivism =\= competition. Competition is a component of it that intersects with other ideologies.

&gt; Competition can also create a situation where the winner of the competition is the most corrupt and abusive and then has no more competition, which is just as bad as any dictatorial ideology. 

And the inverse is true as well. It depends on how it is regulated.

These things exist on a spectrum. Not just a binary right/wrong categorization.

Does this clarify what my position is?

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","One thing I have trouble with is that many female comedians tend to set a lot of their act around either bitching about men or talking about female body issues and while this can be funny I find a lot of them tend to let this dominate their act instead of letting it be one part of their repetoire.

If you think I shouldn't do what I think is fun or are gonna insult me for it, then you're the child. 

Also, if you're taking a stance, at least be consistent. Where is your outcry against people riding mountain bikes on the street? Why is it okay for people to use SPDs on the road? Are you gonna pull people over and scold them and call them childs for wearing skateboarding helmets while riding a bike? Probably not.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","I was referring to this first comment where they said i was talking to the original poster.

&gt;Did you not read the part where she said she was counting calories? The theory is simple but it can be difficult to do, hence her saying it's not easy. You're calling people dumb when you yourself haven't even understood the comment you're replying to.

This guy was saying i was talking to the original poster. This is where it all started. Then i replied to him saying i wasn't talking about OP, then you came in saying that i was. I put that edit in after the comment.

then i posted
&gt;I never called this person dumb.

Then you posted
&gt;Damn -10, thought this was a satirical subreddit, didn't know most you people were actually this dumb.
**Try again.** You called pretty much everyone who disagrees with you dumb. Even someone who is an expert in the field and clearly more educated on the topic.

All i was trying to do was inform her that you can disregard cardio and eat right to lose weight, so the picture was not far from the truth. After 10 votes i edited in telling them to go google it, it's 100% true. She never said she disagreed with me, she even stated later that i was right, you don't need to do cardio, it's all in the diet.

too god damn confusing to backtrack all that. It's not about people being idiots for disagreeing with me, it's about them refusing to believe in a fact. Downvoting is meant to get rid of things not relevant to the topic, not for disagreeing with people(or disagreeing with facts for that matter). They were not using it the way it was intended. So yes, they are idiots. Downvote away though, these internet points are serious business. Keep living in ignorance.

"Flipping","t5_2y9q6","Well my mom and I go up to this garage sale and the lady who is running it is quivering. I first thing I think to myself is ""huh, looks like she has some sever social anxiety disorder or something. Better be try to be extra nonthreatening.""

Anyway this kid comes out and yells at his mom to clean off a table for his Xbox 360 and his games. She flinches and apologizes to him because it's 2PM and she didn't realize that he was going to participate in the sale. He calls her an idiot and goes to get his 360 and games.

At this point my mom and are giving each other the ""Did what just happen really just happen or did that Gameboy that leaked battery acid on my hand send me down the rabbit hole?""

So we play it cool and my mom is looking at a washer and I'm waiting for the 360 stuff. The kid comes out and I start BS with him about video games, halo, MLG and pretending that what just happened didn't just happen. 

Eventually we get to business and I ask him how much he wants for one of the newer games. He tells me $50, I say ""alright, lemme just price check Amazon."" I pull out my phone and I find that despite the game coming out about a month ago it is currently worth about $15. I show him the price on my phone, and he says the lowest he will go is $45. I respectfully tell him no, but ask what he wants for all the other games.

He says ""Make me an offer."" So I take my phone and go through game after game telling and showing him exactly what they are worth. His games totaled a little less than $50 on Amazon. By the end he is red in the face pissed but hasn't said anything. So I ask him as carefully as I can. ""Well, now that you know what I can buy them for on Amazon...(deep breath) How much do you want for them?""

He insists that I make the first offer. So I say ""You're not going to like it...*sigh*... together they are all worth on Amazon about fifty-"" He yells ""No! This is worth $600!"" and shoves past me into his house. When he does this I nearly lose it, as he walks away I am tearing up from trying so hard not to burst into laughter.

But it doesn't end there folks. My mom had just asked his mom if they would take $100 for their washer instead of $175. And the kid's mom had gone to get the dad because she ""Can't make any decisions without his approval."" Dad comes back, his wife is quivering harder than normal. The dad tells my mom ""You will take it for $150."" Mom tells him: ""No thank you. If it doesn't sell by the end of the sale I'll take it for $100."" (Mom don't take crap from nobody) Him: ""You will take it for $150. This is not a negotiation."" Mom: ""Alright, I'll have to ask my husband."" She says this with enough sarcasm that I start snorting/coughing trying not to laugh. 

They don't notice her sarcasm and he leaves while his wife writes down their name and number for us to call them back.

We didn't call. And we feel bad for the lady.

Edit:TL;DR: Lady is living in abusive household. Abusive Kid wanted $600 for ~$50 worth of games. Yelled at me. Their aggressive Dad was aggressive toward my mom.","1404173434"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Quick and dirty ""pure economic"" analysis:

HP OfficeJet 4630 -- $99.99, comes with shitty starter ink

Conversion Kit -- $7.95

4 oz. Ink Bottles -- 4 @ $6.00 ea. = $24.00

HP #61 Black Cartridge, OfficeDepot brand -- $11.99

HP #61 Color Cartridge, OfficeDepot Brand -- $16.79

[This page](http://www.printerfillingstation.com/Refill-Instructions/HP/H46.htm) seems to indicate that the HP #61 Black takes 15mL of ink and the HP #61 Color takes 7mL each of CMY.  

Apparently you have to run a couple cleaning cycles to get the new ink to take, so we'll knock 10% off the yield to account for that.

**Black**

4 oz. = 118.3mL (106.47mL effective yield) = 7.09 fills

7 x HP #61K Cartridges = $83.93

**Color**

4 oz. = 106.47mL effective yield = 15.21 fills each

15 x HP #61CMY = $251.85

**Analysis**

Initial nut without conversion kit and ink -- $128.77 --&gt; A

Initial nut with conversion kit and ink -- $160.72 --&gt; B

Difference -- $31.95

2d set of cartridges (or 1st fill) -- $28.98 (A = $157.75; B = $160.72)

3d set of cartridges (or 2d fill) -- $28.98 (A = $186.73; B = $160.72)

Therefore: The conversion kit pays for itself after 2 full fills or 1.01 partial fills.","1404173437"

"SWORDS","t5_2qt1p","From [this discussion thread](http://www.militaria.co.za/nmb/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=19395) at the NMB. A really cool cross-cultural object. I will quote Ian Bottomley, curator emeritus of the Royal Armouries at Leeds, who posted to that thread:

&gt; Peter, The tanto illustrated was bought by me for the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds where it is now on display. It had been described in an art magazine during the 1930's and as you say exhibited in Oxford in 1968 where I first saw it. The blade appears to have been made from a German hanger or sabre dated 1623 or 1625, the inscription being partially obliterated by polishing. The maker was from a well-known Feisser family working in Solingen at that date, but the individual is unidentified as his initial is again almost lost and might be either P or F. The original blade has been cut down to leave the forte and fullers with their inscriptions, re-shaped and given a traditional yakiba and polish. It is now mounted in a saya covered with 'Dutch leather' and a kozuka with a fretted iron namban panel. I interpreted the kamon as one used by the Matsura family of Hirado where the Dutch has a factory before being moved to Dejima in 1640. The museum on Hirado fairly recently found a namban armour made up from elements of two Dutch pikemen's armours that can be dated to about the same age as the blade. Although it is pure speculation, it is possible that the original European sword and the armours formed part of a gift from the Dutch to the Matsura on leaving the island to move to Dejima.
&gt;Ian Bottomley

For the sake of our readers here I will add that in the early 1600s ""namban"" (southern barbarian, i.e. European) stuff was really hot in Japan. You see a lot of swords being signed as made with *namban tetsu* or *oranda* (Holland) *tetsu.* Not many European blades converted into Japanese style though!","1404173438"

It is well known that most immigrants are of low intelligence, education, and skill. They are less able to contribute than the native people. It makes no sense to add low quality people to a nation, especially people without any shared values who are vastly dissimilar in culture and ideas.

It might make sense to throw away a national culture and accept a generic commerce-based culture if the immigrants were highly skilled doctors, engineers, etc., but that is not the population being sought. It's as though politicians are deliberately bringing in the useless cases so they can create problems only they can solve, except they can't solve them either.","1404173438"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","You can't fight the fed. I think that inflationary pressures are creeping into consumer and asset markets. CBs will be forced to do whatever constitutes tightening in their constituency. I think that the reason that markets continue creaking higher is low interest rates pure and simple. With markets at full value, real tightening (in whatever form in these rather odd times) may add pressures that may create the conditions for some sort of a correction that market seems to want. When is another question.

I'm slowly coming to terms with the idea that if I were fully invested, I'd probably stay that way. Since I'm not for reasons not related to securities markets, I'll wait for what seems like an opportunity and average into it. 

I wouldn't be all out of the markets .... probably ever. I also wouldn't actively sell down my portfolio, but I also wouldn't pour cash into these markets at these levels. It seems better to manage the cash as well as possible and sit tight ... for what, I do not know.

I normally keep an advance in the account worth about 20-30% of the value of the portfolio. I use it to buy more of the portfolio and can borrow at around 120bps. I've paid that down with the cash. I also spread the remaining cash across currencies for a natural hedge. I was more anxious about it, but after writing it all down, I feel a bit better about the allocation and will sit tight.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Basic guide to DIing that will usually save you. When getting comboed DI away from them, when getting hit while offstage DI up and towards the stage.

Survival DI however is very dependant on what you're getting hit with. Getting hit by fox's upsmash you want to DI directly left or right. Getting hit with marth's fsmash, you want to DI up and in. Most finisher attacks hit either straight up (e.g. fox's upsmash/uair) or at around a 45 degree angle (e.g. marth's fsmash, falco's fsmash/bair, falcon's knee) so you can usually bet on either DIing directly to the side, or DIing up and in. If you're not sure which one it is, DI straight to the side towards the stage, that is optimal for upward kill moves and it's usually good enough to save you from sakurai angle kill moves too.","1404173442"

A woman doesn't have to 'look' pregnant to be pregnant. it also possible to be pregnant and then lose the baby without ever knowing if it happens early on enough.

it'd really be one step below banning women from smoking or drinking on the off chance that they could possibly be pregnant. 

then what do you do for women who are sterile? would they be allowed to smoke and drink without worry or would they still need to be tested to make sure they still aren't pregnant, cause shit happens....

then there are those who identify as women but cannot biologically be pregnant... or even those who can get pregnant but do not identify as women...

you'd have to just pregnancy test EVERYONE just to be sure to enforce that sort of law...

A lot of people would not see this as fair, that's the problem.

So thievery, gang involvement and things like stalking without assault need to have far less harsh punishment to what you suggested.

Sure, but if you have been paying attention to this issue, you will be aware that the peaceful and diplomatic protest of groups like [Fight for the Reef](http://fightforthereef.org.au/) has lead to the construction of the port being condemned by major organisations such as the UN and has resulted in many of the major investors backing out of the project, delaying, and possibly preventing, it's construction.

O ME! O life!... of the questions of these recurring;	 
Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities fill’d with the foolish;	 
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)	 
Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renew’d;	 
Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me;	         5
Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined;	 
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?	 
  
Answer.

That you are here—that life exists, and identity;	 
That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.

-Walt Whitman

He tells us that existence itself is the reason for being — that life exists is in itself enough, and that in this life we have identity — we are who we are.  Among all these masses there is one named Walt Whitman, and he is an actor in the great play that is life, that vast, ongoing poem that is life; and each human, like Whitman, will contribute a verse to it.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","Your trip sounds amazing, I'm an anthro major specializing in organic ag so I can appreciate how exciting that trip is going to be/have a bit of experience when it comes to easy, heatproof makeup. Basically, the requirements for this type of makeup are: uv protection, staying power, and sheer to medium coverage. My skin isn't perfect, so it always feels a little better to me to have something on my face. I don't really care about eyes or eyebrows or lips when I'm working, but it's nice to have an even complexion. I would recommend a primer and a bb cream. I have had good luck with L'Oreal's Revitalift Miracle Blur primer, and I recently got my mom Baby Skin by Maybelline and she seems to like how it feels on her skin. These will help your makeup last throughout the day. My favorite bb is L'Oreal's Youth Code, which seems like it would be for a more mature crowd, but works great for me. It's nice and thick, and provides good coverage for a bb. It has SPF 15, which is nice, but I would recommend getting a moisturizer or primer with additional SPF, and adding sunscreen to your regimen before you apply the bb cream, because SPF 15 will not be enough to last you all day outside. I've never tried a setting spray, but have heard great things about them. They are also supposed to help your makeup last longer. Good luck, have fun, and learn lots :)","1404173450"

I stopped listening to them when Sophia John or whatever her name was took over the station.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Source: I am a publisher that has had to put up with shitty intrusive ads from a number of ad agencies for over a decade.

""Hey, we don't want interstitials"" is responded with what amounts to ""Run the ads, or get fucked"".

To expand on that, it's like this:

Ad agency sells a campaign worth $5,000 for say, 100k impressions. As part of that sell, they offer value add to the client, and that value add comes in the form of intrusive popovers, interstitials, or other some such Ad Block Plus inducing graphic.

When we say ""Hey, we don't want interstitials"", then that means being taken off the pitch list entirely. So its ads with terrible UX, or nothing...

So no, it's not further from the truth. I work on the OTHER end of industry and I can tell you that the ad agency retains all the control in that situation (unless you're an Alexa top 10k site and have your pick of a decent ad agency), and doesn't give a fuck about the health of the site they're running ads on.","1404173453"

Just do not be one of the guys who waits and waits then waits some more just to finally give in and invest 5 years down the road because you are going to hate yourself.  If you are going to wait for a 5% drop wait for a 5% drop.  If you are waiting for a 25% drop wait for that.  If you do not actually have an idea of what drop % would make you feel comfortable  but you know that you need to wait for some % drop to feel comfortable then you need to put more thought into how you are managing your money.

Personally I am almost entirely invested however some of my investment has a good negative correlation to equities (example EDV).  Besides that I figure even if the market can be mathematically proven to be 30% over priced (I actually doubt that can be done by the way) that does not mean the market will not become 50% overpriced before it finally drops.  It is also hypothetically possible that the market moves sideways until it becomes fairly priced or undervalued again, during which time I profit from dividends.

All in all, not worth my effort to worry much as I am dollar cost averaging my investments and if the market drops I can better use my future investments.","1404173456"

And Captain Falcon and Fox are two of the best characters in the game. Idk I haven't played Brawl in a long time but this is true for melee so I'm sure it transfers over for the most part.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;I can't believe I'm actually talking to someone who views different people as being worth differently. Here is a quote of you even saying that different people have different values:

You're right. The concept of social value is totally falsified. The last person you had sex with was just lucky he or she was in the right place at the right time. Replace that person with a 400 lbs couch potato who hasn't showered, cut their nails, or brushed their teeth in 7 years, and spends their day eating doritos and watching Babylon 5 re-runs and you and everyone else will be on their genitals like white on rice...

PLAYAH! PLAYAH!

Get real.

&gt;You're even giving them a price tag, this is called COMMODIFICATION. Do you seriously lack the mental capacity to understand how this is a huge human rights violation?

Human rights violation? Now you're being sensational. It'd be a human rights violation if A) I was the only one doing this, and B) I was selling people. Neither of which are true. 

&gt;Well, I would love to see the proof for it.

Sure. Leave your house. Go to a mall. Look at the couples. Tally how many partners are not of equal perceived social value. You will find very few. 

Attractive people date attractive people. Unattractive people date unattractive people. Attractive people are not going to date unattractive people because attractive people are worth more. This is a basic concept of life dude...lol.

&gt;I'm very curious to see what evidence you have that people's partnering decisions are determined by market forces as opposed to individual choice.

Why are you interpreting ""market force"" as something alien to individual choice? When I buy a product, that was my choice...

&gt;No. It is not. I do not economize my relationships with my friends or my partners. It's not about winning or losing to me, and I am perfectly willing to give a lot of myself to the people I care about.

Yes you do, you're just being obstinate with your definition of ""economize"". Your friends are your friends because you get something of value from them. Maybe Timmy is your friend because you value intelligent conversation and an appreciation for classical music and Timmy shares those traits. Maybe Timmy values people who can bring hot girls to a party, and enjoys recreational drugs, and you share those traits = a friendship is made. 

People who are not your friend either advertise poor value, or do not share traits you value. Maybe Bob is not friend because he's ugly and you don't enjoy spending time around ugly people, and maybe Jane is stuck up, and you don't find arrogance a worthwhile value to trade for; ie. it would be a negative transaction for you.

&gt;I guess you could say that I obtain ""happiness"", in some very abstract way, in being engaged with those people... but that's not really something that ""they're giving me"". 

Of course it is something they are giving you. As I explained above...they are validating you. If you value intelligent conversation, and Timmy gives that too you, he's validating you by making you feel smart, and listening too, and makes you see things in new ways. He makes you feel net positive about yourself, and because you found he has value, you value that he sees you are worth validating, therefore, he makes a good friend, and you are validated. 

&gt;It's not an economy; it's something that comes from within... from knowing that I have people around me who love me and care for me.

No it's not because it's conditional. Your mom and dad only love you because you're their son. If you stopped being their son somehow, or where born to another family in an alternate universe, they would not love you. Your friends care about you because they value your valiation, and if you removed the things which validate them from your personality, they would cease to be your friends in short order. 

&gt;Err... no. If your friends have to constantly validate you, then you are (as I like to call it) a parasite. Those kinds of people are the absolute worst to be around; they just bring me down. I do not need a personal cheerleader squad, nor do I intend to be anyone else's.

I already explained why this is wrong, so I'll not repeat myself, other than to say it's not parasitic; it's symbiotic.

&gt;Err... no. If your worst problem in life is that you can't get laid, then you have a pretty damn privileged life.

Coming from the bisexual orgy participant...lol. ""LET THEM EAT CAKE!""

No one said it's the worst problem...it's a highly pertinant problem. Sex is a basic human desire no different than eating and sleeping, and not being able to seek and attain it is a massive cause of pain and mental anguish for many and for someone partakes in decadent acts of sexual privilege slutting around at group sex parties to insult and dismiss that pain with such repugnant dismissiveness kind of makes you a pretty sick fuck...

&gt;I'll grant you that everyone likes to feel sexually attractive, but when you're attempting to coerce that attention out of people, then you've really stepped into some morally questionable territory.

I have no idea what you're talking about ""coercing"" attention out of people. 

&gt;How is it fucked up? Seriously? Raping a girl while she's unconscious isn't her finding you ""sex worthy""; it's you imposing your own sexuality onto her body

When did I ever say it's ok to rape a unconscious women because they find you sex worthy? Lol, this is the kind of thing that makes me think you're wasting my time...

&gt;Putting girls down (hamstering? Isn't that the term?) to make themselves feel less valuable is absolutely horrendous.

Firstly, it's a sexual stategy. Women do similar things, I'd argue with greater frequency than men.

Secondly, that's not what hamstering is. Hamstering is the act women perform of creating circular logic in their head of why their immoral debate, argument or behavior (usually sexual acts) are justified. 

&gt;but in reality, it seems to be a way of extorting women for sex, and of manipulating the boundaries of consent so that you guys just barely ""not rape"" someone.

Alright. This comment has annoyed me sufficiently to engage role play mode. Let's pretend I'm a ""cis gendered TRP scumbag"" who's been shat on my whole life by the ladies, friendzoned constantly, and I'm in a pretty dark place. I found a subreddit called TheRedPill that sounds like a pretty sweet place to nurture my growing hate and resentment towards women for treating me like garbage for 20 something years. Why don't you tell me from your hot-gay-dude-sex-party high horse why I should give a fuck what you, or anyone else thinks about the manipulating women and/or emotionally extorting them for sexual activity (something you get for free and I don't)?","1404173458"

&gt; Helter Skelter is a 2004 television film directed by John Gray based on the murders of the Charles Manson Family. The film was a remake of the 1976 two-part TV movie. Unlike the 1976 version which focused mainly on the police investigation and the murder trial (as did the novel), this version also focused mainly on Linda Kasabian's involvement with the Manson Family.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","Because white people don't want Black People to have shit. The system of Racism White Supremacy does not allow it.

There's plenty of Black female artists that aren't Nicki Minaj. Instead of giving them the time of day anywhere, they're relegated to the deepest underground. Same for the male artists. Yet macklemore gets grammars and he ain't a real rapper. Fuck how long he claims to be one.

Motherfuckers talk about Eminem as if he's as good as he's made out to be when he's not and everyone knows it. He's good relative to today's mainstream talent, but has never proven himself in a battle. But oh, my bad. His albums sell. Let's put him automatically in the top ten. Call up Vanilla Ice as well.

Dame Dash had it right a few weeks ago; nothing but a bunch of culture vultures with fragile fucking egos who want to desperately prove that they can master an art form and get credit as being down. 

That's why Lord Jamar's videos on YouTube get the hits they do; because people know he's right. Its obvious. No one has ever addressed the things he said. They go off on tangents as if they know what the fuck they're talking about. A bunch of goddamn trolls. It's one thing if this was speculation.  But 50 years after the fact, the plagiarist cunts known as Elvis is hailed as the King of Rock and Roll. King of a genre that no white man invented. Now I'm supposed to feel the same about unproven Eminem? Fuck that. He made racist comments about Black People. As did Beiber, for that matter. But I'm supposed to let that slide because they have ""black friends"" (read: Black business partners; a bunch of sellouts who care me about making money with racists instead of the preservation of the culture and their children's future. Fuck them.

And you know what, fuck the rest of em too. All these white rappers so desperate to be ""down"" and ""hip"" and ""cool"" by taking the attractive parts of our culture and trying act like they care. 

Yet when it's time to protest about the Jordan Davises and Trayvon Martins, the Stop and Frisk policies, the gutting of the Voting Rights act, the strategic destruction of Black and unfair hiring practices, these cunts and their fans are noticeably absent. But you'll find their racist fans on niggermania or chimpout talking shit. Call them out on it and they'll call you a racist. 

Because Black People dare point out the theft of their culture by those who can't create something nearly as good, we get called racist. Despite the historical precedent.  We have a right to talk about the shit. Its not just music like the culture vampires wanna claim so they can stake their piece of our culture out for profit, not for the sake of the culture. If that weren't the case, all these white rap fans world be taking black rappers to task for their garbage.  Black people do it plenty, and in increasing numbers (anecdotal. Based on tube views of these particular subjects). Instead of that though, everyone wants to dictate to Black people our culture. And it burns people up the fact that we ain't complying. 

I'm gonna go blow some weed since this subject makes me mad.

My brother and my cousin were visiting my grandma's house that was a former boarding school for girls in like the later 1800's. This house had been in our family for almost 120 years and we all knew that this place was haunted. One night, around 11:30, they had the idea to go outside and climb trees to get a view of the street from the house. They climb this big willow tree and by the time they get to the top, they hear a ""Whack!"". My brother looked down to see a girl around the age of 12 in a nightgown whacking the tree with a willow branch. He told me that he and my cousin never had ran faster in their lives. He's only told me this story once when he was drunk. I tried to ask him about it when he sobered up and he just shuddered and told me he'd rather not talk about it. 

TL;DR Brother and Cousin climbed a willow tree next to an old haunted house, looked down, and saw a little girl whacking a branch against the tree","1404173461"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","**TL;DR**: I was extremely lucky to be able to set myself up to work my way out of homelessness. My story is the exception and should not be taken by anyone to be a story about how ""all you have to do is pull yourself up by the bootstraps.""

No worries; I'm pretty open about my life.

The first thing I did once I decided I wanted to stop being homeless was find a campground in a very small town where I was allowed to receive mail. I paid about $5 a night (which I had saved up from busking while I was in large cities) for a tent space though sometimes the people there ""accidentally"" gave me an extra couple of nights.

If nothing else, being homeless taught me that people can be absolutely amazing and wonderful to one another.

The campsite had an onsite shower which I used every day. When I could afford it I picked up a disposable razor and shaved. When I had picked up a couple extra dollars (through a combo of busking in the nearest city 20 miles away - I walked a day to get there, stayed a few days, then walked back in another day while knowing my ""stuff"" was safe at the campsite) I went to the nearest thrift store (in the city) and picked up some ""nice"" clothes.

Then I applied *everywhere*.

I ended up getting a really good job as an executive assistant in a place pretty much across the street from where I was staying; a little tech company in the middle of nowhere that didn't want to pay much but paid enough for the folks living in that area.

From there it was pretty easy, honestly. I had a steady income, a place to get mail, and friends to help when I messed up with my money. I say ""when"" because one of the biggest challenges when you go from living on almost nothing to living on about $9/hr is that $9/hr feels like *infinite* money. I splurged when I shouldn't have. I didn't save well because I figured I could do it later. I messed up with some credit stuff.

But I learned. I worked at it. I got better.

I had a lot of advantages, really. I'm youngish. I'm white. I made it a rule from day one of being homeless that I would *never* touch anything mind-altering while I was homeless, even caffeine! I have some talents that lend themselves to making enough money busking to live on the streets.

After a while things just worked out. I met my now-wife online and when we met in person we really hit it off so we decided that we'd move in together a few months later when she was going back home (long story on that but to shorten it, she was on the west coast doing an internship).

Things have never been better in my life and while I still suffer from depression (because brain chemicals suck sometimes) I do not suffer from suicidal thoughts or tendencies. I'm a dad and I have never been happier.

"bdsm","t5_2qjdo","Have you had another discussion with your husband yet?  How did it go?  Is he on board with you?  

*I often worry I drive him up the wall, stubbornness ensues. I ensue. Whatever the case may be. I just think it's a winning situation when it results in situations or circumstances being diffused. A healthy dynamic that just results in the resolve of negative situations, and the build up of positive situations.*

Yes.  My wife tells me she would ""stuff"" her emotions for fear of starting a fight or adding to my stress, and over time she became resentful of not being able to express herself.  I was guilty of the same.  Now she speaks her mind freely, and I can express my displeasure with spankings.  We don't let things build up, and it's made a big difference for both of us.  We're both more relaxed and open. 

*Is the ""game"" aspect of this alluring? I always thought it would be hot to have secret missions that the general public wasn't aware of (painfully perhaps) but I certainly was. Just curious if that plays out for you guys as well.*

Yes, we sometimes play our own private games when we're with friends or in public.  It's a lot of fun.  

For example, if we're with a group of friends she has to pay attention to me (at least a little bit) so that whenever I speak to her she promptly makes eye contact and verbally acknowledges me.  Usually it's just a simple ""yes?"" if I speak her name, or an answer if I ask her a question.  It seems simple, but she tells me it requires some discipline to do this every time and to make it seem natural, and it reinforces a feeling of submissiveness that she really enjoys.  

Or I'll give her rules on how to act when we're in public.  Often its silly little things (nothing that would get any attention), and if she makes mistakes she'll get spanked when we get home.  I love the look on her face when she realizes she made a mistake. 

I recently bought a remote controlled vibrator that I plan on using on a dinner date or maybe at a cookout with friends.  But I need to get the hang of controlling it first.  I want to tease her and keep her on edge, but not to the point anyone notices.  Once I get the hang of it, I think it will give her a feeling of being controlled, which she likes.

*Thanks, btw, for the generosity of this post and the wealth of information, much appreciated!! :)*

Granted, by my definition, we are taking more feminist stances on topics than masculinist stances, because in today's world that is simply needed. But it annoys me when I see people say that men having their rights advocated in the few areas they need to be is also feminism. It isn't, stop giving a gender loaded term to something that should be termed in a gender neutral fashion.

My state (Iowa) has more guns per capita than Illinois but we have far less murders. Clearly it would be disingenuous for me to say more guns means less crime: there are variables that have more powerful effects than guns per capita in regards to crime rate and homicide rate.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","My advice would be to explain counterparts ability-by-ability through every skill in DotA, rather than going hero by hero. I'd then allow the information to be sorted from either perspective, so you could look at an entry for **Ashe** and see:

*Focus* - Somewhat similar to **Brewmaster**'s 3rd skill, *Drunken Brawler*, which also guarantees a critical hit on his first basic attack after a short duration of not attacking. Drunken Brawler also has an Evasion component built in, guaranteeing a dodge after Brewmaster is not attacked for a short time.  
*Frost Shot* - **Drow Ranger**'s *Frost Arrows* do almost the same thing, except they also slow attack speed.  
*Volley* - **Jakiro**'s *Dual Breath* may look entirely different, but it's the same sort of effect, slowing units in a cone and damaging them. Notably, the Dual Breath cone is much narrower than Volley's, and its damage is dealt as a DoT rather than immediately.  
*Hawkshot* - **Clockwerk**'s *Rocket Flare* has the same usage here for scouting, though it also does some damage if enemies are underneath the rocket when it reaches its destination. If you're looking for the boost in gold, **Alchemist** has *Greevil's Greed* (sometimes called ""Goblin's Greed""), which provides bonus gold for slain units.  
*Enchanted Crystal Arrow* - This skill is actually based upon the *Sacred Arrow* carried by **Mirana**, the Priestess of the Moon. Mirana's arrow only hits one target, but rather than scaling from 1 to 3.5 seconds, it scales from 0.01 up to 5! It's also a normal skill, so you can get started with your high-impact skillshot right from the very beginning.

... but also look up **Mirana** and see something similar, explaining which LoL champions have the most similar skills to hers. The former will be a better reference for people who are coming over and looking for parallels to their favourite champions' skills, while the latter will serve as a quick ""How does this hero work?""","1404173475"

- ""Sansa goes to the Vale.""

- Arya's journey with The Hound. 


Dislikes:

- The Sept rape scene didn't work for me, specifically because no one acts like anything untoward happened afterward. 

- I thought that the Tysha reveal was both dramatic and low-hanging fruit as far as Tyrion's character development, and its absence burned my britches. If they reminded the audience about Ser Dontos, they could have reminded them about Tysha.

- Asha goes to the Dreadfort: In the books, Asha is both excellent at throwing axes, and one of the only Ironborn with a lick of sense. Book Asha would not raid the Dreadfort, and, if she did, she would have killed the dogs immediately upon entering the kennels, killed Ramsay with a throwing axe, and clubbed Theon into unconsciousness to better haul his stupid ass out of there.","1404173476"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","These things ARE measurable.  That's what tests *DO*.  Why are you finding this so difficult to understand?  Are they as accurate as an accelerometer?  No.  Why not?  Because psychological research deals with human brains, and human brains are so enormously complicated that we're only just beginning to make sense of it - we're just scratching the surface.

AND, Professor Logical-Positivist-Reductionist, you can't perform tightly controlled experiments on human beings because it's unethical.  Human beings are also inseparable from their environments.  They have a history, diatheses, genetic vulnerabilities, experiences, personalities, etc.  The idea that this is ""unscientific"" because it's not as easy to measure a mental disorder as it is to time a marble rolling down a metal track is ludicrous.  I hate to say it, but the world is a very complicated place and people are very complicated animals.  It's possible you just don't realize how complicated psychopathology is.

I'm getting the impression that you're somewhat low on the Big Five personality trait of openness.  Nevertheless, here's my bibliography from the paper.  Due to space considerations, I couldn't use so many more PEER-REVIEWED, SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ARTICLES and textbooks by EXPERTS.  So go ahead and read some articles.  I'm not going to serve it up to you on a silver platter.  I had to work for it.  You want to learn something?  You'll have to work for it too.  Physician: heal thyself!

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","You obviously are unfamiliar with birth control.  But that doesn't stop you from feeling very strongly about it.  Birth control pills, obtained through insurance with a doctor's prescription, are usually picked up by the patient at a pharmacy.  You see the employee usually pays for a portion of their health insurance along with the employer.  This is part of their compensation for the work that they do.  Many health plans that are purchased by employers include contraception coverage.  Some do not.  This is really in no way a personal responsibility issue.  If I have insurance coverage and I use it when I need an appendectomy am I some kind of mooch for using my insurance that I paid and worked for?  Women, because of their ability to make babies and the parts associated, have different health care needs than men.  The affordable care act mandates that all insurance plans must have contraception as a basic part of their coverage.  I agree with this morally and politically.  If conservatives want to alienate half the voting population because of an arbitrary and conveniently contrived religious conviction then please, be my guest.","1404173479"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","An interesting conter-point to the notion of post-growth economics. While similar in the respect that both look to move beyond scarcity as the driving diviner of value, it seems to me that post-growth is somewhat more pessimistic. Where post-scarcity suppose a world of unlimited resources, post-growth imagines one of finite capacity. 


But could both be true. Could we imagine a world that has stabilized at a given population size, a size whereupon there are sufficient resources for the needs of everyone to be met? What are the moral implications of a global population cap? And of the outcomes? Does an agreed carrying capacity suggest that we need more capacity, that humanity is want to move beyond the Earth? Is that presumed?

The game has been super fun thus far.

I've tried Rift, TERA, Neverwinter, DDO, GW2, Secret World, WoW and even Wildstar. Runes of Magic was my main squeeze for a long time until I got sick of spending all my money. I played/play LoL in my down time since I didn't really enjoy anything out there. 

Honestly, swtor makes me want to come back and I'm glad I gave it a try. I'm excited to see what ends game brings. The community seems really decent, too.

Riot has been getting a lot of heat recently. The challenger ddos attacks I'd say are more the fault of the players than riot not giving them the support they deserve. The London visa issues? That was completely riot compromising the integrity of the LCS matches to get more media exposure. This change up in the logistics of worlds this year seems like a similar move. They are undermining the quality if the games by putting extra out of game pressure on players via forcing them to travel, cutting into prep time and causing unnecessary fatigue. 

The Koreans are mainly whining for the wrong reasons. We should all be angry that riot is splitting the opening rounds from the main tournaments geographically.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've experienced similar to the first story. At a friend's house, I heard someone walking upstairs and asked my friend who else was home, I thought we were alone and we were being super loud, so I felt bad. She gave me the same look I'm used too by now (long story, let's just say I've seen some shit) so I tried to ignore it. It didn't sit well with me though, because I have never been able to hear the things I can see. Later that day, she freaks out when she finally hears it too, so we both freeze and listen as, clear as day, footsteps go from one side of the upstairs family room to the other. I still don't know if I should react, as she looks from the ceiling, to me , and back again, like it's a joke or SomeThing. The look I gave obviously told her I had nothing to do with it. Rather than call police… we decide to investigate... we were not smart people. 

We went to the kitchen near the stairs, and being the person I was at the time, I grabbed the biggest kitchen knife I found and lead the way up the steep old steps. In the hallway to her upstairs living room, there were giant piles of toys and laundry. As we were trying to get through this *quietly*, my friend tripped, and chucked the broom she was wielding (God we were stupid) right into the wall. She panicked and squealed loudly, finally freezing with her hand over her mouth. Eyes wide open looking at me, like `now what!?`. At the same moment we heard frantic footfall and scraping, followed by a huge slam. I held the knife in front of me and ran (towards the f-ing noise, no less! Wtf was wrong with me!?) Stopping just outside the play room. My friend (looking rightfully, scared shitless) came to a halt behind me, all brooms forgotten, and we both stayed silent. Finally, after catching my breath, I peeked around the doorway. No one was in there, but I proceeded cautiously anyway, cause where the hell else could they go?? After clearing all the bedrooms as well, we finally took deep breaths and decided we were obviously nuts. and stupid... until we got back to the play room that is. We realized there was food on the coffee table, and the tv was on. The sandwich had cheese on it, that was still cold, and the window to the balcony was cracked around the base. Looking out the window, we realized the trampoline was still set up to be able to jump to and from the balcony on... when her family was home later, they insisted it wasn't any of them. The creepiest part, is that for as long as we were there, they would have had to get the food out of the fridge in the kitchen right next to us for it to still be cold.","1404173486"

"Crouton","t5_2yv5a","tl;dr Crouton Chromebooks are a hacker's paradise.

I bought a C720 in January and have been using it 99% exclusively since.  It's absolutely viable as a daily driver; Linux only works great but I find myself spending more and more time in ChromeOS because of its simplicity.  

I've taught a university programming course on it and am running a company on it.  I've switched to an online IDE (Nitrous) that works for me because I do mostly Web stuff. But Sublime in Crunchbang linux worked great before that.  I still use Debian's Skype client for international business calls all the time.  Switching between the environments is a snap.  It takes about 5 seconds to boot into linux: open a crosh with ctrl-alt-t and `sudo startunity` or what have you. I run two Chroots- one Crunchbang for most stuff, one Unity Ubuntu I install Ubuntu-dependent programs in so I can avoid those dependencies in my main setup.  

Wine works as well as it does in Linux, which is OK if you have time to fiddle a little.

Still amazing to me that all this is running off a 16GB ssd that arrived at my door in 2 days (Amazon prime) for $200 all in. I bought a verizon Jetpack and have 4g LTE anywhere I go for less than the cost of an iPad.  Will upgrade to a machine with 4GB ram in a few months. Two laptops and an LTE modem still less than a Macbook air.

Also extra power cords can be as cheap as $8.","1404173489"

For example, the party is sent on missions that increasingly test their morality, and eventually they decide they'eve had enough. Maybe they're sent to quash a supposed rebellion, when it's really just a handful of citizens who protested at the mercenaries stealing their food for provisions. Or maybe they need to execute a prisoner, and they discover that prisoner is another Adventurer who tried to free a noble that the mercenaries are holding for ransom. Have the missions be things that have two sides-- the intel they've been given, and the reality that definitely doesn't warrant the mercenaries' extreme orders.

I'd also recommend getting a Ti step bit and drilling a hole in the MegaPot so you can install a ball valve for easy transfers.

I've never heard it at his house before but I've heard it at mine so I just brushed it off as no big deal. Then my cousin talks and says ""It's time."" I get kinda scared and ask ""What? What's happening?"" He says ""When the train comes through he shows up"" I freak out a little bit and just say ""What?! What are you talking about? Who?"" Then I see this figure at the foot of the bed just standing there, pretty wide like a bear standing, and like 6'3"" it's just a silhouette of something.

It's these announcements that are really throwing off the community I believe. On one hand the expansion of the Explorer Edition, and partnership with DVF show Google's commitment to Glass. But on the other hand the absurd price point and heavily degraded software (due to the updates since KitKat) point to something different. 

That being said I appreciate the announcement for a streamlined App acceptance process, and added staff to achieve this. Yet there is no public roadmap for what Google's plans for Glass are. It's these mixed messages that I believe are driving the community's general distaste for the direction Glass is heading in at the moment.


As a techie who's watched the insane rate of evolution in consumer electronics over the years, and as an Industrial and Service designer, it's baffling to me the lack of hardware and software developments for a product that was effectively launched over two years ago. Personally I believe there is some sort of mega super crazy consumer edition in the back rooms of Google X to be priced at $299. But I'm a dreamer though.","1404173496"

Playing the ""Isaac Was Good Today"" challenge as Judas (Select the challenge, press escape, then right 3 times) is a good strategy.

* It'll give you 3 Hp. Good Damage (Red tears), Flight and the Book of Belial.

* Aim to get the Pact/Mark out of Devil Rooms. Or go for Guppy. Brimstone is also useful.

* When you get to the set of floors, try and have an Emperor card, and teleport straight to the boss. Otherwise, beeline the boss (You don't get item rooms in this challenge)

* Treasure Map/Compass are huge. Especially if you have both. You can use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQrbQk04kE0) to identify the location of the boss if you only have the map.

* Cubes of Meat are great. Don't get 3 of them though.

The Spiderboy challenge is also quite good. It gives you Quad Shot and Slowing tears (Which are great)

"ketorecipes","t5_2t46o","Here's an adaptation from Caveman Keto's Chicken Cordon Bleu casserole:

48 ounces of raw chicken, cubed and sauteed - about 40 ounces cooked.
Saute in nonstick pan.  Drain.  

Put into rectangular pyrex or other glass casserole.

Cube 8 oz package cream cheese, 7 ounce ham steak and toss these with the chicken.  Sprinkle with Provençal seasoning if on hand or experiment with thyme, rosemary, etc.  

Mix 1.5 cups chicken broth with 12T heavy cream, pour over the chicken mixture.

Back at 350 degrees for 20 minutes (the chicken is already cooked).  

Put some kind of cheese (6 ounces) on top - gruyere or swiss is traditional, any kind will do.

Cut into 12 serving portions.  About 300 calories, 17g fat, 26g protein, 2 carbs.  Keeps well in refrigerator.  Good with steamed spinach as a side.

This recipe, in several variations, can be found all over /r/ketorecipes - but it's a start.

"dontstarve","t5_2v1jr","I use about 40 grass and 40 twigs then 30 berries for my farm. Then I have chests for fertilizer, extra grass, and extra twigs. It's nice to have something to pick during the slower days and there are always reasons to burn through those resources, especially the cut grass. I'd rather have a few stacks of 40 grass in my chest and never urgently need to pick again in my life than have just enough to scrape by and end up in a bind during an emergency. 

Also I'm not sure what the magic number is with farms but I have 6 turbos atm (only on day 120, and beefalo are a days walk away from my base and I only spent about 4 days collecting from the herd early on and I haven't been back since.) But 6 feels kinda lousy, I get 6 dragonfruits going, I need to burn 5 of them on the bird to guarantee I have enough seeds to replant, which leaves me with 1 DF per batch to cook, you can burn 4 instead and have 2 to cook but you are rolling the dice if you'll have to put a random seed in. Obviously you can just burn all 6 over and over until you have more than enough seeds to replant but it's easier to get up to that number with maybe 10 farms. Also I think turbo farms are a little overrated, I can only check the fields to often, it's nice when they are usually always up but with how powerful rain is in RoG I think the normal farms are just fine.","1404173506"

It's not. It's getting a call from hand that are beating us that we would check/call at any rate, saving us the 1/4 pot or more difference (villain's likely betting for 1/2 pot plus. I'm not using a blocker if i see villain has a tendency to fudge betsizing). 

&gt; Why not just check? I feel you get a check behind here a lot.

I agree. *This* is why it's not my favorite move. I would opt to check/call around 1/2 pot, fold around 3/4+ pot on the river against john doe.","1404173508"

| ASOIAF| ADWD| 5| Tyrion II| Tyrion Lannister| 1| Those followers of the **BLACK DRAGON** who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across the narrow sea, among them Daemon's younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat.
| ASOIAF| ADWD| 11| Daenerys II| Daenerys Targaryen| 1| The **BLACK DRAGON** had been flying north across the Skahazadhan toward the tall grasses of the Dothraki sea.
| ASOIAF| ADWD| 22| Tyrion VI| Tyrion Lannister| 1| The dwarf pushed his **BLACK DRAGON** across a range of mountains.
| ASOIAF| ADWD| 24| Jon Connington| Daenerys Targaryen| 1| The Stricklands had been part of the Golden Company since its founding, Harry's great-grandsire having lost his lands when he rose with the **BLACK DRAGON** during the first Blackfyre Rebellion.
| ASOIAF| ADWD| 57| Tyrion XI| Tyrion Lannister| 1| Elsewhere teams of slaves were raising ramps of stone and sand beneath their mangonels and scorpions, angling them upward at the sky, the better to defend the camp should the **BLACK DRAGON** return.
| ASOIAF| ADWD| 63| Victarion I| Victarion Greyjoy| 1| Yet it was from their lips that he heard of the **BLACK DRAGON**'s return.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","I see a lot of comments here using the word ""arrogant"" and I understand where the accusations come from, but I've been where you are.  

Being ""zen"" isn't about overcoming all of the negative aspects of living. Then there would be a yin and no yang. The search is for the Middle Path, where you are equally as invested in your inner world as your outer world. You recognize the good and the bad must coexist, good cannot exist without evil just as day cannot exist without night. The high and low points are both one part of the same wave.

The truth of how humans impact the world around them is a disgusting fact. It is not easy to come to terms with. But *you* are only responsible for your own actions. *Your* world can be a beautiful place if you chose to make the decisions that are most nourishing for your growth. Being alive on this earth is a very improbable blessing. Don't allow yourself to believe that it's something to escape from. Be a light to the path you walk on. Make this life your own personal heaven by being a beacon of light and love to all the situations you are put in. ","1404173509"

&gt;So how does one explain Terran's downfall? Grotesque statements such as ""Terran players are all slumping"" or ""Good Terrans all left Korea"" will naturally be disregarded with a frown; it makes absolutely no sense that all top players from one race start underperforming at the same time, especially—surprise, surprise—after a heavy nerf occurred. As for the other ""argument,"" only two Code S players left Korea between the critical seasons: Bomber and jjakji left WCS Korea while Hack (of Code S caliber) returned from WCS America. Unless 11 minus 1 (or 2 if you want to dismiss Hack) magically equalizes 3, we have to consider other factors than this mostly meaningless transfer. 

""Code Apocalypse: the Blink Menace"" and a bit before it. It wasn't just that people had left, but regulars who were still in Korea got knocked out.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Being from southeast Asia, I'll say that not only is the story plausible, it's also not that rare of an occurrence in my humble opinion. Back when I was younger, it was common for parents to tell their kids to really take care when relieving themselves in the forest, or in a place uninhabited by humans. This is because we know we are not alone, we share this earth with all of god's different creations, and we should take care not to offend anything/anyone if we can help it. For example, a dense jungle area could be a place where Jinns live, and just because we can't see them, it doesn't mean that we can trespass into their territory and desecrate it ad we please (Hence probably why OP's friend told him not to whizz on a tree, since it could be the home of a Jinn).

In college, I also had many encounters with my friends becoming ""possessed"" by Jinns, and even though I was really freaked out when it first happened (voices change, tones change, and even a girl can have incredible strength when possessed), but eventually I realized that I was more vulnerable when I was afraid, so I put on a brave face and even started talking to them. 

I've also heard of Jinns taking not only human form, but even all sorts of animals. It's not only possible, it's common in Southeast Asia where the practice of communication uwith Jinns is common. I'm telling you, Jinns are capable of quite unbelievable feats. However, we shouldn't forget that they are still God's creations, and respect them as such, without fearing them. I can think of so many different stories to share, but yeah, basically, the story could very well be true (details may vary here and there).

TL;DR: We are only one of Allah's many different creations, and there's just so much stuff about His other amazing creations that we don't fully understand.","1404173514"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","A little bit of back story my friend was 20 years old and a delivery truck driver. On the 7th February 2006 He hit some black ice on a back country road and rolled the van 3 times into a field and destroyed a telephone pole. His head was submerged in water however he was very fortunate the man behind him had stopped and kept his head out of the water until the emergency services had arrived.

He lost his right eye when the van rolled through the hedge at the side of the road. I am not sure of the name of the hedge but they have thorns which caused the damage. I was living in England at the time and received a phone call from my mother. My uncle worked with my best friend and he was the one who had to go to the scene of the accident and recover the van hence I was able to find out about the accident before alot of people knew. I was back in Northern Ireland the next morning and went straight to the hospital. I was allowed in to see him but I could not go in as I was petrified and most probably in shock. I remember sitting in the emergency room waiting area and his mother coming out and giving me a hug. I do no remember any more than this or a timeline after this.

He was sedated heavily on morphine and put into a medically induced coma for a week before the doctors could complete a 12 hour surgery. He has a glass eye now, this is the 8th one which took some trial and error to get right. The glass eye is made by a computer and machine but the measurements are all guess work. His first was ever so slightly too big which caused discomfort in the eye socket. The second was a good fit however the pupil and Iris were a mis-match with his left eye. Then after each operation there had to be alterations made to the glass eye because the socket would change shape also. This current eye is a great fit and the pupils match up most of the time and the Iris is a similar colour to his own. He has limited movement of the glass eye because of all the muscle damage he sustained in the crash however he can move it a little.

The main issue he has had was his right eye weeped especially during the colder months in the UK. Most recent operation was a little over a month ago and it was billed as 50-50 success rate to stop the weeping but so far so good and fingers crossed it has completely worked. When the accident first occurred he states the hardest thing was adjusting to the depth perception. He says it took 6 months to full adjust and it ""makes you a clumsy fucker"". We notice it sometimes for example if I throw him a lighter he will go to grab it and miss completely but we laugh in good spirits. He says learning to drive his car again and reverse was the most difficult skill after the accident.

This is a little album of his recovery and I am very proud of the fact that he asked me to share these images as I feel it is a very brave thing to do. This timeline runs from 2006-2014, he has had numerous operations and he has recently just had his last one. We may have a couple of more pictures if we can find them. My friend is watching as he was interested to see what peoples reaction would be but he is more than willing to answer any questions and we are having a look for photos that may help such as one of the van.

EDIT: A little more detail

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I will also add that offering support to someone doesn't have to be a burden. It can also be a blessing. The ability to help another human being overcome some obstacle in their life can be a rewarding learning and growing experience. It can teach you about yourself, help you discover new value and meaning to the order of the world in your life around you.  
  
The problem is that many people that do this don't do it healthily. And that is where most warnings come from. People often do it because they receive some kind of gratification and closeness, irrespective of the person being helped. And in an unhealthy way, it feeds their need for sense of self worth, or maybe even some degree of power and domination. This may be especially true when it is a romantic relationship that is involved. Because you have your own complicated emotions regarding a relationship all mixed up in this other psychological situation.  
  
This role would be best fulfilled by a close friend that has their own separate romantic relationship. But where there is enough trust between the friends to help with this issue. Unfortunately, for many people, that is difficult to achieve outside of a romantic relationship. So it often ends up in the realm of romantic relationships.  
  
If you can really shape your mind around this being an experience for him alone, irrespective of you (which is very difficult), this can be a great demonstration of grace within you as an individual. Which is incredibly valuable to learn from.","1404173517"

"thesims","t5_2rbdu","Woah... woah woah... ok, first of all, it is NEVER safe to just rip mods out and put them back in, and that's likely the cause of a few of your issues. NEVER safe. Just going to say that again. When you save a game with mods, you should really try to keep all of those mods in - save for a few exceptions. Removing a majority of your mods out of a save should be last resort and it should be done very carefully with a lot of saving and backing up just in case something gets messed up on the way out. 

Second of all. The Sims 3 is not a stable game. It will crash after playing for a long time around. Even when I play ""stable"" games, there will be the occasional crash. This is nothing to worry about. This is why I always encourage to save often and save as often. Never save and quit (those saves are more likely to become corrupted than the normal Save or Save AS button). After 4 hours of playing, it's not really a surprise that your game crashed, I mean this in terms of the game should be restarted every once in a while as a preventative measure - 8 hours is a godsend that you've gotten it to go that long. 

Your save has been corrupted, and that's all I can say on the measure. In layman's terms... your game has gotten a lot of little, itty bitty problems over time that have grown into big problems. The only way to fix this corruption is to save your family to the Family Bin (all of them) and move them to a new save. Pick the mods you wish to have in your game and be careful about adding and removing them. 

A lot of tech forums tend to irk me, as the first thing they do is shout ""take out your mods/CC!"" Which can cause more harm than good when fixing a solution sometimes. Once a mod/CC is in your game it starts to function as a part of the game. Taking it out of the game and loading the save will put that save file in a temporary freefall as it figures out where that ""part"" of the game went that it needs to load. If it was CC like Clothing/outfits, it suddenly has to think harder to generate more clothing/hair on those it was originally on. It has to replace objects and so on. Keep this in mind with your mods. Errortrap and Overwatch are on the low end when it comes to adding/removing, but adding and removing them a lot overtime can cause issues with corruption and errorlogs backing up the system causing your game to slow down. 

Remember: Overwatch and Errortrap are helpful, but they do not preform miracles. You have to be very careful with your saves - especially your important ones. Save As often with a new name to always have a backup to go to when your files start getting wonky. There's nothing you can do to save this file you're playing in except for moving the family/homes to a new world.","1404173518"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; Read through any standard college physics textbook. There is no chapter on multiverse mechanics

That's a bit misleading, for two reasons: first, it's more cosmology than physics, and second, you wouldn't typically cover this sort of thing at the undergraduate level, but it certainly gets covered in graduate-level cosmology courses.

&gt; It is more of a philosophy/science fiction/popular science/fringe theoretical concept.

It's more than that.  Multiverses are a direct potential consequence of some accepted theories, and as such, various theoretical physicists and cosmologists have worked seriously on the implications of this - people like Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, David Deutsch, Max Tegmark, and a number of the string/M-theory people, not to mention many others whose names are less well-known.

Eternal inflation, the quantum many-worlds interpretation, and M-theory are all examples of these ""respectable"" types of multiverse.  Working on these implications of the theories can help better understand the core theories, and also help identify ways to actually test for certain kinds of multiverses.

If any of these theories turned out to have validity, it could have a major impact in our understanding of our own universe.  Explorations at the boundaries of our knowledge like this are difficult in general, so the more information we can get, the better.  Exploring the boundaries and implications of the theories is one way to get that information.

"survivor","t5_2qhu3","Final 5!!!

1. Denise Stapley
2. Rob C
3. Vytas B
4. Earl Cole
5. Dirk Been

Finale Part 1: Denise wins immunity. Earl and Rob are seen as the biggest threats to win the game. Earl/Dirk are voting Rob and Rob is voting Earl. Denise/Vytas want Rob gone more but know that Dirk is too loyal (stupid) to vote out Earl next round which means an inevitable fire making challenge. Thus Rob, Denise, and Vytas vote out Earl 3-2.

Finale Part 2: Rob wins final immunity! He barely beats Denise in a balance contest (similar to Amazon's final challenge). Denise tries to convince Dirk to force a tie but he decides against it (after and annoying moral battle with lots of praying). Denise is voted out 3-1. 

FTC:
Rob's argument: I was a power player most of the game and flipped everything by playing my idol well which resulted in Tony and Spencer (the two biggest threats) being booted. I was targeted from day one as a threat.

Vytas' argument: I was an underdog the whole game. I had to flip back and forth constantly to insure my place at the end. I flushed RC's idol and am responsible for many game changing moves.

Dirk's argument: I played loyally and morally and I'm super lame.

Jury:

Mick: Understands the difficulties of being a leader because of Samoa. Criticizes the follower Dirk. Votes for Rob out of respect for his leadership.

Jane: Mad at Vytas/Rob for playing underhandedly. Calls Vytas a charmer and Rob a snake. Votes for Dirk for playing morally and being super lame.

Sophie: Calls Vytas two-faced/wishy washy but commends him on making that strategy work. Despite this she has more respect for Rob's game and votes for him.

Tony: Tells Dirk that morality and truth have no meaning in Survivor and criticizes him for not playing the game. Commends Rob and masterfully playing his idol to get rid of him and votes for him.

Spencer: Calls out Dirk just like Tony did. Respects both Vytas and Rob but votes for Vytas due to his underdog status the whole game.

Alicia: Ignores Dirk. Acts like a bitch to Rob. Mad at Vytas for voting her out but votes for him anyways because she likes him the best.

RC: Mad at Dirk for acting so moral but blindsiding her. Also mad at Vytas for blindsiding her and Rob for switching his vote. Votes for Vytas out of dislike for the other two.

Earl: Congratulates all 3 (classy guy). Calls Dirk a good guy but undeserving of the million. Calls Rob his rival and deserving of the million. Votes Rob.

Denise: Also congratulates all 3 (classy gal). Questions Vytas about voting out Jane over Tony and Vytas gives a typical BS answer. Denise claims that while she was a true underdog in her first season, Vytas placed himself in the underdog position by his own mistakes. Votes Rob.

ROB C WINS! 5-3-1

Discounting his stand-up like he's going to get destroyed is what 3 year old would call ""retarded"". I think all three (Weidman/Silva/Machida), have different style that play against eachother in different ways. 

-Silva like to stand just on the egde of dudes range and use his head movement/counters
- Machida uses his Karate stance to move in strike and get out of town.
- Weidman Stands in the pocket/clinch and boxes.

I totally believe if he can close the distance or get matchida against the cage he'll have the upper hand.

How people can have any doubts that he at least has a good shot at winning I have no idea.... But hey I just like using my head and knowledge rather then calling people on the internet retarded so what do I know.","1404173529"

1: I imagine the pass is just kind of a difficult one to make, since a defender is usualy bodyingup or close to doing so at the elbow. I don't think it does all that much to change the direction of the play as well.

2: I would say at the weak side corner so they can slide up towards to top of the key/wing if some of the side to side motion leads to a dribble drive.

3:no clue

4:I think the no switching is affected by how dyanamic these screens are. When the 1 screens for the 2/3 coming up from the corner, the defender guarding the 1 and switching onto the 2/3 would have to change directions. I also think the 1 could execute a backdoor cut in that moment of hesitation where they are switching directions.","1404173531"

My worktable isn't terribly steady and as such isn't conducive to hand planing.  I'm still progressing in short jumps my skillsetss of sharpening and hand planing - good enough for small things, but not bigger more special projects.

c)  Ain't that the truth.  I know it, I just don't have the time on this build to factor in ""training"".  I just need to start moving forward on it.

Thanks for the input!","1404173534"

1) Writers have nothing to do with photo captions or headlines. Any blame there generally lies with the editors.

One other thing about that quote: is it weird to anyone but me that they used Verlander's salary? Clayton Kershaw makes $30 million next season. To me, it would have been more impactful to say that every minor league player in every major league organization, all (approximately) 6,000 of them, could receive an extra $5,000 for the amount it will take to pay Kershaw for the year.","1404173535"

It was as if people were trying to understand my transition by trying to fit me in a gender role.

"watchpeopledie","t5_2u25v","I work in critical care as a Respiratory Therapist. Part of my job is managing the airway when a patient is in respiratory distress or when an impending arrest is apparent. 

During these situations I insert breathing tubes  ( intubation ) and manage the patient on life support ( ventilator ). 
With this type of patient crisis I stand at the head of the bed .  The majority of patients are unconscious. 
However , there have been many situations where the patient is awake and I am often the last person they see before being sedated or die. 

There is one patient  I will never forget that haunts me years later. 
I was called STAT to the icu for a cardiac event. 
When I arrived the patient was distressed and in SupraVentricular tachycardia or SVT  (life threatening heart rhythm). 
He was in an out of consciousness because his heart rhythm was changing from  SVT to V-FIB or  Ventricular Fibrillation  and back to SVT. 

I remember climbing over to the head of the bed and grabbing the resuscitation bag. My colleague was beside me preparing for the intubation (breathing tube ). I was waiting  for the patient to have a cardiac arrest , lose consciousness and then I would insert the breathing tube (intubate the patient ). 

I looked down and bent close to talk to him. he was mid 50's , married and had a teenage son.  
He told me repeatedly how scared he was and that he did not want to die. I promised he wouldn't die and that I would make sure of it. 
The problem was the ICU doc was not answering his page so a Code Blue was called.
The nurses were freaking out because we couldn't push certain drugs or cardiovert the patient without a physician present. 

As I talked to him we locked eyes and he grabbed hold of my forearm. 
several times I watched him fade out , pupils dilate , his grip would loosen. I looked up at the monitor to see the heart rhythm change again and he would suddenly regain consciousness. . 
Each time his grip would tighten on me , the fear in his eyes upset me. 
He asked me repeatedly  ""what's happening ?  
And  ""Don't let me die"" ,  ""my son, my son"". 

I watched his pupils slowly dilate one last time, his eyes still locked on mine and then I could tell he was gone. 
I intubated him and we did CPR for about 30 mins. He never regained consciousness. 
If you haven't seen someone die in front of you it's difficult to explain. You are no more , your just gone and it's final. 

To this day It bothers me I was the last person he saw as he passed. It bothers me his son will never know his father was calling for him. 

It is apparent to me when death approaches there is a sense it's coming and when it  finally takes you, life is turned off like a switch.

I have been working my way through Skyward Sword, so I have not played much of my games yet, but I have played some of them or their demos. The games with stars are games that I obtained through other means than the summer sale. Here's my impressions of what I have played.

***

**Ultra Baby's Co-op Chaos Pack (Battle Block Theater)** - I've played a decent amount of this with my 9 yo nephew, and so far we are having a blast!

**The Walking Dead** - I played the demo for this. I am not certain how I feel about it yet, but I do like stories affected by my choices, which I think this game has (or the illusion of). It is a new genre for me too!

**Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons** - My nephew and I played this together today, even though it is a single player game. We are enjoying it, and we both think it is beautiful!

**Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning** - I played the demo for this, and so far I thought it was awesome! My nephew played a little today too, and he loved it!

**Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3** - My nephew and I both enjoy Naruto, and we both enjoy this game. It is one of my favorite fighting games!

I have yet to try Brave New World, but I very much enjoy Civ V!","1404173540"

So, here's what happened.

Basically, I have a shy bladder. I can't pee if someone else is in the bathroom. Which is NOT easy at a big office. That being said, I was sitting in the stall, takin' care of bidness, and these two girls walk in. Let's call them Rachel and Monica, because I want to.

Rachel and Monica walk into the bathroom, and start talking about another girl we work with. We'll call her Phoebe to continue with the theme here.

Rachel says, ""Can you believe Phoebe is friends with her? I mean, seriously? The hick is BEST FRIENDS with the dyke?! How does that even make sense?!""

Monica: ""What is wrong with you? Jordan (dass me!) has never been anything but nice to you. Why would you say something so un-fxcking-called for?""

Needless to say, I was super happy that Monica was being so sweet and defending me, even though Rachel is a rude bitch that needs a rude bitch awakening. 

Also, since it happened in the bathroom, there's no proof. And Rachel and Monica, despite disagreeing about this, are best friends and always defend each other no matter the situation, so it genuinely is a lost cause.


It just makes me sad, more than anything, that all the middle-aged white women I work with are more accepting of my sexuality than the girls my age that work there.

It's knowing things like timing your call when your in a pileup, knowing to call QRP because DX contacts want QRP stateside, bands that work at different times of day and solar cycles, how to use filters, work splits, watching ALC if the radio has it, and so on.

Even if you're saying that you started out QRP from day 1 and got DXCC in a weekend during a contest (and I believe it is possible), I still contend that starting QRP for the average new ham is going to be a frustrating experience without having done an insane amount of reading and listening beforehand.  Nobody said to run out and get an Alpha and a SteppIR and run full limit to compensate for lack of skill or experience, especially since RFI and exposure is potentially dangerous at full limit.  But running barefoot QRO on an old used Kenwood or Icom will likely lead to better results for the average new ham.

We're also not talking about CW which, for a DX contact, can be even more difficult to deal with a pileup for a newbie when people are operating at 30wpm.

"everymanshouldknow","t5_2u82c","With the large increase in subs the content and character of TRP has changed significantly. They started with the intent to draw men out of abusive relationships where they were being used and abused. They try to teach them to become self confident/aware and to stand up for themselves and their opinions because they matter (everyones equally so). It was about drawing men back up to even ground with everyone else to the point where self respect is common. Then naturally that leads to aquiring ""alpha"" qualities to attract certain type of people in your life that you want. Regardless of what some women say a large portion do like alpha behaviour from their man (This does NOT mean abuse either physical or psychological but acting in a dominant and confident manner). However recently it has stated to fill up with self loathing, women loathing, pathetic ""Beta"" men who think just because they found the sub and read some literature they have become Gurus in all things sex. TRP is about self empowerment and the realisation that you matter, any relationship you are in (m/f, f/f, m/m) you deserve to be treated with respect. TRP teaches you to sieze that respect when it isn't being extended. It isn't psychological/emotional bullying when your partner needs to worry about losing you if thats whats required to make them respect you as a person and not a commodity. They do not advocate bullying at all, they push confidence in yourself being all you need to acquire happiness and that a partner should enhance your life not control it. The mods and early subs had their heads screwed on tight, and were aware of the nuanced games we play with each other because we arent confident enough in ourselves. Now the pool is just getting pissed in by the very people TRP was trying to cure.","1404173549"

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Have to disagree. Day of the Doctor didn't do any of that. None of it was wiped away, it all still happened just the way we saw it. What you saw in DotD was the Doctor's redemption for sins he never committed, but fully intended to. He went into that shack with the Moment fully intending to destroy both sides for all time. When he came out, both sides were indeed apparently gone from the universe, even if the details of how it happened were a bit fuzzy.

When the truth is revealed to him he was redeemed in his own mind. He wasn't a failure anymore. He didn't succumb to the depravities of the Time War along with the rest of his race. He was The Doctor, through and through. He found a way to fix things without needing to kill anyone. His depression (11), his anger (10) and his grief (9) still existed, are still very real, and were not dreamed away by the writers, but simply given context.

Imagine it as a man who thought he killed his family in a car wreck because he was careless all his life. He blames himself, even though he  doesn't quite remember what happened. Years later, after trying to help others drive and live more carefully, he finds out that a drunk driver was to blame for the accident, not him. That he was not careless, and because of his careful driving he managed to stay alive when everyone should have died. That's what this was. It was redemption.","1404173551"

My beef is that the complaints about AA/12 step are usually from people who are opposed to the idea of complete sobriety, or people who hate religion to such a degree that they can't see the organizations in any other way (ie. the Stanhope school of thought).  ""AA is not proven to do any good"" is something that gets repeated a lot (there's even a wiki page for it), and it's a direct comparison to nothing at all- despite the fact that the simplest search would find you results which would say otherwise.

Supposedly this is all about science and evidence...except I've not seen any numbers about the efficacy of Rational Recovery et al.  Wasn't this about what is most effective?

I do agree with this being a fashion/style sub (which I adore) but my point is sneakers can afford to focus on looks rather than functionality as they're not used for playing sports in.

But the mistake is clinging to an aggregate, in this case Fabrication.

* Right now I haven't done this very much, but in the future the human-curated mod descriptions will go out of their way to avoid bundled mods. Instead, packages can describe ""prerequisites"" and Kosmos is smart enough not to re-install a mod it's already installed.
* You can list using `kosmos list`. Here's the output when I run that on my machine:

    You have installed 22 mod(s) using Kosmos:
      * ScienceAlert
      * RCS Build Aid
      * Toolbar Plugin
      * Hyperedit
      * B9 Aerospace Pack - Fix for KSP 0.23.5

      * Kerbal Engineer Redux
      * VOID - Vessel Orbital Informational Display
      * Active Texture Management - Aggressive
      * RealChute Parachute Systems
      * Kerbal Attachment System
      * Safe Chute
      * Docking Port Alignment Indicator
      * Kerbal Joint Reinforcement

      * Distant Object Enhancement
      * Infernal Robotics
      * KSP Interstellar
      * Deadly Reentry
      * Ferram Aerospace Research

* Searching for available mods something I have planned but not yet added. However, Kosmos will help you if you spelled a package name wrong:

    $ kosmos install mecjeb
    Error: Kosmos couldn't find any packages with the following names:
      * mecjeb (Maybe you meant: ""mechjeb""?)

* Yes. Even if one mod modifies another mod's files (like Astronomer's Visual Pack does) uninstalling still works properly.
* As many as possible. This is why Kosmos is still in beta -- I already have over 100 mods ready with Kosmos, I want to have plenty of mods available with Kosmos before releasing it for real.
* This is a feature I hope I can add.
* No, I do not plan on having an ""update-all-mods"" function at the moment. I may add it if people really want it. Updating multiple mods at once is a *bad idea*. You should update mods one at a time to reduce the chances of annihilating KSP by accident.

Completely and totally incomparable. A *huge* amount of the people there don't even have the ability to haul out their garbage should they want to.

Dumping all of that consumed product into a landfill is the cost of profit. Its entire purpose is to be consumed and discarded. Everything you see in those photos. It is a statement in all sorts of ways, but don't damn the festival goers, who were just doing what they were supposed to do.

The Super Bowl, NBA Finals and Stanley Cup are all called the World Championship...

The foreign players have definitely taken over baseball, last year half of the all star starters were foreign players. This year currently out of the 19 players who lead their positions in votes 10 are foreign. 4 out of the last 5 World Series MVPs have been foreign and since 1994 there have been 13 foreign MVPs (out of 40) and thats including the 7 MVPS won by admitted roiders. THEY ARE GROWING STRONGER IN NUMBERS BY THE DAY.

Home Runs, Strikeouts, Spectacular plays in the field are all way up since the 70s. (Although Homeruns took a giant leap during the mid 90s/early 0s and has come back down to earth a little bit) while the time of games has gradually increased by a minute a year. If anything the game is a lot more exciting then it used to be. If anything wouldn't football be the slowest paced game? Considering the 30+ seconds it takes between plays?","1404173560"

Close range it's somewhat mediocre, but if you hit someone with it mid/top, it's pretty much a guaranteed kill/double/turnaround a gank, on top of those things you can usually take an objective too. I don't think anyone really uses it to soften up a target, as the damage just isn't high enough to warrant it.

As someone who plays Ashe a fair bit, it's really not hard to hit them from bot to mid/top. Sure, you aren't going to hit it all the time, but you will hit it regularly, and the risk/reward of it absolutely makes it worth the shot.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt; I'm on this earth to enjoy my life, If you want to tag along, you surely can. But I won't bend my knee for any of you ever again.

The message was more about not being a jackass to people. If someone is a jackass to you, you surely wouldn't like it, and so a reasonable and empathetic human being can picture themselves in another's shoes and realize ""Hey, if I don't want to be treated like a jackass, maybe I shouldn't be a jackass to other people.""

That being said, a relationship is between two people. There's a give and a take on both sides in a healthy relationship. The second you enter a relationship you now have a responsibility to another person's happiness as they do to yours. Of course there being varying degrees of responsibility based on how serious the relationship is. If you have two people employing the ""I'll do whatever I want without giving a fuck"" strategy the relationship will probably be a clusterfuck, even between two similar-minded people. Hell, this is the reason why everyone says not to room with your best friend.

Being who you are and being comfortable with that is important stuff. Having a partner that is also comfortable with themselves and you is vital as it becomes serious. But if who you are also happens to be a jackass then you're the problem, not other people. Either learn some empathy and change, or learn to be okay with the image of everyone lying their asses off about how nice you were at your funeral when everyone knows you were a jackass.

**Keep in mind I am not saying that you specifically are a jackass. I don't know you. But you seemed to have glossed over the main point of this post, which was: we're all people, and you can't expect a healthy relationship (Whether professional, romantic, or friendly) if you take, take, take without any give.**","1404173562"

"Frozen","t5_2vpth","Hm okay, I kept my comment really superficial for brevity's sake, but I feel I should explain myself.

If you make that joke among people who know that it's based on stereotypes, like your friends apparently, the joke is making fun of racism rather than being racist. And maybe people in China do drive like shit (I wouldn't know), but you and your friends know it's not *because* they're Chinese. So to me your example is fine.

However if you make that joke in public, like on reddit, it's also gonna reach people who actually believe these things, and then it becomes a problem. Because they don't know your intention behind the joke, they'll find themselves re-affirmed in their wrong beliefs and think it's totally okay to joke about. And as much as I would like to believe no one on here is like that, some probably are.

And then there's the whole thing with what the joke's actually about, because it can range from Asian driving to jokes about [insert minority] people being lazy/stupid. To me the latter crosses a line, given the social context of how there's still a ton of discrimination against basically anybody who doesn't look white.

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","I had half a fan fiction wrote up and some initial sketches - essentially this Avatar is a farmer who's arms are chopped off because a medieval Earth 'kingdom' military is looking for the Avatar but can't pinpoint him and burn down his village. The Avatar as a kid is already a decent Earthbender but without arms he couldn't do any bending for a while. 

He is inducted in as a slave, soon escapes, and goes into hiding, figuring out that he can Earthbend. He then discovers he is the Avatar and then travels the world trying to fight this military empire and other factions - it's a very law less land, the tenants of bending were still being set. In a lawless and mostly fighting period, bending is more ruthless and powerful. It's a combo of some other anime, a bit of Chinese history and reminiscent of the first series. 

I once had an idea of an interesting water bending encounter where he essentially uses waterbending to simulate ice arms. 

Thought it would be more interesting too to see how Airbenders in ancient times were like - we only see snippets/one or two Airbenders in the series. We don't get a very good idea of what the culture is like, or how more aggressive/activist Airbenders are like.

Then they steal my idea. DAMN YOU BRYKE!!! (Shakes fist)","1404173577"

I had already suffered so long to get to the Chest that I couldn't leave it at that, so I gave myself the items and things that I had at the start of the Chest through the cheats menu, so I don't know how that affected the item drops in the Chest. So the [first screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/qZTcbsr.png) is pre-blunder. And the [second screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dBeZfsy.png) is the ""final"" product.  

[Regardless, this was a challenging run since I was Eve and only had Jesus Juice as my damage up until the Mark and Steven in the Cathedral. I was relying a lot on my familiars for damage.

Anyway I would have to say beerhammer (finished beers can be placed as terrain.) in general. I remember playing a game against my buddy's Eldar and I had my Crons. I had just dropped my Deathmark squad with a pimped out lord and crypteks and I was about to light up Y'riel and one guardian with everything. I had my back turned getting my bucketful of dice ready. Meanwhile buddy is busy crushing his bud light and just as I go to roll he slams his beer down in between my Dms and Y'riel and let's out an epic burp. It took me a minute to take in the situation. He cut off line of site of most of my guys. Y'riel and the poor guardian survives my volley and ends up charging me and destroying my assassination squad. 

TLDR: beerhammer ","1404173579"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There was one time where I woke up around 3 something in the morning rather suddenly and, seconds later, my TV turned itself on. This was over ten years ago, so it was a tube (Toshiba, if I recall) and I didn't have a digital box, so when it went to a channel I didn't have, it was the dreaded snow channel. And that's where it was with the volume turned high enough as to be entirely unnerving. I'd been watching Adult Swim when I'd turned it off, mind you. My door was shut. Everyone was asleep. The remote was on my desk across the room, face up. 

Suffice it to say, I had to wait a full minute before working up the courage to turn it off. It's a good thing that I hadn't seen The Ring yet. But when I did, it hit much closer to home.

A similar occurrence took place about two years later, only this time it was my desk lamp. It was one of those bendy neck ones with the hard-to-twist on-off switch around the back. Same deal as before: I woke up seconds before it turned itself on. Again, my door was shut, it was 3 something in the morning, and everyone was asleep. 

This one is easier to explain away, though. I can imagine that I simply turned the knob a little too far past off and it just finally clicked back into the 'on' position much later. For the TV, I've always told myself it was a power surge that was responsible, but it's little comfort.","1404173579"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Copper IUDs (the Paraguard) work by blocking fertilization.  
Copper is toxic to sperm. It makes the uterus produce fluid that kills sperm. This fluid contains white blood cells, copper ions, enzymes, and prostaglandins.   In rare cases, when fertilization does occur, IUDs
may also prevent implantation.  An IUD could also come out and then a woman would, like a woman using no birth control, have about a 22% chance of a fertilized egg not implanting (because that happens naturally).  In studies comparing IUD users with a control group of woman using no birth control, the women using none had a much higher rate of implantation failure.  Another, way women cause fertilized eggs to not implant is by breastfeeding.  Sources: [IUDs block fertilization](http://www.un.org/popin/popis/journals/network/network162/blck162.html), [Study comparing IUD users to a non-user control group](http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/Sivin.pdf)","1404173581"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","After moving out of the dorms while going to college my former roommate and I got a four bedroom house with two other guys we had met at work.  The house was pretty old.  It had a dirt-floor basement, old-school fuse box, mostly two-prong outlets and a steep, narrow wooden staircase to the upstairs.  The stairs creaked very loudly, and the wooden hallway on the second floor also creaked pretty bad.  

I was home alone one night in my room on the [second floor](http://i.imgur.com/5pFRjcK.png) playing video games.  The only light in the house that was on was the one on my desk.  At some point I took my headset off and alt-tabbed to reddit, which is when I heard the stairs creaking.  I looked at the time and figured it was my roommate coming home from work.  The footsteps continued up the stairs, and down the hallway past my room and into my roommates room.  I couldn't see into the dark hallway because of my light.  The footsteps got to the room, and I heard the door to his room close.  

I wanted to talk to him about something, but I figured I'd give him a minute to change clothes from work.  A few minutes go by, and he doesn't come back out.  I go to his door and knock.  There was no answer.  So I opened his door.  The lights were out, and I thought for a second maybe he went to bed already (it was about 11:30pm) but I turned the light in his room on anyway.  

*There was nobody there...*

I noped back into my room, closed the door, put my headset back on and played more games at max volume until morning.

There were several more instances of hearing footsteps in the hall and on the stairs, not just from me, but also from the roommate who had his room on the 1st floor.  Also sometimes doors that you closed would be open again when you walked by them later.  I few times when I would take a shower and lock the door, I would get out of the shower and the door would be unlocked again.

TL; DR. Giant tower with 100 floors, where did it come from, no one knows, amazing treasure is rumored to be at the 100th floor.

Heres the very long version.
A thousand years ago, a massive tower of 100 floors height, (about 100x100 meter areals) emerged mystically from the ground. The great darkblue-black tower is made up of large shaped rocks. Rumors were quick to spread about an amazing treasure resting atop the very topmost floor of this tower, the origins of the myths unknown. Every floor bears a distinct theme. Some are just marble labyrinths. Some are miniature forests. The way up is always different per floor. Some have stairs, some have teleports. Long ago, people began settling on the bottom floors, making a fortune of providing gear and rest to daring adventurers who were going to venture up the tower. It is a dangerous journey though. Monsters and traps hazard many of the floors, and the trip is long. These bottom floors have evolved into civilization, lawlessly ruled by tough mafias and gangs. Some of the population has spilled out beyond the tower, even.

The PCs have decided to reach this treasure.

I would love input on the idea, and ideas for flavoring floors! And i do realise this was a bit more than 6-7 sentences. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, im on mobile.","1404173585"

&gt;America has many allies who have less constitutional restraints than Japan. If Japan brings itself into line with global norms on constitutional interpretations of defense, it does not mean that Japan is seeking to participate in wars of aggression.

If the US is pushing to loosen those restrictions, it does mean the US is seeking for Japan to participate in it's wars of aggression. This is common sense.

Non-STEM does not mean dumb.

Usually it is the technicians who are gung-ho about implementing cool new technologies, and it is the non-STEM folk who are more adept at interpreting the wider implications of that technology.

In the case of the NSA, there is nobody who has stepped up to be a grown-up and place limits on the invasiveness of the the technology, and the legislative framework disallows any external analysis of that sort.

Note that I'm not necessarily opposed to using ID as a Voter-Verification system. However, if you're going to use such a mechanism, then the State should provide these ID's (ID's that literally, only establish residency and potentially citizenry. Maybe an emblem on the ID for Legal Residents or those in the country on a Visa?) to the citizenry free of charge, assuming the proper paperwork establishing residency and citizenry are provided by the applicant. What I take issue with, is the requirement that the citizen provide an ID that he must pay for, which amounts to a poll tax. Sure, go ahead and leave the option open to use Driver's Licenses, et al, as ID. But in the case of the basest form of acceptable ID, it should at least be made available to the public, free of charge, in the event they provide the applicable paperwork, if you're going to have such a requirement to verify citizenship at the polls.","1404173586"

Even if it stores matter at an atomic/molecular level, though, the question would be whether it can transmute one atom to another (if it can't, it should be much more limited than it is; if it really stores things at a molecular level and can't transmute, it shouldn't be able to produce half of what it does).

Terran doesn't have as effective a harass as early in the game as an oracle, which forces terran into less greedy plays.

"52weeksofcooking","t5_2t4i2","If you're wondering what cube steak is, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_steak) is the wiki. Basically just a tougher cut that's been sliced up a bunch. This recipe that I discovered last fall, and have been tinkering with every so often since. On the side I had some braised kale with mushrooms, onions and garlic. It felt a little strange eating such a warming meal on a 90 degree day in New England, but still tasted great!

* 1 lb cube steak, cut into a 3-4 pieces
* 2 medium onions, sliced
* 1 cup beef stock
* 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
* 1-2 tbsp vermouth
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 4+ tbsp flour
* salt &amp; pepper to taste

Salt and pepper the steaks, then dredge in 2 tbspflour until dry and lightly coated.  Melt the butter in a pan with oil over medium-high heat. Once the butter has stopped foaming add the steaks, in shifts without crowding the pan, and cook until golden brown on both sides (don't worry about cooking all the way through). Remove from the pan to a paper towel lined plate. Add the onions to the fat (and the fond that's forming) in the pan, saute until translucent and soft. Add the remaining flour to the onions and stir to coat. Mix the worcestershire, vermouth, and beef stock together. Once the flour has begun to brown on the onions and bottom of the pan, pour in the liquids and stir, scraping the bottom, until the bottom of the pan is clean and a thin gravy has formed. Reduce the gravy for a few minutes if thin.  Once the gravy is near your desired texture, return the steaks to the pan and simmer to finish cooking for a few minutes.  Serve the steaks on a plate covered with gravy and onions.","1404173591"

Ultimately, the strength of the network that results is what will drive everything that comes after it. The mining is the incentive and with Litecoin, the incentive is strong enough to have created the conditions in which a transition to dedicated hardware could take place.

Naturally, what remains to be seen is if that network strength will translate into increased venture capital, business and development and ultimately, adoption. But I would say given the current trajectory, Litecoin stands a MUCH better chance of becoming a serious part of the conversation than it did in January.","1404173592"

You can also keep a player a max of 3 times. Also, and I think this is very important to us, you can only keep players you drafted. That way you get rewarded for planning your draft values and strategy as well sleepers without rewarding someone getting lucky on the waiver wires since you can't know if you are out bided until its too late. We kept the fee at $5 in order to reward good picks without discouraging keepers, while the 3 year limit doesn't allow keeping a top 5 player for dirt cheap indefinitely. ","1404173593"

Current SL mesh uses the industry standard COLLADA file format, the next Linden world will certainly use this or another industry standard format. 

Source Code Converters do a notoriously bad job with simple code and break with anything complex. 

Mesh texturing image files (including ""clothing files"") correspond to a set UV layout to texture a given mesh. Unless the UV layouts match exactly they will not work, attempts to morph one to match the other will simply cause distortions in the image. Any new base avitar (if they even have them) will not be using the old SL UV layout because it only has one arm that is mirrored to texture the other arm.

"randomactsofsteam","t5_2ta28","**Games:**I picked up Monaco during the Summer Sale.  I'm almost done with Marlow Briggs, I'll give that one a shot after.

I recently started Skyrim, but have put it on hold while I play The Witcher 2.  I was turned off to this game for a long time due to having a roommate that hogged the TV playing this game for HOURS a day for the better part of a year.  Two playthroughs on 360, then two more on PS3.  He was the kind of player that would intentionally stop doing anything interesting in the game after you'd sit down to watch and start doing something ridiculously boring (i.e. reading through in-game notes, repeatedly jumping or running to increase stats, etc.)  This is also my issue with the Fallout games; that and the VATS system that I am not a huge fan of.  

Everyone tells me I need to play Mass Effect.  Literally everyone.  I'm going to have to get around to it.  I try and only have one major game going at a time (more than 10-15 hours to complete) before moving on to another one.  I'm less worried about the shorter games.

Don't Starve is AWESOME.  I was actually gifted this game by a coworker last year.  It has a pretty steep learning curve, but it's totally worth the effort.  The games wiki is helpful with this.  My biggest concern with that game is I can't sit down and play it for 20-30 minutes, because once I start the hours disappear and before I know what's happened I've only got 4 hours to sleep before the daily grind begins again.

**Shows:**
Red Dwarf is now queued up on Netflix and Amazon because of your recommendation.   It doesn't seem The Mentalist is available on Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu.  I watched all of Fringe, it was awesome.  Futurama is one I've seen most of, but have probably missed several here and there.  Sleepy Hollow was definitely cheesy, but I'll probably stick around for another season.  (After all, it took me 2.5 seasons to give up on Once Upon A Time...)  and Supernatural is one of my guilty pleasure shows.  I continue to watch it despite the fact it has devolved into a massively incestuous on and off bromance between Sam and Dean.  

**Movies:** The first example that springs to mind would be The Others (2001) with Nicole Kidman.  Excellent movie.  See also: ""The Thing"" (1982) and ""The Haunting"" (1963).  

Might I recommend [Magic Magic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929308/) staring Michael Cera and Juno Temple (whom this movie introduced me too, leading down a rabbit hole of strange and wonderful movies) and [Killer Joe](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1726669/) also starring Juno Temple, alongside Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch and Thomas Haden Church.","1404173595"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 10 years ago me and my mom was spending the weekend working on restoring our old family cabin, an hours drive from where we live.

After a long day of work I felt a sleep on the couch in the living room. In the middle of the night I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming to someone in her bedroom (I can't remember what she said).
I jumped up and ran to her room and noticed the door being half open. I looked inside and saw my mom sitting in the bed terrified with a blank stare across the room.
I asked her who she was screaming to and she just said. ""Ehm.. I think I had a nightmare.. Go back to sleep"". I went back to the couch and fell asleep.

The next day while we ate breakfast, I asked her about the nightmare she experienced. She said she suddently woke up and saw a man standing in the room by her bed staring at her. And when she screamed, he slowly walked out of the room. When she saw me entering the room at the same time he left, she figured it just was weird nightmare. We laughed a bit and didn't talk more about it.

Later that day, on our drive home the really weird thing happend. The road from our cabin is really curvy and you need to keep attention to the road as it is difficult to spot oncoming cars.
We didn't talk much and I was in my own thoughts looking through the passenger side window almost falling asleep.

Suddently my mom yells out: ""Look, there he is!"". I turned my head fast but couldn't see anyone.""Who? Where?"" I said. ""The man on the side of the road there!"" She said, pointing straight ahead. ""What is he doing? Can't you see him?! No!! He's walking towards us"". She said. She jumped on the brake pedal and we went careening down the road. The car came to a stop half way into the ditch. My mom was panicking ""Where is he! Didn't you see him?! That was the guy I saw last night!"". 

At that very second a large semi truck came around the sharp curve in front of us at high speed in our lane. The world stopped for a moment and I made eye contact with the driver for what felt like a lifetime. He stod on his breaks and the semi rushed towards us like a big boulder. I didn't have time to react I just sat there staring into this guy whos desperatly trying to avoid killing us. By all mighty gods the truck stopped about 3-4 meters in front of our car.

No one got hurt. My mom went and talked to the driver for a couple of minutes and we drove of. We've talked about this episode a couple of times since, but she don't like talking about it. Nor does she want me to tell others about it.

I don't know what to think, but I'm positive that if she hadn't seen what she saw at that moment, and slammed the brakes, I would not be here today. I'm not a believer of the paranormal and did not see any man on the road or in the cabin. Still I think about this situation from time to time.

TL;DR: My mom saw an invisible man in the middle of the road, hit the brakes and saved our lifes.","1404173599"

1. The market does not provide the widget you currently want at the price you want it.

2. You want someone else to make your thing at the lowest cost possible.

3. You are willing to invest in development, not for a cut on the sale price but for the ability to buy at the lowest cost possible.

4. There are other people willing to invest with you to achieve this goal.

5. You will not get upset that third parties will benefit from your investment without paying for it as much as you did (though, they will finance the manufacturing of your widget by creating demand for it, that means a lower cost to buy for you).

You can't leverage IP on the design if you make the design open. 

I guess it is a good approach for user-designers. I think the autopilot guys were part of this category at least in the beginning and in the long run they benefit for a much more user friendly product that if a commercial firm put out an autopilot (which would be a black box you can't open or modify, and they would nickle and dime you to death at every turn).

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","35/hr is actually a very good price for studio time. I would highly recommend going into a studio and recording there. I would also highly suggest a few things.

1. Make sure you know your songs as best as humanly possible, an engineer said to me once that bands should play their songs over and over until they begin to hate the songs. Pretty much know them so well that there is no possibility for wasted time in the studio.

2. When you track drums, use brand new heads (you can play them in a little prior to recording) and make sure they are properly tuned. (believe me this will make a huge difference. Same goes for guitars, use new strings to record (even if you have to retune and adjust as needed).
The tracking phase is so crucial, I firmly believe that if a band is tracked properly, the songs pretty much mixes itself, all is needed is to make it more awesome than it already is. and try to stay away from the typical 'fix it in the mix' thing.

3. Pay close attention to what the engineers do, you can learn a lot from watching.

And to answer your questions

1. No, they are very easy, if the engineers don't know how to put tempo changes in a session, I'd find a another studio asap. I've been screwed by a studio once, and it sucked.

2. Of course, and if they don't, run! 

3. It really depends on how well you know your material. I've worked with bands that tracked over 15 songs in one day. But they know the songs very well.

Best of luck to you, and remember to ask for a multitrack of each song you guys record. You never know, down the road you might want to remix it yourself or have someone else remix it.

And it isn't rebind-able, unless one wants to rebind the mouse buttons permanently (in which case they are backwards if one is holding just a single rifle).

Also, most games/software call the buttons ""right-click"" and ""Left-click"" but they should really be called ""Primary"" and ""secondary"". If any developers are out there reading this, please don't make this mistake in your next project.","1404173610"

Satan refused because he said that man is not perfect and the only one he'll bow to is God.  And since Satan (God's like, number 2) disobeyed him and didn't worship man God cast Satan to hell, and 1/3 of the angels took Satan's side, agreeing that humanity was one big fuck up.  (This is just a story I read about the devil's side of things or some shit.)  I don't necessarily believe it, but it's interesting to think that we, humanity, is/are just a pawn in this aeons-old contest of who can piss farther......

Unfortunately the actual data doesn't fit your preconceptions.

The average wholesale price is ~EUR35/MWhr. i.e. 3.5c/kwh. As per the definition of average, this includes the fluctuations.

You can see the daily spot prices here - they don't actually fluctuate very much:

http://www.epexspot.com/en/market-data/auction/chart/auction-chart/2014-07-01/DE


Looking at the historical trend the average spot price is down from a peak of above EUR90/MWhr in 2008. Note that most of Germany's renewable generation has been installed after 2008.

This person will be answering the phone. You can for example say I want someone who speaks in a very neutral American English tone. So anyone with a hint of accent would be denied the job. Even if they are answering two phone calls a month.

Same thing for sex/gender. If you want a male just put in the job description must be able to lift at least 100 pounds. This would pretty much automatically disqualify virtually all women. You could even stretch this to disability. Again, even if this means they might lift up one heavy box once a year.

"Thief","t5_2rduq","Yeah that is one of the reasons I mention the Hold E, then tap everywhere. I got stuck in the first mission point of no return with that until I worked it out. Worst thing about those bits is they are only there due to last gen console limitations.

Ectors quest chain has better writing than the main game, and it is delivered via notes and books you find (which is why it is annoying that the lets plays I've found no one is reading the notes &gt;.&lt;). That completely optional set of side missions does a better job at explaining the world than anything else in the game, and after going through those missions as soon as I unlocked them, I was constantly waiting for those bomb shells to drop in the main story, for them never to eventuate. 

Considering the number of assets that were created that fit in with that, and then were used for a 10 second lift sequence later on... I assume that direction of the game changed to make it more ""cinematic""^aka ^more ^explosions ^in ^a ^stealth ^game

Since you do have the game, I'd recommend downloading a completed save game and going back and doing those missions if nothing else. Vittori's missions are fun too but are much more just get in, get loot and get out. None of these 6 missions have points of no return.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","If I remember from my Baltimore Catechism, for a sin to be a mortal sin (meaning so serious that it separates you from God's love, and will result in your damnation if you don't clear that shit up), you have to full choose to do that sin, you have to fully know that it is a mortal sin, and you have to know what that means (insofar as people can know what damnation means).  So that means the mentally ill, children, people in the midst of addiction, etc. can't really commit mortal sins.  It also means that if you think something isn't a big deal (""sure, maybe it's a little bad to masturbate to my sister-in-law, but it's not a huge deal""), then you are not actively choosing mortal sin, and thus aren't as culpable.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","&gt; Remind her she's a sexual being.

Here's the catch... she's not. She never was. Why would you think that she is? I made that mistake years ago and now I know better. 

I wooed her. Courted her. Did all the relationship building, romantic stuff. It didn't work. It actually had the opposite effect - if I did it with no expectation of sex, no sex happened. If I did it and hoped for sex, it made her anxious - ""we've been having such a great day together - but he's going to expect sex later and what if I'm not in the mood?"" Scented candles and backrubs, yada yada yada.

Sexuality isn't something that people have by default. Lust can be powerful in the beginning of a relationship, but long-term it fades, and when it does what you're left with is how that person feels about sex, the role it plays in their life. Sex is important to me, but not to her. It's just the way she is, the way she was raised. Look around at the mixed messages society sends and it's not difficult to see how/why it happened. I can woo her until my woo is all wooed out, but that isn't going to make her magically want to have sex with me, or anyone. She needs to have more of a reason to want to have sex, a benefit/reward that she actively wants.

&gt; People get married because they love each other so much that they will do literally ANYTHING to keep the other person happy, and their mate. For life.

This is incredibly romantic, but sadly, incredibly untrue.","1404173619"

Typically if I play her I'm letting the lanes I'll be ganking most about my tactics, and usually they comply. IE, bot lane leaving a low minion for me to Q to or Q away from. Her stun is reliable ""early on"" in my opinion since I can save a health pot and keep an eye on mids HP, if its lower I go for it. I'm not playing her generically, I'm making plays based on the situation provided. 

I also find her ult to be great utility, especially when pushed under turret. In one game I defended a &lt;300hp turret twice using her ult to clear the entire wave. Same game secured two kills with it. I agree there are better picks, but played correctly I've found she is a monster.","1404173620"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I just wanted to throw this out there if you're a jazz musician, if you play any kind of wind instrument, I don't know that you'll be back up and running in 2 weeks.  Piano might be cool, but my best friend had a full TT a few months back and she was pretty much physically out of commission physically for 4-ish weeks.  She was back to work (sedentary desk job) in 2, but for several weeks, she said coughing was worse than childbirth.  I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be to hold notes on a trumpet or sax.  I think some of it probably depends on whether or not your ab muscles need tightening.  Being very obese and/or pregnancy (my friend birthed 3 babies and lost 80 pounds) can cause the muscles to pull apart, and a tummy tuck often involves bringing them back together which can make any abdominal strain difficult and painful during recovery.

I get not wanting to tell people, and I've heard other people use a hernia repair as an excuse.  Recovery is similar, and sometimes it's even true.  It sounds like you have to tell your fans and social circles *something* though.  You certainly don't want people to stop showing up at your gigs!

EDIT: Just found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwV1F47Nzh8) about recovery time.  I honestly didn't realize it was 6 months!  My friend mentioned above is only 5-ish months post-op, and still a little tender.  Just FYI!","1404173623"

I na severu nije ništa bolje.

Šverc se vratio u modu. Hrana se pazari na pijaci. Vozila sa BG tablicama se vozikaju po gradu (i naravno plaćaju porez BG-u), velike fabrike propale, a one koje su žive su preselile sedište u BG, a neki i pogone. Jako velik broj firmi je pogasio kancelarije ovde i preselio ih u (najboljem slučaju) Novi Sad, a u većini slučajeva u BG. Upališ TV - BG. Otvoriš novine - BG. Zoveš call centar - BG. Trebaš da letiš negde? BG.

U međuvremenu, infrastruktura i troškovi za dolazak u BG su porasli, tako da mora i masa da pali za BG.

BG, BG, BG, BG... kurac.

Mada ima sve to smisla. Napraviš Beograd na vodi (hah, kao da će ga napraviti), i gle čuda, više od 3 miliona ljudi može da pari oči na to i da izdrkava na Vučića. Gde ćeš bolje...

I think for things like flying planes (all new pilots), driving cars (new drivers and the very old), and owning guns, that the pre-test probability * the risk of the action is too high.

All the best to you, and so glad to know that you are on the upward path of recovery. Many people have successfully used methadone to get off the dope train.

"Survival","t5_2qh7j","As someone who has ice fished most of their life, and someone who has taken cold water rescue courses in the past — **do not go on ice that isn't safe! If you are unsure of the thickness of the ice, assume that it is unsafe!** The only way that you should find yourself in OP's situation is if you chose to put yourself into it.

Falling into cold water is a great way to drown within seconds, as your body's uncontrollable reaction to that quick drop in temperature is to gasp for air, causing the aspiration of water. Then you have the body putting itself into cold shock, which can kill within minutes — basically through heart attacks. If you survive those two events, then you still have the very short window of time to get off of the ice, and get warm and dry before hypothermia kills you.

Be safe and cautious out there! Often the best survival techniques are recognizing and avoiding the danger in the first place.

If by some strange circumstance you accidentally find yourself on unsafe ice, or otherwise safe ice becomes unstable, the other posters are correct — lay down and distribute your weight over a large surface area","1404173633"

I had a complete radical hysterectomy. This means they took the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and my cervix. This gives you the best chance of not having endo recur. Since I had been on every other treatment option and none with long term success, most things lasted about 9 months or less, I knew we needed to be as aggressive with this treatment as we could be.

I am on a little bit of HRT. I use a patch with .1mg daily absorption. It's only been about 6 months, so it's still new but so far so good. There are also small pellets that can be inserted under the skin at your doctors office that sometimes work better if you have symptoms that return with the estrogen patch. 

I had thought about having a hysterectomy for about 5 years before I actually did it. I needed to know we had run the course. But that being said, I wish I had been ready for it sooner. The complete and utter change in my body since then has been awesome! I'm free to live my life and there are not any side effects so far, and my sex life is better, my mental health is better, my body is better...it's been a really good thing.

It started as a bit of an underground cult phenomenon and grew into a column that many admins around the world looked forward to following. The charm it created in poking fun at some of the job specific stresses was something many of us back then needed - and still need today.  

It is considered a pretty big part of IT cultural humor and there have been many spin-offs. Much of the ""bad admin"" funny stuff you can find on the net was probably inspired in part by this long running ""humorous"" series.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Let me start -- since these remarks are often mistaken by people -- that the following is not criticism, merely observation and opinion.

Like most people, you qualify the concept of 'science fiction' by a system of mostly superficial tropes. These tropes are not, however, central to the thematic form of true science fiction, which need not have *any* of them. At its heart, true science fiction merely speculates about reality as we know it tweaked or expanded in some *scientifically plausible* way. By that, the vast majority of what is popular called 'science fiction' does not mostly live up to it.

A lot of Star Trek, for example, is implausible BS. *The Wrath of Khan* is very entertaining, but it makes very little real sense. How the hell do some of the most qualified people from a starfaring society not know what planet they're on? No modern Navy would make the same mistake in respect to an island. (Never mind that even the explanation given barely makes any sense.) How does one of Star Fleet's best and most experienced commanders make a seriously fatal mistake in judgement that is absolutely key to the plot that follows? How does Khan remember the *one guy* he almost certainly *never met?* Later films only become even more insulting. As I like to say, the only thing truly consistent about Star Trek is its inconsistency. It's a complete textbook both in discontinuity and in creative retconning, all by itself. (Just wait till you find out the in-universe explanation for why TOS Klingons look different from later ones.)

Even Lucas didn't consider Star Wars science fiction. He called it ""space opera,"" and that's a very apt description. The first half of the original film is a tribute to Kurosawa's *The Hidden Fortress* (set in what Kurosawa himself calls ""a feudal Japan that probably never was""), and the second half is a brilliant reinterpretation of the WW2 thriller *The Dam Busters*. Star Wars is great fun, but it's also very easy to pick apart rationally, and so also fails the 'true SF' test.

Even recent 'serious' sci-fi fails, which I have to say disappoints me no end. *Moon* has some rational basis, but fails to hang on to it. I forgive the artificial gravity, because there are many practical reasons you have to have it in most popular SF, even where it's difficult or impossible to explain (and best not to try to). But my mercy stops there. The mix of technology is too broad to seem plausible. The AI seems childish, given its extremely important role. A lot about the setup comes apart too easily under scrutiny and questioning, and more. I still recommend it as a bit of worthwhile moody filmic poetry, but not as defensible SF.

And don't get me started on *Gravity*. I can't tell you how severely it disappointed me. Great to watch, and it has *some* worthwhile stuff. But also some really bad science. Which would be a lot more forgiveable from a film not trying so hard to convince of us its truth.

The last SF I remember being released that didn't commit any obvious violations of science was *Alien* (but not the later films). Before that, Kubrick's *2001*. It's a very disappointingly short list.

Most of what's billed as SF is what I call 'sci-fi' -- either flawed attempts at the real thing, or, much more commonly, other genres in SF 'drag' -- the system of superficial tropes I referred to at top. Most of them are either horror or war *inn spaaace* or *in The Future*. Many of them are rehashes of older sci-fi that's already been done many times: Machines take over, robots are sentient and must be protected / want to kill us, some people are superhuman in some way, magic pretending to be science because spaceships instead of wands, swords and sorcery, blood and thunder. Even Westerns: If you like *Firefly* (and I'd argue that all right-thinking people do), check out *Outland,* a 1981 remake of the 1952 Gary Cooper classic *High Noon,* here set on Jupiter's moon Io and starring Sean Connory. I love it, but it's a Western through and through. The sci-fi tropes are thick and rich, and delicious, too, but scientifically they are mostly nonsense, which sets this pretty far from true SF. Or for fun, I recommend *Galaxina,* a campy low-budget 1980 romp starring former Playboy Bunny Dorothy Stratton (only a year before her murder) and a cast of nobodies except Avery Schreiber, best known at the time for being in Frito-Lay commercials. Like *Outland,* it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, which is mostly a Western, and it's great fun; it's one of my favourite movies. I riffs playfully on a lot of sci-fi and Western stuff, as well as some more conventional movie fare of the '60s and '70s.

If you can find it, I also recommend *The Creature Wasn't Nice,* later titled the much less memorable *Spaceship*. Another low-budget comedy, this is an early satire by the folks who would later bring us *Airplane* and *The Naked Gun,* and stars Leslie Neilson. Patrick Macnee co-stars.

It's very hard to sell younger people on this stuff now, but some examples of films that to me hew much closer to the philosophical heart of true SF include *Forbidden Planet,* *The Lathe of Heaven* (again, good luck finding it, though Emma Lathen's book is easy to get), *Logan's Run,* and the original *Rollerball* (not the awful remake, which focused too much on the action and completely missed the deeper issues that were actually the whole point). A lot of these will seem corny now, especially the first one, but if you can overlook that, they address real scientific questions that to me are what define true SF. What if you really had great power, but no more control over yourself than anyone else? Would the world be better or worse if everyone died quickly and painlessly before getting old and sick? How would that change the character of a society? What about those who disagree? What if corporations really did take over, *completely?* What would that society be like, how would it be different from ours, would it be better or worse, and again, what about dissenters?

As an aside, I want to note that cell phones and Star Trek communicators are only similar in the most superficial of ways. First, even the word 'cell' is outdated, as original *cellular* systems are already obsolete. We're the only country in the world still using that term; everyone else uses the more general and accurate 'mobile'. But almost none of the millions of mobile phones in the world right now can do what a Star Trek communicator can do: communicate directly with an orbiting spacecraft all by themselves. Your mobile phone relies on a huge, complex terrestrial infrastructure that you can't possibly lug around with you, as well as the energy required to run it, which you could not stand to be that close to. I used to live near a mobile tower, and it had its own generators, with all kinds of warnings not to go near it or you might get killed. If you want to talk to a spacecraft today, you need at the very least a sizeable ham setup, and that's also much bigger than anything you can carry, and also uses more power than you'd want to be that close to. So don't let superficial tropes fool you. You're smarter than that. In the real world, natural laws trump everything else, even our imagination.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;""While rape is being reported more and more often, there is also the other side of the coin, where women will also report rape in cases where it isn't necessarily rape. If they wake up in the morning, and regret what they did, they can, and sometimes do, accuse the man they were with of rape. Even if that person had their consent that night, they are still accused and convicted of rape.

&gt;I am NOT trying to downplay the violence that is done against women when they are raped, or trying to say that rape does not happen. I am NOT one of the redpill guys. However, there ARE times when the woman is lying and those are the times that make it so difficult for men to take every claim of rape seriously. I've had friends accuse other friends of rape. I had a girlfriend that accused one of my best friends of raping her. I belived her at the time, and only after her and I broke up was I able to take a step back and realize that if he truly had, she would have reported it, and it would have been over and done there. I don't want to go into the details of why she would have, but the position that she was holding, it would have been simple for her to make that accusation, and have it stick. If it were true.""

A comment above yours is the perfect example of this.  In order to actually make any sort of statement or start any kind of reasonable discussion about a male fearing a false rape accusation he must immediately have some sort of statement that is equal to or longer than his original statement defending himself from those that would suppress, belittle, and ostracize him. He must have direct anecdotal evidence of the position he is taking, while simultaneously very obviosly agreeing to and recognizing the opposing point of view. That fear of the outcry against those who would stand up for male rights should be seriously considered when it is so prevalent in the only comments that stay above positive scores. To me that is proof enough of the bias in today's society against anyone who would defend men.

And this isn't to say that I don't think women's right's are important.  Or that rape isn't a very serious problem.  I don't mean to bring this up in order to detract from these other very serious issues.  Do you see what I'm doing yet here or have I gone over your head?","1404173639"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Oh how I understand you. I know what fear of rejection is... But you know... You can only fear it less by getting rejected. It's not a reason to go to every girl in a 10 miles radius, but still.

About the girl you've known for long... Yeah. I understand that getting rejected by her could be very very painful. 

I'd say... If you want to ask her out... Do it. Even if it makes matters worse between you two, it's worth it, for you. You deserve an answer. Your friendship might never be the same after that, but it's okay. You will know. 

I have tried to keep a ""friendship"" together with a girl I fell in love with and who I told my feelings to. It didn't work. Last saturday, after a ""fight"" on facebook, she said she was tired of my shit and my jalousy and decided to put an end to our friendship. We used to be close as shit, before I told her my love for her. People would mistake us for a couple, and tell us we looked cute together. And then afterwards everything changed.

But you know what ? I don't let myself get down because of this. I have refused rejection, become horribly jalous, and acted like an idiot to her. I had my part to play in the fall of our friendship. But I still don't regret telling her my feelings. Because if I wouldn't have... I would still be suffering today, from not knowing. Maybe our friendship would've continued... But it would've been a poisonous friendship, which would kill me slowly over the days.

If you really feel something for someone, it's ALWAYS better to tell it to her. Maybe not directly (don't pull a Ted Mosby...), but don't just stay and do nothing. You won't find someone who loves you as much as you do love them if you fear rejection.

Be proud of yourself, you're a human being, you have as much worth as anybody else. You can get through rejection, because you know that out there there's probably another girl that's at least as interesting as the one you've just been rejected by.","1404173646"

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","I can try to work up a list of mods when I get home tonight, but I'm sure it would be incomplete. 
The only one I needed for the counter rotation was infernal robotics. I used to powered docking washers mounted in opposite orientations on either side of the part that holds the living pods. The pillar down the middle has all of the fuel tanks in it so it is much heavier but the inflatable pods aren't necessarily light either and the way they are mounted gives them more leverage. Since the pillar in the middle is not heavy enough to resist the power of the docking washed completely, it will begin to rotate. By attaching a bunch of reaction wheels to the central pillar, I can use them to hold the middle still for docking. In this case all of the reaction wheels are mounted on one side of the rotating section, what is actually happening is that half of the central pillar is being held in place, the living pods are being by one of the docking washers and the other half of the pillar is actually being rotated the other direction at the same rate, so it appears to be still.","1404173646"

Relying on MvPs to level is a terrible mindset to come into if you join any server not just this server in general. I came and joined this server expecting MvPs to be camped and have competition and so should everyone else joining this server. I plan to contest the campers with my own knowledge and skill and honestly that's the way it should be. I will probably win and lose some mvps but that's what makes it fun to me.""

Having already featured twice in the Billboard 21 Under 21, where he ranked ahead of the likes of Miley Cyrus and Cher Lloyd, you begin to quickly see that Porter is no ordinary talent.  Growing up in the sleepy town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Porter began producing music at the tender age of 13, having caught the bug from Dance Dance Revolution.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'm going to reply to this non-top-level comment of OPs because in a sense I agree with him. 

The reason that you're getting this pushback is that people tend to reject ""ends justifies the means"" thinking, morally speaking.

If the only possible means to an end are unethical, then you probably should view the end itself as being unethical.

What you're looking for is generic actionable advise that anyone could follow that would result in women dating them. But women are different. The only kind of advice that is going to meet this requirement is going to be unethical advice that trades on the ability to manipulate *people* in general. 

The part I'll agree with you on is that there are a lot of people on reddit that are seeking this unethical kind of advice. There aren't a lot of subreddits that cater to providing this unethical advice, and there's a bit of a ""network effect"" that leads me to think that this kind of advice is a ""natural monopoly"", because it will tend to take over other competing similar kinds of advice.

So, yes, you're right. You can't find the kind of advice that you (and also many socially awkward narcissistic geeks) seek without treading into the dark side of reddit. 

Generic advice isn't going to have the effect that you want. The only kind of advice that will have the effect you want without being unethical is going to be specifically tailored to you and the person that you want to date (or at least a specific and reasonably narrow individual type of person that you hope to attract). 

And reddit isn't a forum that's well suited to providing individualized advice. The reliance on groupthink to upvote good comments doesn't lend itself all that well to advice that is so tailored as to be applicable to only a small number of people. 

All that said, the great thing about reddit is that it's an open platform. 

You can create that subreddit if you find the existing ones lacking. 

That will take real effort, and real passion, and... ironically... would be pretty likely to result in increasing your success in dating if it were respectful, and focused on treating women as individuals rather than prey. 

There's some actionable advice that you could take. ","1404173649"

Could you please provide an argument for this assertion? Namely, why your position about language/communication is right as opposed to mine.

&gt;I don't think this is a good reason to deny animals a place at the table of emotional thought.

I do not deny this, as I've stated in my comment. 

&gt;If I break my leg, but don't tell you I'm in pain--does that mean I'm not in pain? Possibly.

However, the CAPACITY of humans to understand and share intelligible utterances provides a stronger case for the phenomenological experience of other humans. That's my point. Your argument of the person in pain doesn't refute the fact that our capacity exists despite various instances of deception. Again, this does not deny that animals don't have emotion - I'm arguing that other humans have phenomenological experiences of pain, and we have good reasons for it, which you argue against here:

&gt;The only way I see your argument working here is if you replace the word ""humans"" with ""I."" By your own account the only way you would be able to observe the pain of other humans would be through ""reactions"" that may not ""parallel how [you] experience pain.""

---

&gt;But I'm willing to bet that a study of nervous-system responses would be a more telling procedure.

My argument doesn't deny the practicality of this procedure...

"GiftofGames","t5_2tb4r","Hmm... That really depends on who wrote the book and how they presented the world today doesn't it? I guess I'll try to cover the utopian point of view even though I would want to disagree with it. However, looking at history, all the book would have to do would be to present the information in a ""patriotic"" way and people would love it.

In the mid-1940s the world was in a state of war. This is something we all know of as common knowledge. 

Now, I don't know how many people who have entered live in America, but I myself have my entire life and felt what it was like to be embroiled in the ""patriotic"" feeling of getting revenge for the attack on 9/11/2001. A common saying here is that everyone can remember where they were when they heard about the attacks. Even I, who was in fourth grade at the time, recall sitting in my classroom working on social studies when one of my teachers open the door panicked and yelled that a plane had hit one of the world trade centers. I went to a school with 70 other students in central Texas, so we only had one T.V. available and it was in the principal's office, so he set it up outside of his office high up so everyone could watch. 

I was only 10 years old, so I had no idea what was going on, nor did anyone else know why a plane had struck the tower. Another followed and several teachers screamed. Worse was when the towers collapsed and many teachers covered their mouths in horror at the scene before them. The rest of the day was a blur to me, I remember getting home and hearing my father on the phone with one of my uncles and screaming profanities about the people President Bush had announced were responsible. In fact, I remember pretty much everyone having a great desire to pray and support those who lost their family members in New York. However, what everyone wanted even more than that, was revenge for the fallen and *everyone* seemed to search for justification to do so. 

The above is what would determine whether we would be considered a dystopian or utopian future. Many, if not most, Americans today believe that our founding fathers and others in our history would shake their head at the world today, but for what reasons?

**Utopian point of view**: The contrast between *Nineteen Eighty-Four* and today's America is actually quite staggering. *Brave New World* did a much better job, in my opinion, of predicting what the future would hold. History has show, at least for America, that we see war as justification for hatred.

Before 1941 had rolled around, America as a whole actually wanted to stay out of WWII due to reasons like the depression which had recently gripped the people. Why would you want to go and fight someone else's war as well? What reason did America have to get involved? 

Skip to 1941 when Japanese fighter planes attacked and destroyed a good part of Pearl Harbor. Nearly 2,500 people were killed in that attack, and it had results that I'm sure many around the world saw as unexpected. The average US citizen reading a newspaper now had extreme zeal and urged everyone around them to support a war against the Axis powers. 

But that's not all. America had a history of hypocrisy justified by things like the Bible or whatever else was needed to keep things from changing. Slavery was kept at the inception of America which was founded on individual unalienable rights due to the belief that slavery was fine as it was within the Bible [Ephesians 5-6](http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm) and a few who attended the meetings to form the 13 states said that they would not support things unless slavery remained legal. The compromise of course was that imported slaves would slow down and eventually halt twenty years later, but the belief that people had the right to treat others as less than themselves was common. 

Women couldn't vote until the 1920's. Racism was still alive and well. And what happened after Pearl Harbor? The rights of more citizen within America were taken away as justification that they may be spies for countries that they were several generations removed from. Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, and even Italian-Americans were placed within internment camps with conditions that left them with no privacy and barely fed. Something which I believe the average person today would see as unjust correct? 

What about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny? The hundreds of thousands of Native Americans who were either relocated or lost their lives didn't see too much justice or care from the average citizen did they? The average citizen was never told that they should care about them  by newspapers.

What Americans should care about had always been told to them by newspapers, radio, and eventually news networks. People rarely disagreed and if something was being presented as patriotic and you were to try to disagree, you would of course be called a traitor or even a spy. 

If a book were to come out in 1945, during or even directly after WWII titled *Two-Thousand Fourteen* and sold well, I'd imagine that if the information presented within was from the point of view of a patriotic citizen who believed that this was necessary for safety and as a result of 9/11, then it would be seen as something close to an utopia.

America now has advanced information systems, better travel, computers and cell phones that allow for instant communication, and even mass production of foods that look like great advancements and welfare for everyone alive. The cost of individual liberties would simply be an afterthought and would most likely be presented in a positive way. The NSA is an organization that ensures that no spies would be able to enact their attacks, the loss of freedoms would simply be overlooked and other parts of society would be looked upon as amazing. Individual liberties would be sacrificed for the sake of progress while the government would control the troops and thus be the most patriotic part of America. 

America has a bad track record of securing the rights of others around them, ESPECIALLY when there is a war to justify that loss of freedom, rights, or privileges. I dare say an America broiled in war would look upon today and draw parallels with what they were going through. They would probably imagine that it would be the world that they would see in a decade after the war was over and may be happy with what they saw. 

Us vs them is a very strong incentive for taking away the rights of human beings and ignoring the pain that many go through. Not just for Americans, but for humanity in general. 1984 was presented as a communist utopia where the average citizen was lied to and the protagonist hated all of it, but what if it was presented by someone patriotic for the system who covered all of the advancements in technology that were made? 

Of course it wouldn't be seen as a straight utopia, but America today would probably be seen as something close to it.

"SocialDemocracy","t5_2sjw0","It's adequate insofar as explaining social democracy and why it might heavily restrain the permissible cases made for violence as a revolutionary measure, but I vehemently disagree nonetheless. I have a lot in common with social democrats, but this is one point I don't. But, in terms of ""does social democracy preclude violence?"", I can accept this explanation. I don't, however, find the *why* satisfying.

That argument comes very close to the ""religion is the only way people know what's right and wrong"" argument. Violence might be necessary to entirely reestablish a system that is entrenched in kleptocratic free markets. But once that happens; once there is a system in store that allows for democratic ownership of the means of production, even if there are residual flaws, it should be easy for the revolutionary to realize that the time for fighting is nil.

For those who might be concerned that this sets a poor precedent upon society: concern away. Sure, someone might try to upset a socialist system and revert back to capitalism, but you have to remember: even if current conditions aren't ideal under a socialist system, socialism is going to be supported by an overwhelming majority of people in society. The only way capitalist elements have such strong military power to begin with is their capital and the ill means by which they attained it. That's gone once they are violently uprooted from that position.

Lastly, all of the answers I've gotten here say ""no violence, unless A, B, C, or D"". The reality is that there are very few places that don't have those specific conditions. Seriously, the only places I know of where violence should not be employed according to the responses are Canada and Norway. Every other place in the world is subject to limitations and conditions that would make social democracy and gradualism impossible.

In a sense social democracy then falls into two identities:

- I support gradualism and fuck everyone else.

- I am a social democrat in this particular case, but I identify with other movements where this system is impractical or impossible, i.e. everywhere else in the world.","1404173651"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","in the summer of 2008 me and my friend's decided to do some illegal camping in the woods. (Farmer doesn't mind as long as we clear up after ourselves) 

We camped in these woods quite a few times, but this time was weird. Leading up to the woods were disembowelled animals, we didn't know what it was. Anyway when it got dark, after setting up, camp fire roaring the works. One of our friends goes into the woods to pee, this guy is extremely level headed , he came back in shock and said ""There is something out there, around waist height black, with teeth and claws and can climb trees"". We all laughed, until one by one we all started to see it. Well I decided to sit down, away from the fire, I'm opening my bottle of beer, and one of my friend's come over and said ""Dude don't move just look up and slowly back away"" there I was face to face with a Panther in the English countryside can't get more messed up than that. Well thing's got weirder and weirder, some people didn't see but other's did got to the point where, we made spears and hid, our level headed friend passed out a tent, and the Panther walks in the tent, then leaves he didn't know it was there. 

Two week's later we heard in the new's that a wandering Panther was seen on a few occasions going to Colchester, the Zoo picked it up.

We then went to camp there again after hearing the news, well... must of been a different Panther... the local supermarket never seen 5 guys with kegs slung over our shoulders, munchies under our armpits, and cigars in our mouths run for our lives...","1404173651"

"climbing","t5_2qk72","How exactly are you planning on rigging this system? I'm not really a fan of the croll as anything more than a backup so I don't have much insight there. Generally speaking you shouldn't be allowing *any* slack in your system if you can at all avoid it. You want to weight the rope so that it will self-feed. This is especially important in the first few meters of climbing where the rope weight won't necessarily be enough to make the system feed smoothly. 

I've got significantly more experience using grigris, micro/mini traxions, and Soloists for this sort of thing but might be able to offer some insight into the particulars of your system if you describe it in more detail. As with all things soloing, you should really make sure you know what you're doing and ideally seek out some in-person instruction from someone who can show how things can go wrong and how you can self-rescue if you get stuck or something jams. 

So yea, give more details and I'll try to offer what I can. Try to get some real hands-on instruction. Don't die. ","1404173655"

And all these liberal talking heads that know just how to fire up their base with, ""See how the Christian right is HOLDING WOMEN HOSTAGE/WAR ON WOMAN'S VAGINAS by not letting them have birth control?"" It's absolutely ridiculous. If you want your insurer to pay for your contraceptives you shouldn't be working for a family-owned evangelical Christian company to begin with. 

The problem with America socially is that we implicitly (and often explicitly) believe everyone needs to think like we think, while paying lip service to the adage, ""We need to respect each others' beliefs.""

Hannibal is outrageous, unbelievable, but more essentially, plot-driven.  I find with the majority of the CSI type procedurals, a weak boring plot is giving a sexing up by throwing in a murder and a rape.  They've outstayed their welcome, in my opinion.  They bloat television with unintelligent excessive violence-for-the-sake-of-violence.  Murder isn't a plot alone.  NCIS, I will concede, is better than the CSIs for that. 

We do actual have a lot more rape plots than we used to on British television.  There was a slew of rapes in our soap operas, combined with some historical/period ones that just glorified rape as 'buxom lady in pretty dress gets pounded'.  I think that's another part of the problem I perceive, in that the rapes are there for titilation, rather than plot.  They're for want of a better term - 'sexy rapes'.   When have we ever seen a bloke get raped on these shows?  When do we see child abuse/sex abuse? When do we see elderly abuse?  The go-to violence is always man-on-woman, like it's acceptable TV viewing.  ","1404173660"

It is true, however, that you could conceivably get in trouble for offering advice that is *tailored* to someone's specific situation if, for example, the person thinks you're their lawyer, relies on the advice, and gets into trouble.  In responding to internet comments, though, I imagine the risk is slim.

Additionally, I can expound about the law in general as much as I like.  Providing general information about the law that is not tailored to someone's situation is not giving legal advice.  I suppose there's some gray area in there, when dealing with hypothetical situations, but I think even hypotheticals are generally ok to respond to.","1404173662"

heh I could care less if you're white, cis, religious, etc. Hell, I don't care if you think she's a man, it's about you making a big deal of it. why not use gender neutral pronouns?

&gt;Sex isn't though.

can we compromise and say male and female when applied to humans applies to their gender and not their sex except when otherwise specified? I just want you to be nice :(

&gt;I doubt it. Maybe as combative, but I don't really get upset from stuff going on online. It's understandable that you're upset. A lot of people dislike trans people and society isn't very accepting of them.

heh, probably cause I'm bored. I'm sure you're a cool person in general, and me calling you a statist is just to show how sometimes for the sake of business and getting along, you might want to not ""lie"" about someone's gender, but at least not actively challenge it (gender neutral pronouns are perfectly awesome and should be the norm except maybe when it comes to discussing sex and other gender-specific topics)

&gt;I figured it would be which is why I considered not talking to you about it at all the first time.

well, you'll piss someone off eventually, good thing you did it to an ancap so you know I won't freak out and dox you or anything. I just want to see you have a more non-confrontational strategy for business, debate, and socialization. I don't want to force you to or necessarily think it's best for you - I'm not a statist - but it's in my interest you do so when we have ancapistan I don't throw up or feel tempted to kick you out every time you visit my business.

&gt;Well the comment that you responded to I'm pretty sure I was saying I preferred Snowden's methods to Manning's. And who doesn't? I also said I don't know if what Manning did actually did a lot of good, besides the info that was put out. I don't hate Manning.

Personally I think Snowden is having a greater impact than Manning. I wasn't challenging that Snowden is ""better"" than Manning, but rather that you implied a us vs them thing as if Manning is bad. Add the gender thing and it seemed like you just wanted to be an asshole to them due to their lgbtness, even if it was a subconscious thing.

The Bucks ultimately get something they normally couldn't get.  A year-removed hot coaching prospect.

You have to post 9 links, for 1 link that is your own? I thought it was simply posting a lot of your own comments etc around Reddit per link you submit as well.

Edit : The rule states : Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.

Clearly your content isn't getting voted down and it isn't seen as spam, so it seems pretty ridiculous to make you follow the ratio rule.","1404173673"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was a few years ago, on the day after Thanksgiving. 

Some background: My wife and I were living in a nice house, in a nice neighborhood in our city. Property values were high, houses were gorgeous, crime was low, etc. 

So the day after the big meal, we were both just sitting in the living room, reading, drinking coffee and making casual conversation. We were just having a nice, subdued, relaxing day. Looking back, probably one of the most lazy yuppy days of my life. We even had some candles going because that's how we roll. 

Anyway, mid-afternoon We heard our storm door open and a knock on our front door. We weren't expecting anyone, and it was a very loud knock. I rose, looked out the window next to the door, and saw the most terrifying person ever. He looked to be about 50, with long, grey hair, in ratty jeans and a denim jacket. He kind of looked like Bob from Twin Peaks, but not as photogenic. 

He couldn't see me so I waited for a second--then he looked at the door and knocked again. As I watched him, I could see his eyes and they were completely black. He stared at our door for a few moments. I snapped out of it, told my wife to get to the back of the house. I have never been panic-stricken like that. 

We waited for a few minutes, then I crept over to the window... just as he was walking down our walkway. He kind of faded away, and neither of our neighbors had been visited by him. It still creeps me out to this day--vivid memory.","1404173673"

I think playing the vocal line and THEN doing the cutups is kinda backwards, maybe hit us with the WAHH WAHH WEPP first and then then reveal the full vocal. as they say ""better striptease""

it's weird how arpeggios just, like, ALWAYS work. they fit in very well here.

i know the the pitched-down satan vocal at the end of the measure is like THE genre thing to do, but maybe delete that and try something else? you've got room to experiment right there and you're obvious good enough that you could do something fresh. is that too critical?

you know, how weird is it that i gotta say....the track doesn't even NEED the Ain't No Mountain High Enough vocals! i know it's a good way to trick the fickle internet audience into pressing PLAY but the vocals come in so rarely it's like you're saying ""yeah, i know i don't need them either""

maybe make an alternate version with, you know, yourself barking into a mic or samping some voicemail and then the track would be entirely yours. you're QUITE good enough that you don't need marvin gaye to save you.

Three cowboys sit around a campfire, their herd asleep for the night in the field. It's hot, it's sticky, and they're all a bit irritable.

They're playing a round of poker and, as it so happens, they begin to insult each other, and--of course--the question of manhood comes about.

""That's ridic'a'lus,"" says the first cowboy. ""I'm manlier thihn any y'all."" And without another word he rips off his Levis, straddles the fire, and lets his balls roast for a good 10 seconds. 

He steps away from the fire with a mixed look on his face, a cocktail of pain and pride he's not quite sure what to do with. But he feels he's made his point.

The second cowboy has other thoughts, though. ""Pah, that's nuthin,"" he spits. And, likewise, he rips off his Levis, straddles the fire and begins to squat down on it, until the flames are licking his scrotum. He does this for a good 20 seconds, fighting to hold back the look of utter torture on his face. When he's had enough, he, too, steps off the fire, pulls on his Levis, and says, ""Ha! That ought'r teach ya.""

The first cowboy shrugs, and after a moment, all eyes fall on their silent comrade.

Right, and I was sort of arguing that this 1/4 savings is nullified by the times we get raised off the pot from hands that have us crushed, namely savvy players with AQ, AJ type hands (but also mean-level players with 44 and 6x).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I wasn't going to post but reading other peoples comments, I feel obligated to tell you how bad our wedding went. 
1st thing to go wrong: we got married in a very small and rural town so only one place to have the reception, supper, and dance and that is at the community center. Problem was there was going to be a mountain oyster fry the week before but when they opened the doors, they discovered the electricity must have shut down which meant rotten mountain oysters in every fridge and freezer with the rancid smell. It was so bad, they threw out all of them but the smell stayed and was still there a week later when we had our wedding (even though we tried everything to try to freshen it up during the week prior).
2nd thing: an older women related to more than 70 percent of the town passed away and her family decided to have her funeral the same day as my wedding....in the same church.....immediately before. 
3rd thing: since everyone is Catholic, her family had visitation and rosary the night before, right before our rehearsal. So rehearsal was done surrounded by funeral flowers and with a casket up front.....and crying people interrupting (she was in her 90s so it wasn't like the family didn't expect it but it was a funeral)
4th thing: the jewelry store lost our wedding rings (found out the day before).
5th thing: 10 minutes before our wedding, I looked outside to see my husband sitting on the curb in shorts and a cutoff shirt. Asked what happened...found out his mother forgot his tux at her house....30 miles away.
6th thing: finally married, pictures taken, go to reception to see the guest had decided to pop all of the balloons that my family and I had spent all day blowing up to make elaborate decorations. In fact, all the decorations ended up either taken down or stolen before the dinner even started...including the table decorations that where handmade and meant to be presents for bridesmaids afterwards (cut out and hand painted wooden designs).

But...we still had the most fun and have been married for over 24 years.","1404173682"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","&gt;The general argument against that is that it'd be against the idea, honour and ethics of the game to divorce the rules for the amateur game from the professional one.

I think that's a fine argument, but I don't think it applies. 

As said elsewhere in the thread, youth and amateur level soccer doesn't see much diving, it's once you get to the higher levels that it becomes a problem. You don't need replay in youth or amateur events to determine if someone dove, much like high school American football doesn't have instant replay/challenges etc. But it becomes necessary at the highest levels (college/professional).

To me it's not changing the rules of the game or significantly altering it, it's allowing better enforcement of something already illegal that is mostly problematic at the highest levels of competition.","1404173684"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","His entire argument could be summed up to  ""Nobody deserves that kind of abuse, including women"". While I completely agree with that message, it's not like anyone is actually is doing anything about men who are abused this way either. There isn't exactly an outpour of men and women out there looking to make things right and stand up for men. Other than the men's human rights movement, there really is nothing. Feminists, if anything, have gone pretty far out of their way to shut down, insult and attack men who do speak up about that kind of abuse from women, all the while defending the misdeeds, entitlements and misandric attitudes of women towards men they deem to be disposable or inadequate. 

  When men are taken advantage of or have their weaknesses exploited, people(women especially) either don't give a shit or just ridicule/belittle them for being victims. When women express satisfaction and glee over treating men this way, no one actually reprimands or penalizes them for it. When men try to speak up about their experiences, they are branded ""nice guy tm"", neckbeards, losers, virgin shamed or women haters.  

So, what else is there? how else would your average men be expected to handle it? Bend over and take it for the rest of their lives, continuously dreaming of and longing for the love that will never be given to them? Kill themselves? Learn to be just be happy with a sexless and loveless life? Those aren't very good solutions, and it's not like any one man can change the way women, or the world, thinks overnight(or in their lifetime) either.  Most women don't want to change the way they act or feel about men, fewer still even understand or care about how their behavior can be harmful/destructive to men(and, in some ways, to themselves). How could you not expect this kind of response from men when these are really the only workable alternatives that are given to them?","1404173684"

The main problems you have in competition now, aside from lack of dev support (a lot of dev's believe occupy is a good mode for competition, but they hate spawn camping - doesn't make sense), is that the main competitive mode which is firefight, it used to be VIP, is symmetrical. Often times when a team is losing they will camp their one objective for 3-4 minutes out of frustration. We can't really afford to all die because the other team is camping so we camp ourselves with the middle point. You get this really drawn out match that isn't very fun for anyone. This is why symmetrical game modes don't work except maybe CTF and that's usually only in games like Tribes, UT, or Quake where turtling up will eventually cost you the game.

I love the core game, that much is obvious or I wouldn't still be here... there are a lot of directions I wouldn't have gone with based upon the community feedback, my experiences in indie games, and my experience in the FPS world but whatever - this really is a great resume builder for NWI and I think they got what they wanted. There is another game coming out in Q3/Q4 that I will probably move to for its competitive nature and its entirely new take on FPS's.","1404173686"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Seriously? Ok, the ""="" sign was a mistake on my part, but I clearly said earlier several times that in utilitarianism it is ethical to maximize utility AND reducing suffering or the negatives, so you'd have had to try pretty hard to misunderstand me.

Look I've already explained to you my initial problem with your statement and I'm glad that you recognize the problem.

&gt;A) The distinction is meaningless

Well not really, most people value the well-being of their fellow man over an animal, hence why animal testing to produce better medicines even exists. It may be objectively meaningless, but being human is the difference between being granted rights and responsibilities and being the property or food of another species.

&gt;B) Being the subject to our ethics means our rules apply to us, it does not mean anything about the rules. The rules can still be ""reduce suffering in all sentient beings"". What you said means that we should not expect turtles to be nice.

That is true, whats also true is  that our rules are not ""reduce suffering in all sentient beings"".

&gt;You would have to explain the nature of the dilemma: is the disagreement about whether or not something is wrong, or are they arguing about how wrong it is?

Its a disagreement about whether something is right or wrong.

&gt;In the first case, one of them is not a universalist

Ok, how do you determine which one?

&gt;As I said, I wasn't appealing at all. Also, appealing to authority is not technically a logical fallacy.

I don't remember claiming appealing to authority is a logical fallacy. Its a form of argument that leads to a logical fallacy when misused.

&gt;But it is a philosophical debate. And you are having it.

Oh, but it isn't. You are the one who keeps bringing up moral universalism and other schools of philosophy, my initial argument did not include them at all. I have been debating with you and trying to provide supporting evidence.

&gt;This is basically an appeal to the majority.

And when referring to morals and ethics which are decided by the majority it makes sense to make such an appeal. You haven't adequately demonstrated what makes something objectively moral or immoral, instead just pointing to schools of thought. 

&gt;The meaning of a word can not be changed depending on the opinion of the majority, because then the word loses its meaning.

Its funny you should use this example because yes, the meaning of a word CAN be changed by the majority, and it has throughout history. Peruse is a fine example in that it now means the exact opposite of its original meaning.

&gt;You say you are a moral nihilist; give me one good reason why I should be one. 

Because morals are demonstrably subjective and you've yet to demonstrate how something can be objectively right or wrong without appealing to authority.

&gt;You actually don't think it is anything wrong with e.g. torturing a child?

Nice try.

In answer to your question, in my opinion it is wrong to torture a child. Because it does not coincide with what I personally consider ethical. This is a subjective stance, and in a world where the majority believes torturing children to be moral my opinion would hold little weight and people would be free to torture children regardless of what I think about it.

Objectively, there is nothing inherently wrong with torturing a child. Morals are not facts, we cannot find evidence supporting a particular set of morals or ethics. There may not be anything inherently wrong about it but that does not mean that humans are not capable of deciding it is wrong and hence refraining from the practice. 

Counter question, if everyone believed it was moral to torture children except for you, what would make you right over all those people?

* Ned goes from the Eyrie to the North and calls the banners
* Makes it to Riverrun and marries Catelyn and conceives Robb
* Marches to fight at the Trident, then to KL
* Rides to Storm's End to lift the siege
* Rides to the ToJ and find Lyanna
* Ned comes home with a newborn son who was born around the time of the Sack of KL in 283 AC (more than a year after Bobby's last known Lyanna sighting), with a newborn Robb also waiting at home

My decision to not bow to their rules does not mean I don't love them (though my mom would say otherwise--she sees my marriage as a ""slap to her face,"" but she is unhealthy). I have to also emphasize that it's the family's choice to disown, not your gf's. Hence, they are the offenders, not her. You get one chance  to live your life. She may have experienced a more loving home than I did, hence  why she is wavering a bit. And I have to say, most parents will come around. I was shocked at how accepting my dad was when my husband and I got married in May at the courthouse. My mom still hasn't spoken to me, and that is her problem. I have done nothing wrong. On the plus side, I have  three siblings, and they all adore  my husband and we get along great. Parents are not always the loving and accepting people that we want  them to be. We have  to live our lives anyway.

The friends and family that love you two will be there for you no matter what religion you profess. Those are the people you want to surround yourself with. I hope your gf is doing better. It's traumatic to lose a parent and be wracked with so much guilt and sadness so suddenly. ","1404173688"

The Shadow Over Innsmouth has the whole ""deep ones are fucking our women"" thing as an allegory for Lovecraft's views on miscegenation, and then you have Yog-Sothoth impregnating Lavinia Whateley in The Dunwich Horror, so there's clearly SOMETHING going on here, but I'd say it's more likely just Victorian prudishness and a bit of child abuse mixed with the fact that Lovecraft saw miscegenation has one of the scariest things EVER and so coded it into his work.","1404173689"

But you can't just go home, not after coming this far. You have to do something. So you grit your teeth, close your eyes, whisper a prayer to whatever gods might be listening, and take a step, hoping against hope that lady luck will side with you.

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","You want a list? Ok, I have some time. Let's look at some of the common semi-auto malfunctions that revolvers have zero chance of experiencing. We'll just consider semi-autos that don't have manual safeties. Forgetting those is a very popular error that you will see every day if you work on the range. But let's assume we're talking about a DA or striker-fired semi.

1. Limp wrist jams. (Serious issue for women, but also for wounded men.)
2. Malfunctions due to improperly seated magazines. (Serious issue for women, who tend to require significant training to smack their guns around. But mag releases can get bumped afterward anyway.)
3. Malfunctions due to worn magazine springs.
4. Malfunctions due to bent or damaged magazine feed lips.
5. Malfunctions due to incompatibilities between a handgun and the shape of the bullet. Many semi-autos are sensitive to bullet shape. Revolvers can easily handle wadcutters. And ammo of widely varying overall length. No need to shoot a bunch of test ammo to confirm function. With any semi-auto, you should always shoot a couple hundred rounds of any given ammo before carrying it. Particularly compact carry guns, as those tend to have cramped feed paths.
6. Malfunctions due to friction. A gummed up revolver will have a heavier trigger pull/cocking action. A gummed up semi-auto won't work at all.
7. Malfunctions due to worn recoil springs, or recoil springs that are not well-matched to the power level of the selected ammo. This is another item that's particularly important with small guns, as the slide doesn't have the same mass as a full-sized pistol. The recoil spring becomes relatively more important. A typical .357 revolver can handle everything from light .38 to hunting loads without blinking.
8. Malfunctions due to physical interference. Ever seen a person shoot a semi-auto with their thumb behind the slide? Remember, this is a recommendation for people who probably won't get out to shoot much. Never mind ""shoot it in a purse"", I've also seen semi-auto slides get tangled in floppy coat cuffs. Does your girlfriend like the fashion for long sleeves that can cover the hands?
9. Slide locking back due to thumbs bouncing into it with recoil. Again, can be eliminated with training. But it does happen. A novice under stress is going to encounter Murphy's Law.

With revolvers, what are your concerns? Is it in good working order? Not broken? Timing good? These are easy to confirm. And if you're not shooting thousands of rounds through it, a revolver's likely to *stay* in good working order, and be so when you need it.

The downside is lower capacity, and a heavier trigger. But that's a fair trade to eliminate *all* of the above.","1404173701"

The blurring, blueish hued light emitted from the screens of a wall of monitors, glowed in the otherwise claustrophobically black room. In front of them sat a man, though that description by that point in his life was questionable. His eyes scanned the data that quickly passed over the screens, each one containing a separate set to be examined, yet he did it with ease. Behind him a soft bubbling noise emanated, coming from unseen tanks, containing unseen horrors. Necessary horrors.  Because for him, these horrors were an answer- for him. For the human race. Though no one else could see it. But he had, and he acted accordingly to the revelation, actions, that if they were discovered by the authorities, would surely have him branded an outcast of society, and revoke his status as a scientist...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cain looked quizzically at the shattered glass tanks. He stood in a blindingly white room, aside from the red that was painted over it at parts, and in front of him were five large, broken tanks, which at one point housed something that floated in amniotic fluid. Whatever creations that had been kept inside of them were big. What was truly curious though was the trail they had left. The trails of amniotic fluid went much further out of the room, but the blood only made it halfway across the room before it stopped. ‘Well, whatever they are, there’s only one thing we’re here to do.’ He thought to himself, finger lightly caressing the trigger of his weapon, walking back to his team. They were all part of a group, whose sole purpose was the elimination of the creations that had arisen through the monstrous advance of science in the past century. Clad in black, with weapons made specially for the mission of dealing with these things, they were in fact part of a private organisation, and not an extension of the United Government.
  

‘So what do you think we’re dealing with?’ He asked Ingvar, a massive man whose origins lay in the part of the world that used to be called Norway, and the leader of their unit. He was a symbol of strength to the others, and with good reason- he was almost unbeatable in all areas of skill and physical ability. Unfortunately though, he never spoke much, probably because of his heavy accent that made it hard to follow at times. So when he opened his mouth to speak, all he said was ‘Big. Regeneration. Intelligent.’

‘Intelligent?’ Cain asked, wondering what gave him that idea, to which Ingvar pointed to the door the fluid left out of.
  

‘Door is fine. Code locked.’
  

And it was true, The door was unscathed, and had been sealed by a terminal. So whatever it was, it had known the code, and they knew it wasn’t the man who had done it, because he was all over the room. They occasionally had to side step to prevent him falling on them.
  

‘So?’ Cain inquired Ingvar, meaning to ask what they would do next. He was met with one word that summed up the plan nicely.  
  

‘Hunt.’","1404173702"

Being physically unable to hold the elections in half your territory is a good reason to postpone elections. 



&gt; No it would have been what was required by the actual process of democracy. 

Palestine is a nation that is composed of the West Bank and Gaza. Like how the USA is a nation that includes the East and West of the USA. If elections for president of the USA are not going to be held in half of the USA then it makes no sense to hold elections until you can physically hold national elections. That's what the PA did. 

&gt; Apparently the leaders of Hamas and Fatah wanted it until now.

They both wanted unity, they just disagreed on the terms of the unity deal. Now they agreed. It took a lot of negotiations. At no point did either side want to remain divided. 


&gt; Not really, because if elections were actually held then it could be used as a PR victory. ""SEE! We are holding elections unlike Hamas. Look at how much better we are"" 


The PA could have held elections in just the West Bank and Abbas would have easily won reelection. However the Palestinian people aren't retarded and would know that the leader would not be legitimate because he would only be the choice of half of the citizenry.

I think it would add the most to scary/horror games and the first person perspective.  
For example in a long hallway the music would be claustrophobic, with instruments closer together and more reverb with some echo down the hall.  You could even hook into this as an input for dynamic music. 
This added to dynamic music would add variety based on the surrounding environment both shifting instrument location and by making the environment the sound field.  
You could probably do raycasting with instruments having a direction and averaged percent of a few rays.  Instruments could be fixed to the character or tile out as if they are walking through the music with instruments crossfading to a new tile.  
I can guarantee EA would licence such a system for deadspace if it was better than what they are working on.  They do use dynamic music.  This is exactly the sort of system they'd want.  I point this out as it's not an easy project and there is some money in a good system.  Both PC and the new consoles can handle it however sound and music has gotten little attention.  ","1404173706"

Its the fact that because of the owners religious views their CORPORATION is able to deny payment of basic medical care. Maybe if the ACA covered abortions then OK. But contraception are not abortions and the dumb fucks who say it is are the same ones who think the earth was made in a few days and that the devil put dinosaur remains in the ground to test their faith. So in essence this country has become a religious fuck up and those of us who aren't dumb are paying the price. Contraception is hard to pay for when you are on minimum wage. I have a slight suspicion that most of the women this effects are on min wage or close to it. Thus by not paying for it they are essentially forcing people to make decisions for where their money goes. Do they buy their contraception or do they buy food?

Will(A)(B)(O),
Alma(B),
Vanila(B)

I was thinking/it has been suggested to me, of going Atro as leader with the 3 wills and vanilla. Does this sounds like a good team given my units? And how well will this team fare in the long long run?

also, is Valkyrie's next evolve any good?

Why?:  Because for every pamphlet saying how bad it is, there will be 5 printed up with some official sounding name spewing some pseudo crap science jargon.

The FORCE is much different and more functional. You can't pinpoint a single exercise to a  specific evolution in the test. You just have to be in generally good shape. Anyone can pass it though.

But don't use that as an excuse to just get by. Also, a lot of people will tell you to hold back so that you don't stand out. Personally, I think that's bullshit. I think everyone should put out to the best of their ability, because that's the kind of people I want to work around.","1404173716"

"AppalachianTrail","t5_2stbz","I apologize for everyone downvoting you: [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)
&gt; Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. 

Personally - as both a gun owner and a hiker - I disagree with your reasoning. Regardless, I think you can do this in a safe and reasonable manner if you so desire for SOME PARTS of the trail. Sadly, I think it will be illegal for a fair portion, but you can mail the gun to your next location when it is legal again. 


Downsides:

****

Weight: (Addressing this for general hiking as well as AT)
&gt;mega mega heavy!

&gt;10 pounds of dead weight.

&gt;Extra magazines? the locked case you've mentioned you are carrying with you to go into the post office? Cleaning kit? gun oil? (you're not going to carry your firearm outdoors for 5-6 months and never clean it, right?)

*Mostly all wrong*, gun and holster with a loaded mag can easily be under a pound and closer to 8 ounces for smaller guns. She isn't going into a firefight and doesn't need a bunch of magazines, and she isn't using it so for the most part it doesn't need cleaned.

Still, it's a pound of something that isn't needed. **Genuinely - I think you would be statistically safer with a pound of medical equipment than with a gun.** 

Regardless, a pound isn't prohibitively heavy. Moving on:

*****

Legality - It's illegal in a large part of the trail. I hate to say it, but I do not think you will be able to legally do a through hike with a gun.

You said:

&gt;Not OK with New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. But I think the Federal Park rule would make it OK as long as I didn't leave the trail, with the exception of Maine. 

&gt;Apparently in Maine you're good as long as it's unloaded and in a ""locked"" container.

&gt;Any thoughts on this?

&gt;The USPS rule is still difficult. That being said, if it's unloaded, disassembled and buried deep in my bag, I can't imagine how it'd ever be an issue. I doubt they have metal detectors in the USPS stations along the trail.

1) **Don't bring a handgun into a post office.**

&gt;[Handguns and other firearms capable of being concealed on the person are nonmailable unless mailed between the parties listed in Exhibit 432.2](http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c4_009.htm)

2) You are NOT GOOD in NY, NJ, MA, CT based on the [Federal Park rule.](http://www.nps.gov/appa/parkmgmt/firearms-information.htm) as the federal park rule doesn't cover all of the trail in the above states.

3) You really really really need to do more research on where you can take it. You probably believe that you can get away with it, when it is illegal, by simply having it concealed / in your bag. You are **probably** right. For the most part, no one is searching your bags. However the penalty for illegally carrying a concealed firearm is very high, and not worth the risk.

4)

&gt;I'm willing to accept that some states won't allow me to carry, open or concealed. I'd be open to storing my weapon away for the duration of my journey through those states, if that would be OK/not illegal, if it meant I could feel safe and secure for the rest of my journey in other states. (I'm not happy about it but I'm willing to compromise. Shipping a gun is a headache.)

In the states which it isn't legal to carry open/concealed - having it in a locked container won't help you. You **will** have to ship it out. 

*****

I wish you the best of luck both hiking, and hiking and feeling safe about it. Genuinely, I feel more safe sleeping in my tent on a trail hiking than any other time. ","1404173718"

I don't know how he got his first premise, ""In about 50 years – 1935 to 1985 – we went from 20% of women in the workforce to 60% of women in the workforce. Assuming a bit under 100% of men in the workforce, that’s an increase of almost 50% over the expected trend if number of women in the workforce had stayed constant""

Here's historical [employment to population ratio](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO)

At no point in the last 50 years is there any suggestion that all men are working or 60% of women are working. Maybe he means 100% employment of 25-54 year old men? Well, [he's closer to accurate there](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LREM25MAUSQ156N)

Majority of 25-54 year old women are [employed too](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LREM25FEUSM156N)

"". The GDP data is totally false. I am suspicious of that GDP data anyway"" Mate, GDP growth weighed down in conjunction to population growth is a more telling analysis, here's what it [looks like](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/USARGDPC) notice how it goes from exponential to linear?

""I’ve already admitted I find the fixedness of the GDP trend bizarre. But how on Earth do you unexpectedly raise the number of people in the workforce by 50% and still stick to exactly the same GDP trend""

Because women entered the workforce in the 70's to supplant their husbands income, because [wages have stagnated](http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/productivity-and-real-median-family-income-growth-1947-2009/).

That being said- I also work in lumber, sing in a band, I'm a decent shot with any gun you put in my hands, and I smoke, drink, and curse like a sailor.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","This debate was about picking Trist into Kassadin. And no, you don't have to eliminate Trist's constraints if you eliminate (what eliminate, they don't really exist in the first place lol) Kass's. That makes zero sense, they are entirely different spells. Trist's requires kills/assists to reset, Kass's does not. Trist's has a slow-ass, easily interrupted wind-up animation, Kass's does not. 

So let's sum up, shall we? Why would a team pick Trist into Kass?

1. Late game scaling. OK great, Kassadin scales insanely late game as well. The difference is even at absolute *max items*, Trist needs at minimum 3secs to kill or take someone low enough to force them out of a fight. Kass needs *less than a second* to do the same. The reaction time for the Trist player getting dove by Kassadin has to be much much higher than the reaction time for the Kassadin wanting to avoid or mitigate retaliation from Trist. And I think I've already covered the animation time of each champ's mobility spell enough.


2. Safety, resettable jump and knockback. In a *best case* scenario Trist can get a total of 8 gap openers in a teamfight. In an EVERY FIGHT scenario Kass can get a gap closer every 3 secs for however long the fight lasts. How about a more realistic scenario? Trist probably has to waste AT LEAST one of her 2 initial gap openers on the enemy top or jungler diving her. Does she get a reset for her W? Maybe, maybe not, depends on how fed the rest of her team is, if they can get a kill while she's focusing on surviving and killing the tank line/Kass. Now do you see? Do you get how there's innumerable variables involved, many outside of the Trist player's own control and skill level, determining how slippery she can be? How many variables are there determining how elusive Kass can be? Just one, his own *personal* skill and timing and items (Zhonya's, Seraph's).

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","Which goes back to Father's point, that certain aspects of modern psychology have an agenda, which is why those recommendations have changed in his lifetime (along with numerous other psychological recommendations).  I'm also old enough to have seen these recommendations change, and I've seen what other changes have taken place in psychological opinion, so I can see the over-arching agenda at work.

I don't use their site or the link as an argument from authority *per se*, just as a convenient reference to a fact that **should** be obvious to all concerned: 

**Children at young ages do not have the moral or intellectual capability to understand some forms of discipline which modern psych has recommended, e.g. ""time outs"" and ""reasoning.""**

To think otherwise is to fall prey to the old canard that some things are so stupid it take a guy with a doctorate to understand them.

------------

Also, a consistent theme of this discussion is commenters taking the idea of spanking out of context, e.g. ""don't hit your kids"" which equates spanking with beating.

It seems somewhat unreasonable that an organisation cannot assume that a person with a disability consents to their carer or guide being present when personal information is being collected. 

The findings of the AIC indicated that the other passengers may have heard the PI, but it was not a conclusive finding; however it was a finding that the sighted guide did receive the PI. The disclosure of personal information to the guide was sufficient to amount to a breach. 

Taken to the n'th, that would suggest that organisations need to obtain written approval from disabled persons before their carer can receive any personal information. I would suggest that would be quite confronting for some high-care people.","1404173723"

It has more cultural diversity than most colleges and I still get singled out for being black! And as a a balck that is in college, I don't see any benefits if I'm not an athlete.  Most don't.

My family lives in a mostly upper class neighborhood. We are one of 3 black families. White people run most of the free world man. We see what whites as a whole do and have done to other cultures.

I jumped on the deal posted at Dappered and picked up a charcoal cotton one for $95 or so.

I'm also in the same boat as you with the suit sizing.  I always get a 40L and just have the sleeves shortened.  The jacket hem is normally acceptable, but it's pretty easy to shorten that a 1/2-1 inch as well (maybe more, but too much and it'll mess up how the pockets sit).  Just make sure the buttons on the cuff are non-functional.  Functional buttons (surgeon cuffs) make it a pricey alteration and normally it isn't worth the cost.","1404173727"
"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","[Note: I'm using LaTeX markup; see the sidebar for relevant browser plugins.]

It occurs to me that the derivative of the series

`[; \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{2^k} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^k ;]`

is

`[; \sum_{k=1} \frac{k x^{k-1}}{2^{k}} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k}{2} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^{k-1}. ;]`

Note that the first series converges to

`[; \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x}{2}} ;]`

for |*x*/2| &lt; 1, so *x*=1 is indeed within its radius of convergence. Further, this means that the derivative of the series is the series of the derivatives there, so this second sum is given by

`[; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x}{2}} \right]. ;]`

Now, to evaluate your sum, you might need to be careful about whether you're off by a few factors of 2, or whether you're excluding finitely many terms from one of these series. But this seems a useful starting point: take the first sum, differentiate, then evaluate at *x*=1.

I try to understand and (to a certain extent) accept all parts of humanity, but I am just baffled by Otherkin. 

I get that transgender individuals believe that they are born in the wrong gender than what they feel, and I'm fine with that. I know a couple and they couldn't be nicer people. 

But Otherkin believe they're born as the wrong species entirely. I mean, more power to them, I guess, but... what? I kind of accept them for it, I mean they aren't hurting anyone, so why not, right? But I will never understand it. 

I've spoken to three so far. Two on the internet, one in real life. The two on the internet believed they were really a cat and a wolf. 

The girl who thought she was a cat would often lick her hands and run them through her her, as per a cat's behaviour. She also enjoyed wearing cat ears. 

The guy who believed he was a wolf would embrace the night and often howl at the moon. He took night shifts at work to become nocturnal, effectively. Good for him. 

This guy I met in real life, however, was a special case. He knew, deep down, that he was a fictional creature. However he believed with all his heart and soul that this creature existed somewhere in the universe, and his spirit had found the wrong host. He described it as a hybrid between a dragon and a butterfly. He drew a decent picture of it that I regrettably don't have anymore. This guy was perfectly sane otherwise and has a high paying job with a GF of several years (she knew of this, but it never affected their relationship).

I don't know. I just don't get it. ","1404173732"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Late to the thread, but let's add in my cheery story from my past. :|

My best friend and I were about 8-10 years old, playing at a nearby park. It was close enough to her house that we weren't there supervised, and it was the glorious early 90s, so there wasn't a ton of ""WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" going on. We're the only ones at the park, and I noticed a car park down by where the ice rink normally is (about 500-1000 ft away from the main park area). 

He walks all the way over to the park where we're playing, and sits on the bench - watching us. Being kids, we didn't really know what he was up to, but we had enough sense to know it was not good. We start moving towards the other half of the playground equipment, and eventually hide in one of those giant tube things kids would have to crawl through. 

What he was up to, was jerking off to us. That was the day I learned what masturbation was. 

He finally got up and left, and we high tailed it back to our respective homes. Told our parents, parents called the cops. I didn't find out til later, but apparently when my friend told her version of the story, the cops tried to tell her parents that kids make shit up for attention all the time. It wasn't until I gave my story, that lined up with hers, that they actually believed us. 

I remember going ice skating at the park either that winter, or the winter after that and seeing a sign up regarding a child predator, and giving a description of the car I reported.","1404173733"

"MMORPG","t5_2qlxw","Let's bring out maybe the reason why you are not enjoying most MMOs.  Have you tried actually playing a P2P game? There are some high quality ones that break the barrier of ""Go kill 5 goblins"".  I've played almost every single MMO since the invention of it with Everquest 1 and Ultima online and let me tell you that you will always encounter the ""Go kill 5 goblins"", that's just how it works even if they mix the words around.  If you are willing to pay to play an mmo I suggest trying out Final Fantasy A Realm Reborn.  It's game play is unique, the world is fresh, and the game is always constantly updated to never become stale.   If you want some form of a heavy story in an mmo try out The Old Republic, though I don't know if it is still heavily populated but it is free to play.  Sometimes you just gotta dread through the beginning of an mmo game to get to the core of what makes it a great one.  Maybe retry Tera as it's end game raid content is just absolutely amazing (Neverwinter was alright but I didn't think it was such a memorable game).  Aion's end game is phenomenal in the PVP content.  Judging by the small list of MMORPG's you've played so far I am thinking you are maybe not fit to enjoy an MMORPG which is totally understandable as it could be a hit or miss for some.  It's all about the patience and the tedious climb to get to the enjoyable end game.  If you can't enjoy an MMO for a week then it's possible you won't really enjoy any others.

I forgot that Guild Wars 2 is a F2P game once you buy the game.  It's easy to jump in and out and the PVP aspect of it isn't demanding unless you want to be part of it.  The developers always constantly update it as well.","1404173734"

So they go to Kate's dad who is a Colonel and head of the Skynet program to find out a way to shut it off. John believes that Crystal Peak is the source of the Skynet core and he wants to blow it up. Eventually they head to Crystal Peak and discover there was no system core - and that Crystal Peak was a fallout shelter. Finally, in the brief epilogue we learn Skynet is based on software.

The plot hole is that Arnie's T800 should have known either that (1) Crystal Peak was a fallout shelter and not the Skynet core or - more importantly (2) Skynet was just software and there was no system core.

Now lets say for argument's sake that Arnie's T800 didn't know that Crystal Peak was a fallout shelter - he still would have known that Skynet was a software program and couldn't have been blown up. Perhaps he thought it was possible that Colonel Brewster could actually shutoff Skynet, which is why he led John and Kate to him - but once it was revealed that Skynet was operational, there was no reason to go to Crystal Peak because it couldn't have shut off Skynet.

Aha you say! John asks at the end - ""why did he bring us here?"" and Kate responds ""to live, that was his mission."" But the T800 couldn't have known that Crystal Peak was where they were going to go until Colonel Brewster told them to go there.  ","1404173739"

Planescape: Torment is very easy to get into. It's not an easy game per say, but easy because there are so many ways to do everything. Death is also a central element of the game, so don't worry about doing a quickload/save constantly. Unusual tidbit that isn't normal for a dnd game that is useful to know for P:T: Wisdom gives you an experience bonus and there are wisdom checks to unlock story details/dialogue throughout the game.

It's probably the greatest PC rpg ever written. The artwork in the game is jaw droppingly gorgeous. It is a masterpiece.

I'm far from a Tat whore, more of a Joya de Nicaragua whore to be honest, but I figured I'd fire up the Tatuaje 10th Annisersary - Bon  Chasseur he sent.  

I've been getting more into Tats lately, I really enjoyed the 7th Natural and the 2013 Black, so I was rather curious about this one.  
I was greeted by a nice pepper blast and some supper sweet flavors on the retrohale which really surprised me.  A nice tight ash that held on for a bit longer than the picture shows.  

I'm about halfway through at this writing and the flavors/pepper have calmed down a bit and I'm getting all sorts of nutty sweetness.

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","I have a few T6 tanks and most of the good ones are already mentioned in here, but I'm going to pick the one I like, and that's the M44 (American SPG).

Now I know what you're thinking, ""ewww, sky cancer, get it away from me"", but let me tell you why it's my choice.

First there's the whole ""nuke them from across the map"" thing. This SPG can do that, it'll happily one-shot tanks all day long. And there's nothing you can do about it, all the rage and tantrums in chat does nothing to hamper it's demolition of your team, if anything it just encourages it to do more.

it can deal far more damage than a KV-1S and even gives a KV-2 a run for it's money, it doesn't need protection during reload, there's nothing left to threaten it.

It doesn't need a platoon like the FV304 to do damage, none of this ""death by a thousand cuts"" crap, just ""death by one shot, you're outta here, don't forget your coat"".

It's mobile. Not as mobile as a Hellcat but it mobile enough to change position and angle. Safe behind that rock are you? Well we'll just move over here and... oh dear, your tank appears to have burst into flames, I wonder how that happened?

It can protect itself. Hey look, it's one of those pesky AMX 12t scouts coming to kill me. Well let me just turn around and, hey, wasn't there a scout here a minute ago? All I see now is a scorch mark.

The M44. It's sky cancer, and there is no cure.","1404173742"

Seeing as we have no hard proof either way, I'm going to go ahead and base my assumption off of logic and presume that those involved in the testing process had no reason to frame Sherman and also are competent enough at their jobs and have the moral integrity not to accidentally spill Browner's piss in to Sherman's bottle and not own up to it, not obtain a replacement sample and then try pushing it through hoping no one would notice.

One gives you piddly amounts of health and Crit resistance, which on some servers is close to 100% useless. I'd be lying if I said the other resistances weren't pretty useful though.

The other shoots *fucking lasers*, and it can randomly Crit, while filling choke points with 60 damage penetrating unreflectable death rays.

Plus, so many people underestimate just how much damage the Bison can put out, so you can catch inattentive medics by surprise by shooting them *through* their heavy. 

Another bonus of the bison is unlimited ammo. Pretty self explanatory.

Decent reload times are another boon.

The BB gives you +20 hp, which is enough to mitigate a.... Few minigun shots? Mid-ranged Le'etranger shot? Umm, pistol shot? A little bit of afterburn damage?

The Crit resistance is pretty eh as well. It only takes affect after you do something like 400 damage, although the other resistances are pretty solid. But that's only if you can hold your charge, which could be difficult if you play more roamy style.

The kid was found **covered in blankets asleep in a box** in the house. I dont mean to imply they made him sleep in a box but, if he was in a box and covered in blankets, someone had to have placed the blankets on him! Their shitty parenting led to the death of a dog! 

Don't get me wrong, my anger that the dog died is immense and if someone like that happened to my dog I would have been in an uncontrollable rage. I think its crazy how people are not prosecuted as harshly for killing dogs and cats as they are people, but this whole situation could have been avoided if those parents weren't so shitty.

&gt;Да, всегда страшно видеть, когда гибнет человек. Но вот только кто его конкретно убил?
На видео: судя по всему, были слышны прямо попадания, много - много попаданий, я насчитал больше 50 по едут ему автобусу. Может мне кто-нибудь ответить на несколько вопросов:
1. Показан абсолютно чистый без попаданий пуль автобус, хотя, судя по 50 пулевым попаданиям, как минимум, одно стекло бы было разбито, или на корпусе виднелись пулевые отверстия.
2. Как может человек, которого ранили в голову (именно, в затылочную область, судя по видео), вести машину с такой огромной кровопотерей? К тому же, держится он за затылочную часть головы.
Почему потом пушилинцы заявили, что водила был ранен в шею???
3. Почему человек на видео лежит и все спрятались лежа от обстрела, а храбрая женщина, так понимаю, сидит спокойно?
Итог: кому-то и зачем-то очень надо было доснять декорации к ранению журналиста. Потому что была цель у этого видео.
Факт только один: погиб журналист 1 канала. Будет очень непросто установить, кто его убил. На новости же написано, что стреляли именно нацгвардия. А может, он как раз увидел и поснимал что-то такое, что заставило увидевших стрелять? Это могли быть и ополченцы. Почему же сразу нацгвардия?
Ведь, судя по ранам, стреляли - то в спину...
Вопросов больше чем ответов. Дотошные ""журналисты"" Лайф - ньюс что ж не показали нам весь автобус и раны крупным планом?

&gt;Посмотрите внимательно видео. Водила якобы ранен в затылок. Но стекло слева от него целое, оно бликует. Вопрос: какова траектория пули, если она задела затылок, но не разбила стекло слева? Похоже, что всё это видео - фейк, кроме смерти оператора.

&gt;Кстати, да! Сразу и не заметил!
Ну и ранение то типа, в шею! Сам же сепаратисты сообщили!

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","It took 12 days from start to finish. Actual hours spent working is probably around 25+, half of that devoted to sanding.

The construction of the table took about 2 days of constant work. The last week was the slowest because of the drudgery that is finishing. This is the process I used:

Apply conditioner and stain; wait 24 hours.

Apply 1st coat of poly; wait 24 hours.

Sand with 600 grit by hand; 2nd coat of poly; wait 24 hours.

Sand with 600 grit by hand; 3rd coat poly; wait 48 hours.

Sand VERY lightly with 600 grit. Move into house.

It was extremely tedious work, but very much worth it.

I also went to a wedding  and helped my brother move in the middle of all of this.

I would say this started at novice level and I hit intermediate by the end. I would definitely try a few more advanced methods my second time around.","1404173755"

It is rare that my girlfriend and I are watching different things on the 2 different tvs (one in the bedroom and one in the living room.)

Not quite accurate, as some TVs have USB ports that provide passive power, meaning connected devices receive power even when the TV is off. I have a TV that does this and 2 that don't.

For instance, the fact that you have two degrees, and were probably encouraged to do so (or at least not questioned about it much), could be an example of privilege. Many people from marginalized groups are discouraged from continuing education or told that certain majors are not for them. Privilege doesn't ensure that you get everything you want.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There is something very strange about this flight. 

Lets look at the facts: 

* Crew made last contact at a point where they entered a passive radar blackspot and were due to switch to Vietnamese ATC.
* After this an unusual course change was made, this was done deliberately by someone on the plane.
* The plane transponder is also suddenly deactivated - the only method of tracking is passive radar (short range) and the plane is in a large blackspot for the remainder of the flight.
* Thanks to the ingenuity of an Immersat scientist, we are able to get a likely flight path for the remainder of the flight, which seems likely to have followed a path which implies the auto-pilot was in control
* The last Immersat broadcast data suggests the plane rolling and ditching into the sea.

The most likely explanation is that of an electrical fire on board - this would explain the transponder deactivating presuming it was damaged in the fire. The crew are incapacitated and a resilient flight crew member attempts to turn the flight around but obviously fails as the plane follows a course out to sea. It's also problematic as a fire with the capacity to render crew and passengers unconscious would presumably bring down the flight prematurely. We know, however that the plane continued to fly for several hours.

Another explanation would be sudden cabin de-pressurisation, again the crew are incapacitated and a flight crew member attempts to divert the flight. This doesn't explain the transponder deactivation or lack of radio contact. 

My own theory is that this is either a botched hijacking job - albeit unlikely given the passenger manifest scrutiny performed, or perhaps a suicide from one of the pilots. 

This last piece of evidence described in the above article, if accurate, seems to imply that there was someone on the plane who deactivated the transponder making errors as they did so. Why would someone do this?","1404173760"

Aside from the fact that it has nothjng to do with battle rap and is dumb and makes the whole thjng look like a stage show, no matter how tough someone is in a brawl or in the street, if they don't train boxing it will truly show in a sanctioned event. When it's just he two of them without clothes to grab and without throwing each other around, if they haven't trained boxing a lot it will  look totally ridiculous. 

They will probably make them wear headgear, they will swing wildly, not have any head movement and it will be a joke. Tough guys always think they know how to box or do mma for some reason and don't treat it like a sport with real skill where people train for several hours every day. It will look like rock em sock em robots or like celebrity boxing like they used to have. It takes a tremendous amount of time to get any skillful footwork and head movement, even to learn how to punch correctly, for it to look graceful in a real boxing match. 

Even if they have trained a bit they are not amateur or pro boxers and when people are used to seeing that on tv it will look horrible in comparison. I really, really hope this doesn't happen for the sake of both battle rap and professional boxing.","1404173761"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","First is the assumption that there is a 'mind' large enough to know everything. Then there is the assumption that information is in infinite. And then the assumption that information is not changing with time and space. Three assumptions not addressed that easily make problems. Large enough mind and infinite information are easily understood I think. 

The last one could throw you. The reason it is a problem is that if the universe is not perfectly cause and effect, then you can never know what is happening everywhere at the same time. Quantum mechanics *may be cause and effect but we don't understand enough*. However, as it is, there is randomness in quantum calculations. We iron that out with statistics, very good statistic such that quantum mechanics is really good at predicting things as systems. But if there is randomness, then you cannot predict something purely based on prior knowledge. Then you have a finite speed of light, or finite speed of information propagation. This means that one mind could not grasp the change until the information made it's way to the mind. 

So no mind could be truly omnipotent in-so-much that the universe needs to be cause and effect and the mind needs to hold more information than the universe. Thus it cannot exist within the universe. Outside the universe we cannot detect. ","1404173766"

"pagan","t5_2rmnm","I'm sure this is going to annoy some people here, but it's kinda true: ""Paganism"" is not, in and of itself, a religion. It's a catch-all term for several religions. While it's certainly arguable that ""Christianity"" encompasses several different religions (sects), the religions that fall under the ""umbrella term"" of Christianity still share some common traits - Monotheism, reverence of the Christ figure, and a common mythology. How many ""pagan"" religions have at least that much in common? I can't really think of any off the top of my head; it would be nice if one could even say that Trad Wicca and Eclectic / Popular Wicca had that much in common, but the highly individualised nature of the latter, and the ""pick n mix"" nature of most Eclectic practices means ""some"" Eclectics might have that much in common with Traditional Wicca, but most probably don't. I realise that people like Bonewits and Zell have attempted in the past to define what makes a religion ""pagan"", but these attempts have proved demonstrably false upon examination at even an arm's length --which betrays the ignorance of these so-called ""pagan leaders"", when concerning any religion they have not been personally involved with, at best.

There is virtually nothing that defines ""paganism"" as a group of religions, outside of the most basic negative definition: pagan religions are non-Abrahamic (and also typically non-Dharmic, unless you count the pop-Dharmic elements that have become increasingly popular in pagan communities via the New Age community) religions. You can't really define common ground by defining a group of things by what they are not. You can't define what cats are, as a Family of species by saying that cats ""do not breathe through gills"", cos there are many animals that are not cats which also do not breathe through gills.","1404173767"

This design seems quite unique. The static ability makes me feel like the Protector protects creatures, while the tap ability makes him seems like he protects lands. While it can protect both, it doesn't feel cohesive. The tap ability is useful with landfall, an opponent's bounce land (this is reusable pseudo land destruction), and mana ramp (as the land comes into play untapped), while the static ability doesn't play into any of those things (besides maybe mana ramping with a basic land).

The stats and name feel good for a green white creature. I like the name and type line, but I believe you need a Legendary supertype if you're going to give the creature a name.

If I were you, I'd split this design into 2 different cards taking a landfall approach with the tap ability and restricting it to hitting your own lands while making another creature who cares about basic lands and protects your creature spells.

Thanks for the submission. I like the unique ideas.","1404173767"

Ook hebben we 2 kerken (waarbij 1 een coffeshop recht tegen over zit, huehuehue).

Verder hebben we een kleine haven, waar ook het gerechtsgebouw staat, een mooi blauw gebouw waar een paar maanden terug Jan Steur(volgens mij was dat zijn naam?) Is berecht.

Natuurlijk is het landschap hier ook prachtig Nederlands (namelijk plat).

Uitgaan in Almelo kan natuurlijk ook, ben zelf vaste klant bij De Stam, maat ook België is aan te raden waar je verschillende biertjes kan proeven, NielZ waar je heerlijk kan eten, maar er zijn natuurlijk ook disco's zoals Crazy Frog en Amused/Enjoy. Laatst is er een nieuwe festivalhal geopend; Naxt, waar volgend mij elk weekend wel wat te doen is.

De evenementen in Almelo zijn de Nacht van Almelo (vlak na Pasen als ik dat me goed herinner), de Profronde in het najaar waarbij het centrum wordt gebruikt als wielren track, en het mooiste, wat aankomende Zaterdag is in het Schelfhorst park; HobNob!

Eye gaze is for initial, instant, and possibly large cursor movements, and then the joystick of the controller overrides the gaze-control to offer an accurate selection of the target.

The controller buttons are for clicking.

**Eye-tracking pointer motion teleport + mouse: eye-tracking for initial warping/teleporting of cursor, then use precision of mouse to finish selection – research paper on benefits of initially warping cursor**

Similar to the game controller example, eye tracking can be used to initially teleport a mouse-controlled cursor near an intended target.

Once there, the mouse can override eye-control when precision is needed

A paper called “Mouse and Keyboard Cursor Warping to Accelerate and Reduce the Effort of Routine HCI Input Tasks” evaluates how initially teleporting the cursor with eye tracking in other common human computer interaction can affect the interaction.

The authors have a video demonstration.

A segment of the video has a task that requires the user to click “click-me” buttons that are generated in random locations as fast as possible.

A competition pits a mouse vs. an eye tracker + mouse.

You can see the performance of the eye-tracking warping + mouse at 2:41 of the video: http://youtu.be/7BhqRsIlROA?t=2m41s.

“Mouse control + eye-tracking teleport” ends up being the clear winner.

In summary, adding eye-tracking teleportation undoubtedly makes interaction faster.

**It’s not choose between “mouse + keyboard” vs. “eye tracker + keyboard”– it’s “mouse + eye-tracking teleport + keyboard” or “eye tracker + keyboard” – that is, eye-tracking is always there**

Eye-tracking +keyboard: Eye-Tracking doesn’t have the precision of a mouse, but if an interface element and hit state is large enough, a “click-where-I’m-looking at” keyboard button will work.


Eye tracking + keyboard two-step process: there are eye tracking features that allow an eye controlled cursor to snap, zoom, etc. to a smaller target element, or make smaller elements project into large elements.

Sometimes it’s a two-step process, so even if you have the ability to instantly teleport the cursor, “both-hands-on-keyboard + eye-tracking two-step process” may not be suitable in certain situations.


Eye tracking teleport + mouse and keyboard: However, whenever you need the mouse, eye-tracking will still be there to provide an initial cursor teleport.


Without eye-tracking: If you have both hands on the keyboard, you lose time switching one hand to the mouse, and bringing the hand back to the keyboard.

You’re usually choosing between both hands on the keyboard, or one hand on the mouse.


With eye-tracking: With eye tracking, it can be used either with both hands on the keyboard (click-what-I’m-looking-at keyboard button), or one on the mouse (initial cursor teleport, then use the mouse).

You never have to forgo something to use eye-tracking; it’s always ready to make normal computer interaction faster.

"news","t5_2qh3l","They are pretty much the equivalent of the annual sensational Shark Attack stories that make the media rounds every summer.  

Do Sharks attack people?  Sure, rarely, and in all the years that the number of shark attacks have been recorded, there has never been a significant spike that would indicate some sort of change in shark behavior that would justify the level of histrionics around these types of stories.   Here's the thing though, Sharks are scary and people have a hard time ignoring stories about them being scary. 

""The Knockout Game"" stories just substitute black teenagers for sharks.  I've never seen any evidence that the ""Knockout Game"" is responsible for an increase in assaults by black teenagers.  This is the key, actual statistical evidence that ""The Knockout Game"", if it even exists, drives assaults, and if it does, that it has resulted in an actual increase in the number of incidents.

This isn't to say black teenagers don't assault people (white teenagers do their fair share of assaulting as well, teenagers are impulsive and occasionally callow as  a whole, thats why they face different sentencing from adults) but it is a lazy and sensational way for the media to ascribe any assault by a black teenager to ""The Knockout Game"" for maximum scariness.   

Not for nothing, but a grand unifying theme of perfidious malfeasance makes it easier for the Media to do scary violence stories without having to research and report on the possible sociological and economic roots of said violence. ","1404173774"
