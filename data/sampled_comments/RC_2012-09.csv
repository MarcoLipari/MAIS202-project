I think they're less discussed because they were previously outside the 'best' price point; since the 670 and 660Ti have released, the 7870 has moved more into the 7850's price range.

For $20 more, the 7870 seems worth it; if the 7850 gets close with OCing, I might consider spending the $20-30 on a model with a better cooler to help with the OCing. ","1346457601"

"vita","t5_2sjmv","How is it even possible to compare an RPG epic to a platformer?

I would hardly consider it to be ""beaten out"" by Gex. The author just isn't that much of an RPG fan. Also, its quite easy to argue that it's not one of the best. An RPG with dragons and knights is such a cliched concept to begin with. Gex was original, and still is. even Final Fantasy had ditched that atmosphere by that point for something a little more fresh.

If you're looking for a critical darling that is frequently regarded as one of the best games ever, then FFIX is a much safer bet than the mixed reception Legend of Dragoon got. You'll notice it is also missing from this list. Hence, it seems like the authors goal was a personal best of list.","1346457602"

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","For getting hair to magically stand up, use two fingers from your free hand and simply pull at the skin, it will get the hair to jump upright. Be certain not to pull the skin tight like a drum (will lead to ingrown hair) but just tight enough... so to speak. Experiment to determine where exactly the fine line lies.

And really, I've never liked, ""let the weight of the razor do the cutting,"" as an explanation. I think it's an over-simplification, and caused me to hold my razor very near the end of the handle to increase the weight at the head (wrong!).

I prefer instead a focus on how much pressure the cap of the razor is making with the skin. Should be none. It should be that very fine threshold of touching the skin and not touching the skin. but definite force is used in the cutting of the hairs.

And if your razor gets that dull that fast, don't have just one razor. TO change blades mid-shave seems like a bummer for sure. IN fact, check out [Bruce on Shavings three razor approach](http://www.bruceonshaving.com/2010/11/15/the-3-razor-shaving-method-revisited/), which would give you a fresh blade for each pass if you like.","1346457604"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I find Sam Harris infuriating for these reasons and more.

He doesn't even attempt to be intellectually honest, let alone rigorous. Instead he uses confabulation and emotive rhetoric to hide the flaws in many of his arguments.

I used to think he was just a bit thick, but I've come to see he has a certain genius. He has taken the techniques of the Evangelical TV preachers and applied them to the church of atheism.

He is a slick salesman who preaches what the choir came to hear, and he does it in that way that makes the audience feel special for belonging to the one true religion. You've got to give him props for having the chutzpah to take such techniques right into the heart of academia and get away with it.","1346457605"
"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","It seems like this is mostly a spirit tokens deck. However, I feel like you are missing out. The great thing about Drogskol Captain is that it gives your creatures hexproof, but that doesn't help much in the case of large amounts of spirit tokens whose main weakness is board-sweepers like Bonfire of the Damned.

I'd recommend just a handful of solid creatures. I personally love Drogskol Reaver with Drogskol Captain . . . together they are invincible. Also, I'm fond of 4 copies of Spectral Rider. But as long as you want tokens, I'd really recommend two copies of Geist-Honored Monk.

Also, you may not like this idea, but my friend runs 4 copies of Divine Favor in his spirit deck. It combos well with Drogskol Reaver, when he has a Reaver on the field, because of the life-gaining. It also helps protect one of his creatures from a board-sweeping Bonfire of the Damned. Also, having creatures with Hexproof eliminates the chance of a two-for-one play by your opponent when you use an aura i.e. when you cast Divine Favor, targeting a Voiceless Spirit you control, your opponent will normally try to Gut Shot the creature, destroying it and causing you to have an illegal target for your aura. However, if you've got a Drogskol Captain on the field, your opponent can't get in a two-for-one play when you cast an aura. My friend originally used a bunch of different Aura Enchantments, but now only uses Divine Favor.","1346457605"

Being a biochem major just makes the next week of lectures a bit easier. And that is similar for pretty much every biochem major. If someone was a Health Science, they would have that same advantage for anatomy, or their specific field of study. From everyone I've talked to (UM, MSU, GV, CMU, Eastern, Western, and a scattering of the Liberal Arts schools), they received about the same amount of knowledge due to the actual way med school is (in regards to medical academics, and not graduate academics).","1346457605"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","&gt;Passing it as progress is just horseshit.

I think you misunderstood, I don't mean progress in the sense of technology, but progress in terms of power.

Suppose you have a 4 mile climb ahead of you at a 4% grade. When I’m on the road bike, I will tend to simply adjust the gearing to maintain a high cadence. When I’m on the fixed-gear, I cannot adjust the gearing, but I still want to maintain a high cadence, so I will adjust MY POWER OUTPUT.

This literally forces me, my legs and heart to be more powerful.  I don’t succumb to downshifting and pedaling light and fast, not that that's a bad thing (It's a great thing!) but that doesn’t mean I don’t pedal fast on a fixed-gear.

If I could could climb hills while maintaining a fairly high cadence with a gear ratio that is somewhat taller than what I would have chosen on a geared bike, then when I transition to a road bike, I can be absolutely BALLISTIC on those same climbs.

It feels SO, SO easy and there is so much more power on tap if I want to sprint up with monstrous power, because of all the training.  Does that make sense?","1346457607"

The multiplayer is decent (loosely comparable to firefight in Halo) and the map packs for it are free, but I'm not sure how the playerbase for it is now - it might have petered off.

I think it was worth playing, and definitely for $16.","1346457611"

I remember our times together very very fondly. We met perhaps 3-4 times a week, at different houses, a few of the family's farms, or a church sometimes. We went to TONS of field trips together. 
All of the children were required to learn a musical instrument. All of the parents played instruments and so they taught all of the children at least one. Many of us learned to play several...Let me tell you something: making music with a lot of people requires a lot of social skills! 

Of all the kids I knew that were homeschooled with, I can't think of one that hasn't graduated college now...

Most of our parents sent us to public school for a period of time. The kids were mostly immature assholes, but there were some really nice kids i met in high school as well. I was picked on a lot for being gay in public school and at the Christian private school I attended briefly. The homeschoolers NEVER did that. I can't see how being bullied is an essential skill kids need.","1346457613"

The whole state's rights arguments we still see today is just an extension of that.

However, if any other item is thrown, they wont combine and the other item continues on towards the lava. This triggers another switch which stops the signal that's heading for the door.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Could we not call being sexually adventurous being a dirty slut?  If that is your personal dirty talk, fine.  But on a broader level it is a weirdly judgmental way to talk about women and sex.  

&gt;That works out well since my SO likes to be dominant in the bedroom. I find myself starting arguments with him so that he will be mean to me during sex.

You need code words to tell him what kind of action you want.  And a safe word.  You seriously should have set up a safe word before any of this started.

&gt;The idea of a threesome and watching him with someone else is also so hot to me, and I would love to try it one day, but I don't think my current insecurities would ever let me :(

Maybe the problem is insecurity, but you should also realize that it is totally normal to have sex fantasies you don't want to act out.  Some things might be better in your imagination and that doesn't make you uptight.  There is nothing wrong with having boundaries in bed.","1346457617"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Okay, I'm the boyfriend. She linked me this thread. After yet a night of her calling me obese, horrible and other names, simply to put me down. This isn't her first reddit thread about how shit I am(however, she has deleted her history after realising it wasn't fair).

Let's start at the beginning shall we? We met through a mutual friend, we started talking. At first I knew nothing about the situation. But slowly(after we had gotten together) I found out more and more. And I've always supported her, the first two years we basically talked at least 7 hours a day, and I did anything and everything for her. Up until just a year ago I found out she had lied about being raped and what not just to make me drop everything I was doing to come home, to talk to her. Something I did, every single time. She kept making things up to get it her way. She has a history of being very manipulative, and she will do ANYTHING to get things her way. Granted, I have fucked up, like this past weekend. I've apologised dearly for it, but she won't quite accept it. Our relationship mostly consist of her calling me in the evening and trashing me, bashing me and throw a shit storm of mental abuse at me. I've been called things and treated ways I've never experienced in my entire life time. She makes it out in this post like she doesn't want to talk to me every day etc. But that's plain and simple bullshit, she will smack down thors fucking hammer at me if I don't pick up the phone, or reply to a text. I feel like I'm constantly monitored and every time I pick up a skype call, or viber call(which is what we use) I'm petrified I will be belittled and made fun of for whatever reason she comes up with at that specific moment. She threatens with suicide when things doesn't go her way. She have also posted dirty picture publicly I've sent her simply because she's angry at me, usually because things didn't go her way.

She has also threatened to send those pictures and logs to my family and friends, and even my boss.

And this isn't the case of your girlfriend feeling bad every once in a while and wants support. Every single day she's upset about something and demand my attention. Either it's her not having lost weight, or her parents being drunk, or generally not happy. She has been diagnosed with Bipolar, so a lot of the the time she's simply just very sad, wants my support, and then take it all out on me. She is very reluctant to get proper treatment. She got lithium at one point, but stopped taking it. It was just this spring she started taking some other pill again(she refuse to tell me what). She has seen a therapist about threes times(which I know of) since june. 

Bottomline is that she is in fact, an absolutely lovely girl when she's happy. The best one in the world. And I'm deeply in love with her. But I can't handle this anymore. I'm being torn every single day. Being belittled, humiliated and verbally abused. My self-esteem have gone down so much since I met her and I can't take this anymore. I've been unable to sleep too many nights to even count, just because I'm so sad after what she have said to me and called me. And it's not uncommon that she keeps these things up until 2-3am, when I often have to work the next day, something she doesn't care about.

Imagine talking to your girlfriend on skype, on daily basis, and everytime you say you need to go she starts verbally abusing you. Doesn't matter if it's because you need to get up for work, or hang out with your friends(plenty of times I have friends over and still talk to her for an hour or so and she throws a fit when I say I want to go back to my friends). I can't handle it. You can call me horrible, abusive or immature. I just can't deal with this anymore. It makes me feel so bad.

At first I didn't want to post in this thread, just let it slip, like the other threads she made earlier, since I don't see the point of involving reddit in our relationship problems, no one is probably even interested. But she asked me to post so I'll do it. She's doing this in hope of people justifying how she's acting, and that people will start bashing me.

I've also gone through 2 suicide attempts with her. Talking to her afterwards and trying to make her feel good. But nothing helps, I don't even have the proper education to handle this. But I tried, but 90% of the time I just get shit for it. I honestly feel so bad after one of her bashings that I just want to curl up under my blanket and don't wake up for days. I can't take it anymore. It's just too much.

**TL;DR: Please read it.**

**Edit:** I was very HAPPY when she would be able to study here in my country. However, I said ""I don't want you to move here because of me. I want you to move here because you want to study at the uni in question"". She flipped and said I didn't want her here, and that's the end of that basically.

**Edit2:** This is just a little percentage of the whole picture regarding things she has done to me and acted towards me.

**Edit3:** When I called her a ""selfish fucking cunt"" was this weekend when my best friend had gone home with me after a night out, and he was insanely drunk, in fact, he was literally choking on his own vomit. I had to run out(the living room, where he was sleeping) and turn him over, and then wash everything and make sure he was alright. She had been calling me the entire time, but for obvious reasons I couldn't pick up, because I was covered in vomit and taking care of my best friend. When all was done I called her back, and she started arguing with me. *Again*, calling me names and saying I didn't care about her, despite explaining the situation, so I snapped and called her that. It was in no way justified, but I was just really stressed over what had just happened and the fact that my best friend which I've known since I was toddler was very close to dying that night.

Bush created the debt by lowering taxes and increasing spending, Bush spent more money than Obama did. The Republican congress held the debt ceiling hostage (if you declare your intention not to pay your bills, it's no wonder your credit rating gets lowered). The bad economy was caused by the Republican drive for deregulation of the financial markets, like Glass-Steagall.

She is FINALLY done with this douche, it's only been 2 weeks but she's never been able to go an entire day without talking to him (even when they were broken up, she was constantly defending herself via text while he called her a lying cheating cunt for catching him cheating on her, and would bring up relationships she had before they got together).  The smoking thing was just an extra way to keep her from being irritable when she had to go 15 minutes without a cigarette, even if it means a few weeks of being irritable about quitting.  It's only been a couple weeks of giving up both of these toxic circumstances in her life, and she's already a lot happier.  She's saved over $60 in 2 weeks, and has gone 2 weeks without crying herself to sleep or being called a cunt.  She's not as tense, we can talk and spend time together without her sobbing about what a mess her life is and how much she just hates everything and can't stand where she's at.  Even when she plays with her kid she just seems to enjoy herself more.  She's just happy now, it's a nice change, and it sucks it took hero long to leave this asshole, but she left a lot sooner than a lot of women do, and she's still able to get her life back on track.","1346457625"

&gt;What **you** want to see is not the same that what **everyone else** wants to see. 
&gt;
&gt;I love seeing Fanart, Wallpapers. I dislike seeing e-sport news. Yet I think they both should be in this Subreddit. 

&gt;Honestly I'm getting tired of all these ""I'm tired of seeing fanart/funny videos/skin ideas/et) they should make a subreddit for that!!"" comments and threads. 
&gt;
&gt;It's /r/leagueoflegends, it should have all League of Legends content, regardless of you or anyone else wants to see or not! 

----------------------------------------------------

&gt;Just downvote and use the hide button to bring out more content. Shouldn't be that much of an issue. If so many people don't want it to be on the front page, they should start downvoting because it seems most people just ignore them instead of doing something about it.

----------------------------------------------------

&gt;Too many LoL Subreddits IMO. Keep it all in one place. If its good it will make it to the top. 

----------------------------------------------------

&gt;If you look at the sidebar you'll see there is a subreddit for every sort of LoL related content. I honestly can't think of any content that would fit in this main subreddit anymore if everyone were to use other subreddits.

&gt;Anyway the point of Reddit is so people can see everything in one place, the same goes for big subreddits like this. If you don't like content and think it belongs elsewhere: downvote it.","1346457626"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","DotA 2 has awesome tools to accommodate viewers and casters that are vastly superior to LoL, I definitely agree, but I honestly think LoL doesn't need them. 

They have the playerbase (the largest in the world), it's growing and expanding (especially in foreign countries, for instance I've heard that its grew to be much more popular than Starcraft 2 in South Korea), and despite lacking the tools of DotA 2, it still has the bare minimums to rake in *tons* of viewers. They don't need much more than a stream and some commentators to keep coming and coming.

And what exactly do you mean that the only tournaments are Riot-run? There are tons of other tournaments I've heard of that go on for much smaller prizes for up and coming teams, and a lot of tournaments now being hosted by the sponsors TSM, Curse, etc.) to show off their teams and garner new fans. I'm pretty sure LoL has more going on in non-Riot-run tournaments than DotA 2 does with Valve-less ones.

I'm still saying the major thing in this battle will be its playerbase. LoL is just a much easier game to get into and will be more fun for the majority of people who play it. Yes, there will be more people who are not interested in the competitive side compared to DotA players who are, but they will still be larger in numbers. The game is simply too big and I see no reason why a much more hardcore game will be able to surpass it given the backings Riot does for LoL's eSport's scene (all the free publicity, *the salaries players will earn next season*, the streams embedded right on the launcher, and all the other good stuff going on).","1346457637"

This doctrine started with the UK's Custody of Infants Act in 1839, which was passed in reaction to a divorce case where a violent ex-husband was given custody as it was actually more usual for men to receive custody than for women. Though this was seen as a progressive move, it ultimately reinforced Victorian social norms, and served as an expression of the Cult of Domesticity, which elevated women so long as they upheld four cardinal virtues--piety, purity, submission, and domesticity. It identified the home as women's sphere while the outside world was left to men. Such gender roles of course failed to recognize the individuality of either men or women, and society would be better served by tossing all vestiges of such restrictive, sexist thinking out the window.","1346457642"

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","I don't have an issue with going against conventional storytelling. However, letting Pell live is not going away from conventional. It is violating the very story he built. For what reason would Oda give Pell such poetic lines before the bomb exploded? Just look at how well put together that whole sequence is. It was the perfect way to go out.

Also, I don't need to hear his explanation as to why he did it in order to deem it a bad decision. There really aren't many justifications, and all of them are poor.

You're right, it is Vivi's story. But it is also about how the straw hats influenced Vivi. Luffy tried to force her to understand that to make that commitment, people would die. In fact, this same theme is portrayed with the death of [Spoiler](/s ""Ace."") To allow Pell to live after he willingly sacrifices himself for the country is a violation of one of the most important themes displayed in the Alabasta arc.

To attack your point that Oda cares for his characters, I would argue that killing a character off does not mean the creator cares less for their characters. It means that they sometimes understand that it is for the greater good for the story. George R.R. Martin said in an interview that it pains him every time to have to kill a character in ASOIAF.

"asmr","t5_2sbyc","This is a pretty fascinating thread. From what I've gathered so far there's a lot of reference to crunch and noise. I think we need to dig deeper, and then think about how to create the sounds from there.

Here's how I play this out in my head, kind of from a different angle. There is a mysterious person that  sits down next to you, you could know them or you could not know them, doesn't matter. They are someone that you feel strangely attracted to but know not the reason why. They move up close to you to whisper in your ear, and you can see their mouth in your mind, and you can feel them very close to you, closer than people get. They start whispering into your ear. Slowly saying words. The words don't matter. What matters is the proximity, the reality, the atmosphere. Everything is so far away, except for this whisper. You can hear every little nuance in the voice, you can hear the stranger's life force. And then your brain suddenly feels like it is submersed in champagne.

I believe it is a proximity affect, a feeling of being closer than is possible in prescribed reality. I think it is anticipation, and being thrown into a situation that is closer than you would normally feel comfortable in. I don't think there is a specific sound alone that is going to do it, but the right sounds at the right proximity in the right order will get you in the right directions. Background noise is also key in my opinion, to create the juxtaposition of the subject sound. The background noise is expected to be quiet, and then you have a sound in the foreground that is normally supposed to be quiet, but is very crystal clear and loud creating the illusion of proximity. Maybe if you can get that proximity effect to trick the listener into thinking that sound is so close it is resonating from inside their brain, you could achieve your targeted ASMR response.","1346457649"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I'm in Canada and this was my process:

* Make an offer on the house. The offer is for a specific price, say 90k, but is also subject to specific conditions. Standard conditions will include that it passes inspection and that I'm able to get financing. There will also be a closing date and possession date. Closing date is a deadline of when I remove the conditions and possession date is when I will take over the home. These are all negotiable by the seller. If your financing is pre-approved, you don't have to include the financing condition, although it's good to keep if possible.
* Seller can make a counter offer and adjust price or conditions. Most likely it's all about price unless they have specific dates they need. If you are flexible on dates, then gives you some room to negotiate.
* When both sides agree, that's when you organize the home inspection, start looking for a lawyer/notary/conveyancer and let your bank know.
* You have until the closing date before finalizing and putting a deposit down (this is different from down payment, but will be included).
* Your lawyer/conveyancer will calculate the amount owing between all the parties. Other considerations will be like property tax, which the seller may have already paid for the year, so you have to pay your portion of it for the remainder of the year (or the other way around if it isn't paid). 

If you haven't done so already, get a realtor to help you out. Find a good one that can look out for you and guide you through the process. As a buyer, there shouldn't be a cost to you. Realtor fees are paid by the seller (at least in Canada). Be wary if the seller's realtor wants to represent you; they will likely not have your interest in mind.

"SocialEngineering","t5_2qlud","Time for the big post from me:

I can see many people are enthusiastic and also interested in a tertiary-tiered document targeting individuals at **ALL** skill levels and this seems like an extremely useful idea. This subreddit has 17,340 users with different backgrounds into social engineering, but, we all have one thing in common; the interest of knowing what goes on in social interaction, be it to try get into a hotel room for free, steal a credit card, or wipe somebody's iCloud system. We are a group of:

* Newcomers
* People who welcome learning
* Individuals who struggle with social interaction
* Professionals at social engineering who use it almost daily in their lives

This would be incredible if we got the moderators of this subreddit to review this thread, or the outcome we'll produce from it; it has infinite potential, it will hold an abundance of information, and it would be a gigantic short-cut as opposed to just reading it ourselves (I'm lazy; sorry).

Firstly, an important part of the absolute introduction to social engineering is the first place is to initiate and maintain social interaction. Ask ourselves, ""How can I approach somebody and not be awkward or give an awkward response?"". The content that is written in the Kindergarten stage of SE School should **prepare** individuals with skills and mindsets that should be exercised. Some very basic information that definitely must be included would be, for example:

* Appearance
* Reasoning for initiating conversation
* The Approach
* Practising in the mirror
* How to small talk
* Do's and **DO NOT'S**

Note that this does not cover all the immediate basics, but from that list, we can see the general picture of Kindergarten. Reminders that you must identify skills and methods that have successful results and keep them, while stripping the fat (unfavourable decisions) out. Also, somebody willing to make positive social interactions must accept that others are different, and take no offence when a strategy of social engineering doesn't work on everybody.

I will be posting more, I'd like feedback on what I should include or elaborate on, or even what isn't necessary and should be removed anyway. Mad respect to ChristianBMartone if he's willing to go through with this.

"politics","t5_2cneq","We've killed plenty of people in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen to more than equal 9/11. Killing bin Laden was a useless gesture - bin Laden was one man, just like Mao was one man and Pol Pot was one man. What made bin Laden anathema to America was something else - Islamist anger against America comes from a specific place that is *precisely* rooted in American violence against Muslim countries. Bin Laden himself pointed out that he wasn't targeting Sweden. Continuing that pattern hardly seems to me to be a great success. A superficial, ""manly"" one, perhaps. But if you're interested in chest-thumping, stick to some empty sports rivalry, please. I'd rather not have my international policy discussions dominated by that kind of dick-waving.","1346457659"

Also, IRL, lightning, especially if it's going to be used in close quarters, is LOUD, so it could fuck with her hearing, but I don't know how lightning mechanics work in the Avatar world, since apparently Amon can take one point blank and still get up.

Yegge recommends a particular book very highly – The Algorithm Design Manual."" - http://www.alexbowe.com/failing-at-google-interviews .

It seems that if you can indeed master something extremely quickly then you should be able to master that recommended reading very quickly, and the lack of CS background would not be a big factor.

Network drivers have been a thorn occasionally (broadcom) and there are several hotfixes (hyperv, clustering,iscsi) that continue to accumulate.

That said, it is very solid on average and performance is good.  We typically deploy the full os because of third party integration we require.  Vcenter seems overly complex for average cases, and overly expensive.

Q: ""Why doesn't water run off the Earth?""

A: There is a vast ""ice wall"" that keeps the water where it is. This explains why you can find a vast plane of ice as you travel southward. The wall is roughly 150ft high. In the McIntyre model, however, the height of the wall increases further as one moves toward the edge of the world.

Just so you know, anyone who works in this field has been in your shoes. I am currently a data editor for the observer program for the National Marine Fisheries Service. If you are looking for field work and you are interested in fisheries, I highly recommend working as a Fisheries Observer. This was the path I took after my graduating with my bachelors. I spent over 2 years at sea working alongside commercial fishermen gathering data pertaining to the catch size, composition, biological species sampling, and interactions with fish, shark, bird, mammal, and sea turtle species. It is a hard job with a very demanding schedule, but I found it very rewarding. If you want to test your sea legs you should look into this. Pay for this job typically ranges from 35K on up depending on which coast you work and how much time you are willing to spend at sea.

Of course the field of fisheries is not for everyone in the field of marine sciences. If you need a job and are looking to sea how the people originally became curious about the marine sciences, observing is an interesting gig. ","1346457671"

"conspiratard","t5_2r2dd","&gt; Bigotry and racism are opposites.

Say what?

[Webster's](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot?show=0&amp;t=1346457008) definition of bigot is the following:

&gt; a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a **racial** or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance 

Seems to me the two tend to go together rather well like peanut butter and jelly. In fact, I think that it'd be rather hard to be racist and *not* be a bigot as well.

&gt; Racism is like a swiss canton and bigotry like two guy scrabbling around in the mud drunk or stoned and trying to brain each other with rocks.

Dude, I seriously think you need to learn what a [canton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland) is. Hint: it's much like states are to the USA. I fail to see how that has anything to do with race.

While for your second comparison, yeah, bigoted people might do something that dumb, but the comparison there doesn't particularly fit the definition much at all. Heck, for that matter, someone doesn't need to be stupid to be a bigot.

In any case, your analogies suck at this point.

&gt; Naturally those whose lives suffer from the most bigotry whether it emerges more on it's own or or projected onto them and their personality (especially the south obviously) are going to be the ones who are more likely to be crying out for the opposite of bigotry. The rest is detail.

Again, I seriously doubt that you really know what the words you're using really mean. See above.

&gt; These people have proved repeatedly to be no more bigoted in theory than east asians, blacks, old money east coast families are etc. black flight is to the south and that's where most interracial marriages happen.But even that type of thing can traumatize lives.

And now you're just being plain ol' racist.","1346457676"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I hope this doesn't get buried, but I have a question that really interests me. What was the transition from normal life to a jail environment like? Did you have to change your mindset to a ""tougher"" one? You seem like you were a pretty average guy, who simply found himself in a set of very tragic circumstances. All of the glimpses the public gets into prisons, like ""Lock up,"" show hardened criminals, and make jail life seem like it is one of day to day survival. They make it seem as though you have to be tough and aggressive just to survive. I may be completely ignorant, but this is my understanding of prison. You don't have the background of the other criminals nor the malicious intent many of them have held. I can understand the transition of being a criminal on the street to being an inmate, but an average who ends up in prison? I couldn't imagine what that would be like.

I feel as an average dude, if I made some honest mistakes, then landed  in prison I would completely fucked, and wouldn't survive very long.","1346457689"

However, I think rituals take advantage of the power of belief. All rituals do is fix your mind to doing something that holds meaning, so you believe you are actually achieving something. And boy does it work.","1346457700"

Playing sports got me through the shitty foster care system, through high school being well below poverty, through college and well was my rock as I started a my normal career.  It was the one thing I could go to and make friends, have fun and make my mark.  I kept at it into my mid 30s, but then the injuries started to pile up and I went from being 'the fastest guy on the field', to 'a fast guy', to 'the old guy with a few quicks', to simply too gimpy to play at all in a matter of a year.  

Yeah, sounds corny even to type, but when you've had something in your life that has brought you peace through the most troubling times in your life and it's suddenly gone for you there is a deep sense of loss, regardless of whatever that thing might have been.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;As one of those libertarian scumbags you speak of, it's not that we don't value fairness and equality,

yeah actually. yeah it is.

libertarians start from the unsupported premise ""all governments are evil"" and instead of doing stuff like exercising your democratic rights in a free society to work to create government that isn't evil, or hold government to account, your solution is ""destroy all government.""

then there's the obsession with government waste, corruption and inefficiency (usually while pushing free market principles and ignoring the fact that corporations can be just as corrupt, wasteful and inefficient as governments, and in many cases far worse,) which leads to libertarians wanting to essentially throw the baby out with the bathwater. who cares that millions of people were prevented from starving to death on the street and given a hand up when they lost their jobs by the welfare system? there might be some corruption and some people might be exploiting the system and we can't have that!

the two areas where government corruption can have serious and dangerous consequences - police and the military - is usually the only government libertarians support. yep, they ignore the fact that a corrupt welfare system might mean a bunch of unscrupulous people get welfare when they don't need it, but a corrupt military *kills people*, sometimes a lot of people.

in general, libertarianism works really well if you are wealthy and don't need to worry about your future. it's a pretty dumb idea if you are poor and face uncertain future employment.","1346457703"

A fair point - those are definitely policies that I'm very disappointed in Obama for pursuing.

&gt;I expected all troops to be brought back.
You clearly weren't paying attention during the election since Obama's position was quite explicitly that he wanted to wind down the Iraq war so we could focus more on Afghanistan.

&gt;I expected habeas corpus being re-instituted..
Obama definitely tried on this one, but was blocked by the GOP.  I find it hard to assign too much blame for trying and failing.  

&gt;I expected legalization of marijuana
Again, you clearly weren't paying too much attention.  Though the marijuana may explain that one...

To me, it's all about how we attach ourselves to certain stories as children, that might reflect our inner needs and desires. Sarah needs to feel wanted and special, and uses literature as an escape. During her adventures there's the beginning of an acceptance that ""life isn't fair"" and acknowledgement that perhaps she'd been a bit childish in her approach up til now. 

I have always watched this film as though it were a story about the exact moment when you ""move on"" from your literary first love. The book is still there, but you've moved onto new things. Though as the beloved characters say, ""... should you need us...""

&gt;There is no evidence at all that small changes cause any damage

There is actually quite a bit of evidence that rapid climate change is detrimental to a variety of species.

&gt;All of the passion that went into making the CAGW

CAGW is not a real scientific term, it is a fake term invented by AGW deniers in order to discredit climate scientists. No denier has been able to provide an actual definition of what the ""Catastrophic"" epithet means in real-world terms.

&gt;All of the rise can be attributed to the natural warming that has gone on since the end of the LIA.

The LIA ended in the 19th century. Most of the warming in the 20th century, and *more* than the recorded warming in the second half of the 20th century, has been caused by human activity.

As for sea rise, it is not only rapid, it is accelerating.

&gt;Corals thrive through swings of temperature far greater than the miniscule warming supposed by the AGW zealots.

Corals aren't threatened by warming as much as the lowering pH of the oceans.

Oh, and the warming isn't ""minuscule."" The only ""minuscule"" thing here is your knowledge of this issue.

&gt;ENSO effects alone make that argument less than moot.

No, they don't. You've shown time and time again that you haven't a clue about ENSO. Stop trying to pretend you do.

&gt;Marine biologists can't explain bleaching

Sure they can.

&gt;But the number of storms is way way down.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","What exactly would make you think he has alzeimers?  He isn't even really old enough to get that yet.  He is seeing a psychologist.. do you realize that psychologists are also medical doctors? 

Its clear your siding with your mom, and I""m sure it makes both of you feel better to think that ""something is wrong with him"" rather than consider the idea that your dad doesn't love your mom anymore, and they're having what most people would call ""a tough divorce""

My parents went through a divorce, and my dad turned into a raging asshole. Everything your dad is doing, from the working out, to hiding money from your mom, is CLASSIC divorce. He's at a point where he can't stand your mom, and he's acting out.  That is not even CLOSE to alzheimers.

The blanket wrapping thing.. sounds like nothing at all.  Maybe he wants to make sure he can take all those blankets with him while he moves, or maybe he wrapped the furniture 4 times because he knows it will piss your mom off and that's what he's aiming for. Its a silly thing to consider a symptom of anything.

Get over it. He's already seeking medical help (psychologist) who is the BEST person to diagnose things like this. Not you, and especially not your mom.

To this day, my mom calls my dad ""satan"" and 20 years later, will tell everyone how nuts she thinks he is. People change, drastically during and after a divorce. He's angry and at the end of his rope. That's just what people will do when they get a divorce, because its a lot easier than considering the other person found fault in you. 

It sounds like your mom could use some help, if she's actually thinking this divorce is happening because your dad has something like Alzeimers. You could probably do the most good by getting her to see a therapist, too.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","As a person who's been to both private and public schools- A school is a school. One will charge you arm and leg and the other is free. **Public education can be just as good, if not better than some private schools depending on the area.** The public school I attended was one of the best in the state with, in my humble opinion, quality education. 

Private schools are notoriously hard on scholarship students. The competition is cut throat and the children are total snobs. They will treat you differently depending on your family's background and income bracket. If you're from a relatively well off family with impressive jobs, you're fine. However if you don't come from such a prestigious background then you are treated like the lowest of the low. The only way you can even hope to stay in the teachers' good graces (and thus gain some immunity from the discrimination) is to constantly try and stay at the top of the grade bracket. 

My mother was a single parent working overtime to pay for my education at a private school even though I was a scholarship student. I was treated poorly all the time by my fellow peers. I was so unmotivated to go to school that my grades started to slip and my status as a scholarship student was under jeopardy. 

In the end I eventually broke down and dropped out. I couldn't handle the pressure of being constantly pushed about like a second class citizen for not having a wealthy mother. 

Though I went to a well off public school district, the teachers and children weren't assholes. Sure the classrooms were larger and everything in general was noisier, but the important thing was that I was happy. I didn't have a guillotine hanging over my head and I wasn't treated like trash. The teachers genuinely were interested in teaching and cared about their students. ","1346457733"

You are partly correct. Listing an item for spares and repairs is not a blanket statement that prevents you from losing snad claims.

The item must be described to the best of your ability, and in as close as possible the correct condition. 

If however, you list a phone that you know isn't working 'for spares or repairs' (I knew it wasn't working from a previous thread the OP made) and then the buyer's claim is that there are cracks (that the seller listed as scratches) those cracks are not significant.

"DayZAustralia","t5_2unpa","Maybe im missing something, but regardless of the accusations of hacking/script killing/teleporting being thrown around (on both sides) that no-one has been able to substantiate,  The admins on AU46 server have clearly admitted to banning people based on the say so of their clan members, and not based on logs or real evidence. The fact that it turns out there was no actual hacking done by the people that recieved a ban makes it worse, but it still leaves the initial breaking of the rules regarding the ban.  The DayZ server rules are not subtle or vauge on this :

""You are not permitted to ban players for killing yourself or clan members.""  (this rule may not have been breached)
""You are not permitted to ban for suspected cheats or exploits of a non-server-disruptive nature, including but not limited to ghosting, unverified cheating, duping and similar, UNLESS you have solid evidence, IE logs."" (this rule has clearly been breached)

I think its also bad form (and again, not in line with DayZ hosting rules) to ask players to provide evidence they were ""not hacking""  Id hate to see a legal system run by these guys :
AU46 : ""you are accused of a crime, what do you have to say in your defense""
Me : ""Ah, could I just ask what evidence you are charging me with""
AU46 : ""one of our mates saw you do it, and thats good enought for me""
Me : ""ah, ok, so no actual evidence as such?""
AU46 ""ah.. no.. but you're still charged with a crime, and you still need to prove you are innocent""

I respect the attempts to rein in hacking, as hacking is making a mockery of the game, but this is a clear overstepping of the DayZ hosting rules.

Considering the service is brand new, helping Valve out during the inevitable growing pains is a pretty cool thing to do. Sure, they make  lot of money, but if Steam wasn't so useful, they wouldn't have such a high status amongst many gamers. This is just an example of how a community helps a company that has provided a good service to them, even if they don't have to (or are not getting paid).","1346457764"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I don't belong to a denomination - that even sounds bad to me, to *belong* to a denomination! If I had to label myself I'd probably say emergent or something like that. I didn't grow up in church, and had a generally negative view of organized religion for a long time, but a strong belief in God. Then I came to faith in Christ and jumped in with both feet. Read the bible cover to cover a couple times and really saw a disconnect between mainstream American Christianity and the spirit and teachings of Jesus. So I felt I was much less aligned with the common beliefs and attitudes of the american church. We still agree on the most important points, of course. But in terms of how to live one's life, I feel far removed.

A good example is this: I feel American Christianity is heavily, HEAVILY focused on personal sanctity and avoiding sin. Prayer groups, accountability, all that time and effort focusing on purifying ourselves. It's all well and good, but that behavior is much more like the Jews of Jesus's day than Jesus and his disciples. They were busy getting their hands dirty, ""sinning"" in the eyes of their peers, and reaching out to their community with love and healing and hope. I'm not as effective in that regard as I want to be, but that's the direction I'm striving toward.

The church makes a huge deal about heaven and hell. Like our life's purpose is to prepare and ensure that we're going to heaven. But to focus one's life on that would almost inevitably lead one to neglect the true good one can do in the world and the effect one can have on the lives of others. It's a selfish attitude. I'd rather risk my salvation to serve others! I love to pray and worship, but I feel that my strongest service to God is service to others - especially the disenfranchised, outcast, and today's equivalent of ""unclean.""","1346457764"

"poker","t5_2qhix","Fundamental misunderstanding of range here. It's very easy to put him on a range if he's playing &gt;50% of his hands. I see this misunderstanding a lot. Just because he'll show up with weird hands sometimes doesn't mean it's hard to put him on a range.

Honestly what I think is happening here is that this guy is probably a pretty solid player, and the rest of your home game is probably full of players who are loose preflop and passive post, so he can pretty much take command of the pot and force the action as he wants. So he just runs them over, shuts down at any resistance because you guys are only giving him resistance when you have the goods. I imagine he can also read body language decently so it's harder for you guys to get away with airball bluffs vs him.

Another thing, jamming when you have a decent hand with solid showdown value, such as having an ace or a king on an ace or king high board, when he's almost guaranteed to keep firing is probably the worst thing you can do don't do that. Only jam if you think he's calling with worse, which from what it sounds like he doesn't just snap call ai on gut shots or weak one paired hands. I know people like to jam just because they're afraid of getting drawn out on or whatever coz they always remember the time homeboy rivered two pair with his rags when they had some premium AK but whatever you're not going to win every hand.

My rec for now is to learn to look for spots to play more aggressively post flop. Start c/r'ing hands like draws instead of check calling. On high boards like AKT that hit your perceived range, c/r the shit out of those and give him a bunch of resistance so he shuts down. You're going to have more variance doing this btw, but playing effectively vs good lags is always going to wind up in more variance. Also really focus on your own body language, you may be giving off some strong tells that give him the info he needs to run you over.","1346457764"

&gt;she no longer has romantic feelings for me and isn't sure if those feelings will return. 

If she were a girlfriend what would you do? I assume there was some mention of fidelity in your vows, but those have been broken.

So the question you are facing really isn't whether you can or want to *save* your marriage, it is whether you want to start over and try and *build* it again. This isn't hard times, this is broken vows. Did she not mean it? Was she not capable? Either way you have to ask yourself if you would trust her to make them again, and if it is a relationship you would want if you hadn't been married the first time.

I was in your position, I ended up divorced after my wife cheated on me. Our relationship had been rocky from the start, we had developed all sorts of dysfunctions and problems. And I said ""Why on earth would I choose this? I know it will be hard and I will most likely be unhappy..."" I ended it. I stopped sacrificing myself, stopped compromising regarding what I wanted in a partner, found someone fabulous, and now my second marriage has been almost twice as long as my first and I just keep getting happier.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","""It only victimizes women and lets them feel that way about themselves if they allow it to""

So you're an expert?  You're a sociologist?  You're a psychiatrist?  That's a simple-minded, dumb comment you made.  Individual circumstances are as varied as snowflakes.  When you've done some serious scientific research on the topic, you've earned the right to start saying what's what.  Until then, you're just a uninformed person making baseless assertions.

""She is projecting her values and opinions about porn onto the behavior of her SO and expecting him to conform to her wishes""

The difference is the she's **in a relationship** with this guy.  Her values and opinions constitute half of the values and opinions that need to be respected in that relationship.

Your analogy with the junk food is horrible.  In many people's mind, watching pornography is akin to infidelity.  It's looking at a person other than your SO in a sexual way.  When it comes to trust in a relationship, and wanting to feel a sense of supremacy in your SO's life and thoughts, you're tapping into much deeper emotions and feelings.  You can be upset with someone for saying they won't eat junkfood, but you'd be a little more upset to find out they cheated on you.  

The bottom line is that OP didn't **demand** anything, she just told her BF that she had a problem with it, and asked if he'd stop.  He said he would.  So now you have two problems where before there was only one, you've still got the problem of the porn, but now you've got the lie too.  If he'll lie about that, what else would he lie about?  It undermines the trust in the relationship, which is the whole basis of the relationship.

I think what's tripping you up here is that you seem to have some personal pro-porn crusade, and to me this post has very little to do with porn.  It could have been anything... the point is that her BF made a promise, and he broke it, and then he lied about it.  It doesn't really matter what the promise was made about, and it doesn't really matter if he was asked to promise something unreasonable.  If someone asks you to make an unreasonable promise, you say ""no, I won't promise that, it's unreasonable.""  You don't just take the easy route and lie about it.","1346457770"

But,seriously, for welfare, you're not being handed a shit load of cash straight up.

You get vouchers and a ""debit"" system but you can't roll in and buy some $300 shoes.

   Though I'll be the first to point out that they're getting welfare, and ""money under the table"" AND slinging rock to pay for those shoes.

Funny, nobody is making jokes about our Military-industrial welfare recipients... they get a far bigger share of your ""hard earned tax dollars""

Goddamn, our view is so fucking skewed.

Look at the percentage or our tax dollars that go to ""welfare"" then look at the percentage that goes to ""defense"" and (spying on YOU) ""homeland defense"" and then ""make with the funny""

The greatest problem we have is the commercial fishing vessels and to a lesser extent the Sunday outing of a man with his son. 
But if you allow for one, it provides a loophole for the other to make money off of the sale of fresh ocean fish. So stop all sale of ocean fish in the USA and allow the oceans off our shores to recover.

**I want to extend the national waters to 1,000 miles off the shore**
Patrol it and make sure that **NO FISHING VESSELS** cross that line unless they want their ships and catch confiscated and sold (at a later date).   It'll be all for nothing if we allow other flagged ships to creep in and steal catches in the middle of the night.. make it really risky and not worth it for the captains and crew.

It would be a net gain if we could put those US citizens that make a living off the oceans on unemployment for a few years and give them free schooling for another line of work...  or switch them into freshwater aquaculture to make up for those that want fresh fish.   Ocean farming only pollutes and spreads disease to wild populations... so that's going to be closed loophole as well.

When I look at all the cold case displays at the supermarket I see thousands of tons of fish going to waste simply because it's not being kept frozen and ends up going bad. 
Such a needless waste that I don't think we can really afford.

I'd be willing to go without for a few years and eat home grown tilapia if I knew it was to give the ocean species some measure of breathing room and have the thrill of a 100lb tuna online like those pictures I see from the 1970's.

Week four was also when I felt the most soreness. More than once I really had to slow myself down and gradually work up my pacing to feel comfortable. Even though it feels like you're not meeting your personal standards, keep in mind that the standards on paper aren't as stringent as you're wanting to be: C25k is all about finishing the intervals.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","This is where you and I disagree.

For one, I'm looking at the front page (as of 8/31/2012 4:45PM) and I see 4 out of the 25 threads have something about Apple. One of them is this one. One is about the case in Japan, another about Samsung holding LTE patents (this is the only non Android related post but considering the recent case I still find it relevant and interesting), and one last one about the court case in the US. I hardly consider this littering.

Also, I would argue that this does affect us as Android users. Maybe not immediately but it does set a tone for products moving forward. Being the gadget geek that I am, I love following this subreddit and speculating about the next products.

Sure it might be Samsung hardware and software related but it still is their line of Android devices. You wouldn't goto /r/linux and complain about how many Ubuntu posts there are. I own a Samsung smart phone and I find it relevant and interesting. I personally don't browse the Android blogs and if it wasn't for this subreddit I wouldn't have be able to follow the case as closely. 

But it's just a matter of preference I suppose. Like some of the other redditors here, I'm just going to echo them and say, if you don't think it belongs here hide/downvote it and move on.

Regardless, I agree that the cartoon may be more suited for /r/antitheism, but it does present a side of the virgin birth that I never considered before, whether or not it presents itself in a socially acceptable manner.  I mean, if I were Joseph, I would have been out of there faster than Bolt.

Bottled water tastes weird and DO NOT WANT.

As a contrast, the tap water in Peterborough, Ontario LITERALLY tastes like potting soil. (I know what potting soil tastes like because I grew up as a typical boy :) It's fine after a brita though.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","let's be philosophical for a moment.

by definition, you never step ""outside subjectivity"". now, sure, we could make another definition. i like ""intersubjectivity"". but this ""the untethered observer"" is... humbug! it's conceptually suspect.

""objective"" is a trick-word. there's no such thing as being ""aware"" of something ""objective"". awareness *is* subjective. ""objective"" is just a weird illusion that people used to tell themselves was going on ""out there, in the *real* real"", or something like that.

we can't keep perpetuating these simplistic conceptual frameworks! it's not healthy, for the intellectual praxis.

good for you that you're enjoying meditation. but please, don't go kicking up a conceptual (shit-)storm on the basis of *that*. be mindful (that kinda sounds like a pun, yeah) of the narrative component of all that stuff.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The system does need reform. The problem is that there are so many crimes that everyone is a criminal. The only question is whether or not you've been prosecuted.

Several attempts have been made to count the number of federal crimes, all have failed.

Because of this, the system is now one of plea bargains being the end of 99% of all charges. The trial barely exists. Prosecutors can overcharge and then people will settle for a plea bargain.

&gt;""There is no one in the United States over the age of 18 who cannot be indicted for some federal crime,"" said John Baker, a retired Louisiana State University law professor who has also tried counting the number of new federal crimes created in recent years. ""That is not an exaggeration.""

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","The phonology really isn't too different. 

1. /k/ and /g/ fronting to their palatal equivalents

2. g becoming /ɣ/ intervocalically 

3. &lt;ll&gt; (/l:/ becoming /tl/

4. á becoming /au/ and ó becoming /oʊ/ 

5. &lt;au&gt; becoming /ɔʏ/

6. the voiced stops devoicing (which probably weren't very strongly voiced to begin with because nearly of the languages spawned from Old Norse have this feature)

7. &lt;ǫ&gt; changing from /ɔ/ to orthographically &lt;ö&gt; (and in the other languages like Faroese and danish, Norwegian, etc.: ø) phonologically /ø/ and /œ/. 

8. &lt;æ&gt; (/ɛː/) becoming /ai:/

I'm sure there are a couple more changes, but I don't think that the majority of these changes would inhibit an Icelandic person from understanding spoken Old Norse, more the other way around there would be challenges.

Faroese however had a large variety of changes (3, 6, and 7, a huge host of vowel and long vowel changes, some of which below) as well as:

-/θ/ and /ð/ becoming /t/ and /d/ at the beginning of words 

-/ð/ and /g/ intervocallicaly becoming /w/ (silent at the end of syllables) 

-/g/ becoming /j/ or /v/ intervocallicaly (dependent on the vowel) 

-/k(:)/ and /g(:)/ becoming /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ before i, e, and j. 

-a process called skerping in which &lt;ógv&gt; is pronounced as /ɛgv/ (as well as a couple other similar situations)

-&lt;í&gt; (/i:/) becoming /ʊı/

-/r/ becoming /ɹ/ and because of this, the inception of the /ʂ/ allophone.

As an example of the differences:
Old Norse: Víkingr /vi:kiŋr/ 

Icelandic: Víkingur /ˈviːciŋkʏr/ 

Faroese: Víkingur /ˈvʊiːt͡ʃɪŋkʊɹ/

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","This is a tactic, the problem is, what happens when, because your opponent is faster than you, you hit his shoulder and he hits you on the chin?  You lose the point, you become discouraged at punching and what is the endgame plan?  To do so much damage to the shoulder the boxer can't defend with it anymore? Floyd won't stand there and take the punch flush just because its aimed at the shoulder, he'l still roll and defend it like it was coming at his face, and he's have an easier time countering it because 1. your hand is low because its at his shoulder and 2. he has to worry much less about the punch coming at him so can concentrate more on the punch he's landing, i think it plays into his gameplan if anything.

That being said Roy Jones and E. Steward often say it, you just have to pop the shoulder non stop so maybe it does work, but i'm yet to see anyone truly try it, maybe it does work, maybe its just a case of well there's nothing else to punch and you have to do something.","1346457815"

"breakingbad","t5_2rlw4","Then again, last episode's final scene, he seemed to be shocked at himself and regretting what he'd done. As though it had suddenly hit him what shit he does because he's let himself get this deep. He also seemed a bit more subdued and passive in the cold open to S5. I'd guess it is the death of his persona, but he has to continue with tidying stuff up before trying to get out, hence the fact he was heading back purely to save someone a year from now.

By no means will he just stop completely, but things will get much tougher for him before he can set them straight. If (when?) Jesse finds out about Mike, I can't imagine him being too cooperative.","1346457821"

I have no memory of the accident, only what lead up to it. Yet slowly my dreams have been feeding me bits and bits of what happened. Me screaming, the impact of the ground as my body bounces off it and rolls over. After the accident everything felt like a dream, to escape it I became addicted to painkillers which I was given much more than needed. When I finally quit the first day I went without pain killers was surreal, never in my life did I feel more isolated. As I walked through the halls of my school everyone and everything seemed fake, its impossible to describe but I felt like I didn't belong for lack of better explanation. Eventually the feeling wore off as days passed and I moved on, but this story brought back the memories of all this. Even as I type, the feeling that I'm in a dream like realm is slowly creeping back to me. Thank you for this story. When I dream I'll try to concentrate on the accident.","1346457826"

Basically my history professor hinted that the amount of Jews killed in the Holocaust were grossly over-stated. He was a very sweet man, not a racist or anything like that.

One day while discussing WW2, we discussed the taboo topic and all he would say is ""History records are written by men. Who came up with the figures? Whoever wrote the figures, how did they came up with the numbers and did they have anything to gain from exaggerating the numbers?""

That's all he ever spoke about it.


So I looked it up.

The Jewish people came up with the figures through estimation and is silently questioned by historians. No one dares question it openly as it  is still too taboo to do so.

It changed my outlook on life and the people of the world.

No, I called you passive aggressive and cowardly because instead of putting your foot down right then and there you wait no telling how long after the fact to bitch about it on some website. I mean you were in a college classroom, what were they gonna do beat you up?

I called you passively racist because you said all AA studies teach that black people can't be racist, even though you admitted that the professor said no such thing, because three fools in your class feel that way? Really?

I said you were stewing because you blew up at me first because of my ""derisive"" quotation marks.

&gt;I never claimed all black people, the majority of black people or even the minority of black people are bad.

Did you not say AA studies classes teach that black people can't be racist, because three individuals, who weren't even the professor mind you, held such opinions? Maybe racist is the wrong word, ignorant may be more apt.

No, shit. There's people of all races who feel this way. 

I was never arguing that black people can't be racist as I'm not a fool. I was originally expressing skepticism over your claims of AA classes teach ""Blacks can't be racist.""

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","The issue is there is a line between creative game play / innovation on the part of players and something that is clearly a bug.

Defeating a boss and receiving more loot than intended in exchange for work from 50 people might be a bug but not earth shattering. I would be surprised if the developers even noticed, its the kind of thing that gets quietly patched out with little fanfare.

Printing money by clicking on an npc to receive high level loot for a fraction of its expected / intended cost is clearly an issue. Exploits like that have the potential to completely ruin an entire game for everyone.

Just comes down to common sense surely?

For this particular exploit it was posted as an exploit on some popular sites that specialise in bots, explots etc. (I'd be very surprised if the Devs don't read them.) It's very hard to claim ignorance when 99.99% of people will have only found out about this because the items were very clearly not correctly priced. Even more so because I guess many people will have bought stacks and stacks in an attempt to get rich quick. Its going to be difficult to claim that the developers are terrorizing you for buying a set of armor in good faith if you have stacks and stacks of the same items for no other reason than abusing a bug.

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","This is a painful story to remember, much less tell. Perhaps its anonymous retelling to such an empathetic community will provide some small measure of catharsis. 

My story of social and personal failure takes place, as many do, during the eternal night known as Middle and High School. During the first few years of this period, I had successfully alienated myself from the rest of my classmates due to my inability to adapt and cope with the ever-evolving social paradigms. This, of course, made hanging out with me a social liability per the sophisticated structure of Middle School politics.

Luckily for me, there was one kid even more awkward and toxic than I. We became pretty good friends. But as time went by my lust for mainstream acceptance grew and with it, my resentment for him. Through no fault of his own, his awkward and mildly annoying mannerisms became nearly unbearable to me. The carefree way he embraced his awkwardness by shamelessly and spontaneously blurting out bad jokes and esoteric references to the nerdiest of pastimes started to make my blood boil. In retrospect, I was just as awkward, and just as guilty of the antics that bothered me (and that may be the real reason it sickened me); however, in my adolescent mind I knew I what I had to do to gain that much-sought-after acceptance. Obviously not attaining social acceptance in Middle School is the WORST POSSIBLE THING.

I refused to be seen with him anymore. In addition, I degraded him as much as I could behind his back in the hopes of raising my profile. It was one of the worst things I have ever done to another person. He was understandably devastated and I didn't care. I didn't care about our friendship. I didn't care about his feelings. All I cared about was the social status that never came.

Fast forward to High School. Our school was a small, private, Kindergarten through 12th Grade institution, which meant the majority of my Middle School classmates matriculated with me. In hindsight I probably should have enrolled in a different school. Unfortunately for me, my stubbornness sabotaged my opportunity at a completely clean slate. Predictably, I fell back into my old habits to boost my social standing.

There was a new target as well. He came from a different school and, although many of us had interacted with him during extracurricular activities, he was a somewhat unknown commodity. He was also a bit socially awkward, though certainly less so than me. This was when I became the thing I hated most, a bully, and probably not a very good one at that. I don't even remember much about what I did to him. It was probably anything that I thought would make me look better than him by comparison. What I do remember is that I felt despicable whenever I reflected on what I was doing. But I continued. There was no Kantian revelation that the ends didn't justify the means, just that same lust for popularity.

The one thing I do clearly remember was how stoic he was during every incident. Eventually we found common ground with the game Magic: The Gathering and developed a rivalry that quickly turned into a friendship. It wasn't long until we found more people who were interested in gaming and formed a clique of sorts. Some of us even went to a gaming convention to play in some tournaments there. It was the best part of High School for me yet something still felt wrong.

I guess years as a social pariah can mess with a person's mind because I still never felt fully accepted by the group. Looking back I would argue that this was just paranoia and I was indeed and it was as genuine a friendship as one can have in High School. Nevertheless my insecurity caused me to constantly push myself into the spotlight. I wanted to make myself a vital member of our group so as to ensure I wouldn't be shunned. I thought it was working. It was not.

Awhile later they just stopped talking to me. I didn't understand. All of a sudden these good friends of mine were ignoring me. I wanted answers so I persisted to try to hang out with them during break hours only to be met with more and more hostile clues that they wanted nothing to do with me. I remember distinctly the moment when it all sank in like it was yesterday. During a mutual break I wandered over to our normal hangout spot when I was met with a loud “oh look, IT returns” from one of the members. I froze for what seemed like an eternity, then slowly walked away.

It was lowest I had ever felt in my life (and only once since have I felt lower). I was angry, ashamed, confused, stunned, and just plain miserable. I blamed myself. Perhaps I was too thick and insecure to pick up on early warning signs that my antics were not appreciated. Or maybe this was some sort of karmic retribution for my actions a few years prior. Now it was I who felt isolated and friendless, and all I could think of was that it was all my fault. I spent the whole weekend in bed dwelling on what I had lost and not knowing how I would proceed.

Ironically, when I returned to school the next week there was one guy who reached out to me. The kid who I once picked on, who probably had more reason than anybody else to cast me aside, came up to me and asked if I wanted to hang out. I'm humbled and grateful that he did. We hung out a lot during the final couple of years. At times we were nearly inseparable. Although life has taken us in different directions geographically, and I only get to see him once or twice a year at best, I am proud to still call him one of my best friends.

I would like to think that I am a better man for having this experience. I would like to think that the people who abandoned me felt some sort of guilt about it later and are also better people because of it. I would like to think that if given the chance to talk to them today, we could actually be friendly again. And while I would like to think all of these things, I cannot say at all if any of them are true. There is only one thing that I know. I didn't know how truly great friendship was, and by extension how much damage I caused when I took it away from someone, until it was taken away from me.

EPILOGUE: Time has done a decent job of healing the wounds. I had a chance to meet up with the man I once shunned in my ill-conceived self-promotional maneuver. He has accepted my apology. While we don't talk much, I am glad we are talking at all. I am no longer angry at the group that left me behind although I haven't really had any contact with them since. While there will probably always be a nagging paranoia of an impending abandonment, I now have a group of friends that I know I can depend on.

TL;DR Stupidly abandoned a friend, was even more of an asshole to another, later had my entire group of friends abandon me, briefly having no friends gave me great perspective of the value of the friends I have today. Learned a valuable lesson about friendship.","1346457838"

On off days, I do the couch stretch (see the recent 70s big video on it) to try to reduce the shooting hip pain I had the first four months or so I was squatting. And the usual foam roller/lacrosse ball tweaking.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Should they decide now or then what to eat? 

No, they need food to live. This is a parental decision, you can chose what to feed your child - within reason to keep them a live.

&gt;what to wear?

For the most part, they need clothes to stay clean or warm. Otherwise this is a not a comparison since it is non-medical in nature.

&gt;which inoculations to get? 

Some parents, ridiculously, do decide not to inoculate their children. They should be penalised for this decision.

&gt;if they need surgery they should be able to choose whether to get it or not.

Surgery, if it is medical (i.e. not aesthetic [in the case of jewellery etc]) and has the potential to save a life, of course, should be given above parental consent.


Circumcision is for the most part none of these. It is entirely an aesthetic operation or a religiously inspired procedure. Therefore, it should be the right of any human being to be able to chose not to have this done to them. That is, above parental consent, and as babies and children are not able to grasp the complex nature of this decision or make it at that time, and since it is irreversible, it should be default not to have it done. I don't think the want to stop needless mutilation of children is at all ""baseless crap"".","1346457839"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Ignoring the semantic issue ofwhat you consider ""indoctrination"", the problem is simple the ""without question"" element. Evolution has been and is currently being (and likely will always be) questioned. That is the point of the scientific method.

Far too many theists treat science as something that is anti-religion and can be proven wrong. Which is a fundamental misjudgement on a grand scale.

Science as a whole is simply a title given to the observations and so on that occur every single day. This is then extended to explaining phenomena which might not be seen every day, but can be explained by those observations.

Evolution is simply one of those phenomenon. Based on what we actually and completely know to be fact, we can theorise that these facts culminate in what we call evolution.

It's not as if evolution was decided on hundreds of years ago and any evidence of deviation is seen as wrong. Any evidence of deviation is seen as the prefect catalyst to redefine or redirect the theory, to encompass the new evidence and be as completely ""true"" as we can possibly make it, else we relegate it to simply being incorrect and accept a theory which does fit the evidence (evolution fits the evidence so well that it's likely only ever to be tweaked, rather than flat out refuted). 

Apologies for the long post, but with so many people posting short ""Well maths is taught 'without question' too"" posts, without any actual explanation, I felt it worth while to explain.","1346457840"

I'm serious. We went on a camping trip once and tried to get it to go to the bathroom, but after training it in the same house for 6 years she thinks she's only allowed to excrete wastes in our back yard. She held it in for 2 days. We don't have a fence, and we can still let her out side without watching her. She wouldn't dare leave.

The person of whom you were sitting their dog for paid no attention to training their dog. Don't assume all dogs are like that, because they're not.

Relating to people can be learned from relating to parents.


All that children learn while going to school with other children is learning to deal with asshole children.   Many asshole children become less assholish as they age (of course there are asshole adults too... but it is much less noticeable... and by that point the ""children"" will be a lot more eloquent and knowledgable of the resources for dealing with such assholishness).... My theory is that public schools may make wiser children (in terms of socializing) but they don't make wiser adults.

Everything they learn regarding social skills will be obsolete by the time they are 20.  They are better off skipping the drama and focusing that energy on learning useful stuff about science or math or history or whatevs.

Sorry to be a boner kill, but I liked lingerie football before I found out how often the players get injured, and that the players barely get paid even though the teams are profitable, and they have to pay a $5000 termination fine to quit their shitty-ass dangerous job. It sucks that the only opportunity women have to play football or hockey and have people watch it on TV is to do it half naked, and it says fucked up things about our culture.

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","I'd like to agree with you, but I think that a lot of the prejudice is *actually* due. Maybe there will be a point when the MR movement, or at the very least the vast majority of MRAs, don't define themselves as primarily in opposition to feminism. I think you're right, and that many (but not all, and maybe not even most) of the injustices that MRAs are concerned with are relics of patriarchal society.

I think that the reasonable factions of the MRM are very much splinters of feminism, but I also think that the vast majority of modern feminists support change for MR where the majority of MRAs are pretty misogynistic. 

So, yeah. I think the modern feminist movement is already fighting MR battles, and will accept the MRM with open arms once MRAs stop hating women and decide that they can be allies.","1346457857"

Your response reminds me that there are good, sane people in the military. I think that the idea I've formed of people in the military is heavily coloured by the fact that I know very few of them, and the ones I do know are not the good type. It feels good to have that depressing view challenged. I'm also glad to hear that you didn't feel like you were being programmed or brainwashed in the marines (though we are all being brainwashed by corporate propaganda on a daily basis). I guess my particular brainwashing (left-wing media/reddit/living internationally) has fed me its truth in the way that everyone is fed theirs. 

Personally, the military has never really appealed to me. I guess the dilemma has always boiled down to this for me: If I was the captain of a nuclear submarine and I suddenly got the command to launch missiles, would I do it? Could I kill  people based on an order? Could I kill in the name of anything but self-defence?
I'm strongly opposed to the idea of violence, and I do not pledge my life to any country. I would, however give my life for other people. Perhaps this is where we share common ground - the idea of a greater good, and sacrifice worthy of it.

tl;dr we should have a beer sometime :)

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Fleet Admiral Nikolai Apamidev.

In 2327, a colony fleet of 5 massive asteroid colony ships and number of other support vessels left Earth, headed for Delta Pavonis. Aboard the UESS *Amerigo Vespucci*, a Marco Polo-class long-range exploration sleeper ship built by the United Earth Space Command to support the colony ships with advanced science capabilities, was a young Lieutenant named Nikolai Apimidev.

Due to some drama on-board the flight as they neared Delta Pavonis in 2563 CE, Nikolai's CO detected some strange readings which were traced to a communication array of unknown origin near Delta Pavonis. This was deemed an extreme threat, and required them to redirect the fleet to Gamma Pavonis instead. The captain of the *Vespucci* attempted to break off from the fleet, and was subdued by Nikolai and the rest of his shift. After this incident, Nikolai was promoted to Shift Commander in upon his next shift in 2803, and was the first human contacted by the Benefactors.

After the Benefactors transported the colony fleet to their sector, Nikolai was instrumental in avoiding several fleets of possibly hostile aliens, now known to the the Hxch. Despite there being no weapons on the *Vespucci*, Commander Apamidev was able to successfully bluff the Xeno fleet and cause them to retreat. For this, he was promoted to Captain, and he spent the next few years locating the system that would eventually become the colony of Principio. 

Given command of a cruiser, in CY 4 Captain Apimedev encountered a Hxch scout ship in the Kuiper belt of Principo's primary star, Lux. He was able to destroy the alien ship and capture several survivors for interrogation, but unfortunately was not able to recover the hyperdrive. After the first Hyperspace Gate was built orbiting Principio, Captain Apimedev went on a grand tour of the nearby alien planets, and made first contact with the Myrmecians, Yoten, and several other alien races.

Now a favorite of Fleet Admiral Patel, Nikolai served on the diplomatic mission to Au'Andyr when the Colonies joined the Galactic Council for Peace in CY 12. He uncovered a plot by a mysterious alien race to release an engineered virus that could have caused billions of deaths among the Au'Andyr, and was widely acclaimed as a hero. This act also improved relations with the Au'Andyr to the point where they were willing to share some of their technology with the Colonies, cementing Captain Apamidev's reputation as a diplomat. 

During the next 60 years, Nikolai served as a politician and diplomat. He was promoted to Admiral in CY 35, and was elected to the rank of Fleet Admiral by the Admiralty Board by CY 40. He served as Fleet Admiral for 20 years, and retired. He was reactivated during the Hxch conflict in CY 79, and given command of the 1st Fleet and its flagship, the UCNS *Nikolai Apimedev*. During action in the Hephaestus and Thule systems, he scored some of the only victories in the one-sided conflict. 

Hailed as a hero, but distrusted by the younger members of the Admiralty Board, the Fleet Admiral was forcibly retired when the conflict ended in CY 82. When the first FTL ship was built at the Thule Shipyards in CY 88, Nikolai called in a few favors and had a large exploration ship built, the UCS *Spirit of Freedom*. Gathering a loyal crew of friends and family, he set off for an unexplored sector. He sent back several reports, and returned for several resupply missions, but on his last expedition in CY 94 and was not heard from again.

There are rumors among the traders and prospectors in the outer colonies that the Fleet Admiral had enough of the tyranny of the Admiralty Board, and retired to some distant world with his crew. ","1346457873"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","The kid just had no reason to do it. He was a PhD candidate who up until a few weeks prior to the event had never showed violent or sociopathic tendencies. His father was supposed to testify against FICO a few weeks after the shooting, but canceled his testimony due to the event. I have heard various reports mentioning that he seemed to disappear for a few weeks prior to the shooting as well as saying he appeared to be dazed and messed up. There have been reports of scopolamine being a possibility. The whole time during court he refused to accept that he was the shooter. A person under the influence of scopolamine would likely exhibit similar behavior to his prior to the shooting, and why he was found in the car just sitting there. IIRC he was never really exposed to firearms until he purchased the murder weapons. There were initial reports of someone letting someone in or leaving through the side door of the theater just prior to the shooting.

In my opinion he was abducted a few weeks prior to the shooting by two or possibly three armed men. They started drugging him while forcing him to go on with his life in a semi normal fashion. After he was finished with his commitments he pretty much disappeared. During this phase they were planning and getting everything in order. Finally on the night of the shooting spree he was driven to the theater by one of the men while one of the others went in near him to keep an eye on him. Just prior to the shooting they pulled him from the theater as the man in the gear came in. He awaited his time to strike. Once he opened fire the weapon jammed. It is said that he had the jam cleared very quickly, way to quickly for someone with little firearm experience. Either way after the shooting the guy ran outside into an awaiting vehicle while Holmes was escorted to the car. 
If he was infact the shooter why did he not try to drive away? Why did he not shoot himself? He was found in the passenger seat and the initial police reports mentioned that he seemed confused. 

I am sure someone will come in and disagree with this whole thing but I enjoy the possibility that not everything is as it seems. ","1346457882"

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt;No, labor labor. You work and receive the fruit of others' work. You are not dependent on a currency at all and you are not forced from your property/trading routes to create profit for capitalists.

Wait what? I work and receive the fruits of others' labor? That doesn't seem fair at all. Why can't I work for the fruits of my own labor, then use that to trade for the fruits of others' labor?

&gt;Vast amounts of capital are needed to create investments (buying factories, offices, etc). This is easier ten-fold for a lone rich man to do as he can lose a lot and still survive, while a group of starving workers would die from hunger if their enterprise fails.

This just isn't true anymore. It may have been true when Marx lived and wrote his works, but now it just doesn't relate. The means of production have been getting cheaper and cheaper, thanks to free markets. You only have to look as far as 3D printing to see this. I can get a good sized 3D printer for about $2000. I don't need giant factories anymore to create things. I need a small investment and an idea. When production gets cheaper, the economy moves more to a service based economy. Services are much cheaper to get into, as you only need a few tools and some know-how for most things. 

It is only when the state steps in to put up artificial barriers, then the cost of production goes up beyond reasonable limits. 

&gt;Capitalism is coercive in that you only have a choice between working for different capitalists, rather than creating your own workers' business, as the latter will fail quickly in a capitalist economy.

That's simply not true as well. Entrepreneurship excels in capitalism more than in any other system. See above about the inexpensiveness of creating your own business. ","1346457883"

"realitianity","t5_2tk9r","Here's an explanation for the hatred, 3 months after when you probably wanted it.

I haven't looked at this subreddit in a very long time, but I was in the thread where the idea first started.  The purpose of realitianity was to create a ""religion"" for the sake of obtaining tax exemption, just to be able to point out how broken the American laws are in regards to religion.  You can take a set of beliefs that are absolute bullshit (i.e. ""worshiping"" the hivemind) but if you have enough people get behind it, suddenly you get to game the system.

That was the point of realitianity.  Obviously we would have had to map out a ""legitimate"" religion to be able to achieve the end goal of tax exemption, but it was never a religion that was supposed to be taken seriously.

And then you took it seriously.  You also represented Reddit in a way that a lot of people found lame or cheesy.  That's where you lost everyone.  The upvotes were for the work you put into that pamphlet.  The negative comments were for the content you put forth.

I'm sure you probably don't care one way or another at this point.  But you put more work into that image than I've seen anyone else ever do on this subreddit.  So I figured you at least deserved an explanation.","1346457884"

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","This is a common question. Xehanort was only able to maintain his form as a heartless because he *willingly* forfeited his heart to the darkness, which is different than the other members. Based on Braig's reaction at the beginning of 3D, and of the talks between Dilan and Lea, we can infer that Ansem's apprentices (who would become Organization XIII) did not know what they were getting themselves into, and thus would not be granted the same control as Xehanort was.

On to the Heartless. It is actually quite the opposite case when comparing Nobodies and Heartless. If a person with a strong heart becomes a Nobody, then they can maintain their human mind and form. However, if a strong heart becomes a Heartless, according to one of Ansem/Xehanort's notes, the Heartless becomes increasingly more wild and inhuman looking. That is to say that the stronger the heart, the more ""abstract"" the Heartless works, and less of a  resemblance between the original body and the Heartless will be born.","1346457914"

"politics","t5_2cneq","You are so stuck on that one little point. It's not even really relevant. ""We built it"" is just a political response to obama's ""you didn't build that"" rhetoric. It is nothing he planned on saying, and that's how politics go down. Someone says they want to put you in chains.. the other will say you need to unshackle. This is just an absurd argument if this is all Obama supporters have is to try and bash Romney. Also, in my opinion, Obama is wrong because the government has nothing without the people.. period. Without the government the people will adapt and survive (which hopefully we never have to do, because government is an essential part of successful civilization, my only point being, we do not cease to exist without it, and life would go on for better or worse). Without people.. the government has nothing to even govern or pull money from. Obama wants to make it so the people can't survive without the government.. which they can and HAVE in the past.. that's why our forefathers came here, was to get away from over controlling over taxing governments and live where people will take care of themselves and not whine about the risks of freedom. Romney wants to expand corporations so that the government can take less from everyone else and become dependent on themselves and corporate ties. 

The difference is that with Romney, the American dream of being able to choose to work harder and take risks with less red tape (regulations) on getting started and having to figure out tax codes and laws and such.. in essence simplifying things to make it easier for people to start businesses with less money.. to put people to work and possibly succeed to millionaire status. That was the motivation America was founded on. Anything is possible.. but it's a risk.. and you might fail.. and you won't have someone necessarily to take care of you except the goodness of you neighbors, family and friends. It made Americans helpful and friendly and cautious and educated. It drove us to the greatness we are. The AMERICAN DREAM is what creates big ideas and pushes people to put in the 16-20 hour days for years sometimes that it takes to make a business successful. Not everyone will succeed.. but everyone has the opportunity.

Lets have a conversation about the ideals.. not petty details. Lets talk about the direction of the country and not some media rhetoric abstracting a single quote for weeks on end.","1346457921"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","The logic behind their bans is easy to understand:

Everyone has seen Karma costs for items on vendors before. They have an idea of how much it's worth, and what things cost, and there was no way anyone buying 21 karma gold weapons thought that that was the correct cost.

This is especially true since lower level weapons on the vendor right next to that one were massively more expensive.

People who bought ~50 or less of these weapons weren't suspended. ~50 to ~100 were given a 72 hour ban, and ~100+ were banned, but you're allowed to petition your ban and will be unbanned if *you* delete your ill-gotten gains. IMO, the ArenaNetSupportTeam responses on the subreddit (responding to players asking how many weapons they had bought) were pretty hilarious, including responses to several players who had bought 2000+ weapons and claimed they hadn't exploited.

Some players were botting certain events as well, and they only got a temporary suspension (72 hours, I believe), and they're ramping up the repercussions for botting as time goes on.

The 2.5s per stack (bugged to be 25s) Poppers that got Kripp banned weren't the only component, and the above explanation omits that the primary reason that he got banned was for *publicizing* the method; I believe the 72 hour ban was for exploiting the mechanic in the first place.

A big part of the account hackings was because people reused old credentials that had been previously compromised in other games, and they've addressed that with a really slick authentication system within a day.

The ingame mail hasn't been down for ""a couple days"", and the trading post is currently up, but for a random rotating 50%+ of the population, and they'll be bringing it up for everyone soon. The economy is definitely gonna be madness for a bit because there's lots of supply  but not nearly as much demand for the gear people have been saving.

The grouping issue with overflow servers has improved massively the last couple days, and I haven't had any trouble playing with friends the last two days, but it definitely sucked only being able to intermittently play with friends before that.

The **main** thing they appear to have done right in their launch is that there are zero login queues (no error 37, or 3 hour queues).","1346457922"

"philadelphia","t5_2qh24","Welcome! I moved here from California 2 years ago with my husband. We had no jobs, no friends and no clue what to expect.  It was easily the best decision of our lives.

What kind of a job are you looking for? It really helps to know people when finding a job out here, don't just rely on craigslist.  Same goes for an apartment.  If padmapper is still up and running, that helped us find some great apartments this year when we were looking for a new place.

One thing I never thought I would say as a Californian is that you really don't need a car.  In fact it's kind of an expensive pain in the ass to own one.  If you live outside of center city though, and have easy access to parking, it may be worth it.  But in the city, I found that it was a huge hassle and I really wish we would have sold it before we moved out here.

Eat as much cheap and disgusting Mexican food as you can in California, it's just not the same here.  I would seriously kill for Adalbertos [rolled tacos](http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/files/2008/12/rolled-tacos.jpg) right now.  Dammit why did I have to let myself think about that?

It looks like he took a standard cloak and draped some fur over the shoulders, but I've been working on a tutorial for making a [stark cloak](http://i.imgur.com/bwKpj.jpg) (with the straps and fur).  Here's a super brief version:

Take a [semi-circle of fabric](http://i.imgur.com/GWtmx.jpg) and cut out a neck hole on the flat edge.  The radius of the circle should be the distance from the back of your neck to where the cloak will hang.  Shin level, foot level, dragging, its up to you.  Higher means less tripping on it and less wear and tear, lower means warmer and cooler looking.

The straps are the trickiest part.  Try test fitting them with trape before sewing them down.  They should go over your shoulders somewhat like a backpack's straps, but they cross in the middle of your back.  From there they come up under the arms.  Each strap buckles to itself and also crosses over the chest.  They have to be longer than the above diagram implies, that's just where to sew them down.  In the show Jon's cloak buckles under his arms, but do what is comfortable.

Cut a (roughly) triangular piece of fur with a matching neck hole out of it.  I used faux fur on mine.  Its cheaper, easier to work with, and no one gets angry at me.  Doesn't look quite the same though.  Sew that ""fur"" down to the cloak last, or else the shoulder strap stitches will show through it.  Perhaps you want to add a liner or trim at this point also.  The straps hold the cloak on really well, but if you want a closure at the neck or chest could help keep it from ""flapping.""","1346457933"

"iphone","t5_2qh2b","before i got my android phone i had a motorola krzr. i wanted a smart phone and i didnt want the iphone that everybody had at the time and had heard good things about android so i got an LG EVE as a free upgrade. going from a flip phone to a smart phone was a jump i didnt know i ad to think about. i didnt realize that you have to consider smart phones specs just like a pc's specs. the LG EVE is the absolute shittiest phone in the world. resistive touchscreen, super small, super slow and it introduced me to the concept of fragmentation. this phone was running 1.5 when the latest version was 2.something and you couldnt just update. the carrier and manufacturer wouldnt let you update. not that it would have mattered because the phone probably wouldnt have been able to handle it.  

i then had a phone that couldnt use half the apps because the os version was too old. i got an iphone 4 as soon as i could and recommend it to anybody who wants something that works and is pretty much going to work for a long time. the whole thing really soured me towards android for the past few years. now that i understand more about what i want and am looking for in a smartphone, i have jailbroken my iphone and am even more happy with it. i have been considering an android for my next phone if the iphone 5 turns out to be just the iphone 4 S^s but am still very concerned about fragmentation as it was a big factor in ruining my previous experience","1346457934"

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","&gt;Ah, I thought you are getting ready to post a major online survey via one of the free survey service providers.

I sort of was, but then the idea of a weekly question occurred to me :) It'll be a 'survey-under-progress'.

&gt;It was supposed to be meaning something like: [average = sort of mediocre], [normal = ok to read].

To me, the 7-point scale covers all the necessary bases. You either like something or you don't, to different degrees, or neither. What is 'normal' doing between 'above average' and 'good'? 'Couldn't be worse/better' would hardly be used in practice, one might as well compress those into 'terrible/great'. Voila, there's your 7-point scale.

&gt; discrimination implies some sort of a negative reaction

Not all the relevant implications of a reaction are its place on the positive/negative scale. You might react positively, or neither positively nor negatively, on learning that I'm black, white, gay, female, American, Indian, whatever, but you can still discriminate if you think you know anything more about me than that single fact.

&gt; I'm ok with being called a white man

You shouldn't be. You're a sentient being (read: person). Anything else is labels, assumptions, and discrimination. If someone wants to know something about you, they'll only find it out by doing so directly, not via these proxies.","1346457943"

You certainly did a decent job of publicly cold-cocking me with that shit. Any time I tried to post my side of the story, the trolls (and mods) came out of the woodwork to attack me and defend poor 9000sins who got his feelings hurt. Congrats. You have your loyalties.

What you don't have is: my code, or my mind to guide its development. Congrats on that, too. ;)

I don't want your personal info, and (after all of this shit) I certainly don't want to stand in your presence. What I do want (for this subreddit) is for you to stop being self-absorbed. Learn diplomacy. Stuff like that. And, for the sake of anything you hold dear, stop using the sidebar as your own personal pulpit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My cousins, my brother and I try to outdo each other every year with un-wrapable presents. The rules are simple: you can only use your hands to open them, nothing else. Over the years we've ignored all attempts at mercy and feelings of guilt, feeding on a need to avenge ourselves for the pain inflicted the year before and come out the victor. 

Last year my cousin Ian gave my brother a heavy, huge lumpy-looking wrapped box. My brother got through the first 6 layers of sealed-with-clear-tape wrapping paper to find a wood box with nailed sides, wrapped with a thick rope choc-full of knots. It was only the beginning.

Several layers later and much effort spent, my brother finally got to the last layer: a painted box (5""x5"" or so). He looked in the small box, closed it, looked at my smiling cousin and buried his head in his hands. I took the box and looked inside: it was a cheeseburger with a bite taken out of it.","1346457962"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","No one has argued that they are characters created by their respective comedians. The point is how they go about entertaining. 

I would judge Kat Williams on the fact that he is not funny and he is playing to the lowest common denominator, just like Larry. 

As to their creators personality, I would say that Louis C.K. and Colbert are probably fairly close in personality to their on stage persona's, just as are Larry and Kat. All of them have stuck to similar characters for years. They got if from somewhere, and are probably in the case of all but Stephen, exaggerations of their own personalities. Stephen took the point of sarcasm and making fun of the people like his character and playing it to the extremes. However, his views are likely similar to the points he is trying to make with that sarcasm. 

Larry and Kat are just pandering hacks who found that if they exaggerate their personalities somewhat, they can make a ton of money. That is the difference besides the most broad basic concept of a comedian having a stage persona. Every actor/comedian has a stage persona, just as does every single person between their public face and how they behave in practice. That broad statement is pretty much true of everyone.

On the other hand, they could have allowed a minority voice, which would introduce a weakness into the resolve of the political party. I think the question that needs to be asked is, why do the majority hold their opinion? Because of the way politics and campaigns work in this country, the winner can be force-fed to the people and those people can be led to believe they have a legitimate choice. After all, how many Republicans do you know really think Mitt Romney is *the* guy? Here in Ohio, most Republicans I know would rather have Kasich up there, and those two are very far apart ideologically.

Ben Swann can sensationalize what happened, but it's what we all knew would happen, and it's precisely what's wrong with democracy and why it must be tempered with protection against tyranny - because such totalitarianism can only be overthrown by a desire from the majority, and if that said majority cannot overlook its own sycophantic love of the Party, we wind up with a literal oligarchy.","1346457972"

This is what I have a problem with, because of a ""simple fact of biology"" men have no choice.  The act of becoming a father is not voluntary according to you.  And the act of deciding to carry the fetus to term places an unwanted burden on the man.

&gt;But once the child is in the world, that's child's interests are what's most important.

I would disagree.

&gt;Adoption is not some magical fix and the foster care system sucks.

I agree that the system sucks.  But that just means work needs to be put into it to make it better.

&gt;If a mother doens't want to abort, she should not have to choose between giving the child up and parenting a child without support from the other parent.

According to your argument the man has to either choose between having sex with someone he knows will abort or consenting to parenthood or providing support.  He also has to hope contraceptives don't fuck up.

&gt;No, consenting to sex is consenting to the risk of child support.

So why is consenting to sex not consenting to supporting a child during pregnancy?  Property is arguably an extension of oneself.

&gt;I think financial freedom is not nearly as important as a child's welfare.

And I would disagree again.  I'm not so sure why the child's welfare is more important than the welfare of it's biological mother or father.","1346457972"

"C25K","t5_2rgoq","I posted this reply to a similar question recently. Maybe it'll be helpful for you:

I'm a molecular biologist, so this is at least informed speculation. Extended periods of regular exertion (a fancy way of saying 'training') condition an overall physiological response to stress. This response is quicker than you might imagine, and some things you might expect to change a bunch don't really change much at all (e.g., you don't start making a bunch of new red blood cells so you have more hemoglobin to carry oxygen in from your lungs to your tissues). But other hemodynamic measures change--importantly, your VO2 max (your body's ability to bring in and use oxygen) gradually increases over time. VO2 max is mediated by a huge number of interacting factors, and we've known for some time that [interval training really does seem to boost VO2 max](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8897392). Even though what you're describing isn't exactly interval training, it has its similarities. Stepping forward and backward in terms of workout intensity is likely a way to prolong some of those mechanisms for increasing VO2 max before your workouts become, essentially, entirely aerobic powerhouses of running non-stop for extended periods. It seems aimed in the direction of ensuring that your body is very, very ready to handle the aerobic load of 3x/week runs without pauses for pumping up your blood oxygen. ","1346457973"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","A few comments here.

A. It has to be said that Paul didn't write Timothy, 

B. There were no such thing as ""the gnostics"" as a group with a set standard of beliefs, it is not good scholarship to state otherwise. And the teaching that Jesus only appeared physical was only held by certain factions of ""gnostics"". I get tired of hearing this term being used in a derogatory manner by people who don't know who they are talking about and in many cases refering to people who understood the Gospel message better than the group that became traditional Christianity

c. What you state about the body and ressurection is taken from the beliefs of the group that would become the Orthodox Church who then taylored the Bible to support their views

The truth is that God's revelation is not limited to the Bible, nor to the teachings and opinions of Paul. We don't have one physical body which we live in, leave in the grave, and then plan to reclaim at some future ressurection. The truth is that we inhabit countless bodies over the course of our soul growing to the point of physical lives no longer being necessary.","1346457977"

So you joke about it as you sip from a ridiculously expensive pint with your friends and that girl Cecilia Priscillington-Smythe returned home from yet another one of her years spent travelling and discovering herself, returning to the comforting embrace that the lower latitude brings.

And so you will continue your cosmopolitan life, going to bars in warehouses and clubs built into the arches of tunnels; but inside you will always know that their womenfolk were oddly alluring, their vast assortment of pies were downright delicious, and most importantly you will never, **ever** drink like they do.

If I make $10,000 that is taxed at 10%, I owe the government $1,000 as my share of paying for those services. If I donate $1,000 to a charity of my choosing and write it off, I pay $900 in taxes. The $100 that I did NOT pay is functionally the government giving $100 to the charity of my choice. Additionally, currency does belong to the government. It is a convenience provided *by* the government to allow citizens to exchange labor and products without the barter system. Without government, there is no money.

The same licence key could be used to move to a 64-bit version,  but it may need to be reactivated by calling up Microsoft. Of course, a 64-bit installation disc would need to be used. Windows XP licences are not available to both architectures and must be purchased separately; in this case it's probably not worth it (although it may be to buy a new Windows 7 licence.)

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","One major problem I've noticed is that people think of entropy in the same way they think of kinetic or potential energy.  While in some cases entropy can be modeled with energy and energy is related to the entropy of a system, this is deceptive.

Take a system of 10^23 dice rolls.  Each permutation of rolls,  all 1s, all-1 1s and a 2, etc has an equal chance of happening.  However 99.999999999% of the random combinations of rolls are going to have a mix of all numbers.  Actually rolling 10^23 1s is next to impossible.

When you look at all the states there is only one state that has all 1s, while there exists countless states that are all mixed up.  When you throw that many dice you are always going to get a mix of numbers.  However you could SPEND ENERGY adding ""order"" to the system by rerolling non-1 dice, or placing them on the 1 side yourself.

If you start with all the dice on 1, the ""ordered system"" and start shaking it.  The system will quickly become a mix of numbers, the ""disordered system"".  No amount of shaking will return the system to its ""ordered state"".  It has undergone an unreversable change we call an increase in entropy.

Entropy as it is called is merely the tendency of a random system to return likely values.  Rather then specific unlikely values.","1346457988"

They think they can hand things in late, they think I am going to coddle them.  I've had many students fail my class (or end up with a D), and then take me again in the Spring.  After that first report card of bad grades, many of them shape up and realize ""ok, I actually have to do work to succeed here.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Let's top this cake off with a nice frosting of issues of state vs. federal sovereignity, and we're looking at a delicious dessert of national unrest. The final cause for war was South Carolina's secession, which basically rejected the legitimacy of the federal government to govern its states.

I think this part is rather important.

I usually bring this up if any of my friends/relatives talk about the federal government infringing on states' rights (usually in a joking manner, but it's still rather important). The final straw that started the civil war was the rejection of the idea that the federal government had the authority to impose law upon states that *don't agree with the law* being imposed.

I'll leave my own opinion on this topic out of the narrative, though.

Also, a small, interesting semantic tidbit: Prior to the civil war, the United States was referred to as a collective (ie: The United States *are*). After the civil war, the US started to be referred to globally as a singular entity (ie: The United States *is*). Now, instead of the country being made up of several *entirely* autonomous islands, we have a country made up of several semi-autonomous, interconnected, and highly interdependent areas.","1346457991"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","GRRM's ASoIaF is literary fantasy fiction. The Millenium trilogy is an airport novel/potboiler/genre fiction/pulp with objectively poor and terrible prose.

After reading ASoIaF I gave this extremely hyped series a shot. Perhaps it's a fault of the translator but:

1. Stieg Larssson has a problem with exposition. If you think GRRM has this problem you'll be in for torture. There's excessive exposition when we don't really care, and lack of it when it's needed. Instead of ""he drifted off to sleep to the sound of radiohead"", Larsson would write ""Blomvkist plugged in his Scosche IDR655m earphones and turned on his 16GB 6th generation ipod nano with 64 MB onboard RAM and USB support to skip to 2:14 of No Surprises by Radiohead, whilst sitting on a Bleking White Karstad Sofa by Ikea"". So yeah, Larsson randomly devolves the narrative into mundane descriptions, hijacking the flow of the narrative.

2. The flipside of the above is a lack of exposition. We see a definite lack of scene setting, where we see a character in a room doing something. We don't know where or why. This happens a *lot*. Tons and tons of completely pointless scenes and horribly far fetched coincidences.

3. Probably a translator thing but the idioms/proverbs/sayings are horrible and cliched. Here's an excerpt : ""She opened her eyes to two narrow slits and stared at him for many long seconds. Her eyes were unfocused. Then he heard her mutter in such a low voice that he could only with difficulty catch the words."" 
""She looked like an ageing vampire -- still strikingly beautiful but venomous as a snake.""
This is a stark contrast to GRRM who actually creates interesting idioms that make sense in the world he crafted. 

4. Very stereotypical and poorly developed characters. Gaping Plot holes.

5. The book glorifies rape and torture.


I think there's some kind of media-publisher conspiracy to publicize these shitty books, or maybe it's some kind of elaborate trolling technique.

I hate Dan Brown novels, but to be fair some parts of DVC and A&amp;D were somewhat engaging, but Stiegg Larsson is EVEN WORSE as a writer. I can't fathom how such utterly shit writing gets so much praise.","1346457991"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are so many theories about how time and the over all universe works it is impossible to say. The simplist explanation is that we will be able to travel back in time but only between the points where we invent time travel and all future points from that time. Sort of like you can't call a telephone that doesn't exist. So when time machines are made they only work when sending you to another time machine.

More complicated theories are things where if you travel back in time your actions will result in the past you left from. I mean if you travel back in time to WWII to kill Hitler before all of this starts you will fail and cause WWII to happen. So there has been a ton of time traveling but everyone who did was trying to be as discrete as possible and all of their actions resulted in what actually happened without them being aware of it. I hate to use this example but it is the only one I can think of. If you have ever read the 3rd Harry Potter book, the last few chapters paint a perfect picture of what i mean.

Honestly, it's probably the best fantasy world I've ever read about. It's incredibly complex but also pretty easy to grasp for a fantasy fan. Not the most compelling characters, but they're compelling enough, but I have a feeling they really aren't even the point of the story, just vessels in which Jordan can show us the world. Reminds me a bit of Tolkien in that sense. It's a goldmine of really well thought out and intriguing fantasy and world building concepts, and a lot of badass events/scenes. ","1346457999"

I'm arguing that her axioms aren't sound.

Plus, she doesn't argue ""if you accept these axioms, then you should behave like X.""  She argues ""these axioms are universally true, and if you don't agree, you're evil."" Yet they're clearly not universally true.

She *has* to argue that way, because the point of her philosophy isn't to explain or to enlighten, but to get other people to behave in the way she wants them to behave. I.e., it's not ""here's how I think the world works, don't you agree?""  It's ""here's how the world works, and you must agree, because I want you to behave towards me as if what I said is true.""

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Study into abnormal psychology and human sexuality will tell you this article actually has merits. In adolescents, especially, there is a strong desire to be an adult, especially in regards to sex and relationships. There are many cases in which young adults, usually 13-17 years old, find a sexual attraction to adults. Seeing the adult as a slightly-more-than-equal, it's logical to pursue a relationship. Unfortunately, children do not have the mental capacity to judge the consequences of said relationship, so they can't legally give consent. Even more unfortunate is the fact that being a pedophile, is very similar to being gay. It is a choice, but their biochemistry makes them naturally attracted to children and teens. 

But, to be clear: Although I understand these dynamics are natural, they are still abnormal, and with good reason. It is the responsibility of these adults to have the judgment to not allow such a relationship to blossom. It's not OK to have sexual relations with a child and then justify it by saying that they made the first move, even though that may have possibly been the case. That's why it's still rape even with consent.

ADDITION: Let me rephrase what I said about pedophiles and gays. Being gay means that the individual has an attraction to the same sex. To that person, it is a natural feeling, just like being attracted to the opposite sex. It is a choice they make to be gay, but those feelings cannot be discounted. The same can be said about anyone with abnormal sexual preferences. For whatever reason, the individual is attracted to children. The environmental influences could account for any portion of that, but it's also possible that those feelings occurred naturally. ","1346458010"

"excatholic","t5_2sdlb","you've touched on the biggest outrage of the whole sex scandal, IMO. the fact that the Church thinks it can exempt its members from the law, keep pedophiles a secret from the police, and just ""funnel them away"" to a retreat where they (allegedly) stay under supervision, and (allegedly) have no access to children....as if *that every worked, ever*. .....it really defines the word ""hubris"" for me. 

""yeah, we have our OWN laws, and we'll be following THOSE. fuck you guys, okay? give us free land!""

the thing that bogs down most people who've been abused by priests, or are just outraged at how heinous these crimes are, is that *the priests are the wrong people to blame.*

Pedophile priests, according to the 2002 (or 2003, can't remember) US Conference of Bishops, comprise about 4% of all priests in the US. Nowhere does it say *just how many priests there are, total*, so it's hard to judge how many pedophiles = 4% of the total. The bishop who gave the talk also did not include members of religious orders in that number, only parish priests unaffiliated with an order.

The real problem is the atmosphere in which these pedophiles are allowed to continue living, and the men who knew about these pedos and shielded them from justice/law.....that would be the bishops, cardinals, and popes beginning in 1962.(from what evidence is available)

priests are a ""moral gray area"", IMO, in that there's no real way to tell if a priest is a pedo, or knows about a pedo, because if asked, they are commanded to deny any knowledge of it, under pain of excommunication. (plus, who in their right mind would actually freely admit ""yeah, I'm a pedophile""...?)

A priest who doesn't know anything will be earnestly telling the truth. lots of times, priests are great people; the church LOVES trotting those guys out to bolster its PR image, too. classic ""compartmentalization"" tactic.

Because of *Crimen Sollicitacionis*, we know that every Bishop in the world at least knew there was a widespread problem, and every Bishop in the world kept their damned mouths shut until it blew up in their face. They, and those higher up than them, CAN be considered the real villains in this.

Fr Benedict is a symbol of a happier time for the Church, when nobody questioned their moral authority, and everyone judged the Church by the Church's own definitions of ""good"" and ""moral"". ","1346458018"

Essentially, Ron Paul used a few loopholes to get where he got. The RNC had some rules and Ron Paul technically followed the rules, he didn't break any of them, he was just sneaky. 

At the last minute rules were changed that meant Ron's delegates could not be seated. The RNC eventually voided a contract. As I said in another post, if the RNC want to change their rules for future events that is their prerogative. But Ron Paul's delegates were there because they played by the rules, albeit underhandedly. The RNC essentially said, ""LOL, no"" at the last minute.

Ron Paul wasn't going to win. Everyone knows that. The entire thing was unnecessary. But they could have just got on with it and given everyone the illusion of democracy. Instead they ended up alienating a bloc of Republicans. It would be like you being seconds away from scoring a goal and me moving the goalposts.

In 2005, Bush asked for $3.9 million, a small fraction of the request the corps made in internal administration deliberations. Under pressure from Congress, Bush ultimately agreed to spend $5.7 million. Since coming to office, Bush has essentially frozen spending on the Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for protecting the coastlines, waterways and other areas susceptible to natural disaster, at around $4.7 billion."" -Jim VandeHei and Peter Baker, Washington Post   

As I said, his cuts to levees is the reason that he is typically blamed for Katrina. The question then becomes would the requested funding level have prevented the devastation? (something that is still being argued) Also, if you want to go further it was widely reported that the Bush administration was told by the corps two days before Katrina that it was going to be ""catastrophic."" This information wasn't provided to the proper people; and as a result the reaction was dismal. FEMA is a Federal agency...

Congress tied his hands *completely* on that one. 

First, he's not allowed to bring them to American soil. Congress passed this law before he even took office, because of his campaign promises. So, we either release these guys (political suicide), or we transfer them to another country, and that country becomes the new terrorist target because they're helping us imprison these people.

Second, he now cannot use any government money for transfer of these alleged terrorists under any circumstances.

So what's left? Shoot and bury them? (I'm sure that's an acceptable solution to many, but let's keep it real... so far those suspects that have stood trial have been held under the flimsiest of evidence).

I'll give you the warrantless wiretapping one. I suspect that once he got into office, the DHS showed him how they're *actually* using it, and he realized that it was some deep shit, and not to fuck with it.

Aside from that, be honest with her. Extroverts love to talk about things, so talk to her about this. Tell her that sometimes you just need to chill out by yourself, and that the same way she gets energized from hanging with people, you get energized from spending time with yourself. 

I also find that planning hanging out together in advance (nothing formal, just a quick txt or smth) makes me prepared for hanging out with people, and I can actually get more energized from that, so it may be worth a try planning to do some stuff so that you know that you can have a few days alone, and she knows that you will hang with here even if you're currently retreated to your cave.","1346458061"

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","Thank you for the interesting conversation :)

&gt; I'm not implying the USA controls them at all. The only thing I'm insinuating is that the USA can pressure them into doing certain things. It's quite possible.

I agree with you that as a superpower the US can exert some pressure on China (and on the rest of the world). That influence however is limited. I think the US *could* pressure them into not meddling with some region with US interests. But the US is not interested in the whole world, so China is happily expanding its influence in places like Africa and South America, where the rest of the world seems to have little interest.

&gt; China has never really been expansionist in any way throughout history. It's unlikely they'll start now.

What do you mean? [At some point the Chinese Empire expanded over pretty much all of Asia](http://images.wikia.com/althistory/images/f/f4/Chinese_Empire_1025_%28EW%29.jpg).

Nowadays they are *forced* to expand their influence, as they need more and more raw materials for production and even more trading opportunities. The enormous economic growth is what makes China stable and their leaders know it. If China's economy were to crash, people would most likely start rioting and trying to bring down the government, like it happened with other regimes. So it's not about whether they want to expand or not. They *have to*, so they are already doing it.

&gt; They aren't really more powerful now than say thirty years ago

I think this is simply false. [Look at their GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif). 30 years ago they were nobody. Nowadays they are the second biggest economy in the world.

&gt; China can easily be embargoed

My point was that the world economies are already too dependent on China for an embargo to happen. Why would the EU join the US in such an embargo? A lot of the economies in Europe are already struggling, the euro as a currency is hanging by a thin thread. An embargo on China will quite literally destroy the already shaken economy of the Eurozone for sure. And they know it. I agree that the US can exert influence on Europe, but I don't think they can enforce anything that drastic, as such an action would simply destroy the EU.

So I agree with you - an embargo could totally fuck up China. But mark my words - nobody is going to do it, everybody is already too dependent on China for that to happen. After all - at the moment China is the biggest exporter in the world.

&gt; They're nowhere near being the biggest economy in a few years let alone ten or twenty.

What do you mean? According to the International Monetary Fund China will become the largest economy by 2016 [(source)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/27/china-imf-economy-2016). Other projections say it will happen around 2020 [(source)](http://blog.euromonitor.com/2010/07/special-report-top-10-largest-economies-in-2020.html). Of course these projections assume that they will maintain their growth, which is not certain for the reasons you specified (social problems, natural disasters, e.t.c). They *have* however managed to maintain that growth for a long time now, so you can't simply dismiss the whole thing like it isn't happening.

Nothing is certain about the future, but if something major doesn't happen China *will* be the biggest economy in less than a decade.","1346458063"

"confession","t5_2qo2a","To be blunt, 

no you didn't. Suicide is a tragic yet ultimately selfish act. You don't need to bear this guilt nor do I think she would want you to. If she wasn't strong enough to handle a teenager being a teenager that's on her not you. She let you down you told her how you felt. I can guarantee that you blowing up on her wasn't what convinced her to do it.

My brother became a meth head and let me tell you that it changes a person. Addiction literally changes who that person was. I'm sure you know what I mean when you look into their eyes when they're high and you don't recognize them. It's not just a cliche it's literal.

 There's a completely different person in there after the addiction. For a drug like meth it's almost impossible to ever really get clean. Even if you don't do the drug for years you're still addicted to it. There's no going back mentally from it. 

No mentally sane person would up and kill themselves because someone said it. I think most of us yelled at our parents and said ""I wish you would die"". She was done, plain and simple. You weren't the reason she did it. She was. It sucks that a person would abandon their child. She wasn't ready to be a parent obviously and wasn't strong enough for this world. You are. So even though it hurts and you will probably always feel guilty. Remember that you're stronger and you will value those you love and wont put them through the same bullshit.

"ask","t5_2qhlj","I was pretty fit when I was in high school. If a girl like what you're describing asked me out, I would have been thrilled. A flat stomach wasn't important, but someone who was pretty obese would have been a no go. When a girl is anymore than twice the size that she should be, they tend to all blend together, look the same, and don't have any discernible personality or character in their face. To me, it's hard to be attracted to someone without a face. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of a flat stomach. I like a little more curve and softness. In high school, I had a pretty big crush on someone that fits your description.

In high school, I think there's less of a chance that the guy will find her unattractive, and more of a chance that the guy will be embarrassed in front of his friends if he starting dating a bigger girl. When I say big, I mean twice the size she should be.

There's lots of guys who are just plain shy. The first half of high school I probably would have rejected a girl just because I was shy and didn't know what the hell to say. If for any reason he didn't seem to have interest in her, there's a pretty good chance it's because of him, not her.

She should ask him out. If he politely declines and she still has interest, she should ask him again in a few weeks or work on getting a little bit closer to him so he can get to know her a little better. If he declines in a not so nice way and she believes it's because of her looks, he can go fuck himself and she shouldn't be wasting her time with someone like that anyway.

Even girls with the flat stomachs you're talking about are worried about their looks. From what you're describing though, she sounds as good as anyone else.","1346458064"

NASA climatologist James Hansen:

Economic losses would be incalculable. More and more of the Midwest would be a dust bowl. California’s Central Valley could no longer be irrigated. Food prices would rise to unprecedented levels. If this sounds apocalyptic, it is.

Fatih Birol, chief economist with the International Energy Agency:

&gt;“The door is closing. I am very worried – if we don’t change direction now on how we use energy, we will end up beyond what scientists tell us is the minimum [for safety]. The door will be closed forever.”

You must have emergency money immediately available in a boring bank account. Imagine another 2008-like downturn that sends stocks crashing and also puts you out of work.

There are ways to make an emergency account make money beyond the boring interest. Here's how.

1) Insurance. Do you have a car? Jack up the deductible to $1000, or even drop collision/comprehensive. You can handle that $1000 yourself. The insurance premium will drop a lot.

2) Credit cards. Never carry a balance. Generally, never have a balance greater than your emergency fund. Since the fund should be greater than a month of expenses, it should not be a problem. Get a rewards card and pocket at least 1% of expenses.

3) Some banks (especially credit unions) will give you unusually high interest rates for using their debit card or for direct deposit. Mine pays 4% on $3K. That is, my bank pays me $10 a month.

4) Never pay overdraft charges. Your emergency amount is your ""mental zero"", so you should always have a positive balance in the bank. Sane banks will let you set up automatic transfer from savings into checking in case of overdraft for free. Don't use insane banks.

5) When the actual emergency comes, you will save a lot of money and stress by being able to deal with it. Especially if you have, say, stock investments that you're forced to liquidate when they are down.

So by having an adequate emergency reserve you'll effectively make more money than what you could get from investing.","1346458087"

Sometimes I would have to skip out of the gym for a couple weeks because school became ridiculous (engineering major) which slowed my progress. 

However, while I was hitting my goal my right wrist started hurting pretty badly. I think I bent it improperly the last time I worked out my chest. So unfortunately, I hit my goal but want to take things more slowly since I don't want to injure myself so it looks like I'll be at 65 lbs for at least a couple weeks until my wrist feels better.

The good news is I've corrected my form. I plan on going for more weight once I've recovered more. I'll probably shoot for 80 and take it from there.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It somewhat depends on the extent of the caloric deficit one puts their body in. In a pure caloric restriction situation, the ratio of losses for lean to fat mass usually sits around 1 part lean to 3 parts fat. However this ratio can be modified by strength training, and some data point to protein content *maybe* preserving lean mass to an extent. However, much of the immediate weight loss generated from a new diet/ weight loss routine represent losses in muscle and liver glycogen (and its associated water, driving this ratio more towards ""lean mass"" loss). But on an extended program the aforementioned ratio holds pretty well. The 3500 calorie/pound of body fat may not hold true because of this relative loss, but it can represent a yardstick for total body weight loss. Given this, a caloric deficit of 1750 kcals in a day would result in a fat loss of roughly .75 pounds. However, certain mechanisms are in place that can certainly modify this.","1346458101"

However, if the US continues to borrow at the same rate, we will have the same level of debt of Southern European nations within a few years. These nations have required massive assistance from the European Central Bank and the IMF and have defaulted on large portions of their debt.

"Debate","t5_2qja8","Here's the problem: Presidential debates used to be more meaningful and were run independently by the League of Women Voters.  The questions were more in-depth and there was more emphasis on clash and discussion.  Then, in 1980, the parties escaped their grasp and deliberately chose a less difficult format for the debates.  Neither party has any interest in escaping from this pattern, and both are aware of complaints by the relatively elite for debate reform.  The problem is, until Joe Schmoe changes his opinion on the debates, it ain't gonna happen.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Personally I'm just about to cancel both the charges on my credit card. One of the charges was legit and an actual purchase of the game. The second charge was a double charge that wasn't supposed to be on my account. I've had 2 tickets open for 4 days now. The double charge ticket hasn't been answered at all, not even a automated reply. Second ticket is due to my account being hacked. I submitted a ticket on the 28th that was answered with an automated reply that was pretty much a copy and paste of their FAQ which didn't help me in the slightest. I decided to send in another ticket on the 29th once Arena Net had realized many more people were getting hacked. That new ticket got a reply in less than an hour asking for info (Serial/Order #, Ending 4 digits of CC#) I had already provided in my ticket so I know they didn't read it. After the email I had sent to them they asked me what I wanted my account name to be, told them and provided the serial number again. It has been 24+ hours since the last email I have received.

If this goes on for another 24 hours (1:37 PM my time in Texas) I will email them again, telling them that I am going to charge back both of the charges unless I get at least one issue resolved. I've seen threads on here about people getting refunds recently so I take it they'll comply.

Really though. Be polite, especially in others' rooms/apartments/houses/whatever. Older students love calling out freshmen for anything they can. 

Don't be afraid to ask for directions, but try really really hard not to. I love the Google maps app on the iPhone. If you zoom in enough, it should have the buildings labeled. Do a run through of your classes sometime this weekend. Plan out how long it takes you to walk there and how much time in between classes you have to do whatever. 

If you really want to try to get into bars, fake ID or not, wait a month or so. Bouncers are expecting you to try to get in now that you feel like one of the big college kids. 

Try some of the delicious eats on State St. Food carts are great, Med Cafe, etc. Stay in shape, though, your health and well-being is still important. The SERF and SHELL are included in your tuition, use it! Speaking of, there are plenty of clubs and intramural sports to join (I don't know much about this, though.)

Don't be afraid to take a class because it sounds cool. Now that I'm a senior, I have less room in my schedule to take Czech like I wanted to. Don't go overboard though, explore your interests but try to stay on track.

Be in contact with your advisor. I made the mistake of thinking I didn't need them, and now I have to tack on an extra semester before I graduate -___-

If you are in a rather large class and have a question, maybe wait until class is over or go to office hours to ask it. Yeah, professors encourage questions or whatever, but 99% of the time you just look like an asshole trying to show off your AP bio or whatever. Use your best judgement here I suppose. 

One last thing! DON'T SIGN A LEASE RIGHT AWAY! 9 times out of 10 you won't really like those people a year from now, or you find you have different lifestyles. I signed in June for August move-in, but that was a little late. Rentals will put the pressure on you with emails and stuff, but come end of spring semester the emails will be to the tune of, ""STILL AVAILABLE!""

Once I had an ingrown hair right below my bikini line, in the center. I left it alone for a day or two. It got a little bigger, so I tried to extract the hair with some tweezers (like I'd done a million times), but it made it worse. The hair was deeper than I thought. Finally I showed my mom, who immediately flipped and took me to the hospital. That tiny little bump had turned into an abscess because I tried to pick it. They had to cut it open and squeeze it out (which was comparable to the pain of labor let me tell you, even though I was on pain meds... I was crying and begging them to stop). Then they had to surgically remove the surrounding meat tissue stuff under the skin so the infection didn't spread. I couldn't sit properly for two weeks, and I still have a scar about the size of a quarter there. My pubic hair will never grow back in that spot and it looks mad retarded if I let the hair grow out. Will post a pic of my scar if it convinces you to never do what I did

meanwhile, pure  laissez-faire capitalism has no such thing, and when governments try to regulate the free market to make it more accountable, fair and just libertarians cry foul and claim the system won't work properly.

the American Founding Fathers never said ""well, we need democracy, so we best not give anyone freedom of the press or freedom of speech cause that'll interfere with the democratic process."" but libertarians would have us believe that a system that rewards earning money by any means necessary with no checks and balances is exactly the way to go.","1346458129"

That is a convenient excuse to get rid of all of them, because even one in the eyes of the feds is illegal. The city's obligation is to enforce state law here, not federal law. This is why local law enforcement cannot raid a pot shop because it violates federal law. Its more immediately dangerous to a politician to suggest that they could, because that ACTUALLY violates enforceable law. 

You also seem really intent on the city ""working with dispensaries"" (and dispensaries working with cities) to create regulations. But you also seem to have no problem with outright ban on all existing dispensaries. These are two polarized positions on the enforcement scale. If the industry wont discuss it, it seems to me the city should just move forward with reasonable regulations anyway (not bans, but regulations). Thats at least easier to swallow than outright bans. Lets see them go for audits, review where their profits go, set a cap yearly cap on new dispensaries, maybe even limit their number within say, a mile radius. I dont like the idea of an artificial cap that is forever set at 100. That ignores demand and is too favorable to existing dispensaries (who get in that 100). ","1346458138"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","A few tips. Have the sound from the game fixed before you start and maybe turn it up a bit more (it sounded like you may have been having audio problems though so that would make sense why it was quiet). Also you have a constant ""hiss"" in the background so it makes the time in between when you are talking kinda awkward. You can fix that hiss using a audio editing program called audacity which is free. Also, if you can, relocate your mic so you can hear the clacking of the controller less. Last of all blind lets plays are kinda boring to be honest. Find a way to keep the viewer interested such as fast forwarding if you die on one level more than 5 times, be more energetic, etc.

"breakingbad","t5_2rlw4","**Spoilers All**

Definitely. As someone mentioned in another thread, Walt always seemed a bit power-mad; he didn't let it show as much, but the fierce independence when he got Cancer, only telling Skylar when necessary, acting superior to Jesse because he felt he sucked at the science aspect. It's as though he's just more comfortable showing his ego now. He kicked the shit out of a teenager, strangled a drug 'lord', blew up a meeting because they refused to sell his meth, tried to kill Tuco.

Jesse on the other hand changed completely. He was banging the neighbours, throwing drug fueled parties, mixing whatever he could together to make shitty meth. And now, he's a professional, thinks about the big picture, long-term goals, seems to be more attentive than Walt (mentions how he refused to cook in the presence of a single fly, batch can't be contaminated, gets pissy in Mexico, mentions Walt's numbers for profit). He's learnt a lot and changed his entire character. 

I guess the death of Jane helped Jesse's transformation significantly. If Walt experienced something like this (say, if Hank had died), then I imagine he would undergo a rapid character shift. It seemed like he was nearing that when he realised he shot a man for refusing to work with him, and for just pissing him off.","1346458143"

I think it's indicative of a society that still values the ""women-as-mothers"" ideal and the nuclear family over any other type of family. For a very long time, Dads like the OP simply didn't exist. As more men like him emerge, products of a more egalitarian society, I think their combined voice and clear passion are bound to change things for the better.

The form  is more than likely from a point in time when the majority of parents coming in *were* the moms; it's not a conscious effort to ""other"" any fathers coming in with their kids.  

I think it's noteworthy to realize that men in North America often get to check off the first boxes on most forms. M? Yup. When ""M"" isn't there, it's kind-of a ""what the heck"" moment, and that's a scary feeling - but important to experience, as it inspires people do to something.

Flood all of your delivery systems with the same message. Push opening day interest and encourage everybody to have a go at the latest new thing. Those who love it won't need encouragement to continue. Get their details on the day to remind them personally for follow up events which are not publicised elsewhere. Those who want something else can just go the once and then try something else the next week. 

Give people too much choice and they will become paralysed and do nothing. Give them a clear direction and you've have more people turning up for events and finding things they want to do regularly. ","1346458153"

Only time I've been in a bar there we apparently missed the one armed guy who was throwing chairs by one night. I was pissed that we didn't get to see that.

Anyways, the drink is a shot of half Bailey's Irish Cream and half Tequila. If you make sure not to curdle the Bailey's it is quite good. You get the taste of the tequila, but the Bailey's covers the burning sensation and it finishes with a slight aftertaste of irish cream. Originally intended to be the worst combination the guys could think of, it ended up being a decent drink.","1346458165"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","This is coming from me SOLELY and ONLY for future financial situation; and nothing to do with the obvious Wife betrayal aspect, and lack of remorse, etc.

IANAL but once lived with one. Law is a funny thing, but the stone cold reality is that NO business wants that type of PR, that type of public exposure.

Just because you wife resigned, or signed some papers , one can make a case for ""under duress"" and thus, not binding.

Regardless of what she signed, that does not mean YOU cannot sue.

Follow me, didn't you say that wife was the major incoming provider? Please note, I do not get the vibe that you are some money sucking asshole wanting every penny he can get from wife during the divorce. 

However, reality is, divorced is coming, and they are ugly at the best of times, your house if you own one, joint assets, etc / divide all of that by two, and subtract a good hunk for lawyer fees.

You now have a child to raise (will you try for single or shared custody) ?

Most US states ; a spouse having an affair does not give you extra ammo during the financial split. In some states you are not even allowed to state wife had an affair during the custody hearing. Bottom line is Divorce Law is cluster-fucked and can vary from one county to the next county; can vary from Judge A to Judge B in the same courthouse. It's rigged for lawyers to make it last as long as they want it to. Any divorce lawyer will confirm the same thing.

QUESTION: IMPORTANT: is company Public (even if owned by another larger company who has a stock market ticker) or Private company?

You say Corp was aware Boss had an affair in the office before, even using company monies before. So wife being fired because of this seems very odd quite frankly. I'm sure details exist that you do not wish to share for privacy reasons; but do consider chatting with an employment lawyer. Many corps would be happy to throw some money at you simply to not have to deal with the exposure of a lawsuit.","1346458171"

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","Hi Green-Light! 

&gt;For those of you who do not know, there is a group called NoLibs (or The No Libs Crew) who hate on all of the following: a) people who are anti-war, b) people who are into conspiracies and conspiracy theories, c) people who like Gary Johnson/Ron Paul/other third party candidates and d) people who support the Liberty movement &amp; Libertarians (hence the name ""NoLibs"")

Lies, more lies and complete fabrications. The term ""NolibsCrew"" was created by you (green-light), your Holocaust denying buddy Dusty and others in your stalker subreddit. Also, Ron Paul ran as a Republican, was elected to his congressional seat as a Republican and has stated time and time again he's a Republican. He's not a 3rd party candidate. 

&gt;They speerhead the page called EPS, or ""EnoughPaulSpam"", a page dedicated to insulting and making fun of Ron Paul and Ron Paul supporters, and bashing on people who support him

More lies. EPS exists to stop the steady flow of Paul-Spam that you and your friends insisted in trying to spread all around Reddit (such as the attacks in Baseball, trees and other non-political subreddits) by using things like facts, evidence and factual data.

&gt;Most of the EPS users have tons of sockpuppet accounts (fake accounts to log in and upvote all their own posts and each others, causing a shift in karma towards their favor) as you will notice in a short time from posting they will have a multitude of upvotes and anyone opposing them will have downvotes. Look at the pattern, you can clearly see this for yourself. I will most likely get a good amount of downvotes, and there will be a group of people opposing me who will quickly gain upvotes. Don't think this is fair play and genuine people voting, this is rigged my friend.

The sheer audacity of this statement is is amazing. Look at your ""leadership"" there in NLW if you want examples of sock puppet accounts. More lies from a verified NLW member. 

&gt;Politics aside, no matter what party you support or don't support, spreading hatred constantly and incessantly to a harassing degree is unacceptable and has no place in a modern civilized society. One of their top priorities to somehow make the world a better place (in their minds) is to be constantly making fun of conspiracy theorists, anti-war people, and Ron Paul supporters on their hateful page [4] /r/EnoughPaulSpam. They also run [5] /r/Conspiratard, [6] /r/rachelcorrie (which is aimed to mock this woman who was killed), [7] /r/Dumbasses and [8] /r/ProWar just to name a few...).

More generalizations and lies. Greenlight, you're getting desperate and it shows. Yet another recruiting post from you lot, huh? Got tired of getting laughed our of SRD and /politics with your nonsense. Seriously man, you'll take any opportunity to play the victim here, won't you? NLW is a down vote brigade and stalker group that accuses people of being terrorists, pedophiles, alcoholics and Child Molesters. Amazing, just amazing.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;Voters do not decide how the voting structure works, or change the constitution to decide voting structure, so then elections in America don't count as democratic? 

Many people argue that America isn't a democracy, but a Republic. Either way, [reddit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) wasn't designed like America. It has been argued [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/sllnz/reddit_is_not_a_citystate/) over what reddit ""really is,"" and I think I'll tow the line that it is ridiculous to apply the label of ""democracy"" or ""democratic system"" to a private aggregate content website not designed to be a democracy. If we're comparing reddit to America, why is it by default the post-revolution America in the first place?

&gt;I am arguing that if your goal or your good is maximum happiness for the maximum number reddit achieves that pretty well. Now, if your goal is the better humanity then you may have a problem. 

I'm arguing that maximum happiness is not achieved. As evidence: all the damn bitching. If reddit was a democratic institution (defined as a democracy because it was collectively developed as a democracy in the first place) I believe this would be addressed.

&gt;Now, voters could change those things in enough numbers, you know amendments and the like. But that is so rare and requires such large numbers that its equivalent to universal demand for a feature here, which i think Reddit would provide. 

America has a method of making such demands for amendments. Reddit does not have any forum to demand features. I see no r/redditConstitutionalAssemble.","1346458178"

The pressure sensitivity in the Note is overrated IMO though.  They claim 256 levels of pressure in the first Note, and it kind of feels like 3 levels.  Transition between pressure levels is not very smooth.  But they claim to have improved it.

The relationships you make in your head are so complex involving the very large and very small, sometimes in repeating patterns, it all meshes together.

That child uses the condensed knowledge to then make a new kind of cheese to allow for tastier burgers. The burgers are then eaten by a man who reflects on the unique taste, had he not had the taste to reflect on he would have been thinking of something else entirely, and has an apifiny in his field of research... and on and on.

It is also possible for dialects to ""split off"" from their mother language and become their own languages, but that process usually takes hundreds and hundreds of years. For instance you could imagine the Texan dialect of American English eventually evolving to a point where it and General American English are no longer mutually intelligible, which is when it --- in linguistic terminology --- becomes a language of its own. Now, it doesn't *have* to happen. It's just a possibility.

To be fair, too many languages, not just Chinese, are taught this way. It wasn't just the poetry and prose but that weird stunted conversation. For a kid being raised to speak English, it's extremely weird when a language you speak is written completely differently (there's a linguistic term for this which escapes me right now). I didn't understand why we couldn't just write down the words we spoke instead of adding in a bunch of words we never use. Then being Cantonese or any non-mandarin speaker, there are even words without characters! I don't think our parents took any of this into consideration because they came from a completely different place. If they had to learn English the same way, they'd have probably gone nuts too.

Yes, I'm quite aware that you don't like my attitude. I find it revealing that that's just about the only thing you're really willing to discuss. What I'd like you to read closely is the content of my claims.

&gt; That's probably why you haven't gotten a simple supportive response to one of your comments, 

I've gotten mixed responses, positive and negative. The reason I haven't gotten many responses at all to my comments under this link is because I JUST posted them, within the last hour or so. Most of the people I replied to posted their comments many hours ago. This is a small subreddit. Responses from those who want to bother will probably trickle in slowly because of that.

&gt; despite cross-posting this post to three other subreddits.

At present, all of my submissions of this link have more positive than negative votes.

&gt;Also, downvoting critical comments as soon as you see them is petty and obvious.

How long do you wait to vote on a comment after reading it? Do you bookmark it and come back later to vote on it, or something?

Downvoting comments which don't criticize *constructively* is what the voting system is *for.* If I find a comment is not constructively critical (doesn't contribute to the conversation), I sometimes downvote it, and so do others. Please note that your responses to me have more than one negative vote.

You say there are ""plenty of things"" you don't agree with - does that include the list of things I mentioned? In that case, in spite of that whole list, you still support Obama on some vague statements he made about supporting gay rights?

That sounds exactly to me like a wealthy person saying, ""Well, I'm voting for Romney because it will be beneficial to me financially."" That's an absurd statement to me, but it's equally absurd to vote for somebody based on the fact that they support ""your lifestyle"" in spite of knowing that they are ruining (and taking) the lives of those who can't speak up for themselves.

 One of my co-workers has a 12yr old son who has been battling leukemia since he was two. Most recently he developed a brain tumor from all the chemo. Of course my co-worker is passionate about this cause.  Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society supports R&amp;D of course but also helps families with costs like co-pays, deductibles, travel expense. The things that you and I just wouldn't think about. Things that insurance do not cover.  Our insurance sucks anyway.  Point is, after hearing him tell me about this, and I have worked with him for three years.  I knew he was off a lot but he has never mentioned to me at all, ever.  Anyway, this Light the Night walk came up and he told me about it and his story and I just can't help but do what I can to help these kids. I'm not trying to pull at your heart or jerk tears.

She told me her family didn't really follow why she would get a black princess when there were white ones to choose from. They didn't see it as bad, but just odd, or a curiosity.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I went in 2007 in Huntsville Alabama, on a 5 day field trip. No proof available, sorry. And I thought it was going to be amazing, It was not everything I expected. our group leader was a crotchety woman in her mid to late 40s. I remember when we all got to ride the big gyro, (I can't remember what it is called) and one person had to sit out because our leader heard them say a person in a different group was gay. I agree that is not ok, but this person had actually said they were gay. They have a ride called the space rocket I believe (picture a small version of the doctor doom ride at universal) and we couldn't ride it because it was I cold. We made model rockets that we couldn't launch because it was raining, ordinarily that wouldn't be such a big deal but we would have launched them at the actual launchpad. We didn't get to see the launchpad because that was our only chance :""( the bunk beds were shaky and the mattresses were very springy. Wost of all the top bunk actually collapsed onto the bottom bunk thankfully no one was on the bottom when that happened so no one was hurt. But food was really good, and it was all you can eat. We learned a lot of stuff, we had to take notes, and we saw amazing things as well. The highlight of my trip was when we did a shuttle flight simulation. I was the mission director. We did good but one student forgot to close the loading bay doors, so our shuttle would have burned up upon entry. It really was a great trip looking back, but after watched  the movie space camp before I went. And I can honestly say that I was very disappointed that I didn't get to go into space.","1346458225"

Look how much aerobic work Hichem El Guerrouj, the world record holder at the 1500m (less than a mile) at 3:23.00 does. His program is 70% based on aerobic work varied into general aerobic, race pace, tempo, etc. Of course, like any good runner there is a good amount of strength, power, and plyometric work too.

Based on the studies I've read, of which I am writing an article on, the 1500m is at least 80-84% aerobic work if not a bit more while the anaerobic component is &lt;20%... which means 1.5 miles is going to be at least 90% aerobic work.","1346458229"

There's really a lot of content in this game, a lot of different things you can do (even if the things themselves are kinda repetitive - one-click crafting was never that interesting to me for example) and there's no push for you to do a certain thing over another. The level scaling works pretty well too, so you don't have that kind of regret you get in other games when you outlevel the content you were looking forward to experiencing.","1346458232"

"circlebroke","t5_2tnz9","&gt;The problem arises when the various communities beat each of these things into the ground, and turn adulation into worship, and make disagreement a sin punishable by mass downvoting, used so often on Reddit as a form of censorship-by-committee (and don't get too hoity-toity, Circlebroke, you're as guilty of it as anyone). Content related to these topics lacks depth because depth is not rewarded inside of these communities. A lengthy religious debate in [14] /r/atheism will lose out to text-over-an-image every time. An analysis of the pros and cons of a conservative political viewpoint will never beat out a lazy insult.

This is exactly why. Reddit is a place to share ideas, not agree in unison and shun all other ideas out. However, there are subreddits, such as /r/girlsinyogapants and /r/CreepShots, that need to be either heavily moderated or banned in my opinion.

It took them 5 years to make Skyrim, and a year in a half was spent *just porting it over to PS3* so they could have the same release date, and the Bethesda Devs even admitted if they had it their way, they wouldn't have even made Skyrim for PS3 just because of this reason. Other games have the same problem, but their games don't have nearly as much content or options as skyrim does, nor are they nearly as big.

And how is it unacceptable? PlayStation constantly has content and entire games that are exclusive to ***only*** PlayStation, just as Xbox has content and games exclusive to ***only*** xbox, same with PC, and Mac. It's up to the game developers what console it's released for.","1346458239"

I only took it seriously because I was feeling creative and it was fun for me. I really enjoyed making something like that. I thought that it would be seen as a viewpoint, not necessarily a correct one or the one that the subreddit was dedicated to. Now that I know that it was just an attempt to make religion look bad, I wouldn't have made that. Or maybe I would have anyway, because it would at least serve as propaganda to make the religion look more legitimate. 

When I got only negative comments, it really bummed me out. I thought someone would at least laugh at it. Or even say what was so terrible about it, constructively. You had the balls to criticize constructively, and thanks for that.","1346458245"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","You, all on your own, came to the conclusion that I didn't read your post. You were wrong. I simply chose to not respond directly to your thoughts. Instead I chose to advance from a different direction.

You gave many valid reasons as to why weed should be legal. However, they are all redundant. Why? Because the ability to do what I want with my body so long as I don't harm others is a basic right of life.

&gt;There is literally no downside.

I do not think that word means what you think it means. The legalization of hemp and cannabis would create many jobs yes, it would boost the economy yes, but to what cost? It would put a huge dent in the cotton, timber, and pharmaceutical companies?

Why use cotton which is expensive when you can use hemp which is cheap? Why cut down ancient forests when you can plant and grow a crop 4 times a year that yields much more than the equivalent size forest? Why take drugs that cause side-effects which need to be cured with more drugs when you can simply grow your own medicine?

Legalization would fuck over those industries resulting in a big deficit that the profits from the hemp and cannabis industry might not be able to fill. Becuase it is uncertain whether or not it would be a net loss, net gain, or no variation at all, you can bet that nobody is going to take the gamble and legalize it on a national scale. At least not for quite some time.

&gt;Hopefully you'll read this comment and then Read what I wrote and realize you're an irrelevant fucktard.

Hopefully you will realize that I am speaking on a level far above weed alone, I'm speaking on a level that encompasses the entire human race. What I am saying is more relevant than ever.

&gt;What I'm saying is fucked up is some people are paying tax out the ass which could lessened if marijuana were legalized and taxed.

Instead of focusing on weed like usual, why not focus on the ENORMOUS tax cuts the filthy rich get and huge companies get. Did you know Exxon Mobil, one of the largest oil companies in the world, paid less taxes than the average person. A multi-billion dollar company getting taxed as much as a middle-class individual. **thats fucked up**

Where are you seeing these. I rarely see anything at all close to something like this in a title on the front page, which by your post you seem to peruse more frequently than other areas here.

&gt;One example I would love to see more of on here would deal with science and evolution.

There's plenty of these actually. You can get some good discussions sometimes in the new tab and self posts. I suggest checking them out.

&gt;Sincerely, A former browser of r/atheism 

Goodbye. However, if you don't like the content here, don't complain about it without actually submitting anything yourself. Besides this post, you don't seem to have contributed much of anything to the subreddit. Post what you want to see. IF you want discussion about science and evolution then actually start some. You are the only one who knows what you want. The majority of complaining posters here never want to actually do something themselves about it. I challenge you to at least consider being better than that.

&gt;Go ahead and downvote this

I have a general rule that I downvote anything where they expect or ask for it.

&gt;because it shows the truth of what this subreddit has turned into.

Again, I downvoted because you ask for it. This subreddit in general has a low tolerance for these complaining posts because of some of the reasons I stated above and because they are quite frequent and usually not very pleasant to read.","1346458246"

In terms of things that move heat, that's not very efficient. As an example, a heat pump may put in 1W of heat to move 3W of heat into (or out of) your living space... To say 300% efficient would be silly - instead, the term is called coefficient of performance (COP).

I'm in Edmonton, and fan of the Oilers.  There's Oiler fans that have jumped off the bandwagon (pussies), and there's the die-hard fans who have made lemons into lemonade.  

Was firing LaPolice justified?  I don't really think its always the coach that needs to be the one to eat it all the time.  Look what happened to the Riders last year.  Will there be a turn around in the Bombers after this?  Maybe, sure, I dunno.  I think [Wally Buono's comments](http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=403972) were bang the fuck on.

As for the amateur gamers, they should do like what TrueNorth did: stream their games, get an audience and, overall, talk about it. The more you talk about it, the more it will be heard of, you know? And also we should show the sponsors that Starcraft 2 competitions make money, by watching their ad-filled tournaments and, for the richer, pay for HD or Premium subscriptions to GomTV, MLG, NASL, etc. If people know money can be made (as with other sports) it will get more publicized and more popular.","1346458287"

If I've somehow misunderstood, my advice would be the same as 92235's: go to community college for all of your lower division courses.  Meet with counselors to make sure you're taking the right courses for the degree you want.  You will eventually transfer to a four-year college, and your degree will be identical to everyone that overpaid for their lower division work.  When you're 24 (double-check this age; it might have changed) your parents income will no longer matter when it comes to scholarships/grants/loans.  Put off going to a four-year university until then, and do your lower division stuff in the meantime.

&gt;So, allowing for argument that a fetus is deserving of rights, from the pro life perspective, it shouldn't matter how uncomfortable a pregnancy is, just in the same way that it shouldn't matter how uncomfortable a child or an animal or even an adult makes you, you shouldn't be allowed to kill them (under our legal system, anyway).

I think it speaks volumes that you refer to pregnancy and birth as ""uncomfortable"", like it's an itchy sweater or pinchy shoes.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;This is a matter of speculation on content, which I do not like to entertain because I do not see it as productive: For it is like speaking of Aquinas' natural theology, with his Aristotelian metaphysics of the four-causes, combined with concerns of modern quantum mechanics, using virtual particles as an objection to his idea that ""Potencies, being not-actual, cannot do anything"". It is nice to pass the time, but it is not compelling in either direction. (I say this as somebody who has wrestled with Aquinas/Thomism for years, coming to reject natural theology altogether in favor of a new conception of God that is not metaphysical)

Right, speculation on content is just that, speculation.

&gt;Use-based property is indeterminate, because it is not a priori a matter of absolute ownership or exclusivity. This gives rise to an ""openness"", whereby it is still to be determined what kind of ""property"" arrangement takes hold. I am looking to reject the language of ownership altogether, as it becomes very, very ideological when it is assumed a priori as it is by way of deontological ethics. I am doing this, precisely, so that we can hold a conversation together on the same playing field - that of use. Anarcho-capitalists who assume a priori ownership, rejecting the notion of use-based ownership, approach mutualists and anti-capitalists in general with two concrete disagreements (i.e. they disagree even on the nature of their disagreements). In recognizing 
Use-based property may vary depending upon what one qualifies as constituting ""use"". There are many ways of doing this, but all of which are socially determined. You favor use-based ownership, albeit with extremely high standards for what qualifies as use (I would say these are unreasonable standards).
In any event, it is from there that mutualists would employ ""ethics of reciprocity"", like a kind of Golden Rule, in order to determine further what qualifies as ""use"". This turns out, for mutualists, to be a way in which ""right of increase"" -- in all of its many forms, wage labour, rent, absentee ownership, etc. -- is not permitted.

What are ""ethics of reciprocity"" and why are they employed?

Why is ""right of increase"" considered wrong?

&gt;It is not that easy to say for many reasons, the first being I don't think those two are mutually exclusive precisely because we're talking about a change in perspective altogether. Proudhon (who was a Christian) has some very critical works on religion that may interest you. It is perhaps a matter of ""seeing things n a new way"", ""becoming a-new"", or ""transformation"", such that the metaphysical conception of God as an entity dies, and a new conception of God altogether takes hold (instead of an entity, cause, or power, consider God as, say, an event, call, or promise).

That does seem interesting.

&gt;Why? I am not asking, here, about content. What do you like about its form?

The form of capitalism? I suppose I enjoy the nature of it, that if one works hard enough, one can reasonably pursue their peaceful goals without hindrance, and if one takes on risk, there is a chance that the individual can achieve unreasonable goals, but also a chance that the individual can achieve less than their goals.

With regards to my personal aspirations, I don't really favor capitalism any more than mutualism; I argue for capitalism not because I intend on practicing absentee ownership, but instead because I believe that the goal of absentee ownership and the practice itself are legitimate.","1346458297"

Ok, so a couple months ago item stacking was added (basically meaning that when 2 identical items are next to each other, they'll auto stack).

When you throw an item into the system, it will trigger a tripwire. This trip wire will do 2 things:

- Trigger a dispenser
- Power an array of repeaters

The dispenser shoots out a copy of Map #0, which will collide with a wall and come to a halt. 

If you threw in Map #0, then your Map #0 will meet the dispenser's Map #0 and they will connect. Your Map #0 will lose all momentum, and will not reach the second tripwire.

Now if it's anything but Map #0, then it will pass through the dispensed item and go to the next step.

Basically, what happens next is a race of sorts. The 2nd trip wire will trigger a new signal, which will always beat the first redstone signal. 
It will then momentarily retract a block with a piston and just as the first signal is nearing completion, it will break the connection and not allow it to pass to the door.

In other words, if you throw in Map #0 the first signal will not have to compete with the 2nd signal, and the block won't retract, so the signal can carry on to whatever it would be powering.

The reason this is useful is because Map #0 is completely unique. It can stack with cloned Map #0s but no other item will stack. Furthermore, it can't be re-created unless you have an original copy, thus people can't forge your 'key'. ","1346458300"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","well that's fine.  I understand your point if this is it.  I know kids are nasty and all, but I don't think that that should stop him from dressing like he wants.  maybe at 5 he is not equipped to make these decisions, but I think it's not that big of a deal.  if he grows out of it, he grows out of it.  I don't necessarily think the father should force him to dress a certain way.  I had a friend who went to school every day until like 3rd grade dressed like Indiana Jones.  no one beat him up.  I think if he goes into kindergarten like this and his friends grow up around him like this, it probably won't be as big of a deal as if he just started wearing dresses in high school.  

I think the dad is doing a good thing by letting his child be who he is, and do what he wants.  if the kid gets beat up (which I don't know many people who made it through 12 years of school without a couple of scrapes) then he gets beat up, and the dad can have a discussion with him why.  If the kid decides he wants to keep dressing a certain way then that is up to him.

Slightly tangential, but it's nice, so I'll share: I also know a single mom whose ex-husband has to pay for their daycare; there was a week in which the kids would have missed two days of daycare, but the daycare was going to have them pay for the whole week regardless. Of course some (many?) people would just say, hey, it's not my money, who cares! But instead she hired a babysitter (me, actually!) and had him pay me what 3 days' worth of daycare would be.

You don't help your case by saying Jesus is being feminized - I'm not sure what you mean, but you've written it very negatively, as if femininity = the bad qualities, or weakness (""being pushed around""), while masculine qualities are the better, stronger ones to have.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Good to see someone speaking from wisdom.

To give some background, her and I have been friends for a little over a year. For several of those months we worked at the same place so we have gotten several chances to chit-chat with each other, although they still have been unfortunately few since our daily lives  have generally made meeting IRL a bit difficult. She's not an Internet-only friend. It's easily possible for us to meet up in real life when I'm home from college during class breaks, weekends, etc. 

Note that this isn't me asking her out. This is me lettin' her know how I feel. If she feels the same, then yay! We can see if we'd make a good pair and if so, get into a relationship. If not then, I'll lick my wounds and get over it. 

&gt; Finally, the message you are even sending is just needy. Again, it reeks of you being in love not with the girl, but the idea of some fantastical version of this girl.

That's something I've frequently wondered. Am I attracted to her, or just this fantasy image of her? That would require getting more opportunities to hang out with her in person. Infatuation is built upon mystery and fantasy. Does the idea of her I have match the real her?

&gt; why you’re doing any of this at all.

To get it off my chest, to get on with life. Yeah, I'm pessimistic about it. Been rejected enough times that I don't have incentive to be optimistic. I suppose that's one flaw in me.","1346458319"
"tf2","t5_2qka0","I second the heat theory for the FPS issues. Are you getting any graphical glitches (weird colors or blank planes)? Make sure nothing is blocking the fan and that your room is cool.

One trick that helped me for a bit was getting a large class of cold water (even ice cubes would probably work) and putting it next to the fan output/the hottest part of your computer. Water has a high specific heat and will absorb rather large amounts of heat blah blah blah chemistry.

You should also make sure your graphics card is up to date (I had numerous different drivers suggested by different tools) and even try a beta driver. I probably tried 3 or 4 different drivers until I found one that got rid of my psychedelic grass when I overheated.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I always found it weird how men (and women) explain their desire for the woman changing her name by saying they want a unified family name. It's fine if someone wants that, but why can't the man then change his name? It just seems like it's always automatically on the woman to change, in order to unify the family.

Then there's the ""semi compromise"" of saying ""hey girl, you don't need to! You can just make your last name your middle name instead and take his last name!"" Well.. that's.. still the same. I don't see the appeal in that.

As for myself, I won't change my name. I like my name as it's relatively unique, from my mother's side (got it changed back to it some time after my parents divorced) and well, I see no need to change my name. For me it's a deal breaker if a person required me to change my name to be their spouse. I don't support the idea of ""the man has to let his name live on (but the woman doesn't?)"" at all so that one especially doesn't move me when mentioned.

I -especially- have no interest in men who want their wifes to take their name, but refuse to offer to do it themselves.

I'm not interested in hyphenating as I find it ugly. I like the idea of making up a whole new name together, but I doubt I'd do that as I already like the one I have.

Another pet peeve is the, yet again, ""semi compromise"" of ""oh sure you don't need to take his name! ...But, of course, the children will have his name right?"".

I haven't decided if I want children, but if I do we either hyphenate theirs or if there are more than one child, give one child his name and one child mine.","1346458329"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","""A state of arrested development"" shouldn't extend so far as to a grown man in his mid-30's. The deal with Mephisto was a thinly-veiled means to the end of upholding the status quo, and/or sating Quesada's bizarre ideals about marriage/family.

""He will always be the teenage boy"" because [status quo is god](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod), not because that's how a good character is written. Give Spider-man a better staff behind his stories, and he suddenly becomes a better character.

You bring up the ""death of loved ones"" thing like Uncle Ben and Aunt May are the only ones that count in his overall development. Gwen died too, and he strives his whole life to fill the gap she left. Mary Jane ostensibly did that. The only reason to end their marriage was to set Peter back to square one in the laziest, most inefficient way humanly possible: a *literally* magical retcon.

A change to his character forever would have been acceptable. This is how people grow and develop in *real life*. It should at least be mirrored in a meaningful way in fiction. This is actually a hugely magnified version of a problem I've always had with comics- [death is cheap](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap). It means nothing because, aside from a few choice characters, death will always be undone to uphold status quo.

If Peter used demon magic to bring back Uncle Ben or Gwen Stacey when they died, I doubt he'd be a better character for it.

&gt;Quesada sees Peter's making a ""deal with the Devil"" as a villain (Mephisto) taking advantage of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate ""they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling that they had to raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. 'Cause that isn't as bad."" Quesada went on to say, ""Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story. But then, I'm an idiot.""

You're right, it's just an opinion. But I agree with Quesada. He's a fucking idiot that doesn't know the first thing about love or what that really means. He turned Peter Parker into a character that cares more about alleviating guilt than overcoming one of his greatest personal flaws- his ever-looming guilt complex. Not only that, but he boils down the problem of super-hero/civilian divorce to *fucking magic*. Magic. Poof, it's over with; you don't have to deal with each other and neither do any writers/editors. All your love problems are gone so future creative minds have a smoother road to travel. Whether they wanted to write for this version of the story or not.

Fuck that.

EDIT: The assassination of Aunt May brought out a darker Spider-man, but it's not the first time we've seen him like this, nor will it be the last. People will always have dark moments in their life, and bringing back a dying old woman who was presumably ready to meet with her long-dead husband in the afterlife will change that. Peter will done the black again, and go on another rampage for some other reason. It will always happen eventually, just as likely as Jean Grey dying and returning will.","1346458336"

Is it remotely possible that a SINGLE person has gotten pulled over FIVE different times and had the option to give or not give consent to a search and that person did not give consent and five DIFFERENT police officers all decided that they didn't care if they got their ass chewed out by their boss or by a judge or by a prosecutor and that their credibility is forever damaged in the courthouse, and said ""fuck it, I'm searching anyway for a minor possession charge."" ?

Does that sound remotely possible?

Once? Sure. Young cop, forgets himself. Never trusted again by the court. Okay. It happens. Weird situation? Sure. Once.

FIVE TIMES. FIVE TIMES refused. FIVE TIMES ignored and searched.

Not fucking possible. Probably not even in Cuba.

EDIT: 

Now add this. Some kid reading this subreddit sees this post and says... ""I knew it.... There's no point."" He gets pulled over, or stopped next year and instead of being strong, the cop breaks his will because he doesn't think it really matters anyway.

Because of ScoopsDick, some 21 year old college kid just picked up a drug charge. Or someone else lost their job.

If he's got a horror story, by all means tell it. I've got plenty on behalf of clients that I could tell. Cops are dicks.

Furthermore, in the event of a failed relationship, the woman's reasons for leaving have to be taken into account.  Was she cheating on him?  Did she leave him because he fell on financial hardship?

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;I think by 10th grade, most kids have developed the majority of their social skills.

I don't think I agree with this.  I was more introverted through high school, but that changed drastically in college.  I'm more outgoing now and I attribute that to college and the people I met there.  I still consider myself as being kind of awkward and insecure, but I think outwardly I don't think I'm that awkward socially.  But this is just my experience, so who knows.

I also skipped a year, so I've been a year younger than most of my friends.  For the most part, I don't think anyone noticed.  In fact, it came as a surprise when they found out I was younger than them.  The only times it really came up (and this was more of a bother than anything else) was when everyone was turning 18 (and I wasn't) and again when everyone turned 21 (and I wasn't close).  I'm sure my life would be vastly different if I hadn't skipped a year, but at the same time, I'm happy with how things have worked out so far and I can't imagine not having the friends I have now.  Personally, I don't think 1 year either way makes any difference in the grand scheme of things.  But I know I wouldn't subject my kid to skipping say 2 or 3 years.

I'm not sure if there is a point to all this, but I think we can't really speak in generalizations here.  Every kid is unique and as a parent, it is your job to figure out what works best for your kid.","1346458349"

It is the parents' responsibility to provide this education.  There are many home school organizations that provide the social, athletic and interpersonal relationships that many posters say are lacking in home schooling.

If the parents want to give up this responsibility and cede it to the government, that is their choice.  School systems were originally created, in the US, by groups of parents who hired school teachers for a co-op school.  The government was never involved.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","why is everyone trying to diagnose something wrong with this guy?  He's going through a DIVORCE, and he's seeing a psychiatrist, who has to be a MEDICAL DOCTOR first to actually become a psychaitrist. He's be the first person to notice a serious problem like this, and he would be actively trying to help your dad. He has way more information that you do, and you don't trust his opinion?  Sounds like he's the only ACTUALLY talking to your dad.

My parents went through a divorce and you know what? This exact thing happened to me. My dad started working out, got angry all the time, started hiding money from my mom, and did stuff like ""wrapped furniture in blankets"" because he knew it would drive my mom nuts. People can become extremely cruel during a divorce. I would assume thats why ALL of this is happening. People go a little nuts when they go through a divorce, especially if its been a long time coming. 

Hearing this from your mom, who is divorcing him, is really, really a bad source. If you're actually that concerned, call his psychiatrist. You can do that, you know. 

Why don't you try supporting your dad instead of diagnosing him, from second hand information you heard from your mom?  You're not even in the same country. If I was your dad, I'd be super pissed too, that my kid was telling people I have a memory loss illness I'm 6 years to young to even get.

So you can't marry whoever you want because the government has a monopoly on which marriages are legally recognized.

&gt;I can move to California tomorrow if I want to.

Yes, you have the ability to move freely within the United States because the government has a monopoly on movement within its borders and has decided that is OK.  Try moving out of the country and you'll find that other countries, with their own monopolies on movement, can and will prevent you from living within their borders unless you get permission first.

&gt;I never needed permission from the government to be a software engineer.

No you didn't, but only because the government has decided your profession doesn't need to be regulated to the extent other professions do.  If it wanted to require special certification for software engineering, it could enact those requirements overnight if it wanted.

&gt;You are looking only at certain elements of these items, which are monopolized by government, like if you wish to marry the same sex or have your marriage recognized by the state.

Uh yeah and you seemed to have completely missed the point.  You're saying that those things are currently in a state of Anarchy.  The fact that certain elements are controlled by government monopoly totally disproves your assertion.  Your point didn't woosh past me, it was just stupid.

You have to provide a cause and effect relationship, as I have, in order for those things to mean anything. I have refuted a few of them already. Perhaps you have forgotten?

To my knowledge there are no firsthand sources published on Stravinsky and Schoenberg, as there are first hand sources for Brahms and Beethoven. Ultimately whether or not Schoenberg was complicit in the plot is irrelevant. We know Stravinsky was which is all that matters in this debate. We know that from the recordings we have from before and after 1940.

Certainly Stravinsky wrote music that was not dissonant. He did, however, write pieces that are extremely dissonant (his piano concerto, among a great deal others) and all of his work is cerebral. I have established that without a doubt. Petrushka was written before the Rite of Spring, and thus is irrelevant to this conversation, and Pulcinella is essentially Stravinsky re-writing someone else music, which he was reluctant to do at first. That's not exactly his own composition there. Wonderful try though! An idiot might have been fooled!

Dissonance is dissonance. It's not relative, it's very specific. Dissonance can be beautiful when used appropriately, but Stravinsky can hardly be called appropriate on this matter. Consonances when they are non-harmonic seem dissonant, but that does not make it so. It's a wonderful thing to build an argument on, especially when the person I'm arguing with is flailing like a lunatic in a fencing match trying to come up with coherent rebuttals!

You seem to think that my argument rests on Stravinsky being in cahoots with germans. It doesn't. That is totally irrelevant to my claim. We are talking about Stravinsky. Providing proof would be a waste of time as such.

You are most certainly talking out of your ass. Your arguments are purposefully vague because you're afraid that I'll debunk them easily, you continuously add on more and more arguments because I've debunked the ones you've made, some of your arguments consist of pure name calling like a child, at every turn you ask for sources and argue points that are irrelevant, and what is most ridiculous is you think you aren't transparent!

And cruise ship companies have been developing the river front and using NOLA as a jumping off point. All of this is translated into huge tax revenues at all levels. The only people really getting fucked are those who lived there before the storm. The sentiment that NOLA should be abandoned comes directly from the media helping these developers to drive down land prices so they can buy up the rest and then actually put in the protections they'll need to sustain their new empire of fun.

I feel like there are somewhat objective standards that can be laid out for clingy-ness and its correlation to tons of extra communication, but it's really bad to force lack of attachment and the expectation of less communication on men.

We should encourage dudes to be open with their feelings and attachments. Using ""dude texts more than non-dude"" as a standard just seems really empty, and kind of mean. Some dudes love to talk, and express fondness or attachment. That's a GOOD thing.

I mean, I guess I can get ""I like to be the chatty/openly attached partner"" as a preference, but not when it's forced on a gender.","1346458393"

As a result, then children would have had identical DNA. aside from a few point mutations scattered here or there throughout the genome Igiven the pretty accurate proofreading capability of DNA polymerase). 


Given that thete are over 6,000 known genetic disorders today (keep. Mind that we have copies of each gene and many of these disorders are recessive). and extremely wide genetis variance among our species, how did this extreme genetic diversity come about in only 6.000 years? That's only 200 generations rassurning 1 generation - 30 years). Bonus points for explaining how the genetic diversity came about in the past 4,000 years since we allegedly went through genetic bottleneck via.

*  Bring Back White Crystals: I asked Jason Attard (Senior Game Balance Designer) about whether or not we intend to bring the white crystals back. He said that we do intend to make this crystal available again in the future, but we do want it to remain very rare even when we do.


* Optimization needs to happen asap: Hey all, I just wanted to pop in and say we are actively working on various optimizations (both server and client) and will continue to do so. It's extremely important for us to continually make improvements to our technology so we can have users across a variety of system specs and support large living worlds for those users to craft their virtual lives.


* Cash Shop Purchases: Account Wide or Single Character only?: Whether or not we sell something as a character vs. account unlock will depend on what makes sense for the selected item and/or unlock -- some will be character-based, whereas some will be account-based. Items that are character-based will, in most cases, be transferable to other characters in your legacy. In the case of certain unlocks where it makes sense, we are also looking to allow players to choose -- pay a small fee to unlock a feature for one character, or pay a slightly higher fee to unlock it for all characters on the account. Hopefully, this will allow players to tailor the experience to their own play style.


* When is someone going to ask the number 1 questions pvpers want to know?:  Hey everyone! I don't have answers to all the questions in the OP and throughout the thread, but I'll keep them coming as I'm able to. Here are a couple I got answers for after talking to Rob Hinkle (Senior PvP Designer).


* Ancient Hypergates will be available in the Ranked Warzones queue as soon as it's in-game; no wait for it to get added.
Regarding queuing as an 8-player team for non-ranked Warzones: We won't say ""never,"" but we don't have plans for this right now. We want to try to keep the regular Warzones competitive in their own right, and allowing full pre-mades to potentially match with a full PUG could be problematic. We'd want to avoid situations like that.
For Ranked Warzones and queuing with less than 8 players: This is something we have plans for, but we haven't announced a timeframe for it (it won't be available in 1.4).
About Season 1: Right now, we have a little more work that needs to be done overall before we're ready to officially kick it off, and I can tell you that it won't be launched as part of 1.4. We'll keep you updated! The PvP game won't be neglected - we do have Ancient Hypergates on the way as well as new PvP gear, and we have a lot more in store for you!


* [Music] Constant music option / loop please: Hey everyone, I talked to Todd Davies (Audio Director), and he had some information to share with you all!  First off, music should be looping on a fairly regular frequency. There could be some issues preventing this, and we'll definitely take a look and address any bugs we find. Secondly, we're definitely open to providing more customizable options for music looping and frequency in the future; it's something we'd like to take a look at.


* Codex vs. Achievement System:  We are definitely aware of issues with some Codex entries, and fixing them up is something we're working on. If you notice a Codex entry that you're having an issue with, please do make sure you report it via the in-game Customer Service portal (in case there are some individual instances we aren't aware of yet)! We don't have plans to scrap the Codex system, but we will be working to improve it.


* Endgame loot musings: I talked to Jason Attard (Senior Game Balance Designer) and he was able to shed some light on modifications in endgame items and how stats are distributed.
Our goal is that a highly-skilled player can complete content without needing to swap mods on their gear, but spending the time and credits necessary to optimize the mods should still make a noticeable difference. 
When we generate mods for endgame gear, we generate all the mod variants at a given item level and then run a process that combines the mods with endgame shell items to create the items needed for an Operation. This process helps us ensure that the stats are useful for Advanced Classes and roles, but it doesn't generate gear that is completely optimal for every spec. We always manually check the results and tweak items where necessary.
We have had some problems in the past with gear that stacks a single rating too much and with incorrect armorings being assigned to some items (high Endurance gear should go to tanking items, Aim/Cunning/Strength/Willpower should go into DPS and healing items), and we're continuing to refine the processes we use to make more useful gear. In future tiers, you'll see many issues with mod allocation corrected!


* Any recent news on Dueling in Non-Dueling areas?:  08.28.2012 , 03:24 PM | #23    	
REPORT POST QUOTE
I talked to Jesse Sky (Lead Flashpoints and Operations Designer) and Damion Shcubert (Principal Lead Systems Designer) about duels in current non-dueling areas, and have some information for you!
Currently, dueling is disabled in the main areas of the Fleets partially because it can have a negative impact on performance in those areas and partially because it can be an unwelcome distraction to other players. This is something we may be able to address in the future, and we appreciate your ideas, but changing it isn't something that will happen in the immediate future.


* Question regarding HK-51 and crewskill: We asked Jason Attard (Senior Game Balance Designer) whether HK-51 would give players an additional Crew Skills deployment. He said that right now we plan on keeping the maximum deployed at 5. Regarding his bonuses, he'll have a small efficiency bonus to all Mission Skills and a small critical bonus to all Crafting Skills.


* Developer Update – Terror from Beyond:  I asked Jesse Sky (Lead Flashpoints and Operations Designer) what kind of gear players should be in to attempt Story Mode and what kinds of rewards they'll receive for doing so. He said that the gear requirements for Story Mode are similar to those for Story Mode Explosive Conflict. It's balanced for Columi and drops Rakata, but will also speed up the acquisition of Black Hole gear. Hard Mode is balanced for players who have geared past Hard Mode Explosive Conflict.","1346458411"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm sorry, but there is nothing rational about 'Al Qaeda', or the Taliban. If you are deluded enough to think Bin Laden and his allies chose its attack points based on some ludicrous notion of a precise relationship between American foreign policy and the Middle East, then I am sorry, you're a fool.

This isn't to say that American foreign policy hasn't caused blow back. On the contrary, the kind of precision you're alluding to is the direct line between the Iranian coup of 1952 and the present theocracy in Iran. But Bin Laden and his allies had as little to do with that regime as they had to do with the Arab spring.

So, go stick your nose in some more books kid. I am glad that maniac is gone, and it has nothing to do with whatever sports metaphor you think you're making. In the real world, his death means troops coming home, it means friends coming home, and it means a crippling blow to an organization that needs to go. And it's going the way it should have been dealt with in the first place.

In other words, if this was 30 years ago, just because our nation is behaving badly, that doesn't make the Soviet Union into the good guys, or into less of a threat to deal with.

2) Black armor. Who else traditionally rocks the black armor? If you guessed Targaryens, you're right. But why? Does he *suspect* he is a Targaryen? (We have no reason to think so) so this is a green dream and he somehow acquires black armor? Would it be too far fetched that when Aegon or Daenerys and Varys and Illyrio's plotlines finally do converge that the whole enchilada unravells and they tell him, give potentially the real Aegon VI Targaryen-SnowStark McGee his armor by birthright?

"flying","t5_2qm1t","I'm maybe 2/3 of the way through the flying. During the first part you practice a lot of basic maneuvers under the hood and get comfortable with climbs, turns, descents, stalls, and partial panel (i.e. dealing with no DG mostly). But having the book knowledge is imperative once you get into intercepting/tracking VORs, NDBs, doing procedure turns, holds, approaches, and basically everything after the initial portion.

So yes, I'd highly suggest starting or even finishing the studying portion before you begin flying.

So far it's been a blast, I'm flying about twice a week and although certain tasks seemed daunting at first (hold entries!) they have become natural over time. 

Hope this helps and good luck in your training.","1346458424"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Housing

The situation you were in sounds unfortunate, but I suspect you were just unlucky.   There are normal people just like you looking for shared living arrangements.   Graduate students, health professionals, and health students seem to be pretty reliable.  People in healthcare most often are required to have a background check so it saves you the trouble.  Sometimes you can find a family looking to rent a room.

&gt; Transportation

Every city is going to be different and will carry its own hurdles.  Some people don’t even think about giving up a car.  One does not need to go barebones in every category, there are many ways to save money and this is just one possibility.  

&gt; Utilities

All bills paid is the way to go if possible.  The links I provided above were all including utilities.  Internet may or may not be included but is not completely necessary.  There are free wifi spots everywhere.

&gt; Food

Yes, it is expensive.  I also realize many government assistance programs budget more than $150 for 1 person to eat even in less expensive areas.  Some section 8 housing is nicer than a few of the places I have lived.  If one qualifies for these assistance programs then they should be utilized, but I was creating this pseudo-budget with no outside assistance in mind.

I still think $150 is manageable for food.  Beans and rice are very nutritious and dirt cheap.

Our expenses came out very close.  In my original example I used $710 whereas in yours you used $715.  Both of these numbers can be trimmed a little bit more in my opinion, but let’s roll with that.

I already tried to calculate taxes into the $1,350 figure for someone making $9.04 at 40 hours per week.  The pre-tax amount was $1,567.  This won’t be exact and I only quickly entered the numbers in a calculator I found online.  Taxes for low-income people are very low.

This is minimum wage.  A resourceful person that is looking for upward mobility should be able to find a job that pays better than minimum wage.  It doesn’t need to be much, but these are minimum numbers used in this calculation.  A second job may also be reasonable while not in school.  There are also tax credits and federal grants available for school can that can effectively lower your tax rate down to 0.

Also, with respect to saving money over 15 years I doubt this person is going to work at $9.04/hr for 15 years if they are really trying to move up.

Community college prices vary quite a bit throughout the nation so it’s hard to give concrete numbers (for example in California I think they charge $20/credit).  I think $2000/semester is very do-able.  There are several options.

This person could work for a year to save money.  If they do that then I believe they should be able to save at least the amount prescribed in my original post.  This is about $7680 after one year.  Keep in mind the difference between the figures I used and the ones you most recently used is only &lt;$300/month.  A second job could easily bring in $300/month.

After working for 1 year this person has already saved up enough for over a year and a half of community college.  Even if they reduce their work hours and earn less money school is mostly paid for.  For a low income independent the federal pell grant can also help substantially--that grant can almost pay for community college itself.

There are still more options for the resourceful person.  

http://www.clovis.edu/TuitionandFees.asp

Here is a community college in New Mexico that charges roughly $1200/semester for out of state students.  A person could do online classes there if college is too expensive in their local area.  Also, there’s always the option of moving like you have done.  

University is more expensive.  If you can pay for two years at community college and then take out loans for the last two years it will put you in a pretty good position.  Some state universities are really not too bad even without scholarships.  This varies drastically by state, but if one really wants to pursue an education they can move to a state with a favorable subsidized education system.

The difference between the numbers I gave and the numbers you have stated is very small.  The difference between living paycheck-to-paycheck and living financially free in this particular case can be just a few hundred dollars a month.  The important part is to live proportionally to the amount of income available.

I’m not making any assumptions about you in particular.  I don’t know you.  Some people just get screwed and there’s nothing they could have done.  However, generally, across the general population I believe people are undereducated about this subject.  

&gt; If you don't mind my asking, how long ago were you doing this? 

I’d rather not get too specific, but it wasn’t **that** long ago.  During this millenium. ","1346458429"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Aaand . . . the third. 

Let's look at the ""charges"".

1. Apparently an intern said something arguable on a blog. Talk about low-hanging fruit. In fact, the intern said it on a blog hosted by Think Progress - the only fact checker that this article actually appears to take on. And it's not even saying that Ryan's speech was accurate. Just that he disagrees with an intern's interpretation of something Ryan did at some other point. *Horrors*. 

2. The Janesville argument, again. Which is again, relying on interpreting Obama's statements as a promise, even a basic component of his entire campaign, neither of which is true, and then just vaguely asserts that ""plants have almost certainly closed while President Obama has been in office"".

3. Really only amounts to saying that the number that one site used is overly optimistic, then says that the ""lowest estimate is 500,000 jobs created or saved [by Obama's stimulus plan]"" Which makes the quote that they're defending by Ryan inaccurate. *At least* half a million jobs isn't money ""borrowed, spent, and wasted.” So Ryan's speech isn't as inaccurate as one site's estimate says it is, just inaccurate by any other standard.

4. Says Think Progress, the same site it keeps debunking, is accurate, but dismisses it as irrelevant. And is, again, as best I can tell, not in relation to the speech at all. He's just saying that he doesn't like the way that one site (the same site he keeps returning to) makes use of the things that Ryan has said and done.

5. See above. Same site, same argument.

6. Doesn't even bother to link the accusation to anyone. He just says that ""someone"" has made an assertion he disagrees with, and then bravely stands up to ""someone"" by saying some numbers about Obamacare, then stating that other numbers would be ""more than offset"" by Ryan and Romney's plans, with no evidence to support that whatsoever.

7. Goes back to that same single site that he keeps harping on (he's not really going after the fact checkers, he's going after Think Progress), and then says that the point is debatable. And is again, not saying anything about Ryan's speech or it's ""spot-on-ness"". He just says that he thinks Think Progress is stupid. Which, ok. Whatever. *I get that you don't like Think Progress's live blog*

8. Again with Think Progres*, nothing about the speech. And it's basis for attacking Think Progress is that the site was using ""estimates of what would happen after Romney and Ryan repeal Obamacare"" without acknowledging how Romney and Ryan might control those estimates by implementing legislation that Romney and Ryan haven't disclosed, which make them pretty difficult to estimate. Basically ""Whaaah! Think Progress is using estimates available to them, and aren't factoring in the possibility that the Republicans might do something that might work, which is a possibility, even if their refusal to talk about those plans means that they are, by definition, impossible to estimate.""

9. Still with Think Progress, still more about Think Progress than the speech, then a brief selection of text from the S&amp;P (not any of the selections that identify the Republicans as an issue, of course), then what's presented as an encapsulation of the S&amp;P statement that singles out the Democrats for blame more than the entire S&amp;P statement itself, and which never singles out the Republicans for blame, whereas the S&amp;P statement does.

10. Guess who? Think Progress. And while he doesn't link to it, it's from a liveblog written as the speech was happening (the same liveblog that most, if not all of these quotes from Think Progress is coming from, and is an accusation that nobody other than Think Progress seems to be making). And even while the article finds that Think Progress mischaracterized the quote . . . so? Even if Paul Ryan is right about this . . . and?

11. Think Progress is wrong . . . because they've identified Ryan as taking a position that he didn't bring up in this specific speech? The argument here is that Think Progress identifies Ryan as wanting to implement European-style austerity measures, which is wrong because Ryan never said austerity in this specific speech, and because other conservatives in America say that they don't approve of austerity measures.

12. Your article again dislikes the way that Think Progress has addressed Ryan's speech. It doesn't say that anything Ryan said was true, just that it doesn't like Think Progress's approach.

13. Apparently, Fox news didn't attack Ryan's speech. It just paid one of its contributors to write an article attacking the speech, then published it. And the things that Fox news people say don't represent Fox news anyway. And three of the things that it said were things that the article already covered anyway (guess which ones! I can't!)

Your article isn't debunking any fact checker other than Think Progress. And it's debunking a liveblog at that - something being created in real time, without the benefit of a transcript to double-check or the ability to sit down and read through all the evidence. And it doesn't even wind up supporting Ryan in the process - there's no ""here's why Ryan was telling the truth"", just ""eat it, Think Progress"". All we've learned here is that liveblogging in general is not a great way to ensure 100% accuracy, and that blogs written by interns are not always Pulitzer material. Which anybody could have told you. 

[Here's the liveblog by the way](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/08/29/770001/rnc-wednesday/). While the linked article decided to attack fewer than 13 statements from it, there's an awful lot there.","1346458438"

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","That's a pretty broken idea of how OO works.

&gt; Then, for some reason, I can make a line of code like this:  
Object N = new Object();  
And if I run that line of code twice, I then have two variables called N  

Actually, you don't have two objects named N, unless this happened in two separate scopes--a problem you'll have in procedural programming, too.  Scope exists in all programming languages: if I declare a variable inside a `for` loop, it typically stays in that `for` loop--I can't access it after the loop is done.

And I can't have two variables with the same name in the same scope.  So this:

    Object n = new Object();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
      Object n = new Object(); //This throws a compiler error in every OO language
    }

That won't fly.  Ever.  *Every* statically typed OO language will complain about that.

However, in C (a procedural language if there ever was one), even this is an issue:

    int number = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
      number++;
      int number2 = 0;
      printf(""%d"", number2);
      number2;
    }
    printf(""%d"", i);

1. You get a compiler error.  ""i"" is only in scope in that loop, so when you attempt to access it in that last line, you're dead.
2. Even if you comment out that last line, it will print ""0"" 10 times: each instance of number2 is its own--and the previous one *no longer exists*.

I would also suggest that the way you would build a car in your metaphor makes no sense.  In computing, you start off by making something--anything--work.  This could be as simple as turning an array of characters ""AAAA"" into an array of characters ""BBBB"" by iterating through the array and incrementing each character.","1346458450"

*Write a PID controller to have the quad return to it's zero position while in flight  
Is there anything much more that I'm missing in that respect?  
  

The camera will track an object on the ground and will send a desired position to the navigation software.  
  
Again, thanks for your help.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yes and no. The idea of secession was certainly seen as valid legalistically at the time, and there wasn't much dispute about that. If you read Jefferson Davis's ""The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government"" he has a nearly 200 long page legalistic definition of why that was acceptable, legally.

Prior to that it was generally expected that states could leave if they so chose and there was a much grater emphasis on states rights. After the Civil War the United States became a practically indisputable indivisible entity. That completely changes the game when it comes to states rights, it means they can fight for them, but at the end of the day they'll have to accept the consequences, and the conclusion the body politic as a whole reaches, and not what is individually right or desired by the state. (A good example would be Eisenhower deploying Federal Troops, and then later Federalizing the Arkansas National Guard to force desegregation of Little Rock High School)

Yes the trend over time has been to delegate more power (or establish, it isn't necessarily delegated, but its established) towards the Federal Government but as far as the flow of power goes the Civil War completely changed the game, and established that the United States was not and would not be a confederation, but was in reality and would continue to be a Federal Republic. 

And people have all different viewpoints on the nature of the American Government and what it should be, but it has been so established now that it will neither ever be just for defense, or completely autocratic. 

The states rights argument doesn't stem from secession, it stems from the Constitution, but the limits and applicability of that argument, and the means through which states could attempt to assert their sovereignty were greatly reduced and contextualized after the Civil War. Thats why its sometimes referred to as the Second American Revolution, because it revolutionized the mandate with which our Federal Government exercises its powers. ","1346458458"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","This really needs to be specified much better, as someone who in Guild Wars 1 utilized a Logitech G15 with macro keys I always wondered what exactly ArenaNet classified as ""okay"" in terms of macros.

An example of something I used in Guild Wars 1, while keg farming you would have to pick up keg's and drop them. I made a macro which hit the pickup button and then .125 seconds later hit the drop bundle button which would allow me to essentially press 1 button but issue two separate commands to the game.

I contacted support in Guild Wars 1 with this same example and was never responded too. My ticket sat idle for months and I eventually just stopped checking. From what I understand the mouse you have with Steelseries for Guild Wars 2 would allow me to re-create this same macro so if it is considered automating gameplay why are you selling a product that could get your customers banned.

**TLDR:** I'd like to see a better explanation on this subject from ArenaNet, it is something that I and multiple other people asked about in Guild Wars 1 and we were never really answered in detail which makes it hard to identify what you (ArenaNet) consider to be automation. ","1346458466"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Buddy I do not want to sound mean but I'm about to get real with you. Stop sulking about not getting women and instead go out there and get some! Now you may be saying to yourself, ""oh but it's not that easy!"", ""I'm not attractive or interesting enough SgtNeilDiamond!"" Stop. Take a breath and understand me when I say, it's far easier than you could imagine and I'm going to give you an example and a crash course. 

Here's my story: I was nothing in high school, I got lost my virginity my senior year and she was a slut, I wont hide it, I had a very very close run in with herpes from her but I ended up clean. Long story short, I wasn't shit in high school, therefore I had no confidence in myself. Skip forward to my first week of college, I was near the campus but I got completely lost, I see a girl just standing on the side of the street, so I go up to her and ask if she knows where Ivy St. is. She was just as lost as I was, but she had a friend coming to pick her up, so she offered me a ride. While waiting we had a very casual conversation for a good half an hour. Once her friend showed up we all started talking and long story short I ended up hanging out with them later that night and became very good friends with them. Did I fuck them? Nope, not once. But what  this event did was open up my eyes to seeing how easy it was to talk to women and even become very close with them. My confidence slowly began growing from this and I soon began just talking with random women around campus. I began to change the way I acted, dressed, and just basically the way I presented myself. Within months I was getting with girls I would have never tried for beforehand, it was an amazing experience and it completely changed my life. I'm giving an personal example of how anyone can change the way the view themselves and how women view them. It is **never** too late to create a new you. 

The basic step in talking to women is the cliched use of ""small talk"", because you'll find one, or two things about the girl, either she's interested in you or she's completely bored and not worth **your** time. That's one thing I had to realize very fast, if she isn't interested with you, or so it may seem, drop her, she's not worth the effort and there's 100 more girls to try the same thing with. If the girl is interested then you've got a hook and you begin to set that hook with conversations about **her**. Rule number two: **do not** talk about yourself unless asked. Women love talking about themselves and love the fact that you're interested and willing to listen. 

Easy questions to ask: ""What are you studying?"" ""Where are you from?"" ""How's your college life?"" ""What are you in to?"", basic questions like that will get you miles ahead and these questions will on their own branch off into other subjects, thus creating a ""conversation"". Do you see what I did there? I just created you a half an hour or more with a woman, and it was easy as pie right? The answer is yes.

If you are in a conversation with a woman then assume she's interested and ask if she would like to do something later, and even ask for her number. I'd love to help beyond this point, but this is the lone wolf zone. I have no idea what either of you are into or what there is to even do where you are, so that my friend is up to you. What I will tell you is keep in interesting, do something out of your ordinary routine and branch out. Hell write down ideas for conversations if you really have to. Keep the event flowing smoothly and it'll all be down hill from there. 

If you don't end up having sex with her, there's no problem with that because you're gaining confidence and becoming better at conversing. You're miles ahead of your peers that just want to try to get the girl drunk and end up having her pass out them. 

Now about **you**. I have no idea what your sense of style is, but I'll tell you appearances affect your chances of getting laid heavily. You could be a 3 but you wear a nice outfit and smell like Georgio Armani, she's immediately going to judge you even higher and you'll be a 6 or 7 in her eyes. I don't care if you're fat or ugly, this method works on anyone. No girl wants to hang out with a guy wearing a hoody and sun bleached jean shorts, that's just obvious. You may be asking, how can I possibly afford nice clothes on a college budget though SgtNeilDiamond?? Ross's and Marshall's my friend. That's it. At these stores you can find Calvin Klein, Guess, Perry Ellis, or even Ralph Lauren clothes for dirt cheap. That's all you need for going after college girls. You don't think you have any style? You're in college, your job half of the time is to research, so why not research new styles, and don't be afraid of asking women for opinions on outfits. You pick up on style pretty damn fast. For the love of the universe understand me when I say that smell means **EVERYTHING**. You smell like B.O., girls wont want to be near you; same goes for smelling like too much cologne. Moderate your sent, and always smell good. It will make you far more approachable. 

If you follow these easy, simple steps and rules, you will be on your way to getting laid in no time. These are all tings I've picked up on along my journey through college and they **all** work. 

Key things: Small talk, talk about her, be interesting, be confident, dress well, smell good, do not fear rejection because there's always more women, and the most important of all, never give up on trying to talk to women, even if you get reject, move on to another girl and never admit defeat. 

If you have anymore specific questions just PM me and I will be happy to help. 

Good luck buddy. ","1346458470"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I'm down voting this because there is a litany of threads relating to this topic already; you add nothing to the discussion as ANet explained it is against their Terms of Service, which all players agree too.

I'll take a stab at enlightening you, though.  El Al Airlines pricing error effects their bottom line, not their customer base (I highly doubt they raised fares to compensate for such a small sample size as compared to their monthly/quarterly/yearly profits).  What happened in this case, a clear oversight on the part of the coder, has SIGNIFICANT effects on the player-base of the game.  ANet cannot let this go without addressing it.  They have 3 choices:  Roll back, Ban, Ignore it.  If they ignore it they reinforce that their ToS mean nothing.  I'm not sure why they didn't roll back (maybe they can't or maybe they want to make an example of exploiters) but they chose not to.  Whether or not you agreed with it, everyone who purchased the weapons knew it was wrong and likely traveled out of their way to get there to purchase them before it was fixed.  They clearly exploited a feature of the game which had unintended consequences and as such is a clear violation of the game.

Because you feel that 'ideally' this be done before sex even takes place, you're basically advocating giving a 'scarlet letter' to men who would consider legal paternal surrender.  I would be with you if both the man and woman had to do something like this, but you're only interested in just the man being singled out this way.

Women aren't required to sign anything or even give a 'heads up' whether they want the baby or not.  That is whether they're pregnant or not, no matter what was agreed to previously regarding childbirth.  So if anything, whether the man will be liable for child support or not should only be between him and wherever he registers for 'legal paternal surrender'.

Under your proposal, women can still renege on what may have been previously agreed to while men are required to be forthcoming about their intentions before an actual baby even enters into the equation.

&gt;shes acts like 10y old princess and treats me like shit...

1) Realise the discrepancy here. Fixate on it all weekend. Think about every time she fucked you over and think about being married to that shit. Could you take that for the next few decades? It sounds like a prison sentence, it sounds like hell. Do you know how many guys go bankrupt/ get sent to jail/ kill themselves over massive child support and alimony bills every year?

2) You are going to focus on not giving a fuck all weekend, no excuses. There is NO WAY you are skipping that studying session on Monday. You will not waste one more second when you could have been studying on little miss princess. Do EVERY Project Mayhem task again. If by Monday you have [climbed up a cliff while drunk and wearing sandals](http://www.reddit.com/tb/s8bu6), trust me you will not be thinking about princess.

3) If the only negative about changing groups in September is the *possibility* of some freaking **gossip** why give a fuck? Do it. Change groups immediately, stop wasting your valuable time thinking about it. Seriously this is not even an issue.

edit-
 
4) I just read [your BreakUps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z3ppg/long_but_worth_reading_life_changing_story_i_dont/) and am sitting here open mouthed, shell-shocked. But I guess people can't see the wood for the trees. I'm gonna lay down some truth, brother. It's gonna hurt so don't read this next part unless you are really a man, with a pair of balls: 

* Those times when she ignored you for months are the times she was **happy**. She felt good about herself, was off fucking other guys and feeling self-confident.

* Those times when she threw herself at you and ""told me shes so alone and she wants me to take care of her and all that stuff"" are the times she was feeling **bad and insecure** about herself. She sucked your attention out of you and made you fixate on her, until *she felt better about herself*.

The only way a long-term relationship between you two could possibly work is if she is constantly miserable and constantly needs to suck all the joy out of you until there is nothing left. When you have nothing left to give her, she will immediately abandon you again, like she has done repeatedly in the past.

Those last two months she didn't bother to reply- she was fucking other guys and falling in love with them. Any time she's having a bad day she has some backup chump to suck the life out of, to make her feel better.

In conclusion, not only should you never see or talk to or think about princess again, I honestly think you should get a restraining order taken out against her to prevent her ever bothering you again. At least change your mobile phone number so she stops calling you. She has serious mental and personality problems and will drag you down with her if you keep feeding her deep-seated insecurities. There are 3.5 billion other women on this planet and you think your *perfect woman* treats you like shit? But I'm not judging you, pal. I still remember how fucked up I got the first time I got dumped. Sleepless nights/ throwing up all the time you name it. It happens to everyone who ever falls in love. But the pain fades.

Hey you know what it's like? It's exactly like when think back to when you were sick (the flu, chicken pox, hangover etc) when you were younger: you remember logically ""yeah I felt like shit then"" but as the years pass the pain fades, until you can look back on your memory and even see the funny side.

The first time I ever walked up to a beautful stranger, to compliment her, I flinched! I actually flinched! As if I was expecting to be punched! My shoulders and chin hunched towards my chest, I instinctively shut my eyes and even backed away from her as I said it. I was so nervous, my heart was pounding. She was a sweetheart...

It sucked at the time but it always makes me laugh when I think about how clumsy and stupid I was when I first started dating.

But it's up to you. You can fixate on her, maybe she'll let you have sex with her a couple more times before she loses interest and ignores you for the rest of the year. Please unsubscribe from this subreddit on your way out.

Or you can Not Give A Fuck and get on with your life. What are you studying by the way?

Jesus is a character in these stories, based on a real character but depicted long after his death in various ways that serve the purposes of the storytellers.  So no, I don't require evidence for Jesus or his miracles, nor do I accept them on faith.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","&gt;Though more workers will be employed, each will be working fewer hours, and there will, therefore, be no net increase in man-hours. It is unlikely that there will be any significant increase in production, Total payrolls and “purchasing power” will be no larger. All that will have happened, even under the most favorable assumptions (which would seldom be realized) is that the workers previously employed will subsidize, in effect, the workers previously unemployed. It is true that the old workers will now work fewer hours; but this purchase of more leisure at a high price is presumably not a decision they have made for its own sake: it is a sacrifice made to provide others with jobs.

He likely wouldn't be punishing us either, but that's because I just don't think a supreme creator would really care about our feeble species.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; If people are being polite because they know everyone is packing, how is this civilised behaviour? I would argue that having guns for 'protection' is an inherent acceptance that thee is 'good' and 'bad' people, rather than 'those with opportunity' and 'those without'. You are essentially washing your hands of the need to cure social ills by re-casting the problem as some sort of us vs them crap. This is hardly civilised.

I'm not saying at all the rifts in society which create criminals don't need to be cured, I'm simply stating that until they're cured and everyone adopts perfect manners the ability to defend oneself against others is an unalienable right. 

&gt; Trust me, your government does not consider its armed populace 'opposition'.

Perhaps not, but the fact is that every violent dictator in recent history has enforced very strict gun control that I'm aware of. If the government does not fear the people why does it feel the need to disarm them?

&gt;You are kind of missing the point. I'm asking why are people being attacked? If its a mugging or robbery gone bad then it is a matter of social inequity. If it is a public shooting then it is more likely a mental health service issue. The point is that by jumping to the argument that guns are necessary for defence you are avoiding the questions of why defence is necessary in the first place.

Again, I'm not asking why or trying to explain why, I'm simply trying to make the point that removing the right to self defense before the need for self defense is removed is a bad way to go about doing things. Defense is necessary for any number of reasons, and until all of those reasons are removed it makes no sense to strip innocent people of the ability to exercise that defense. I think we may be seeing two different arguments here. 

&gt; I'm assuming that you are referring to bad elements in the society around you? If not then I apologise in advance for misunderstanding, but honestly I can never take this view.

You misunderstood entirely, I am literally referring to bears, mountain lions and rabid dogs. As humans encroach on the natural habitats of large predators encounters with said predators will increase in frequency. If I'm walking along in a new suburb in a small mountain town and a mountain lion starts heading my way I'd rather deal with the EPA being upset I shot it than just turn and hope I could out run it. If I'm hiking on a trail and I come across a mother bear with cubs I really don't want to bet my life on a can of bear spray. If I'm in a park with my child and a rabid dog comes sprinting onto the playground and attacks me, my child, or other children should I just sit back and be thankful that at least criminals can't access guns?

&gt; I argue that the times you really actually do need a gun are so utterly infrequent that no, you really should not be allowed to just walk around with one even if this means you have a more limited means of self defense in these situations. Accepting this is civilised. Being willing to go down shooting is not.

The times you will need an airbag and a seat belt are pretty infrequent too. Yet the government mandates your car have them and that you use them. The issue with this is that criminals rarely make appointments. I never plan to need my gun to defend myself. The issue is what if I guess wrong? What if I do need it and I don't have it? I'm just SOL? I carry my gun everywhere I legally can, not because I think I'll need it, but because **IF** I ever do need it, I'm going to really need it. ","1346458499"

Whether it's effective or not, it's null. There's no law against it, there's no law for it. You are clearly convinced that there is absolutely no correlation whatsoever, so good for you.

But just think this through with a clear head for one moment. A woman can choose to heed advice like Krista Ford gives, or they can choose not to. It's as simple as that.

Why? Because i think it's wrong to steal and I would feel bad if i opened up this dudes car and took his shit. Clearly not everyone in the world thinks like I do, and therefore as a precaution people choose to lock their doors, even though we should live in a society where we have no fear of getting our stuff stolen.

corporations are doing extremely well, but the problem is that they don't need to hire US workers to make up for demand which is essential to most theories on how an economy can thrive. it also seems apparent that companies realized they didn't need all employees that they had before the crash.  throw in the fact that a lot of Americans lack the skills to get the jobs that are available creates a melting pot full of shit.

Years ago I woke up and had 2 tiny blood spots on my pajamas so I check my chest and sure enough there appeared to be 2 tiny puncture wounds right above my nipple. As crazy as it sounds they looked like fang marks of a tiny tiny vampire! I figured maybe a spider or bug bite, didn't think much of it and eventually just forgot about it. But then I noticed the 2 holes seems to be dark brown. I don't know why I ignored it for so long, but years later the holes were still visible and appear to have something brown in them so I decided to try o extract whatever it was. It hurt at first so I gave up. Then I had the brilliant idea of trying to do the extraction in the shower. The combination of soap and water made it easy and sure enough I was able to remove whatever it was. It reminded me of a blackhead extraction except there was a lot more. I actually saw one on my other boob recently and removed it as well. Never did find out what the hell it was and it does bother me. Not an ingrown hair, not a pimple, blackhead or whitehead.

Using male privilege as an example (straight, white men are who are assumed to have male privilege mostly, but this specific example applies to most men). Men have the privilege to not have to be worried about getting raped 24/7. If you ask most men what they do to protect themselves from being raped, they will look at you and say nothing. If you ask them further how many times they think about the possibility of being raped in a day, most will also say none. If you ask these questions to women most will tell you that they do things like not walk alone in the dark or carry mace or whatever else, and that they think about the possibility of being raped pretty often, whether it be walking alone at night, when a man is walking up behind them in an alley, or even when they are going to a party where there will be a lot of males. 

It's a privilege that men don't have to think about/worry about rape the way that women do. They can't help it, it's nothing that makes them any worse than women or any better. It's just an inherit privilege that comes with being male.

On the other side of that coin, you could argue that men get put into a box as ""potential rapist"" even though most men have done nothing to deserve it, other than be a man and that it's a privilege of women to not have to be an assumed potential rapist. 

Privilege is a really complicated issue, and it's really sensitive to a lot of people, but it does come inherently, and by things we have no control over. It's just something to be aware of when you're looking at other people, or discussing social issues. ","1346458526"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Parents are naturally inclined to stand by and believe their children.  The mind of a parent is very different from how the law is (or at least how it should be).  

In an ideal world, the law feels that it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to punish one innocent man.  

For a parent, it is better that ten people be subject to wild accusations than to let one act of sexual violence against their children go unbelieved.  Not saying it's right, but I understand.  

If I had a child and she came to me and said her uncle molested her, I would believe her.  Most sexual assaults on children are committed by family, after all.  I would try to get to the bottom of it and in the meantime keep her away from said uncle.  **However**, if it came to light that she was a liar, she would be grounded for a year, cut off from her friends, all toys and privileges taken away...  Whatever punishments I could think of that would avoid acting with violence.  

That said, that woman is a bitch for being so blind as to hold on to her indignation long after it was proven her daughter was full of shit, especially for harassing you for so long afterward.   I do not blame you in the slightest for not caring about her cancer.  What's more, you are indifferent.  You aren't gloating over it, you just don't care.  That's perfectly fine.

There are already apps that do that in WP7, but without the integration to the main voice commands, it's not as usable.

As for Dips, it's harder because they conflict pretty heavily with both the presses, which are very important for the program (most programs, really).

"reformstorm","t5_2uhlg","I think for something like this to work, there would have to be something very specific for us to link back to. For instance, another post similar to the one Dan wrote after everyone spammed Greenwald, etc. Something of a ""cover letter"" for Dan, telling CNN why he wants the job, what he would do for them, and why that would work, etc. 

From there, we'd have to get people organized, set dates, and give people an incentive to get involved. One way to do this would be to have Dan do a 'live' Common Sense podcast on Ustream or something of that nature.* He could advertise it for a few weeks beforehand, on twitter, the forums, and podcasts. During live podcast, everyone who tuned in would be reminded periodically to tweet out (and retweet) the #HireDan tweets. 

This is just an idea, though, and I'm new here so I may be totally missing the mark of what this subreddit is aiming for. I have a bit of experience with internet-based activism, though, so I figured I'd throw out my ideas.

*edit: this would be contingent on him even being comfortable with this, I'm not sure if he's ever said before whether he'd consider something like doing a live podcast.  ","1346458549"

What about Obamacare the bailout for the insurance companies?

There's a lot of fair points and when you start stacking them you start to see this isn't what was voted in.

Funny how you're acting like I was hazy on details of the campaign. Maybe it was how he winked and dogged marijuana questions and people thought it was cool that he openly talked about smoking pot and even snorting coke but the overall story arch of the campaign was ""Yes we can"" and ""Change"" and neither of those things happened.

The puppet strings are clear, most people can see them now.

Mix and make sounds at low volumes, and I mean damn low. Test time to time loudly for feel.

Test in mono, balance levels in mono always, stereo lies.

Have a groove, a rhthym that is always present, emphasize it, build around and on it, this is the soul of the track.

Don't fall in love with chords/sounds, if it starts one way but ends up another much better way and you want to run with it, trust your gut. If you force it out it won't be nearly as dope as if you're inspired.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","I drove a Veloster, Cruze, Caliber, Fit, Civic, and Fusion before I bought the car. By far the Focus had a much nicer interior (with this package) than everything but the Fusion had. 

The only thing that came close to being as good as the Focus was the Fusion which was out of my price range in the end, and the Veloster, which the car felt good to drive, but the interior felt cheap.

The cruze might as well have been a Geo Metro it just felt so underpowered and the turbo lag didn't help. Caliber was a POS, felt like driving a brick while surrounded by cheap plastic. Hondas both weren't bad, but they weren't impressive and the Fit was really cramped.

Seems people were getting the SE or S base model as rentals and that's where the interior complaints come from. The Sport has the nice seats like [This.](http://images.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/08/Focus-SE-sport-buckets-450x337.jpg).","1346458559"

Recently, after my graduation in May, I moved back in with my father.  I don't really like cats because I'm allergic to them, but Mouse and I have built this relationship over the months that I've been here.

Just the other night, though, I was practicing and Mouse came in.  We connected on an astral level for a moment, and I felt his large and fuzzy energy.  He's really as big as a mountain lion if you'd believe it!  I'd been struggling with my Wicca journey, and while I have come to understand my patron I had yet to connect with my matron (rooted, I think, in my relationship with an abusive mother).  As it would have it, I had prayed to that big sexy moon and humbly asked the goddess to show me how to look for her.  This story was kind of a way for me to understand that, and now I believe my patron and matron have contacted me and let me know they've laid claim to me.

Will people who have no knowledge of this game know that? Not really. What they will know is two things based on the context. 1. This is good for the flamboyant guy with fabulous collars. and 2. This is bad for the enemy team.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Abraham Lincoln gets far, far more credit than he deserves. His actions and inaction pretty much directly led to the civil war, shattered our form of government, and set the foundation for the big government, crippling debt we have today. 

He failed in almost every regard, but hey, at least he gave short speeches. 

Edit: Honestly, I don't mind the downvotes, so pile on. But if you're disagreeing with me, let's talk it out. I'll lay out one basis for my reasoning. 

First of all, Lincoln inherited a shitty situation, and maybe war was inevitable, but I say it could have been avoided. 

Only a few weeks after he was elected (before he was confirmed), South Carolina met and said, ""Fuck this shit, we're out."" They voted to secede. There's just one small problem, Fort Sumter was located outside Charleston, and Fort Sumter was filled with U.S. troops. 

At that point, they became a military fortification on effectively foreign soil. 

Keep in mind, Lincoln isn't President yet. 

In January, the US military tried to sneak a ship of troops and supplies into Fort Sumter to resupply it and reinforce it. South Carolina said, ""Umm...fuck no."" They fired on the ship. 

This made it clear to just about everyone who may have still been confused that South Carolina did NOT want Fort Sumter to remain on their soil. 

The U.S. trying to sneak troops into Fort Sumter prompted several more states, over the course of the next few weeks, to say, ""Fuck this, we're out."" Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas to be precise. With Texas voting to dissolve their treaty with the U.S., instead of secede - a complicated affair that made Texas a sovereign nation again. 

The South meets, forms a Government in February, but otherwise, things remain tense yet peaceful. 

Then, in March, Abraham Lincoln takes office. He tried to make everyone happy. He said he had no intention of trying to end slavery in the South, but he also said that he would not tolerate secession, but hoped to avoid war. 

This is the moment for which everyone was waiting. He had the power and the option to order Fort Sumter to stand down, and to turn the fort, now located in a foreign nation, over to the Confederate States. 

Lincoln chose not to act. He chose to continue blustering and stomping around saying that secession was unacceptable - all while maintain the presence of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. 

In April 1861, instead of showing a willingness to negotiate, Lincoln informed the Confederate States that he was sending aid and troops to Fort Sumter. South Carolina said, ""Fuck it, we're done with these people."" They bombarded the fort and took it over. 

Four more states seceded, and the rest is bloody, terrible history. 

The icing on the fucked up cake came in 1863. Lincoln, trying to put even more political pressure on the Southern States, issues the Emancipation Proclamation. Popular belief holds that this freed all of the slaves and made them U.S. citizens. This in fact, is not the truth. That took place with the 13th amendment in 1865. 

The Emancipation Proclamation was an ultimatum executive order that Lincoln issued. He informed the south of it in September of 1862, then enacted it on January 1, 1863. It basically said, 'If any Confederate State does not return to the Union by January 1, I'm ordering that all of the slaves in the south are no longer your property and you don't get any compensation for them.' None of them returned.

So what about the four slave-holding states that were part of the Union? They retained their slaves for some time afterward. Because the Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves and was not about freeing slaves, it was a tactic of coercion - it failed. 

Maybe we're better off this way. Maybe 750,000 people needed to die. But I still think it could have been handled much differently with a much better outcome. ","1346458575"

We're moving up. The RNC debacle was disheartening, of course, but to throw it away is a slap in the face. Gary Johnson was running as a Republican too.

My own opinion is that if you kind of ""naturally"" sit back you avoid this.  The hips might break a little before the knees but it won't be exaggerated like in the OP's video.  I think one of the underrated aspects of form is not just thinking of these lifts as a collection of cues you have to memorize and perfect every rep.  You're trying to get the lift to feel natural for you so you can stop overthinking it and concentrate on the effort.  As such, you might see some variability from lifter to lifter but as long as the basics are in place (decent spinal position, knees stay out) I think it boils down to what feels best to you.","1346458595"

Problem is, the benefits came from his cousin, aka a family member and exempt from NCAA rules regarding benefits. They couldn't prove we did anything wrong with regards to this, so they punished us b/c we talked to our players about it before the NCAA investigator talked to them, which they told us not to do. The problem is that they send that to everybody they investigate and it is regularly ignored.

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","I was dating a girl for three years, I drove her to school helped with tuition and books. Nearing the end of our nursing program I hear from multiple people (looking for drama) she was bragging about sleeping with people so I asked her at school in which she got really defensive, yelling at me and callin the other girl a liar, the other URL heard and joined the confrontation.. I walked away.

Cut to later that day, she wants me to drive to her house to give her the school books I bought, I complied naturally. She comes up to my car and starts yelling 
her - ""were not gonna talk about this?"" me- ""there's nothing to talk about"" her- ""you sure had a lot to say when you had your friend backing you up"" me "" please shut up""
She proceeds to fake like Shes about to hit me so I flinched and then I just put my hand on her face to remind her I'm really not afraid of her.. Now before I continue we need some background: 
Throughout the relationship she swore she could kick my ass and we would play fight and she would always win she was 5'3 and 130 lbs of puerto rican and Italian fury, I am 5'7 and 115 of Irish German Italian rage. Now back to the story
After I put my hand on her face she pounces and starts pulling my hair (Mohawk) and hitting me in the head with her flailing extremities
I simply stood up, wrapped my left Arm around hers and threw one punch to the face ... She got knocked out . I had to pour water on her face.

I drove her to school the rest of the year because I felt obligated (idk don't ask me why) and we never really spoke again..","1346458600"

You are wrong there.  [""After weeks of drama, the White House and Congress reached an agreement that raised the debt ceiling until, most likely, the end of this year, after the November elections."" ](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/us/politics/obama-presses-congress-to-act-on-his-priorities.html)  

[""Obama, Congress Near Agreement on Debt Ceiling""](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/07/obama-congress-near-agreement-on-debt-ceiling/242843/)

&gt;The Budget Control Act was not progress

Sure it was.  The act was intended to prevent the default that could have resulted from the 2011 United States debt-ceiling crisis.  The debt ceiling was raise as a direct result of the Budget Control Act of 2011.

&gt;The Budget Control Act was not progress; nothing was decided there.

Obviously Congress did decide on the terms of Budget Control Act of 2011, or there would be not be the fiscal cliff resulting from it and the debt ceiling would not have been raised.

&gt;There were no original deals. They threw in non-structured automatic cuts where the Republicans gave everything (military cuts big time) and democrats gave little to nothing.

Non-structured automatic cuts as a result of Budget Control Act of 2011 are literally the deal which was signed into law.  If there was no deal then the fiscal cliff would not exist.

&gt;Lead on the specifics of what needs to be reformed. You're claiming that congress (without any input from Obama let I remind you) passes a bill that pushes the responsibility off to a council that Obama again fails to work with as leading on the issue?

Wrong again.  The articles linked above indicate Obama was working with Congress.  Here is an article about [him trying to influence the super committee.](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/obama-tells-super-committee-to-bite-the-bullet/) 

&gt;He could have at least done his liberal duty to claim cuts for the military were the necessary measure and give good reasons why.

The article above explains why.  ""The whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country.""","1346458611"

(The stuff with Oberon/Dworkin, and the creation of Amber.)  The Corwin series is still part of the Chronicles... not part of the prequels.

The issue is a play on subjectivism/objectivism, as well as solipsism, which is still an ongoing issue in philosophy...  which is a reason I love his novels... they go deeper than most other novels do, though I always thought his short stories were better.

"bodyweightfitness","t5_2tf0a","Welcome.

Check out the FAQ and this article from the sidebar/FAQ which will instruct you on how to build a good routine focused towards strength and hypertrophy:

http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2010/03/the-fundamentals-of-bodyweight-strength-training/

A couple things I can spot instantly that you need to significantly revise: 

* You'll want to do away with the splits because they are inefficienct compared to full body routines for gaining strength and hypertrophy. Aim for 3-4x a week full body routine.

* You'll want to narrow down your exercises, so you are repeating the same ones over and over again so you can progressively increase weight or reps, or progressions with these exercises. That's how you get stronger and bigger.

* eliminate a lot of isolation work like skull crushers, curls and other garbage exercises like wall sits, situps and crunches are they waste your training time and are ineffective. You basically want all of your training capacity aimed at the money compound exercises because they will give you the most stress for your body and thus the most muscle growth.

* Any routine where you're trying to put on muscle mass especially you should be focusing on squats, deadlifts, overhead press, bench press, dips, pullups. rows, and the similar bodyweight substitutes for any of these exercises like handstand pushups, planche, front lever, back lever, etc.","1346458614"

Our infrastructure is crumbling, our education system is, quite literally, a fucking travesty, and we're bleeding ourselves dry through incredible military spending.

Our post war boom was so incredible and long lasting because private capital was being reinvested domestically and not going into the yachts and off shore accounts of the ultra rich.

For our anniversary that year, I had this whole trick planned out where I met him at his work for lunch to give him his gift. It was a PS3 game and I played dumb, saying the guy at Best Buy or wherever had said it was a great game, but I felt like it was ridiculously expensive. 
I started to act upset when my husband said it was for a different game system than the one he had, then I told him I'd even gone to the trouble of getting the manual, which was in the trunk of the car along with the receipt and could he please get it for me so I could take it back (meanwhile fake tears are welling up)? He goes to the back of the car, opens the trunk, and there's the new PS3. 

He picked up a card for me on the way home from work and forgot to sign it, so I had to wait while he went in the other room to sign the card.

It's difficult, the pay is not as good as other industries (typically) and as I'm sure you've seen, sometimes job security is a big question. So if that doesn't dissuade you, then give it your all, have a backup plan and constantly be learning everything you can while striving for your goal. Read the valve handbook which is available everywhere - if you're a ""T-shaped person"" I think it's safe to say that any company would be interested in hiring you - heck, Valve just hired an economist so maybe they'd love to hire someone with experience in investment banking.

If you're curious about where to begin - Unity is an engine that's free, and there are lots of great communities that have sprung up with regards to people looking to crowdsource making their indie games. Hop on to one of those boards and partner with someone, see if you can make happen what they want to happen. Don't say you can do something when you can't, but make sure that you're open to trying. Also make sure that if someone takes the time to teach you something you take really good notes if you know you won't retain it the first time through.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Please know that I am not trying to start any sort of flame war or be offensive in anyway, I am genuinely curious about this (great way to start right?)

You state that you are a gender equalist (the term FYI is egalitarian) but you describe yourself as feminist. Does the inherent contradiction between those two terms, on a purely etymological level, bother you in any way?

Second, you say you are a feminist (but not ""that kind of feminist"") which I completely understand and believe about 85-95% of western women would self identify with the term feminist. However, I am curious to know your level of involvement with feminist organizations and the feminist movement as a whole. The reason I ask is that most women I speak to who identify as feminist don't actually read feminist press or research, and aren't involved with feminist organizations. In fact my mother has always been a huge feminist, having taken part in the major feminist movement in the 60's, but when I showed her the current stances of organizations like NOW, and feminist position papers coming from major women's studies programs, and especially the policies being pushed by the feminist oriented federal departments (such as the white house women's council) particularly the institutionalized discrimination inherent in VAWA, she was disgusted and quickly recognized that so called ""second wave"" feminism held little in common with feminism as it was meant to be. 

I think the Men's Rights Movement is wrongly demonized, a concerted effort by the many feminist organizations out there (though I had to unsub from r/mensrights because it was overrun by PUA and MGTOW types that just fancy up sexism). The men's rights movement has bad apples, no doubt about it, just like feminism has misandrists and female supremecists like the folks who wrote the SCUM manifesto. I personally no longer identify as a men's rights activist but as an egalitarian, though I still believe in nearly all of the men's rights positions, because so many jackasses took to that movement. However, I do think that those women out there who identify as feminist should really take time to explore what feminism really stands for in the modern world.","1346458642"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Actually, I reset my password on a bunch of websites this week. Very few of them reveal whether or not an account exists. Most of them say something similar to ""If an account exists with that email address, a password reset message has been sent"". That same message apears 100% of the time, whether an account doesn't exist.

I don't know if it was brute forced or not. Either they had the credentials or they brute forced my simple 2 dictionary word + 2 digit number password.

I do know that like most people I received a forgot password email first.. then a few hours later saw a login into the GW2 account. 

What I don't understand If they had my password from the beginning, why do the forgot password first? Just use the credentials straight up first like you are suggesting.

All I'm saying is that Arenanet could have done a MUCH better job on making the website and infrastructure triple AAA/best in class.  You need to supply a captcha to just login on the support site. A simple captcha on the website login would have slowed the hackers down quite a bit.  

**Still, the fact that they wrote an amateurish forgot password capability isn't the big deal. My biggest complaint is still on the change email not needing to be confirmed.**  Allowing the email to be changed without confirming it with the old email address pretty much invalidates the need for the email value to be there.. once you have the game credentials, who cares what the email is set to? The hacker can change it to what ever they want.  At that point Arenanets other account security becomes almost worthless (forgot password, and location approval) are worth anything once the email address changes to what the hacker wants...

If there was email address change confirmation... Guess what? The hacker can use my game credentials, and as long as I used different credentials for email, I can undo the hack. At that point it comes down to how fast the hacker can empty the accounts/gold spam.. If I happen to be sitting at the computer playing GW2 when it happens, they would have access to my account for a few minutes, because the hacker CAN'T change the email address, and I can issue a forgot password and then login and force a disconnect.

* 1. Meet Eric online.
* 2. Exchange information, pictures, emails, etc.
* 3. Become Facebook friends (with his fresh account)
* 4. Eric becomes super clingly and weird
* 5. Break off all contact with Eric
* 6. Get a text from an unknown number, ""Disappointed""
* 7. Weeks go by, you're not eating, you're paranoid
* 8. Friends finally convince you to go out, you go to a club
* 9. At the club things start going hazy and you think you see Eric
* 10. You have a seizure
* 11. You wake up in the hospital, Eric is there, says you've been bad, kisses you
* 12. You ""wake up"" again, this time Natalie is freaking out, says a guy was in there (no description of the guy)
* 13. Time goes by, no direct incidents, just creepy stalkery-type stuff
* 14. A couple years later you meet a new boy you really like and decide to go for it
* 15. Next morning and email is sent with pictures of things happening
* 16. Freak outs happen, eventually you go to your police friend who looks around
* 17. You stay at Brad's (police friend's) house to be safe
* 18. Greg, Brad's partner, is acting weird, but they both go back to the police station
* 19. To occupy time, you and Natalie and Tommy snoop around the garage
* 20. In there you find a file with stalkery-type things about Brad's wife
* 21. You show it to Brad's wife and she freaks out
* 22. Tommy sees Brad pull up and tries to sneak up on him
* 23. Brad beats the shit outta tommy
* 24. Brad walks inside
* 25. Hell breaks loose. You freeze and don't process what's going on, a minute later you start to run
* 26. Brad had hit you on the head, knocking you out
* 27. Brad stars attacking his wife
* 28. Dog attacks Brad
* 29. Natalie is able to get out with you and tommy and get in the car to go to the hospital
* 30. You get to the hospital
* 31. Back at Brad's house, the dog is dead, his wife is unconcious, and he and Greg are both missing

A big yellow lopsided ring can look very cheap and will appear to be dull sooner, plus your love is true and this should be a reflection of this. A smaller carat size is modest and appropriate (around .5-1). Also, everyone will ask to see her ring right after she gets it and after you guys get married (congrats by the way) so it is a big deal what others think at first (woman caaaan be judgmental, sorry ladies, it is true) later on, it will be more about what she wants and less about having a show-off ring because she will have it forever, so keep it classic.

By the mid-fifth century there barely *was* a Western Empire, and in 476 they lost Italy entirely, with the Emperor, such as he was, forced into the Balkans.

Overall, the East had *always* been richer than the West.  As an example, in 293 Diocletian divided the Empire in four for ease of administration.  It was the East he kept for himself.  In 330, Constantine, ruling a united empire, moved the capital to Constantinople (then Byzantium.)

Why would Mitt Romney want to be president? Probably because he thinks he deserves to be (http://www.salon.com/2012/01/29/mitt_and_the_white_horse_prophecy/). And yeah, I'm sure money does play a part. If he gets a sympathetic Congress (which, if elected, he will) he gets to cut his tax obligation to practically nothing. 
Also, as to your leftist claims, check out politicalcompass.org. The line between Democrat and Republican is about halfway over on the right side, and they're all about 1/3-2/3 up the authoritarian ladder. 
For reference, these are some things a real socialist would have done, even a mild one. Single payer health care. FDR style public works program to combat unemployment. Termination of oil rig/refinery leases and nationalization of those assets. Nationalization of the banks. None of these things were done. Hell, there wasn't even any prosecution of anybody who got us into this whole economic mess. Obama and the Democratic party are a bunch of corporatists. They just aren't the theocrats that Republicans are. And happy labor day to you as well. Due to working a compressed schedule, 4 10 hour days, I get two free days!","1346458661"

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","&gt; Show me the peer reviewable pacemaker software. It doesn't exist.

That wasn't the question or the point. The point was you were arguing that closed source pacemaker software would inherently be better. Pointing out that all pacemaker software is currently closed just makes your claim more ridiculous, because you don't have any open source pacemaker software to put down.

&gt; the quality of code is no better than the code base I worked on for proprietary software.

But it's not worse? In which case your original argument is still bunk? In any case open source is not a guarantee of quality. But when there's enough interest and thus enough eyeballs on something, it tends to increase the quality. But the project has to attract enough talented devs, which isn't always the case.

Also it looks like Open Source Lab hosts 160 projects... generalizing much?","1346458662"

A none statement, morde can push and deal damage without taking any damage at all

&gt;He can push the lane just as hard as Mordekaiser can.

Very unlikely, even if possible Morde can push that lane and then go away to do wraiths while nautilus will have to stay there autoattacking and morde doesnt even have to auto attack

&gt;His attack animation is almost identical to mordekaiser's and he has more base AD.

You are talking about ap ratios, so who cares?

&gt;His damage is much higher than mordekaisers.

You are a seriously massive idiot.

&gt;He has 4 cc skills, mordekaiser has 0 cc skills.

True but his cc is much less effective when nautilus hasnt built tanky

&gt;He can jungle steal just as well as mordekaiser because of his W.

You're an idiot

&gt;Mordekaiser is just an ultimate, Nautilus actually has good skills other than his R.

What a stupid and meaningless statement.

If I may elaborate for a moment, an emission spectrum is a list of the wavelengths of light emitted when an atom or molecule drops from a higher energy state to a lower one by giving off photons (again, light).  This depends on how much energy was given off - essentially, the difference between the energy states of the atom or molecule involved.  The more energy needs to leave, the more energetic the photon, and the further towards the violet range.

The ability to reflect light is...related, but a different story.

We do have other things we can go by as well; via watching movement and interaction by gravity, we can determine mass, which gives further hints.","1346458666"

My Dad died at the start of summer and it threw my eating habits into a major downward spiral. To top it off, I have tendonitis in BOTH of my ankles from all this weight gain stressing out my feet, so I'm having a hard time moving around. I am now at 246 and I'm 5'7"". My size 16 ""fat days"" jeans are feeling a bit snug around the thighs and it's really not cool, considering I was getting close to going back into a 12.

I lack discipline and motivation when it comes to dieting, and I hate to exercise because I have hyperhidrosis and I really get uncomfortable and embarrassed with how much I sweat. However, I don't want to get surgery on my ankles and I don't want to die from the same diseases Dad ended up developing in his adult life. So I need to get on the program. I'm about to go to Costco and stock up on keto friendly food, so tomorrow is the day I start.

Scenario: Tito Villanova ends up sucking and they sack him, so they bring in someone else, who decides that it is time to change barcelona's style and tactics, they put Messi in a position he doesn't like or they bench him in favor of a more defensive formation.

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Often times, community college courses can give you dual credit with high school and college. Talk to your counselor at high school, and get in touch with an adviser at the community college. You can likely earn your high school diploma with no extra classes. You just need to really have everything planned out. Like exactly which classes you will be taking for the next 2 years, and plans for different colleges you may be accepted into. If you do this right, you can get your high school diploma, associates degree, and 2 years of university completed. If everything goes well, you can transfer as a junior into a 4-year, and snag a degree there, having already completed most of your gen-eds in community college. If you have already done a couple APs, it should be even easier.

I really doubt you would have ANY trouble finding a job if you did this. You just have to be 100% with your decision, and don't look back. Make sure everything is clear and organized early, and that by your second year at community college, you have your high school, college, and university contacts all on the same level of your intent.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So cooks/kitchen managers vs. chefs. To be a cook you need no experience. To be a kitchen manager, you just need cook experience. (think chain restaurant) Chefs are trained, but just a step above cooks. They can have little to average cooking experience. To be a sous chef you need real experience. Executive chef generally requires experience/training and talent.

Actual chefs/sous chefs do fairly well. For reference, i am in DC and a restauranteur. 
Chefs are on the higher end for hourly (10-16/hr), sous chefs are generally salary+bonus (40-60k); executive chefs are slaves (seriously, the only one to ever work more hours than me has been my exec chefs), but fairly well compensated (65-100k + % bonus). These figures are from upscale semi-fine dining non-chain restaurants. 

Becoming a chef is a lot of fucking hard work and tremendous amounts of pressure. Definitely not for everyone. It's a solid love/hate profession if I've ever seen one. 

If you are considering it, find a nice restaurant around you and ask if you can observe because you're trying to figure out your career path. I would fucking LOVE if someone did that in the hospitality industry and I KNOW my chefs would get a kick out of it. It's just an idea! ","1346458695"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","It's pretty much up to the retailer.

When I worked in retail, albeit many moons ago, I would have accepted Bank of Scotland notes. I would have refused Northern Irish notes or Scottish Clydesdale Bank notes.

There is no legal requirement to accept them, and while they are fiat money in an identical sense to Bank of England notes, they are far harder to determine the authenticity of due to their rarity, plus the extra pain in the arse paperwork that was required when cashing up at the end of the day.

A very common saying in Scotland of their bank notes is ""they're legal tender"". Legal tender is a very narrow legal term related to settlement of debt and has little practical bearing on general use of money. 

he acceptability of a bank note is more down to agreements between banks to honour the notes as money, and approval by parliament as legal currency.

Scottish notes are not legal tender anywhere, not even in Scotland. But then, nor are Bank of England notes legal tender in Scotland, while they are in England and Wales. Coins too are only legal tender for certain amounts, to prevent someone trying to settle a £1,000,000 debt with 100,000,000 1p coins then using the defence ""Well I tried to pay but they refused"" when taken to court.","1346458699"

Looks like you're using Terro baits, which are great for Argentine ants.  However, if your infestation is severe, the Terro baits have too high a concentration of poison.

Avoid disturbing the ants (so NO SPRAYING) and let the baits do all the work.  You want to encourage the ants to feed on the bait while mitigating colony budding.

Here's my 2 cents: I have about 250 all resist right now with 28K life and I use prismatic armor-so I can definitely take a few hits (though not many). I used to have an all life regen gear set (it was also about 1300) up until I got to some of the higher levels. I found that without some resist, it didn't matter how fast I could regenerate health because I couldn't avoid some of the damage in the first place. I'm trying to get my resist up to about 350-400, but I'm thinking some life regen would be helpful, especially for reflect damage elites and to heal when I'm kiting. Maybe its a matter of just finding the right ratio. For what its worth, many of the top builds (the ones that were linked in a previous post) seem to just stack all res as high as possible; none of them had life regen though. ","1346458719"
"REDDITORSINRECOVERY","t5_2rdsb","Al-Anon, check it out there are lots of people there dealing with the same issues you are..... You may just have to end the relationship, because your friend is an addict, she will use everyone and everything around her until its gone, she dies, or winds up on the streets or prison.  If she doesn't want to get better (sounds like she doesn't) she is going to repeat this scenario with you and you will repeatedly feel shitty. 

I'm sorry if this is a little harsh, I'm older and have seen lived ruined from drugs, including myself. In prison there are so many heartbreaking tales of drunks who accidentally killed a motorcyclist, or a heroin addict gets 30 years for accidentally overdosing a friend.
Hooking up with a stranger in a bar leads to felony sexual assault charges, or a fight outside a bar leads to attempted murder charges. 
many of these people have no criminal record, but the US justice system is a cruel hateful place with little or no mercy on addicts. 

you may thing ""that only happens to other people"" well, I thought so too. SHe has using friends and they will eventually win out if she is already slipping. this is a pretty common scenario. she may need to do 30 days in jail to realize how serious the issue is. Using friends arent really friends, because eventually drugs are the reason and are more important than the relationships.

I Googled for helplines in California and found this: http://www.youthcrisisline.org/ . Such programmes tend to be anonymous, unless they believe you are in danger (in which case it is against the law for them to not tell the police. Remember that they on your side - they will place your personal safety above all.)

There is a whole list of California-based helplines here: http://someonehelpedmehelps.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/crisis-helplines-in-california/ if you ever need a shelter or further advice in the future.

But please please please don't kill yourself. You are important to so many people in the world, and as you get older and meet more you will be important to those people too. You are the most important person in your life right now. The fact you are here shows you want your own mind and your own future, like many young atheists in your position. Persevere, and you'll have it someday.

However, for now, if your mum is going to take it badly, don't even bother. Stick through it (unless, as I said, your personal safety and freewill is seriously threatened, in which case GET HELP!!!) When you pray, be it in the temple or at home, rather than praying to a god, why not just reflect on the things you like about life. Reflect on the knowledge that one day, you can do whatever you want and believe whatever you want.

There may be online ex-Sikh groups out there. You may want to ask for more advice there if you haven't already.

Your body is all solids and liquids, which are incompressible, so as long as the pressure changes aren't too rapid or not evenly distributed, you'll be fine.  The problem is the gas pressure in your lungs, you have to keep breathing more and more highly compressed air to keep the pressure even.  Eventually they have to add other gasses into the mix to keep it from being toxic (oxygen will kill you once it gets to a high enough concentration).  And at some point, no matter how they mix it, the gas mix will be so compressed that it becomes too 'thick' for you to even keep breathing it in and out.  That limit is somewhere WAY past 9 atmospheres, though.  The current record for saturation diving is like 70 atmospheres, I believe.

EDIT: also, while researching that, I learned that there's a low pressure limit we can survive, too - 0.0618 atmospheres.  Any lower pressure than that and all the exposed liquids in your body will begin to boil away and you'll die.","1346458737"

Basically, his parents were away and left him to look after the family dog, so he decided to throw a house party. Lots of his friends came and the place was buzzing. Everyone was drinking, having a good time. 

Anyway, this friend was still relatively young and wasn't accustomed to drinking much, but that didn't deter him from drinking beer after beer, shot after shot, with no foreknowdledge of how fucked-up alcohol can make you.

He continued this until he passed out on the cream leather sofa in the living room, once everyone had left. Sometime during the night, he had an accident.

In the morning, when he woke up, there was shit on the sofa. Human shit. No matter how hard he wiped, how much bleach or cleaner he used, the stain would not go away. 

After hours of scrubbing and no joy, his parents came back, saw the sofa and asked him what had happened. Feeling embarassed he replied, ""It was the dog.""

All is forgotten and the family relax. The friend calms down and thinks he's gotten away scot-free. He wakes up the next morning to serenity - mum making breakfast, dad on the sofa reading a paper. Something is wrong. Something is missing. He asks his dad where the dog is...

""...I had it put down. If it had such problems, then it was the humane thing to do.""

The PLQ has a horrible track record. The only reason why I'd vote for them is because they're the only party that is committed to Federalism. To be honest, I have little hope for this province as a whole, and I'm ready to settle for a vote of ""just don't make it worse.""

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Here is a link to a detailed discussion about what is legal for nannies... [Nannies and the Fair Labor Standards Act.](http://www.nannynetwork.com/library/Parentlib/flsa.cfm)
Some highlights

* ""live in"" nannies must be paid at least minimum wage for each hour actually worked, but need not receive overtime pay no matter how many hours they work. 
* The law permits the reasonable cost or fair value of meals, lodging or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer and which are primarily furnished for the benefit of the employee, to be considered as wages. 

So, if minimum wage is $8 and assuming a 40 hour week with no overtime that would be $320.  Room &amp; Board is certainly worth at least $20 per week, so, yeah.  Its legal.

But, lets face it, room &amp; board would certainly be more than that for you - lets assume $150 / week (which would probably still be low), with an eight hour day it is closer to $11.25 an hour.  

I guess it depends on what you are looking for and if you can find a better offer.","1346458747"

I wasn't really planning on hiding anything, and now that I think about it there isn't really anything specific I was looking for.  Because I'm bi (so I've been with girls) and pretty cis-gendered, I have a lot of straight guy friends who just assumed I was straight and I'm used to explaining that part to people as it is best to get that out of the way quickly.  I just figured maybe from someone who has reservations about it (like OP) I could gain some insight into what makes him uncomfortable in the first place.

&gt; Obviously I'm not an authority on this, but from what I know of straight guys this is not true.

Not trying to be an asshole, but this is pretty sexist (and the whole reason /r/mensrights exists).  Much of this thread is spent explaining how a homosexual male would not flirt with, harass, or attempt to have sex with a heterosexual male who has no attraction to the homosexual male.  I don't see why you think a straight male would not have the same restraint or respect for another person's lack of sexual interest.  But more on topic, the idea of increased familiarity (after a certain point) leading to lesser sexual attraction is a psychological concept usually used to describe how heterosexual siblings of opposite sexes who have grown up together usually do not feel sexual attraction, because they have been together for so much time that they no longer see each other as potential mates.","1346458749"

His/her job isn't just teaching your kid 2+2, it's keeping that child safe. And if your child is in danger, the immediate answer isn't always ""Be better parent and make your kid change schools."" That teacher needs to step up and discipline the trouble makers. Separate them, monitor them, whatever the hell it takes to make things right.

On the plus side, he actually does have foot retention and he's using a frame with horizontal dropouts. Also he's not running aerospokes, which is something you see a lot with these expensive conversions. I've seen much, much worse on group rides in LA.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Well I think vagueness and subjectivity of such a word is at the root of the problem.  I agree that players who took advantage of it knew what they were doing.  I don't think their intent was to damage the economy, though they surely would have if the problem wasn't fixed.  I don't agree with the policy of banning them for a mistake that ANet made though.  

In Diablo 3 there was an exploit where you could make way more gold simply by stacking gold finding gear and destroying jars in a certain area of the map over and over.  It was really boring but was the best way to make gold at the time.  I did this for about a week off and on before it was patched.  The Chinese botters were ruining the economy because they could do it 24/7 with hundreds of accounts.  They were subsequently banned but not because of the exploit.  They were banned for botting.  Blizzard didn't ban anyone for manually taking advantage of this gold making situation, they fixed it.  I think Anet would have been better served handling the matter in a similar way.

I was thinking about running Tsukyoumi, but honestly haven't gotten around to testing it.

Plus Scapegoat is one of my personal all-time favorite cards)

As for my Scrapyard, I'm keeping it at 2 for now, because I tend to use 1 for actual searching, and the other for Summoner Monk, as it's the only material I use on monk. Are DARK decks still big this format? Because if not, I'm going to remove my Shad-Imprisoning' and maybe add a Tsukyoumi.

However, it's not perfect. The way it works is that a property of the player called onGround is set to false when a player is airborn, nocheat can detect this and if after 5 seconds it's not back to true, player gets kicked. Water fucks this up, if a player is in contact with a block, onGround is always true. This means a player can enable flying on the surface of the water and it's a bit faster than bobbing in the water as normal.

Conflict resolution, participating in extra curricular activities with their peers, having a sense of belonging, interaction with other adults and kids are all help whether they go straight to work or go to college. 

Kids aren't prepared going to college as it is, it's only worse when they are home schooled.  They need to be put in circumstances where they are pressured but have your support.

The idea that science is proof however and not just a collection of evidence and logical systems is fundamentally misguided and even worse, it's misleading.

You're equivocating a lot, here. The word ""science"" can refer either to the best method available for telling ""that which is an accurate description of reality"" from ""that which is *not* an accurate description of reality"", or to the scientific consensus established by said method but open to further modification.

If I may quote Isaac Asimov:

&gt;men's bodies are for utility, its for getting around. Like a jeep. It's art vs chaos

If this were true, how do you explain societies such as ancient Greece, where the male form was glorified as the ultimate ideal of beauty? It's all cultural.

In any case, I think it is important to make a distinction between passing Step I and doing *well* on Step I. In point of fact around 94% of US MD students will pass the test on the first try. However, the exact number of your score determines where you can do residency, which I think is important to note. Strong match lists can grant bragging rights to a med school. I have not yet read anything that suggests that after a 28 on the MCAT everyone scores about the same on Step I.

However, regardless of whether or not the MCAT is a good predictor of board/school performance I think we can all accept that a higher score correlates with a higher acceptance rate going by the AMCAS data which is what is important for those trying to get in.","1346458803"

The presumption isn't that men have better things to do. The presumption is that men are inherently incapable of taking care of children or that, if they choose to, it is so they can abuse them. The idea that American society can only discriminate against men under the premise that it thinks so highly of them that it assumes they have better things to do is ridiculous when considered in context of child custody. Men aren't kept from custody because they have better things to do, it is because they are disposible and their role can be replaced with money.

In my 12 years experience I've never met any who I would consider a good linux sysadmin that didn't use linux as their only desktop for 5+ years.

No, it actually is true. There are Linux admins that don't need to use a desktop in order to administer Linux systems. It's not necessary to model your choice of desktop system to the environment you administer.

This actually reads like, you dismiss anyone who *doesn't* use Linux as their desktop for 5+ years as a good linux sysadmin. Why 5+ years? Also, what exactly are they ""good"" at?

Linux environments come in different sizes. It could be an office environment with a single server hidden in a closet. Or it could be multiple datacenters running clusters of Linux servers using custom distributions and software (ala Google). Skills mastered in one environment don't necessarily translate to another.

Why is that different with desktop Linux, especially when introductory knowledge, familiarity, and mastership of Linux/UNIX can be acquired from actual administration, test/dev servers, remote shells, mentorship, etc.?","1346458809"

Otherwise you're watching security camera footage, which is just... ugh. There's a reason they pay people to do that job.","1346458810"
"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Funny thing is that I lost money and karma when buying those weapons, I was testing out if there exists possible rare mats when you scavenge gold items. I lost around 15 silver and 2000 karma to get like 100 woods. But Anet doesn't give a shit, they assume I exploited hard using mystic forge (I didn't even know it existed before) and didn't even check my currency. I have like 1 gold being lvl 48 which is quite low Imo. Yet i've been perma banned too. Even if they had to ban some people, and I don't mean perma ban - hell no it's their mistake they should pay the consequences themselves, why didn't they check who actually made tons of profit that day? or who actually used mystic forge countless times? Can't they check who used mystic forge? Ofc they can, they can even check if EVERYONE has deleted the stuff they obtained through the exploit. How are they gonna do that? Are they going to compare your items with what you had before the exploit was on? What about the loot/gold I got on the side? This whole thing is bullshit, in the end I assume a handful of people knew about the mystic forge, a handful of them actually tried hard to get something valuable through it, and a handful of them actually got something interesting. No they didn't consider that. They put ONE PERSON online the whole time on reddit to answer to us, and they took their time showing it as an example all around, but they can't make one guy take 20mn to check if item prices are correct. How long would it take to do it anyway? How long did it take Anet to hotfix the item prices btw? More than anything, WHERE ARE THE EXCUSES? Yeah hear me Anet, you banned my precious GW account that is so old, that holds so much memories, you got me banned for the first time of my life just because you can't set up an npc properly, and you tell me I ""have a second chance"" ? Wth I don't remember ever having the intention to exploit the game. You're just putting almost free weapons IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOWN FULL OF PEOPLE and ban them for getting those weapons. You disabled mails and auction house right? Why didn't you disable mystic forge? Ain't it some other stupid mistake that WE are paying for?

You'll be 100 crit chance till lvl 40+ and will obliterate all the ennemies alone. Will I get banned for this?
Will I get banned for wall jumping and getting access to a chest your not supposed to access this way? If I log out and in to transfer in overflow to loot a chest twice, will you ban me too? Don't blame players that simply play your game. ","1346458810"

&gt; Why is it their unyielding position that they had to have some increases?

Hmm. I would think any adult would know this. Let me explain it to you in terms a child can understand since any adult should already know this... You see there are two parties. One party is a big fan of people helping themselves out. They believe they shouldn't have to help out others that are in need. So, they don't like it when the government takes a small amount of their money (this is called taxes). The other party believes that we are a society and we should help each other. So, they like it when government takes a small amount of their money to help out everyone else.

Now, that you understand the two ideologies, Democrats wanted some revenue increases. The Republicans refused all revenue increases. Democrats wanted fewer cuts. The Republicans demanded massive cuts. The Democrats ceded massive cuts, the Republicans failed to cede revenue increases.

The reason we got downgraded, as given by the people that downgraded us was their belief that our government has become increasingly dysfunctional to the point that one side would hold the entire country hostage to win an argument.

Finally, the tax increases the Democrats demanded weren't immediate tax increases. They were delayed tax increases that wouldn't have started until after the recession was over.","1346458815"

Because these are most likely Argentine ants, disturbing the nest will only worsen the problem as it will cause the colon(ies) to bud and form new colonies.  Argentine ants are real nuisance and incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to eradicate.  The best control of Argentine ants are liquid sugar baits, and if the infestation is really severe, you'll need a concentration of poison that is much lower than what is commercially available.

"audiobooks","t5_2qqq5","The process of recording an audio book has changed a great deal over the years, for me personally and for the industry at large. When I first started recording audio books, I always had the luxury of being able to read the entire book beforehand, and then I would go to a recording studio and work with an engineer and a director, and the director was almost always the producer as well. These days I record all the books I do by myself in my home studio, acting as producer, director, engineer, and narrator all in one. But even many of those who record in studios in NYC now rarely get more than one person to work with, so the engineer is also the director for them. I almost never get to read the book before I record now, however I've developed some tricks to help me prepare. And I've never been one to mark pages with notes unless there were pronunciation issues, but I have a friend who literally marks every syllable that gets emphasis so that he can turn his brain off and just “read the music” for the recording sessions. That part of the process is different for everyone, it's just up to personal preference.

One major difference in the way we do things now is the recording process itself; now they almost exclusively do what they call “pickup” recording, or “punch and roll”. That means that when you screw up, flub a word, mispronounce something, or just make a weird noise, the engineer stops the recording, goes back to a spot just before the screw up, and “punches you in” at that spot. Saves time on the editing later. Used to be that they would just let it roll, and if I mess up I just go back and they edit it later. Some narrators prefer to work with pickups, but I feel that it interrupts the flow of things and makes the recording take much longer. 

As far as remembering voices, I rarely forget what voice I've chosen for a character, but a good engineer will mark the spot where a new character comes in so you can reference it later. There's always a reason that I pick a particular voice for a character, and I think what makes it easy for me to remember is the accompanying attitude or even the face that I make when I do the voice. It's impossible to do Earl Harbinger from the Monster Hunter series without a scowl on my face.","1346458843"

This subreddit is an anarchist space.  ""If anybody doesn't like what I used my authority to do, then that is their problem"" is not a valid argument, being essentially equivalent to ""I have power therefore I can do whatever I want with impunity"".

If this subreddit instituted a policy of regularly rotating logos that gave equal time to gender/LGBT issues, race issues, economic issues, environmental issues, etc. then I'd have no problem with that.  Since that is not the case, this is a clear mod abuse of power, forcefully directing the subreddit towards their pet causes simply because they have the authority to do so.

Speaking out against this abuse of power usually gets labelled a ""manarchist"" (which I assure you is hilariously off the mark in this case) and/or downvoted into oblivion, which is fallacious bullshit.

LDRs aren't easy and they aren't ideal, but they work if both of you want it to. Don't get blackout drunk and don't put yourself in cuddly proximity to a lady.

&gt;And of course the thought of how ridiculous it seems to stay committed to someone for several months after only knowing them for six weeks comes across my mind.

As it should. Sounds like you both jumped on board for the relationship idea while your hormones were still exploding. My personal recommendation is to talk to her about putting the relationship on hold or opening it up until you get back, though you need to decide if the potential for a relationship with this girl is worth risking over 5 months of partying with girls you may or may not get to have sex with.","1346458862"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Someone who has a penis cannot, ever, experience pregnancy (a serious issue for many women with said organs). Sure, lives are changed if a partner gets pregnant. At the end of the day, though, the partner who contributed the sperm can leave. They may have to write a monthly check (a whole different can of worms), but they aren't pregnant and facing the suite of emotions and physical complications that go with it. They don't feel social pressure to do a certain thing about the pregnancy (terminate? Carry? Adopt?), or to act a certain way (do yoga, don't lift weights, do stay at work, don't stay in school) for the duration. They don't *have* to get the stares, the judgement, the uninvited ""advice.""


So, yeah, their life can change. Acknowledged and embraced! But they always have the choice to wash their hands of the affair (sans financially, sometimes, but that's a different problem). The pregnant party doesn't. They either terminate or carry to term. If they carry then they raise another human being or they give their child away. None of those is the same as just not being pregnant. 


And, yes, the non-pregnant partner may choose to remain with the pregnant partner. That can come with serious baggage, no question about it. But it still isn't the same. Potentially horrifying, potentially awesome, potentially earth-shattering, but it absolutely is not the same. ","1346458862"

I also don't think they have a focal character. In season 1&amp;2 the focal character was Sid. He was basically the fly on the wall that would hint at everyone else's opinions. In season 3 we had Effy. She was the thing everyone had in common. Season 4 stops focal points.

Dodging was not a problem as the attacks were telegraphed by most of the bosses and I personally had no problem seeing the red circles.

I think the whole point of these dungeons is that they are supposed to be a challenge ad like much of the game it comes down to the skill of the player and group. For instance take The Lovers boss, when they are close to each other they are much stronger and heal themselves so you have to split the two of them up using the boulders on the floor and then take down the girl so she cannot heal.","1346458880"

"circlebroke","t5_2tnz9","I'm genuinely confused here. My understanding of events doesn't include anything *that* bad (where ""that"" refers to the level of badness you appear to see). I'm going to review the events as I see them and if you would please tell me which is (are) the bad one(s). 

1. Destiny talks in chat with two friends about BlueTea. 

I assume this is okay. 

2. Destiny shares opinion BlueTea is ugly. 

Is this bad?  It sounds mean, but also sounds like discussion among friends. 

3. Destiny shares naked photo(s) of BlueTea with friends. 

This is the only part I personally feel has badness to it (so far). This badness isn't that much though. Can we call it 20 badness?

4. BlueTea reads Destiny's chat history because she knows his password. 

This is kind of bad - right? Invasion of privacy etc, but she is curious and maybe infatuated so it is understandable. 5 badness. 

5. BlueTea gets angry, changes passwords and shares dick pictures to twitter. 

This is also kind of bad, right?  Totally understandable because she is mad and has the power to do it, but not really justified at all. The reaction is out of scale to the provocation but also it is in retailiation to provocation so it becomes more acceptable. I'd place the badness at between 10-40. 

6. Nobody apologizes about anything. 

You and others seem upset - but I don't see why. Destiny didn't hurt you, why would he apologize to you?  If you think he should apologize to BlueTea for breaking her trust - that is your opinion, but it only describes one possible resolution. Another is that they won't like each other any more and that seems fine too. 



Okay, that ends my timeline. Both people did things that are minorly bad. Big deal?  Not really. Personally, I can't see this meriting more than a ""Heh"" from anyone. As a post mortem: it is wrong to share naked photos and Destiny is an idiot for letting BlueTea know his password and BlueTea is an idiot for expecting Destiny to act respectfully towards her. Destiny is habbitually disrespectful to everyone, which may make him a worse person, but it doesn't seem to have particular bearing on these events. ","1346458882"

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","You don't tell her. You ask her on a date. That tells her that you are interested in her as more than friends, and it helps her to let you know by her response. If she says yes to the date, then she is interested in trying more than friends, and if she says no then she's not.

The problem with an out-pouring of feelings is that it's kind of unfair. If she is not interested, you don't give her a graceful exit. For example, if you ask her on a date and she says no, that's kinda crappy, but not a huge deal. However, if you tell her all about your feelings and how great you think she is, you *make* her destroy you if she wants to say no. Give her a tactful exit.

Another reason it's a bad idea is that if she is just *somewhat* interested, but sees you as being suuuuper interested, she will feel like it's an uneven situation and be put off by it. Thus, you never even get the first date that can allow feelings to begin to develop.

Whereas, if you just ask her on a date and she is somewhat interested, she might say ""sure, why not"". Then if she has fun and you guys have chemistry, you go for a second date, and maybe feelings develop. But that opportunity never comes if you put it all out there before you even know if she has moderate feelings for you.

"anime","t5_2qh22","That pretty much means that they weren't popular enough.

Anime and manga are luxury goods in a niche market. they get imported, translated, and in some cases, fancied up. And generally speaking, they're expensive products. US Anime and Manga *have* learned to deal with piracy for the most part. Crunchyroll exists and a good number of Bandai titles are licensed through crunchyroll. (And pretty much everything new on CR ends up getting licensed by Sentai nowadays). Viz has had a partnership with Hulu for a while. Funimation has set up their own streaming service as well. Aniplex really buys into the luxury good idea and makes their products really expensive, but with a lot of perks. NIS America goes for a lower-end version of what Aniplex does.

Manga is different, naturally, but it really depends on fanbase. If the gintama and reborn fanbase don't like the respective manga enough to purchase, that sucks. On the other hand, there are other fanbases, like with Wandering Son (a niche manga on a niche topic for a niche within a niche) that gets published, hardcover, and by and indie publisher.

You can rage all you want, but most anime and manga companies have adapted to piracy, and companies have been successful despite it. You really can't expect every series to be popular enough to continue English publication.

Edit: bandai itself actually just plans on licensing out its titles. Sentai already released K-On! Season 2 for example

For the interested Capitalists here, NO, the civil unrest does not mean, they hate the system and want to be democratic. Look at democratic countries, they have many unrests and all that too. However, the system of the two processes are different and how you deal with unrest is thus different. Communism unrest at higher levels is generally more violent as the Communist governments are generally more ""volaitle"" than Democratic ones but small civil unrest generally doesn't happen in Communist ones in the cases of staging protests and arguing laws that Democratic ones have to constantly deal with.

The CPC has only learned of imo half of what the USSR failed at. Many things, it is still learning from the USSR and America today. IT does not have world wide news coverage control as the U.S holds nor does it know how to always effectively handle international situations to better them in the international eye.

Overal, the CPC government is seen as an eyesore and fake Communism by the hardline full communists on /r/communism and I can see exactly why. The only problem is that, I am a realist. Communist China and Democratic U.S.A are such parallel mimics of each other that it's not even funny.

"Connecticut","t5_2qji0","The 1990 Supreme Court case *Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz* determined that sobriety checkpoints are constitutional in a 6 - 3 decision. Furthermore these criteria have been laid out by the Department of Transportation.

* Decision making must be at a supervisory level, rather than by officers in the field.
* A neutral formula must be used to select vehicles to be stopped, such as every vehicle or every third vehicle, rather than leaving it up the officer in the field.
* Primary consideration must be given to public and officer safety.
* The site should be selected by policy-making officials, based upon areas having a high incidence of drunk driving.
* Limitations on when the checkpoint is to be conducted and for how long, bearing in mind both effectiveness and intrusiveness.
* Warning lights and signs should be clearly visible.
* Length of detention of motorists should be minimized.
* Advance publicity is necessary to reduce the intrusiveness of the checkpoint and increase its deterrent effect.

However I just want so say I agree with the dissenting Justice Brennan ""That stopping every car might make it easier to prevent drunken driving...is an insufficient justification for abandoning the requirement of individualized suspicion"" ","1346458887"

Don't tape the bags closed.

I remember BR saying in an interview that everyone needs to chip in with goals. That's something that he will build into the team with the players' movement off the ball. Train them to get into scoring positions, kind of like how we saw Stevie set up a shot for Shelvey in the last game against Hearts.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Well, first of all, without standardized rule sets for cities and with localized cultures, politics and decision making, protectionism and rapid expansion would be a thing of the past. A growing enterprise would be forced to adapt to an entirely different set of laws and an entirely different culture if it were to expand into the next city. I also see decentralization as the greatest way to bring about the innovation of an open market to our political processes. Every city would be attempting different methods of governing, different methods of taxation, different methods and levels of governmental involvement.

Just like in an open market, poorly designed and implemented ideas would fizzle and great ideas would flourish.

The relationship between a citizen and his political process would change drastically. Your mayor could potentially be your neighbor, and you would be capable of bringing an idea into the political process.

Experimentation would be what defines decentralization. If a city chooses to allow (hypothetically if a Walmart were able to even form) a Walmart to build in it, and the standard of living of the next city were to decline, then the next city wouldn't allow it to build, or would impose tougher regulations developed directly from the cities locals.


It would be easier to implement change as well.","1346458904"

I really don't think there was complete justification in firing LaPo, but it seems as though most GM's get to fire one head coach before it's their head. I agree, Buono is right on the mark. Actually, when listening to that interview it seems like he has a lot more to say but is holding back because it is a small league and tact is everything.

I think that there is more justification to firing LaPo than there was to the Marshall firing last season. LaPo had a losing record over two-and-a-half seasons, whereas Marshall was a brand-new head coach. Even though I don't agree with the decision or timing of the LaPolice firing (given this past off season) I've got hopes that Burke can lead a turn-around.

"AskModerators","t5_2uwjj","Funny story, actually. I had lurked for over a year before I finally decided to make an account so I could customize my front page. After that, I made very few contributions to reddit for quite some time. A comment here, a comment there, nothing getting more than 10 or 15 karma, iirc.

At some point I began spending more &amp; more time on the site, delving deeper into niche subreddits, but at the same time still reading the defaults regularly. I was fascinated by the patterns that I found in front-page submissions. I noticed that certain key words or phrases in post titles gave it an extra advantage. Once I started to really examine what sort of submissions were reaching the front page day after day, it became almost trivial to duplicate. I began to submit articles, videos and images that I thought would be successful on reddit, and my link karma began to grow. It was almost like I was playing a reddit RPG and earning experience points. Basically, I was a huge karmawhore who gamed reddit for his own amusement. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? ;)

Meanwhile, I had noticed a rather polarizing figure known as /u/violentacrez. I was in awe of his massive link karma, not to mention the fact that he moderated more than 200+ subreddits. I was daunted at the prospect of moderating a *single* subreddit, let alone 200+. I thought to myself, ""How the fuck did he end up moderating so many subreddits?"" Then I realized - he created most of them himself. He was always very vocal about the fact that subreddit creators are essentially kings in their kingdoms, and can pretty much do whatever they want when it comes to the direction of their subreddit, something that has stuck with me ever since. That's when I decided to try my hand at creating subreddits.

The first subreddit I created was a complete flop, I attempted to create a spinoff subreddit for the ""You can't explain that!"" O'Reilly memes, if anyone can remember those. I named it /r/canyouexplainthat. I've since stepped down as a mod, and that subreddit hasn't had a new submission in 10 months, but I remember being absolutely fucking **thrilled** when I managed to get it to 100 subscribers. 100 different people thought that *my* subreddit was interesting enough to click ""subscribe."" It was just fantastic.

After a little trial and error, combined with my increasing frustration at the direction that /r/pics was heading at the time (deeper and deeper into memes &amp; facebook screenshot land), I stumbled upon /r/SpacePorn, and absolutely loved the name. I had heard of the term ""food porn"" on the travel channel, and ""space porn"" was just extremely appropriate for the beautiful images featured in that subreddit. It occurred to me that a subreddit devoted to beautiful landscapes might be successful. So, I created /r/EarthPorn, then /r/CityPorn followed soon after, I asked to join the moderation team over at /r/SpacePorn, and thus the SFWPorn Network was born. More than a year later, there are more than 40 subreddits in the network, and /r/EarthPorn now has almost 150,000 subscribers.

I moderate more than 100 subreddits, many of which I created myself, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. I'm always thinking of potential new subreddits. Creating a new community and watching it bloom out of nothing is just such an amazing thing that I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it.","1346458906"

Ao harrasses with autoattack, does almost no damage, I level and hit him with my 3, he is slowed and takes 1/4 to 1/2 his life in damage from my 3 alone. My minion s also attacking him, I either score a kill or force him to B, he falls behind, even if he buys beads, i throw 3 on him then land a stun and ult, he beads, doesn't matter dead anyways, now I'm fed, GG. Also his tower usually is down by the 3rd or 4th wave because of him having to B. Don't use anecdotal evidence as an argument, it doesn't make for a good argument.

The nice thing is I am also pretty tall (6'3"") so we can work in together when squatting and overhead pressing on the rack.

Strength is something that takes a long time to build, you will get some so called ""n00b gains"" at the beginning, but that's only for a couple months.  You won't get jacked overnight so I wouldn't worry about it.  Lifting is by far the best thing you can do for weight loss.

Here is my lifting routine
Mon
Bench or Press 2x5, 1x5+ (alternates every workout)
Weighted Chins 3x3 or EZ bar curl 2x10-15 (alternates every workout)
Squat 2x5, 1x5+

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","His taunt ability is mostly a utility skill, meaning it is a very useful skill, both defensive and offensive.  It can help you dash through walls and escaping ganks.  On the other hand, it is a powerful ability that can help you initiate fights successfully.

Shen is meant to be built as a tank.  Often times, Shen initiates the fight by dashing in with the taunt.  And in the few moments that everyone is autoattacking Shen, the rest of the team should jump in and focus down the carries.  Taunt in this game is very powerful when used correctly.

Shen is known for his R ability, which in layman's terms is ""OK OK I got him!  He's almost dead.  Just a few more - OH SHIT SHIT BACK THE FUCK AWAY""

If you time it correctly, you can R -&gt; e combo to save your carry from imminent doom and to maybe even help him score a kill.  When you're ulting in to save someone, your combo should look like: R-&gt;W-&gt;E-&gt;Q for maximum awesomeness that is Shen.

For Shen, I normally put what I put on any tank, unless the game asks for a different build (i.e. your enemy AP mage is getting fed, too much cc, etc.).  But a simple Merc treads + Warmogs + Visage + FoN + Atmas + Randuin seems to always work.","1346458914"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Explain to me how gitmo is ""more complicated"" than that.  I'm sick of this argument, Obama gets into office and suddenly none of the shit he said means anything because it's ""more complicated""
He could have closed Gitmo permanently and he didn't.  
Obama probably should have taken ques from Bush in actually leading when he had control of both houses; instead he spent 09-10 pandering to Republicans and getting predictable results.  
Lets talk about DREAM for a minute.  I know a dude who has been working on that campaign since it started.  He came to my university in 08 immediately after Obama was elected, full of hope etc.  The past 4 years have seen nothing but stonewalling from the federal government on this issue.
Once again, Obama squandered any chance of doing anything with that issue.  He issued a temporary stay of deportations, but DREAM is far from a reality, and its ridiculous that its taken this long to even get where we are on it.  You will find many in the DREAM activist community who are fed up with Obama to no end.
Yes, I know what's in the stimulus bill.  I watched every time that its initial promise was whittled down by Obama's conciliatory nature, to the extent that many of its core programs were cut.  The initial idea of government employment ala- FDR never even got close to making it.  
We still have no meaningful regulation of wall street.  Any attempts are fool-hardy as long as the revolving door between washington and the financial sector continues.  The response of Obama in particular to the LIBOR fiasco and the damning evidence against the financial sector in general that emerged in subsequent trials is fairly astonishing as well.   
Meanwhile, we have an administration that, like bush, lies about civilian casualties in iraq/afghanistan(remember the promise of ""open"" government), and continues to perpetuate illegal drone strikes in sovereign nations.  Its funny how the left was enraged about this under Bush but gives obama a pass because... why?  
No, Obama is not the -same- as Bush, but his policies and those of his party in general, as evidenced by the last 20 or so years, are not enough to justify voting for him and expecting a different result.  Both parties are pretty firmly dedicated to maintaining the status quo.  ","1346458917"

&gt; Do the worries have any validity? 

No. It's clearly _well_ within FCC rules, as it says. And given that you're surrounded on a daily basis by other appliances broadcasting in the same frequency range, at much higher power, it shouldn't be a priority even if you're paranoid. The article [2] doesn't even list any actual concerns, it gives the [anecdotal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence) account of one person, reporting diffuse and easily-imagined 'symptoms'. 

Similar to the ones that have been reported many other times in relation to all sorts of devices and which have been investigated many times, and where the effects invariably fail to reproduce themselves when actual double-blind tests are done where the test subjects no longer have knowledge of whether the device is on or off or not.

The blood-pressure thing is plain silly. It's hardly news that _worrying_ about something will increase your blood pressure. Thinking that this proves you were right to worry is an unusually clear-cut example of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).

With a very deep league though say 19 player rosters then it can be worth it.  You'd be surprised how many extra points you can get when you get a D in the NFC West and AFC South and play match-ups.  It you have bonuses for points allowed and/or yards you can get extra points.  Also, some leagues make you pay for transactions, and pay out for wins, If this is the case it's hard to pay for just one week so you may want to draft one.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","when the master was revealed in series 3 and 4, he spoke of the timelords being able to choose their names. the master chose his and the doctor, his. the psychologists had a field day with both of them.

the doctor looked into the vortex and ran away

the next thing we know for certain is the doctor stole a tardis and ran away.

the sontarans said the doctor ""led the battle in the last great time war""

the people of the forest have no word for doctor, but they do for Warrior; in french it is a very similar word actually. warrior is Guerrier, where in french and very old welsh the surname Guérin means to watch or guard.

i'd hypothesize based on the latter evidence that the question is more of the sort ""doctor, who will you guard"" or like ""who will you stand for"" to which his answer inevitably is earth.

the doctor (as the leader of the war effort of the time war) slips on a second type of Genesis arch, which gives him a different Timelord Persona instead of a human one. he is now protector of all Earth for all Time against the Daleks and all things related to the time war. this is why he can't go back.","1346458927"

House has much better insulation once I get the house up passed 68 degrees which only takes an hour. I can turn all the heat off and it will stay above 68 for a day just have to turn the ceiling fan on to re circulate the heat. Propane costs me less than electric and is more efficient than diesel only problem is the byproduct of combustion is water so I've made a couple dehumidifiers.

/r/howtoquitreddit

The problem when you quit something that was a habit or that was a large part of how you defined yourself, is coming up with something to replace it. The only way to do this is by trying everything and anything, this is the only way to know if you like something or not. No offence to gamers, but it won't bring you long term happiness. Socialising, interacting with people, volunteering, real life experiences, those give you long term happiness. Sharing your life with people, being accepted, and accepting others brings you happiness. The problem online and in video games is the inability to perceive the other people as real people, and will continue to mark the way in which the community interacts with each other.

Many people who have an addictive personality will switch between gaming, the internet, porn, and substance abuse to feed their addiction. When one becomes boring, it's easier to switch to something else you're addicted to instead of examining your addiction or looking at why you are addicted.

Many people who have addictive personalities do so as a means of escapism, so that they don't have to deal with the real life problems or examine what it is about their lives that is leaving them wanting more. The problem with addiction is that it never really fills the void, it's a temporary fix that will always leave you wanting more or looking elsewhere to fill it.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","Here are seven things Obama SHOULD apologize for ...

1) For lying to the American people: Calling a politician a liar is a bit like accusing a fish of being fond of water, but even amongst politicians, Barack Obama is a particularly hamfisted and prolific liar. Obama’s strategy is simple: He promises everything to everybody and then points the finger elsewhere when people are inevitably disappointed. This has led to some jaw dropping whoppers than would even make Bill Clinton say, “Wow, that guy is a shameless liar.”

Obama promised not to hire lobbyists and not to raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 per year. He would post every bill online before he signed it and he promised to negotiate health care reform publicly — those are all lies. Then after going on the biggest spending spree in American history, Obama turned around on a dime and talked about how important deficit reduction was to him. He lied about health care. You can go on and on with these examples. There’s not an honest bone in Barack Obama’s body and the American people deserve better than that from their President.

2) For the nasty class warfare: Barack Obama must be unfamiliar with the seven deadly sins because never before has an administration so openly advocated envy. Successful Americans have been treated like villains and whole industries have been slimed for no other reason than it’s politically convenient. Obama supporter Bill Maher perfectly captured the attitude when he wrote,

The next rich person who publicly complains about being vilified by the Obama administration must be publicly vilified by the Obama administration.

Trying to destroy innocent people for political reasons. Demonizing success. Turning Americans against each other. For all the talk of unity during his campaign, Barack Obama has worked obsessively to divide Americans since he got into office.

3) For Obamacare: Everybody in D.C., Barack Obama included, knew the American people didn’t want Obamacare. The polls showed that they hated it. Scott Brown won “Ted Kennedy’s seat” by promising to vote against health care reform. There were angry townhalls, Tea Parties, and tens of millions of phone calls and emails spurred by that legislation.

Yet, Obama helped push it through anyway, methodically lied about what the bill would do, and arrogantly claimed people would learn to like the bill in time. This bill will cause the deficit to explode, kill private insurance, pay for abortions with our tax dollars, create death panels, ration medical care, and destroy the quality of medical care in this country. Obamacare would be a bad idea at any point in our history, but creating a massive new entitlement program when America is on the verge of a debt-driven meltdown caused by entitlement programs has set a new standard for irresponsibility. Let us hope, God willing, that no other American President ever matches that standard.

4) For putting our children so deep into debt: Barack Obama’s stimulus plan cost more than the race to the moon, the Louisiana Purchase, and the Marshall Plan — in real dollars — and it did nothing for the economy. Obamacare is a massive new entitlement program that we cannot afford. His 10 year budget? It will leave America with “more debt than has been accumulated by all previous Presidents in American history combined.”

As he did all that, Obama was in public saying things like this,

I refuse to leave our children with a debt they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.

Have you no shame, Barack Obama?

5) For the abuse of power: Obama appointed a staggering number of czars to get around the congressional confirmation process. He spent tens of billions in taxpayer dollars and broke legally binding contracts to give his union pals a fat pay-off from the auto industry. He issued a creepy, dictatorial ultimatum to BP demanding that it give the government 20 billion dollars just because he said so. Obama took over the census process so it could be twisted to help the Democrats. Barack Obama is not a man who respects democracy, the Constitution, the American people, or the rule of law and he should be trusted even less than you should trust most politicians, which is to say, not at all.

6) For the racial polarization of America: The unspoken promise behind Barack Obama’s campaign was that his election would enable America to finally achieve its long held dream of being a post-racial nation. Yet, Obama’s election has led to a flurry of finger pointing, grievance mongering, and race based accusations.

Some of that has come from Obama’s own administration. Eric Holder said America is a “nation of cowards” on race. Barack Obama even publicly sided with his friend Henry Louis Gates based on reasoning that really didn’t go much deeper than Gates was black and the cop was white; so the cop must be racist.

That being said, Obama has allowed his followers to do most of the dirty work. In other words, Mr. Post Racial Healer is happy to see anyone who disagrees with him smeared as a racist as long as he gets to keep his hands clean. If you don’t believe that, ask yourself, “What has Barack Obama done to stop the tidal wave of false accusations of racism that have been made in his defense?” Absolutely nothing of significance. For that vile and cynical tactic, Barack Obama should personally apologize to the staggering number of Americans who have been falsely called racists on his behalf.

7) For the arrogance: The good news about being President is that it doesn’t seem to have gotten in the way of Barack Obama’s golf game. Nor his vacations. Moreover, despite the fact that Obama seems to be completely baffled by the fundamentals of governing, it hasn’t stopped him from saying things like,

But I don’t want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess. I don’t mind cleaning up after them, but don’t do a lot of talking.

Then there’s this story, which is turning out to be one of my personal favorites, given how the election seems to be shaping up,

Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark., fears that these midterm elections are going to go the way of the 1994 midterms, when Democrats lost control of the House after a failed health care reform effort.

But, Berry told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, the White House does not share his concerns.

“They just don’t seem to give it any credibility at all,” Berry said. “They just kept telling us how good it was going to be. The president himself, when that was brought up in one group, said, ‘Well, the big difference here and in ’94 was you’ve got me.’ We’re going to see how much difference that makes now.”

At what point does Barack Obama actually accomplish something not just worthy of the Nobel Prize he was given, but of any worth at all?","1346458938"

Every day, wake up and say to your ceiling, ""today will be a good day. I'll make it one day without PMO, and today will be a good day."" Then get up **without touching your junk** and go take a cold shower. Bring your clothes into the bathroom so you spend as little time naked as possible. If you feel a urge, **DO NOT GIVE IN.** tell yourself, ""I'm better than this. I'mma go do pushups/ look at kittens/ go for a walk. I *will* leave the house, and I *will* make it through the day without any PMO.""

Then you get the hell out of your house, go for as long a walk as you can handle, come home, and do literally ***ANYTHING ELSE*** but look at porn. Repeat as needed, plus eating right and some basic excersise, and soon you'll be a majestic /r/nofap lion, out on the prowl for some love and a meaningful relationship. Never, ever, *ever* beat yourself up for failing. Tell yourself what you did wrong and how to fix it, but be *positive.* if you break your streak on a NSFW subreddit, go into your preferences and tell it to ask if you're 18. In that moment before you say yes, think, ""do I want this? Will it help me make my life better? Is it worth screwing up my body for moments of pleasure? Is this hollow euphoria worth destroying all that I've worked for?""

This is when you close the tab and go outside for a long walk.

Either way, your interference would not be welcomed.  In the first case, you took things way too seriously and made things uncomfortable for him.  In the second case, you just gave them a lot more ammo to bully him with.  Before, the jokes were just stuff they made up, now his life is probably filled with barbs about his girlfriend coming to save him again.  

The best thing you can do when you think a guy needs saving is to ask him privately, and listen to his answer.  I'd put a lot of money down that your boyfriend said some variation of ""if things got too bad for me I could have handled it myself.""

It just really wasn't your place.  Imagine if your boyfriend overheard your mom saying something to you on the phone, and called her up the next day and asked her to lay off of you.

Probably here the phrase ""same algorithm"" is right only at a higher level, because that Mathematica code is very far from C++ level and semantics.

Well written Python code is usually no more than about one hundred times slower than C++, but once in a while you reach a ratio of two hundreds, as in your case. Generally in Python there are ways to reduce such gap, reaching 20-30-50 times, but to do it sometimes you have to write Python in a low-level style, that is not very pythonic and not nice looking. Psyco or PyPy help reduce that C++-Python gap by about one order of magnitude.

I am currently trying to translate your nice Mathematica code to Python, but I am not expert in Mathematica and for me it's not a quick translation job, despite your Mathematica code is quite short.

I'd like to see your C++ code, there are several paste sites that accept 400+ lines long pastes, like http://codepad.org/

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","1) Always retrain your crew to the next tank. After Tier 5 you should always use the 75% retraining (20.000 silver). Having a good crew makes a huge difference.  

2) Secondary skills can only be trained when your crew is at 100%. Once you have a secondary skill, it will stay in effect even when your crew is below 100%, but it will only increase when the primary skill is at 100%.  

4) Angle your armor and aim for weakspots (Turret ring and the lower front plate are good weakspots on KV), otherwise there's not much you can do, since the KV is the better tank IMO.  
Anyway, I'm playing M6 right now and while not mindblowingly good, it's a pretty decent tank, especially with the 90mm gun.  

6) Don't. At least wait until you have progressed to Tier 8 with regular tanks, because:  
I. You're going to be paired up with Tier 8 and 9 tanks, which you have never fought against, and probably fail horribly.  
II. The primary purpose of high-tier premium tanks is to earn tons of cash, which is needed when playing Tier 8+ tanks, as they have high repair/operating costs, i.e. you're going to lose money most of the time when you're playing them. The income from the premium tanks helps to compensate for this, it also helps to rack up the millions of silver that you will need to buy Tier 9 and 10 tanks.  
There is no real need for these income capabilities at Tier 5, unless you're extremely impatient.","1346458965"

I feel that, while hard drives and/or CD/DVDs are useful for supplementing your library, there should be a quorum of actual books in every home that can be taken in a heartbeat in a bug-out scenario. Some survival handbooks touch on long-term survival scenarios, but don't adequately touch permanent settlements or higher-order medicine. Adding a medical guide and a homesteading guide, can help enormously. Other books of knowledge will help stave off boredom and create opportunities for developing barter goods and/or amenities.

For example, for completely new concepts, pair programming really sucks for me, because i need to really play with a concept and understand it fully before I am ready to move one.

JSA doesn't have any real provisions for this, its procedures assume that you are fit and able bodied capable of doing any and all work and those procedures really aren't flexible and once on JSA it ceases to matter if you could carry that load... obviously you can because you're on JSA and were booted off ESA; that's all the computer tells them.

The government (pick one, I don't care) and ATOS running around kicking people off ESA &amp; IB is actually going to stop a percentage of the recipients from being able to return to work... as the support mechanisms they needed to do so just suddenly vanish. ","1346458973"

[Im interested to know more about ice-cubes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4r0v/iama_former_restaurant_employee_and_food_writer/c61exoq?context=5)|Ah, this was an eye-opener for me. So, at most places, they don't do a very good job of cleaning their ice makers. I cannot count the number of times I've had to clean the ice maker and gobs of mold and black stuff comes out of the filters, ice holding bin, etc.
 |In essence, when you order a drink with ice at a restaurant, there is a high chance it's made contact with or contains mold. Yummy. 
[Why do safety regulations allow this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4r0v/iama_former_restaurant_employee_and_food_writer/c61jmw7?context=5)|Like someone above me said, the regulations are generally pretty lenient. It depends on your state how often you have to clean them. If it is once a year, or once every six months, mold can still accumulate by then.  
[Should the regulations be changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4r0v/iama_former_restaurant_employee_and_food_writer/c61k0we?context=5)|I think they should be changed, since it's just not sanitary. As for whether it is dangerous, I'm not sure. I suppose it depends on the type of mold and how it reacts while in the human body. 
[Who regulates that sort of thing?  Federal?  Local?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4r0v/iama_former_restaurant_employee_and_food_writer/c61ovxl?context=5)|Well, food inspectors come in to check it out, but I am pretty sure it is state laws that mandate how often you have to clean things like ice machines. 
[Have you or any of the chefs ever Intentionally done anything to a meal to get revenge on an asshole customer, I.e. spitting, pubes, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z4r0v/iama_former_restaurant_employee_and_food_writer/c61fe2e?context=5)|Great question. I think my morals are just too in place for me to ever do something to someones food outside of making sure it stays under the light even though the rest of the group's meals are ready.
 |On the other hand, I have seen a LOT of chefs and line cooks mess up food to get revenge on a customer. A friend of mine in high school (while working there) decided it would be funny to sop up the grease around the salamander (it's basically a super powerful broiler) with the hamburger he was about to make for a customer who insisted that his two prior hamburgers he ordered were overcooked. Let me be clear here though, the guy sat down, ordered, refused the first burger, ordered another, refused the second burger, and then my friend did that to the third one.

He went out the front door, so I quickly snuck around the side door, and picked up a rock. I don't know why I tried to do this, but as he was walking to the mailbox (with his back turned to me), I threw the rock straight up in the air (I'm talking at least 60-70 feet up). 

And I don't know what sort of odds that I could ever do this again, but the rock landed smack dab on the top of his head. I had only tried to scare him by landing it near him, but by some act of God, this rock/pebble that I threw up in the air just to scare him hit him right on top of the head and nearly knocked him the fuck out. 

He collapsed immediately, and started crying. I ran the fuck back inside, trying to look as innocent as possible. My family never knew it was me, and I hold this secret to my day.

The guns in paintball are sometime based off of real guns but I, myself have never seen a real mp5 with a CO2 tank coming off of it. Another thing is that if you have a net or a sticky target or something like that, you can shoot it with an airsoft gun and the BBs will stay there and you can reuse them. You can't do that with a paintball gun (that I know of). At my local sporting goods store you can get 5000 .25 gram BBs for $10. At that same store 2,000 paintballs costs $40.

Saying someone can't call themselves Anarchist because they are a mens rights activist is ""policing"" peoples identites. Right? I'm a transgender, gay identified, woman anarchist. I'm a feminist, queer and I hate cops. I am disgusted by mens rights advocacy and think cops suck. I also feel like label policing and politics is dangerous. 

Names ""need"" to mean something to have power. If someone was a cop and called himself an anarchist I feel like that would be very hypocrtical. But... who am I to say that he can't ""call"" himself that. Right?

Now you have to read that carefully.. Once a month, report everyone who may drive in the next three. 

I was disqualified (by the automotive department) in December. So my department was reporting (incorrectly) to the automotive department every month that I could possibly drive.

Although **I do support the legalization of marijuana**, I'm concerned with regards to its effects on reaction time, decision making, and overall awareness - based on academic studies NOT layman speculations or wishy washy ""I do it all the time and I'm not dead yet so it must be safe"". 

The same can be said for drivers that are going behind the wheel feeling tired, distracted, angry or on medications that may make them drowsy, and just overall irresponsible/drivers that are unaware of their surroundings. 



tl;dr Doesn't matter if it's marijuana, alcohol, or magical unicorns - going behind the wheel less than fully alert and aware is a bad idea. Driving is not a right, it's a privilege. Don't be stupid, I don't want to die/have anyone I know hurt from your stupid decisions. 

Edit: Formatting and to emphasize that I am **not** against the legalization of cannabis. I'm against irresponsible drivers (which includes and is not limited to - texting while driving, driving in a distressed state, driving with medication that could affect your driving such as drowsiness, et cetera).

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Quite honestly it's surprising to see a post like this at all (where it isn't buried).  I'm a single father raising my daughter alone in the South, and here support systems and everything else are geared towards a single mother as opposed to a ""single parent"" (whomever that may be).  Honestly I've wondered if there if there is even a resource for single dads anywhere that actually has a good bit of information, or Hell even a place for us to vent from time to time.  The biggest things are:

1. Registering for anything, it's either geared towards single parents or geared towards a single mother with financial assistance available.  I always have to put both sets of information down.

2. Feeling looked negatively upon about any injury.  Children get hurt sometimes, and my house is a no-spank home and my daughter is a klutz just like her old man. However, if she manages to get one little bruise playing I get ""the eye"".

3.  Meeting new people/dating is less important but still mentionable.  For some reason the single mothers I've met don't seem to be very interested in meeting someone else with similar responsibilities.

Even as backwards as the South is, I'm glad I didn't have to try and come up with those papers, it took two years to get the papers signed for the divorce as it was.  What are they going to do, not let them attend school if the other parent won't sign?

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","""American banking system"" is a pretty general question, which has gone through tons of changes since the country was founded.

As for Glass-Steagall, before it was passed banks could do just about anything with the money you deposited, without having to back it up, so much of it was used in loans and investments. When the Great Depression hit, people flooded to their banks to withdraw their savings, but the banks didn't have enough money to distribute, so thousands of people lost their savings and thousands of banks closed.

Glass-Steagall basically said to banks ""If you take deposits from citizens, you're called a commercial bank, and you can't make investments with their money"", and also banks had to insure their depositors' accounts for a certain amount. The act hoped to prevent both the practices which led to banks' low amounts of money, and the loss of money by investors in a future bank failure.","1346458987"

It seems like most of the people who say nasty things are in cars, so you don't have to look at them or think about them for very long, or people who are obviously jealous. 

Running with headphones is a very galvanizing issue. On the one hand, it blocks out stuff like that and motivates you. On the other, it really is much safer to have full awareness of what's going on around you, there is some correlation of hearing loss with continual use and I have found running without to be really rewarding and centering. I don't get much time to myself, so my runs are when I get to focus on me and think about whatever I want.

I also second the running in daylight suggestion. I wouldn't run in my neighborhood by myself most of the time. Maybe look for a local running group? Even if you fear you are too slow, they will be great encouragement.

This call spell worked. We ended up meeting up and I feel like I can actually be around her again now. I got to thinking about how I missed beng with her...so I decided to try some more magick. I used the same setup as before. This time when I cast, I asked that if the possibility be there for our hearts to reunite, that this reunion be sped up. I specifically stated that I wished for no free will to be bent or broken, and that if there was no natural possibility, that the spell do nothing.

Apparently that still must have broken a rule, because I got some payback the next day. I lost my second job, then later that afternoon found out I hadn't even been considered for a job I had applied for. Since I lost one job and couldn't get the one I applied for, that means I have to stay at my cashiering job...which I'd been hoping to escape from. Those things coming in pretty quick succession, to me, seemed like a message. Hell, not getting the job I applied for alone was enough of a payback to get my attention.

So yeah, not attempting magick that would have the remote possibility of interfering with free will any time soon. Besides, there's plenty of other types of spells to learn about and experiment with.

She's laughed at a few of my jokes. Anyway, she's telling me a story about this guy who's being a dick at work and being incredibly patronising. 'He thinks I'm a pushover,' she says. She's attractive - coming across as confident, intelligent, on top of things and generally clued in. I can't imagine anyone considering her a pushover. So I say, deadpan, 'Yeah, sure. Because you *look* like a pushover'.

She freezes completely, looks at me for a second or two and says, 'What the **fuck** did you just say to me?'. I start trying to explain how she's clearly not a pushover *etc. etc.* The whole thing went on forever. Eventually I just got my coat.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My wife does therapy for kids on the autism spectrum and I just want to clear a few things up that might make people more understanding of the parents decisions. Now we are not anti-vaccine at all, but working with kids and parents my wife has seen many videos of kids functioning typically without any problems and then they go in to get vaccinated and a couple days later the kids won't talk or have autistic, non-typical behaviors. Now the science is pretty clear, but no amount of studies or scientific consensus is going to change these parents minds after their experience. Not trying to make any excuses, but not all anti-vax parents are crackpot hippies. Many have followed normal procedure and have followed doctors orders to the tee. It's just that no amount of reason and scientific proof takes away their personal anecdotes. 

Will probably get downvoted and again I am not making any excuses for their negligence, I'm just saying it's not as easy as ""these crackpot parents are idiots and are just selfish."" Granted there are many of those, but it's not always black and white and it's hard not to sympathize with them when they fall into such a shitty situation. ","1346458996"

He should not have done bench press on that bench.

Bench press should be done [inside a power rack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pCOo3RtKu1E) with the safety bars down a tiny bit below your chest. Or better yet buy a [Free Spotter](http://www.shermworks.com/xworks.html) for about $130. At the very least do them on a bench with some sort of safety catch.

Do not ever solely rely on a spotter. Things drop too quickly to rely on human reflexes.

Even if you are bench pressing light weight you want to do it inside a power rack.   
You have to ask yourself how many pounds are you ok with falling on your face, neck, or chest?

A lot of weight seems trivial and not worth worrying about. I can do 225 for 30 reps on a good day but I still wouldn't want to drop it on my neck. But to me when I am lifting it, it feels very light and not dangerous at all.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I wouldn't care either way about the race of the population. I've lived in a couple villages in Africa with a 100% black population and thought they were wonderful people. Unfortunately, what you are implying about the correlation between black population density and crime/poverty rate in America is technically correct. However, that has absolutely nothing to do with some kind of genetic trait. It has everything to do with the systematic and government sponsored economic and housing discrimination of the black population in America from the 1860s well into the 1990s.

Imagine, if you like, that you are a very bright, hard working black man in the 40s. You just got out of the war, and you have a GI housing bill sponsored by the federal government. This is the same GI housing bill that all of the white soldiers got. However, you can't spend yours because none of the new housing projects going up post-WW2 would accept black residents. 

Now if you did manage to buy a house, you would get to watch that house and all neighboring houses become worthless instantly, because all of the white families would quick-sell or even abandon their homes because they didn't want to live next to no nigger. Within a decade, the nice, middle class neighborhood you moved into has become a ghetto, and since that's all most black families were allowed to buy regardless of economic status and education, you see massive clumps of black population in ghettos.

Additionally, imagine you cant go to most colleges, you cant use most public facilities, you are legally or illegally denied access to social programs, and white people spit on your boots whenever you walk down the streets.

So you have generations of black families denied access to all of the benefits white people enjoyed. White people got rich from these benefits post WW2, while black people got poorer. In response, they created an insular, anti-white, us-against-them culture both to protect themselves from the prevalent lynchings in the South, but also to band together and share what meager resources they had in their communities.

And that's where we are today. Only one, maybe one and a half generations of black Americans have had ""equal"" access to housing, education, and social programs. You really think 100 years of enforced culture is just going to melt away in a few years?

The housing boom was *world wide* -- in many countries around the world much bigger than in the USA.  Whatever the Fed did in the US, and no matter how much financial regulators screwed up the mortgage market in the face of the boom in the US, they didn't cause the world-wide boom.  Americans really shouldn't be so conceited.

The ""savings glut"" coming out of China in particular and Asia in general after their 1997 financial crisis -- when the Asians started accumulating massive reserves to assure they'd never go through that again -- was identified as a prime suspect behind these price rises near a decade ago, notably by Bernanke himself.

The camera was pointing up a path. I started with the camera the right way up (landscape) a ""flip-flopped"" the light wand end over end, either side of the path. I then rotated the camera 180° (upside down) and repeated the process.

I then rotated the camera 90° (portrait) and spun cathodes either side of the path. I then rotated the camera 180°, spun the cathodes again and finally drew an outline of myself standing in the middle of the path.

Hope that made sense!

I should also point out the green sky was created using in-camera custom white balance. No post editing/photoshop.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Yes, like ""Obama ordered drone strikes that killed women and children."" That's a fact. Raw data. **And it means Obama is a mass-murderer.**

No, it doesnt. Obama has never himself killed anyone, therefore the title of murderer is entirely hyperbolic. Furthermore, obama doesnt directly approve every single strike, id be surprised to hear that obama was bothered with drone strikes frequently rather than delegating that authority to the secretary of defense or something. And its hardly the case that innocent civilians are purposely being killed. 

Civilian causalities have always been an inevitable part of war; and war itself has always proved inevitable at times as well. Would you have stayed out of WWII just because in hindsight, the united states inevitably killed lots of innocent civilians?

&gt;Or, Obama ordered US intervention in places like Libya, expanded the War on Terror to places like Yemen. Those are also facts. Raw data. Which make Obama a warmonger.

You were doing so good! I thought you finally understood it, and once again you pawned off your interpretation of the facts as fact! You're totally right in the beginning, obama ordered interventions in libya and yemen and somalia. Those are facts. Raw data. 

And then you lose all reality and intelligence. That means obama is a warmonger? Thats your opinion of the facts! how many times do i have to tell you that? That is not itself fact. 

&gt;Mmmkay? Oh and really, there is only one way to interpret those facts. Such as: Obama is a mass-murderer, and Obama is a warmonger.

No. If theres only one possible way to interpret that, why do i interpret it differently? shouldnt that be impossible? Or are there in reality different interpretations of those facts, and you just choose to plug your ears and scream ""nananan"" when anyone disagrees with you?

There are two kinds of people:

The people.

You.

When the people judge you either they like you or they dont. If they like you, awesome. If they dont, who the fuck cares. You'll never meet them. Ever. 

Now, if you DO plan on meeting them, then its different. They first impression matters the most. If you make a good impression, the second matters two times more. 
For example, if im a good looking person, most people would think im a good person. But then if I turn out to be a douchebag, then most people will label me as a douchebag (unless you make them think otherwise later)

P.S im not good at advice, so if i made no sense im sorry.

Don't send the payment again, it will make a double payment. 

If PayPal tells you the payment is on its way somewhere, but being held, unless you absolutely CANNOT wait, just let the payment complete normally.

Typically it will take 2-3 business days for eChecks to clear, but can be as long as 5-10 business days.  

I don't fully understand where the hiccup with the payment is, and I know that PayPal will typically not know either, unless 30 full days have passed. Then they can trace the payment down. 

If something really weird is going on with your payment, you should have gotten an email explaining the situation. Generally this should happen right away. 

I really can't give any better advice or information without knowing the country you're located in, or at the very least the region of the world you are in. 

In either case, the seller will have received an email stating that the payment is coming, but has not cleared to them yet. They will get another email when the eCheck clears. 

Hope this helps :)","1346459019"

I'm not sure of the evolutionary history of these, so I don't know what selection pressures it would require, but the chance that all of these adaptatiaons could show up in one organism is rare.  There are numerous exceptions whe you talk about one adaptation (like the platypus having a duck bill, or whales growing fins/flaps) but so many adaptations coming together for a single (and very complex) emergent behavior is asking a lot.","1346459036"

"ferrets","t5_2qhn1","First, is this a vet with experience with ferrets?  Try to find local ferret groups/rescues and ask for advice on which vets have experience with ferrets.

Second, even so, maybe a second opinion is warranted?

Third, maybe consider something like [CareCredit](http://www.carecredit.com/) or [other options](http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/trouble_affording_veterinary_care.html).

Finally, how old did your vet say he might be?

To be honest, ""not acting like a ferret"" is kind of what ferrets do in a new environment.  Also, of the symptoms you've listed we have two which can be treated reasonibly easily (fleas, parasites), only a suspicion on what is going on elsewhere (innards) and admittedly a big bill from the mouth (teeth/gums &amp; tumor).  So I wouldn't rush into something.


On the other hand others here have reported stories of ferret owners doing just this on Craigslist and similar services.  Namely, being unable to take care of their ferret and offloading them to someone else during those expensive years.

I don't think anyone here can make the choice for you, and it is rough.  And I get it about being a softie.  When it comes to these little critters I'm a complete wreck when they're not well.  At the same time keep in mind what you can do for the little guy.  The vet might be recommending euthanasia more out of looking at the cost vs. probable time left.  $400 is... well... I've put $1100 into a ferret that was 5, maybe 6 years old.  I quipped at the time we could've gotten 10 more ferrets for the price of that one operation.  $400 is actually kind of typical for ferrets, it's just a shock to get it within days of adopting the little bugger.  Anyway, I'd say not rush into anything because it doesn't sound like he's in dire straights.  Maybe someone else here has some better advice to offer?","1346459037"

The only character I really liked was the historian, Duiker I think his name was. The rest of them felt like dungeons and dragons characters to me.

2. Must wait until 100%    

3. It's inherent RNG AND based on crew skill.  Your gunner's skill level helps determine accuracy.  For arty, try to place enemy tanks halfway between your reticle and the edge of the circle closest to you.  Works out well for me at least.    

4. T1 is a grind, I find.  Against kv's, aim for the driver port (The flat area below the turret).  If aiming at a kv from the side, aim for the area just behind the tank near its stowage boxes.  You have a good chance at lighting them on fire if you do.     

5. Yes, but it requires coordination and skill/knowledge of what your tank's limitations are.    

6. Get a premium tank to generate lots of credits.  I would personally suggest a Churchill since its loads of fun and generates steady income (With profits of 2-3 thousand on a shitty performance and loss, combined).

I hope you realize that it was British territory. The country was created by the United Nations Resolution 181. Hence, not illegal. 

&gt;Israel's existence is only because the West allowed it to be there.

Let's just assume what you say is true. What's wrong with that?

&gt;Israel has been involved in wars ever since it was created.

Again, that is not evidence for anything. Maybe it is the countries around Israel that have been involved in a lot of wars ever since they were created?

&gt;The IDF shows no mercy to Palestinian women and children, it is called ethnic cleansing.

No it's not. Just because you put the words ""ethnically cleansing"" at the  end of your sentence doesn't make it even remotely accurate. Go to Kosovo or something if you want to see real ethnic cleansing. Or maybe watch a World War 2 documentary. 

&gt;not running away like the Jews did against Nazi's.

Anti-Semite much?

&gt;There are protest going on in Israel as we speak. Protest for social justice, better living, WTF are you talking about?

Yes, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly exist in Israel, unlike the states surrounding it. Again, this isn't evidence of anything. There are protests every day in Canada, the United States, France, Finland, etc etc etc. 

&gt;More people are leaving Israel than are going there.

I was never trying to diss bassnectar, or devalue his music in anyway. But for me, its not my taste, and I felt like sharing the story behind why I feel that way. People have tried telling me ""oh you gotta this to this album,"" or ""this track"" but the thing is I paid this guy money twice, one time I remember it, and I remember not liking it. Its hard to get past that and listen to studio albums when you've been to his live show and were under-impressed.

Its like reading a book, not liking it, then someone tells you to watch the movie made from it because you might like it more. fat chance.","1346459055"

This went on for about twenty minutes until she told me it was a gag ticket, as she burst out laughing. I left her house Christmas morning on the spot, storming out blind with rage. On the way home, I had to call everybody back and explain what happened, near tears. It took me almost all year to forgive her.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Raising the debt ceiling absolutely means the government intends to borrow more money. It is not the ""act"" of borrowing more money, but it most certainly is the signal and the approval that it is going to happen. 

Where some people are mistaken is that they believe raising the debt ceiling means the government is going to initiate new spending. As in, programs and promises that do not already exist will suddenly be manifested. That is the difference. Our government has already promised more in outlays than they have coming in, and must increase the debt ceiling to cover those past promises.

That said, it is not at all misleading to say that raising the debt ceiling (the limit on how much the government can borrow) signals the government's intention to borrow more money.","1346459060"

"politics","t5_2cneq","My statement stands. The Democratic Party's dramatic shift to the right - and embrace of ideological and policy positions associated with American conservativism and the right wing of the Republican Party - is old news at point. A large part of why the GOP has increasingly turned towards lunatic-fringe far right politics is because much of their traditional agenda and rhetoric has been appropriated by Obama and the Democrats. 

You can go down the list here: the fervent embrace of pro-business mythology, the fanatical militarism (the armed forces are the ""steel in the ship of state""), the authoritarianism (Obama is the ""Warrior President"" who must exercise unheard-of powers - indefinite detention, domestic spying, assassinations, etc. - to ""Defend the Homeland""), the contempt for 'government' (bloated, inefficient, needs to be cut down to its smallest size since the 1950s).

Not to mention some of the Democrats' current policies, like education and entitlement 'reform,' are lifted straight from longstanding Republican Party platforms. It's not an accident that Obama and the Democrats have continued virtually every aspect of the Bush agenda.

Really, the most shocking thing about these changes is that some people are just oblivious to them. A few still seem to think the Democrats are about expanding the social safety net, reigning in the power of business and helping the poor.","1346459061"

It's very similar to fantasy in a lot of respects, right down to big heroes with swords saving alien princesses. You might get mental powers, and you certainly don't have a lot of hard science or high technology. It's also pretty essential to the genre that the hero goes to a strange planet with strange customs to do his heroics. The hero bumbles around doing his thing while the reader is exposed to just how exotic this strange planet is. 

See the similarities with Dune? 

Hero goes to strange planet which the reader is exposed to.

I know however, that many haunted houses turned out to be haunted by mice, or old wood contracting upon cooling at night, or deception for publicity/screwing with people. As long as these explanations stop working, we can start looking for other things.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","1:Obama did cut over $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare.
The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism.

-It was money that was saved, and was put to better use. Ryan's plan (old) cut about 700 Billion too.

2:The Janesville, General Motors plant was closed down under Obama 

-While it closed down under Obama, it was set to close during Bush's tenure. Although it is a broken promise to the workers.

3: Obama did blow off the bipartisan debt commission.

-As I recall they were unable on multiple occasions to even come close to getting a plan that both sides agreed on. Obama can not control an inept Congress.

4: Obama’s waivers do allow for the relaxing of work requirements in welfare reform.

-It allowed States to use there own Welfare work requirements in place of the National ones, IF they were submitted and approved. He did not cut the work requirements as the Romney ad boasts.

Keep going, and before you say, ""You can't blame Bush forever"", its only been 4 years, and those 2 Wars and prescription drug act that were not funded, yeay, still not paid for, so yes people will still blame him for where he messed up.

As it turns out the Economic problems the US was and is still suffering from can not be fixed overnight and not in a 4 Year period with a Congress who can hardly agree on anything at all.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I would second **Alan Wake** for the moment, although I would say there is a fair more bit of action than she might be able to tolerate.  However, the story is decent and a something new compared to other recent games.

**Alright, the rest of this post isn't going to help you much at the moment but should the opportunity ever come up, I'd regret not having suggested the following.**

If you ever get a PS3 and your girlfriend is still interested in gaming, you MUST get these.  **I will guarantee that these games will capture her attention**.  I have had personal experience playing both games multiple times with non-gamers with positive results every time.  Funny enough LA Noire would also by my first choice to introduce a non-gamer to gaming but you've already played that.

 * **Heavy Rain** 

 * **Uncharted Series**

First **Heavy Rain**.  Why limit her to watching when you can play together?  I frequently recommend this game to people because its a one of a kind experience.  The game is a mix of interactive events and cutscenes.  The main story is a suspense/thriller/mystery involving the kidnapping of the main character's son.  You alternate between 4 separate characters as the story develops.  A Father, a Detective, a Journalist, and an FBI agent.  For the most part you can move at your own pace, the fast paced portions of the game are limited to pushing the right button combinations or directions.

I fully suggest you pick 2 characters, and let her play 2 characters.  No matter what happens, the story continues and the ending changes depending on your choices.  Yes a character can die at certain points, but the death will be written into the outcome.  Let her know that there's no pressure to be perfect as deaths are required to get every ending.  

**Uncharted Series**

I know you stated ""not a bunch of action"", but Im going to go ahead anyway and recommend these games.  You might want to start out with Uncharted 2 or 3 as they gameplay mechanics are greatly improved.  The stories are a great mix of action and historical fiction.  Think of them as a cross between Indiana Jones and National Treasure movies.

I would suggest you do all the shooting portions, and let your girlfriend do all of the platforming and puzzle portions.  The platforming is surprisingly forgiving and you aren't required to make perfect jumps to grab onto ledges.  The puzzles are not overly difficult either.  The games are fairly good at alternating between shooting, platforming and puzzle sections so if you're taking turns, no one is bored for too long.  Additionally you'll root for each other to advance the story.

Anyway, I know you don't have a PS3, but as gamer of over 20 years, I have never been as successful getting non-gamers into games as with **LA Noire**, **Heavy Rain** and **Uncharted 1/2/3**.  If you ever give these games a shot and it doesn't work out, msg and I'll make it up to you.

I didn't care that some things didn't work, cause atleast I could play.  but now I have all this extra time to think about how disappointed I am with Anet support and I go to reddit to exhale.  There is no service number, no live chat support, just a ticket system where you wait patiently as you get ignored.

the problem with reddit is if you say anything bad about Anet, people think your a hater.  Rather then listen to why you have a problem.  I love(d) Anet before I had to deal with support.  Now I feel like they already got my $60 so they have no incentive to move quickly on my claim.  they focus on kicking out player (exploiters), then get players that got hacked back into the game.  It is very frustrating.

It depends on how much you want to spend, time you want to invest, and the quality of the cards you want to buy. eBay is a good place for bulk commons and uncommons, which is good for getting a collection back up and running. Some of the bulk rare lots are decent, too. (search eBay for ""mtg bulk"" and you should find lots)

You could hunt down a local game story that sells magic cards and ask if there is anything they could do for you

If you want to win girlfriend of the year award, pick a Saturday or Sunday, grab your boyfriend, and go look for yard sales/flea markets. If you said ""get in the car we are hunting magic cards"" to me I would flip my shit. 

Another, albeit kind of sketchy, place would be Craigslist. Search for mtg

Example: a black girl joined our troop. Our leader actually told my mom that she ""tried to stop it"" but that she had to let her in. It was a very ""There goes the neighborhood!"" sort of situation for her, apparently.

Example Expansion Pack: We had a sleepover/lock-in, where the 4 or 5 chaperones/moms were doing makeup and hair and nails for the girls, and none of the moms would even make eye contact with the one black Girl Scout; my mom was horrified that this was the example that was being set for me, and she quickly called the girl over and painted her nails and did her hair and makeup and whatnot, but the girl unfortunately was quite aware of what was going on. I left the scouts shortly after.

Let's say that this signing can be a SUPER success if he manages to get in here both on and off the pitch, training the way he's supposed to etc etc OTHERWISE it'll be a (little) failure: he's coming for free and he's not the top player we were waiting so no big expectations, if it goes so bad we'll just send him back to Arsenal in 1year... fact is, no matter what, he's still better than the other noob names that were supposed to fullfil our 5th striker spot (Borriello, Floccari, etc etc)

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Just as I said to brobaru, I drove a Veloster, Cruze, Caliber, Fit, Civic, and Fusion before I bought the car. By far the Focus had a much nicer interior (with this package) than everything but the Fusion had. 

The only thing that came close to being as good as the Focus was the Fusion which was out of my price range in the end, and the Veloster, which the car felt good to drive, but the interior felt cheap.

The cruze might as well have been a Geo Metro it just felt so underpowered and the turbo lag didn't help. Caliber was a POS, felt like driving a brick while surrounded by cheap plastic. Hondas both weren't bad, but they weren't impressive and the Fit was really cramped.

The focus feels amazing around corners. It has a nice sporty suspension and the hatchback has a great center of gravity. Steering is very responsive and the brakes are great, I had a dog run out in front of the car one night a couple months ago and I went from 50-0 what felt like instantly with no loss of traction. The 2.0L inline-4 is a good bit more powerful than the other cars in its class, and it doesn't need a turbo like the Cruze. It's based on the old Duratec engines so it is a reliable design. The dual-clutch transmission is very smooth after the new upgrade they did, and is a nice step up from the standard tranny of all the other vehicles I've had.

Interior of the car is great. I didn't like the cloth seats, but the leather ones are wonderful, and the Sport's nylon bucket seats are pretty damn nice too. The benefit of the nylon seats in the Sport is that they are pretty tough which was a big bonus for me.

Room in the car is great. 4 grown men can ride in it comfortably, and 5 kinda uncomfortably. The Cruze I drove almost killed the salesman who was crammed into the back seat despite being shorter than me, in fact one of the things that really sold me was in the Focus when I test drove it the salesman was the huge black dude who got in and out of the back with no problems at all. If you fold the back seats down you can get a lot of stuff back there, which I tested with 3 people's camping gear.

All around it's a great car. If you're interested in one just go drive it and see if you like it, I think you will love it.","1346459085"

If you're counting on DX10/11 for a particular feature, which you almost can't be given the nature of your question, then there is a certain amount of uncertainty about the future of XNA.

A lot of people in the field believe that Microsoft is just being quiet about a new rollout of a fancy new DX11 managed framework (A new XNA or XNA5) and that they want to release it a few months after Win8 comes out. 

All MS has actually said is that XNA4 will not let you create Metro (or Modern, whatever they're calling it now) apps. You will still be able to (and would actually have to, for GreenLight) make it a desktop application.

A lot of other people took this to mean ""XNA IS GONE FOREVER!"" which is not true at all. At the very least, it will remain an extremely effective way to make games utilising DX9.","1346459085"

Probably have the recipe lying around in there, but it worked really well as long as you used very little at a time, because if you put on a bunch the eyeshadow looks all goopy and piled on no matter how little you put, because that thing SERIOUSLY works.

I have been trying to work on my Game/mic audio balance for a few episode, guess I still need to tweak it a bit. Thanks for pointing it out.
As for my Mic, I'm using my Turtle Beach Headset and Mic, and that tends to pick up A LOT of ambient noise, so the ""buzzsaw"" may very well be my Fan,If not, its Probably the Construction that was going on during that time :/ I'll see what I can do about it.

And yes, Random battles CAN be annoying in Turn-based games, and Honestly I Avoid MOST of the battles that I can, But if I hit a few, It does add a BIT of variety to watch. Especially when you get New skills, or weapons. I'll probably keep them to a minimum as much as possible.

I'll try doing 720p, I'm new to Editing, so I won't be able to do a lot of the alterations that you suggested (widescreen, battle transitions, etc.). Probably something I'll work on figuring out in my Free time.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I feel more safe knowing that if I'm being beaten to death with a pipe in the middle of a parking lot there is a chance that someone will be able to immediately and effectively bring my attacker down. I feel safe knowing that even if the guy attacking me is humongous and has been training in the martial arts all his life I still have the ability to stop him rapidly and decisively. 

I assume the fact that criminals are more likely to have guns is what makes you say you'd feel unsafe. But the fact is that a criminal can kill you just as easily with a knife, or a bat, or a brick. 

&gt;There wouldn't be anything from which I would like to defend myself when there weren't any guns. 

So you don't mind getting stabbed and beaten with blunt instruments?

&gt; And even if there are threats that remain then their would be other ways to defend yourself.

If you;re young and fit, maybe. How many people have time to take a class and learn how to fight with a knife? What about the people who have disabilities? It'd be real difficult to defend yourself with a bat from a wheel chair. What about people who are small? Or fat? Or old? The only thing that a 70 year old grandma is going to be able to use to fight off an attacked is a gun. If you remove guns you remove the ability for those people to defend themselves.

Forms were made based on how society is and that's the way our society has been for a long time. Most daddys work more most mommys stay home more, hence they have the time to take kids to activities and such. It's nice to see that our society is changing and this isnt always the norm. But really all you guys getting your panties in a bunch is just silly. The more single daddy's out there will be recognized and forms like these will be changed. Just takes time. I remember filling out my race for a school standardized test, I was never more confused in my life. I had the choice White, Black, Biracial ( not Hispanic) Hispanic Asian and pacific islander. I was only allowed to check one box. I'm biracial, my father is from Nicaragua and my mother is polish, but the only biracial box said not Hispanic. I was 7 and lost. I actually checked two boxes and was told by teachers to erase the mark in the white box, probably because I look more Hispanic than white even though I'm the only in my family besides my father who's brown. My brother looks just like my mom, uber white. But now things have changed and I can check as many boxes as I want! They even ask from which Latino descent! I'm super excited for when everyone is too mixed for these questions to matter! Point is things will change, just need a little more time and more of you amazing daddy's making yourselves known.","1346459090"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The fact that if anyone disagrees with the hive mind or makes a grammar/punctuation mistake you will get downvoted to all hell.

examples: 

 * r/gaming tends to dislike those who are a console gamer and do not play games that are over a decade old and hates facebook gamers.(ie. lack of xbox/ps3/wii posts because r/gaming either downvotes it when its new or causes an argument after an hour since its been posted. For the decade old game? try posting a halo 3 picture and watch at how quickly it turns to ""halo 2 was so much better"" and ""they should totally bring it back"". Now on to facebook gamers, if a person plays whatever that mafia game is, and tries to post a screenshot to r/gaming, that person will be instantly downvoted and hated upon because ""it's not a real game"" or it is hated by the hive mind with no actual basis around it or possibly because they simply do not like to play it.) 

 * r/atheism will attempt to crush any sort of religious thing no matter how small and how unaffected others are(ie. your friend disagrees with you about evolution, church sign says something that can brighten up another religious persons day, the ""one nation under god"" on the United States currency, etc) but will still viciously attack it.

 * r/politics generally doesn't want to hear about the two sides of the argument because they are on the side of the argument that is beneficial to them and everyone else is pretty much screwed.(ie. if you do not agree 100% with Obama then may god have mercy on your soul because r/politics sure as hell will not)

tl;dr: I hate the hive mind that reddit created and I am expecting the wave of downvotes to come.","1346459091"

&gt; This kind of discrimination not only reinforces the idea that only mothers are capable of taking care of children, but it also plays into this (growing?) anxiety in America about the potential for men, but never women, to be sex predators.

It seems to be synergistic when taken with choline.  I'm going to be getting my first sample batch to try from [Brainpower Nutri](http://www.brainpowernutri.com/index.php?route=common/home) - Because they have little pre made stacks and sample sizes for certain things.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","It varies from culture to culture, but we'll focus on the Endans, who're my favourites at the moment. Their greatest hero is a man called Vittori, actual facts are pretty hazy, some people claim he was a demigod, others an elf, but the most likely he was a powerful chieftain of a large Etnysian tribe residing in the Bridge Of Sapyen, a thin stretch of land connecting North and South Sapyen, this area is home to many different ethnic groups but was, at the time, controlled by the Omindic Empire. When the Omindic Empire began cracking down on the personal freedoms of the occupied cultures in the area (right to private armies, freedom of religion etc) Vittori attempted to oust the Omnidic, his early battles were successful, but his army lacked discipline and eventually melted away, Vitorri was exiled but returned 20 years later with a large army of sellswords and took much of the East coast, the easterling Chimite culture, made up of the sons of the old Chimite civilisation rallied behind him, as did Lordsin, a small nation hoping to decrease Omindic power in the bridge, now with a large organised force behind him, he was able to route the Omindic force at Myro and again in The Floodplains, after a hastily arranged marriage, the people of the Southern Foxinii came to his cause , bringing highly versatile cavalry, with the ability to match the wrecking ball that were Omindic knights to the table. The Foxii revolted, the city of Foxin fell into Vittori's hands, the Omindic forces in the South surrendered and soon after that the enemy in the East. Vittori returned to his people with a huge army of Chimites, Foxii and sellswords. While some Etnysian tribes remained loyal to The Empire, the vast majority followed Vittori, who met the last of the Omndic forces in the Bridge at The Battle of the Shy River. Vitorri's forces were all but destroyed, they were outnumbered, his men were half starved and the Omindic knights smashed into the weak rebel left flank. Vittori retreated to the friendly city of Endswatch (which he later renamed Omindowatch) hoping to make a last stand behind it's walls. The inhabitants of the city turned Vittori's army away, thinking him to be a lost cause. In a moment of madness, Vitorri marched his men back South, to the Shy Hills, right into the jaws of the enemy, huge swathes of the Chimite army deserted him, but he still possessed most of the Etnysians and Foxii. He marched his men to a large pass in the hills, hoping to turn the terrain to his advantage, but still expecting a crushing defeat. He sent out scouts to determine the position of the Omindic, but his scouts spotted only one other force, a huge Lordish army, that had manged to vanquish the Omindic force that defeated Vitorri at the river. Vitorri returned to the capital city of The Bridge to find the people chanting his name. He renamed to city after himself and the nation he had freed Endo, after the patron Etnysian God of patience and perseverance. The Chimite's, Foxii, all the Etnysian and Northern tribes and cities pledged fealty to Vittori's new kingdom and Endo lived in relative peace, until the Chimite rebelled (unsuccessfully) and Vittori was killed by an infected arrow wound, though the Endans will probably tell you he returned to Heaven, or the Elvenlands.

Rotworld starts in issue #13 of Animal Man, Frankenstein Agent of S.H.A.D.E., and Swamp Thing, and is probably a good jumping on point for all of those.  
Green Lantern, Green Lantern Corps, Green Lantern: New Guardians, and Red Lanterns are all starting the big event ""Rise of the Third Army"".  
Demon Knights has just finished its current arc, with the end of issue #12 going directly into the next one. Justice League Dark and Earth 2 will be finishing their current arcs in October, and starting new ones with issue #14 in November.

The argument of legalizing marijuana and the argument of legalizing hemp should be treated as two totally different things.  On one, you can argue about the effect it has as a psychoactive drug, its affect on the community, etc.  

But the other, hemp, you can't.  If it's not economically viable to use in place of cotton and other fabrics, that's fine... don't use it.  Let the market decide.  But making it illegal simply because it's a relative of a plant that someone doesn't like doesn't make any sense.  It's also useful as a source for protein.

LOL. The ability to buy Bitcoins that can then be converted back USD in the form of a debit card is not an advantage over just spending the USD in the first place. This is *not* the thing that will take Bitcoin to critical mass.

Bitinstant's next move should be to allow customers to use Chase deposits to fund those cards directly-- without going through Bitcoin-- which wouldn't benefit Bitcoin at all, but it would benefit BitInstant by cutting Mt. Gox out of the path from USD to ultra-cheap prepaid debit card.

"politics","t5_2cneq","""Services"" provided by the Federal government, by the most generous definition, amount to less than 20% of the total budget. The rest is military and entitlements - money given away for nothing in return. So it's not much different from a charity really. I know everyone likes to argue that taxes are necessary for the services we receive, but again, the total for every agency and department that ""does"" anything is less than 20% of the total. 45% is writing checks to individuals, and the rest is military and interest payments.

Whether or not it's appropriate to give giving out that money to people can be argued, but we should stop pretending that our taxes are going to ""services"". They are not.

Currency represents value, and that value was not created by, and does not belong to, the government. Currency existed before the Federal government got involved. People invented money, gave it meaning and value, managed and controlled it. The government decided it was in our best interest to have it controlled at the Federal level and that may be true, but it's not the case that ""without government there is no money"". ","1346459130"

The trouble is that the situation I described is very common; that year was the worst, but during the years I was on my own in Seattle, I never had what I'd call a stable roommate experience.

As to food assistance, the cutoff is $1100 gross. Our hypothetical friend is spending most of the difference between that and his income level on food. It's a bad bracket.

I didn't realize you were factoring tax into full-time; I divided that $1350 figure by 4 weeks and got 37 hours, which is pretty reasonable as most hourly employers don't want to schedule you at 40 lest you go into OT.

You're absolutely right that tons of assistance is available for a resourceful person in my position. I am grateful for Stafford loans and expect Pell grants for this, my sophomore year. But in our original scenario- OP's situation- trying to get through college and then save up $100k inside of 15 years is going to be ugly, especially when it's hard to find work and almost impossible to secure a student loan as a felon.

It makes sense that a mistake leading to somebody's death would and rightly ought to ruin your life, but it seems ridiculous to prevent someone from contributing fully to society because he is perpetually condemned to repent for a 3rd-degree felonious tragedy. I feel for the guy. There's a toolbag running around this thread tearing into everybody who sympathizes with OP because OP killed a person. My feeling is that OP can only atone for this by living fully, since his friend and victim can't.","1346459132"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You are probably going to get various responses instructing you to do everything from send a registered letter to wearing a tinfoil hat.  Here are some resources you should read for yourself.

The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf) (FDCPA).  The law that governs what collectors can and can't do.

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) (CFPB). The government agency that regulates collectors.  They have an ""[Ask the CFPB](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/search?selected_facets=category_exact:Debt%20Collection)"" page on debt collectors.

The [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre18.shtm) (FTC).  The agency that used to regulate collectors before the CFPB existed and still does but nobody is exactly sure how anymore.   

If this was the first time they have contacted you,  you should be getting a Validation (or Dunning) letter in the very near future.  See: FDCPA § 809.

When you get that letter, follow the instructions.  If you dispute the debt, you can write them back and ask them to verify the debt.  Many of the members of the ""collectors are evil bastards"" club will direct you to web pages telling you that you should request an affidavit, signed in blood by someone who actually saw you borrow the money but they're full of shit.

&gt; ""[v]erification of a debt involves nothing more than the debt collector confirming in writing that the amount being demanded is what the creditor is claiming is owed; the debt collector is not required to keep detailed files of the alleged debt."" 

&gt; *Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo*, 174 F.3d 394, 406 (4th Cir.1999). See also: *Graziano v. Harrison*, 950 F.2d 107, 113 (3rd Cir.1991), *Dunham v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC*, 663 F.3d 997, 1002 (8th Cir. 2011), *Clark v. Capital Credit &amp; Collection Servs. Inc.*, 460 F.3d 1162, 1173 (9th Cir.2006), *Maynard v. Cannon*, 401 F. App'x 389 (10th Cir. 2010),  *Azar v. Hayter*, 874 F.Supp. 1314, 1317 (N.D.Fla.), *aff'd*, 66 F.3d 342 (11th Cir.1995).

You indicated that the university sold the debt to a collector. This is a very common practice typically referred to as an ""assignment.""  The collector buys the debt, usually for much less than is actually owed, hoping that they can get you to pay and make a profit.

The rights of the debt buyer vary depending on the state, the contract between the original parties, and a bunch of other things but the fact of the matter is that people can buy your debt and you then owe them money.

Looking at the web page of the collector, they are putting themselves out there as squeaky clean [ACA](http://www.acainternational.org/) members. The ACA is an organization of collectors who spend lots and lots of money to convince people that debt collectors are not going to eat your children.  They even have a [consumer friendly website!](http://www.askdoctordebt.com/).

If it were me, I'd call them.  Ask them to confirm that the creditor does own the debt and then, if they do own it, I'd work something out but **make sure you get any agreement in writing BEFORE you pay**.","1346459133"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The official story has Bin Laden, 19 hijackers and a few other advisors that planned the whole thing. Now, the same amount of people that was in the official story could have also organised the whole thing with no one else knowing. Nobody apart from the organisers and terrorists had to know about it at any level. This could have been planned in a board room for all we know amongst a small party of people. 

The terrorist recruitment would be done in the same way as it is always done. A intelligence asset handler or recruiter is given an identity and history that fits in with his mission narrative. He may be of Middle Eastern appearance with work history, family etc all in place to make his story 100% legitimate. He recruits young men from local Madrasahs and funds their entire training and operation with them believing the whole time they are fighting for a Jihad outfit, not  x government.

The only thing I know is, the whole story of 9/11 has not been told buy the US government and the people who are suspected of been involved certainly had motive and also past intention to target the countries that were targeted in the wars after 9/11. The idea that people cannot believe a set of people who knowingly went to war and caused over 4000 troop deaths in Iraq, over 2000 in Afghanistan, over 100,000 civilian deaths in Iraq, 10,000's in Afghanistan and millions displaced wouldn't kill just over 3000 people to get what they want is ridiculous.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Good sir, I would like to humbly disagree. I did not attribute my quote to anyone. So there is no way to know if I miss-quoted.

I was just trying to make a point about how it takes away from our entire political system, and also takes away from rational debate, when you not only lie, but then openly admit that it's pretty much your game plan to lie. Now we can just all go around spouting crap that we know to be totally false, or at least a misrepresentation, and just shout it loud and over again, and come November we'll just see which party yells louder... Super.

The Romney approved ad saying Obama ""gutted"" medicare by removing the work requirement is also patently false. However, it has shown to be their most effective ad yet, and they are outspending Obama 3 to 1 in order to air that and others like it.

The election process should be held to a better standard than this. How can we have faith in our officials if every single election is just pure unadulterated lies with not even a thin fishing line back to anything that would even resemble truth. These are the people we need to run our country and it is being decided by whomever can lie the biggest and spend the most money on it. It's no wonder our politics are mocked worldwide.

A lot of people complain about /r/politics becoming a shit show circlejerk. All I can say to that is art imitates life. Why would a bunch of younger men behave with any rational arguments or logical debate, when our very well paid representatives can't even must an effort to do so?

It's a familiar boy meets girl, girl hangs out with boy, etc. tale. An independent film from New York that's light on the dialogue, extremely light on the philosophical dialogue that *Sunrise/Sunset* have, but it's charming nonetheless.

They share very little about themselves to the audience and each other, and they do very little -- a race in a park, playing a keyboard, looking at some art -- it's all quite throwaway, but I couldn't stop myself from enjoying it, perhaps because that sort of spontaneous day full of nothings quite appeals.

I have a great deal of experience with homeschoolers (do not confuse with unschoolers). Traditionally the children are better educated, score better on standardized tests and get along much better with a wide range of kids in different age groups and social backgrounds. I have also found that most (although I have run into a few that are kind of scary) are more self confident, don't suffer from the esteem issues that are often attributed to public schooling.","1346459156"
"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;According to your argument the man has to either choose between having sex with someone he knows will abort or consenting to parenthood or providing support. He also has to hope contraceptives don't fuck up.

Yep, just like a mother has to decide is she wants to abort, give up for adoption, or keep and *hope* the father stick around or at least will pay his share. Sex has risks attatched and life isn't fair. Why should the father get to have sex risk free?

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Alright enough with this condescending sarcasm.. You're acting like a jabroni.

I have in fact watched every episode of Community, because I still believe that it is a hit or miss. My personal opinion of Community is that it is a rarely funny show. Community to me is not really a comedy. Sure, there is some comedy relief from time to time but it is mostly cheesy low brow humor that most people can see from a mile away. Very cliche. 

However, Community is very entertaining. The character development and the storytelling has been very good, yes, but I made that comment about the show being unoriginal because I remember myself saying multiple times that they are doing a silly parody of another show or something unoriginal. I felt that they starting ""jumping the shark"" after the middle of season two, actually. BUT... But most episodes are still very much entertaining, yet not funny to me for the most part.

Let me also say that I have only watched all of the Community seasons once, so I might of misjudged Community. That is because I guess I appreciate real shows that actually make me laugh. I re-watch over and over again the greats like The Office, Parks and Recreation, Workaholics, and, of course, Its Always Sunny.. The greatest ever. (I can name more off-air shows, but lets stay contemporary.)

I'll continue watching those comedies and continue rewatching them over and over, because they are completely original and make me laugh every time.. They always have fresh new material and are not a hit or miss to me. They are truly the best comedies out right now.

But who am I to judge? Idk.. It's just what I think.. I'm actually going to school for Writing and hopefully can be able to write for the shows that I'm sure me and you love one day.. I truly love TV comedies. Although, I think our sense of humor is a little different.. But not that far off.

And are you kidding me man?? Big Bang Theory?! lol jeez'...

"MLPdrawingschool","t5_2skv4","&gt; I got so frustrated I said ""screw this, I am going to barf on this canvas and not give a crap what happens"". Above picture happened. And you know what? I liked it.

When you aren't worried about how the end product will look, you get more relaxed, and more adaptable. It lets you look at the piece as a whole, make more of those connections in your head, and the whole thing looks better as a result. Being frustrated or nervous will trip you up every time, and it's especially bad if you're really passionate about your work. And that's why your [assignment] is this: Stop caring.

Don't get me wrong, you still have to make the effort and work on improving and do your best, like you're doing already, but stop caring if it looks bad, or if it's not the best piece you've ever made, or (especially) if people will think it's ""good"" when you're done. You did that with this piece, and liked the results. So do it again. And again, after that. I can promise your art will look a lot better, and it'll be a lot more fun.

&gt; One last question to you for complicated reasons: What motivates you to do art?

Storytelling. I can always imagine stuff in my head and have it be really cool, but I can't share them without learning to basically write a story with pictures. I try to focus on how I can best change aspects of my art to communicate ideas or feelings to a viewer, and get the response I want back. It's especially nice getting gradually more ""fluent"" and having ideas kind of come together easier, since there's less and less of that ""It doesn't look like it did in my head"" feeling.","1346459159"

"malaysia","t5_2qh8b","Lesen kopi/terbang is a small part of it.  The simple fact is that we just don't give a fuck about other people nowadays. It's not just on the roads; try getting on public transport during rush hour the way you *should*, and watch a whole ton of bastards just jump right in front of you. In a similar vein, I was once queueing up to pay for petrol during a drive on a long holiday (pump card readers were all offline), and one lady just simply skipped the entire queue of maybe 20 people, with the ones in front having lined up for five minutes. I called her out on it to her face, in full hearing of everyone in the kiosk, and she didn't have the decency to be ashamed about what she did, just looking back at me in a hostile manner and saying an obviously insincere ""Sorry lah"".

We just don't give a fuck anymore.

I've had idiots cutting in front of me at full tilt and almost clipping me just so they can get into the Touch n Go lane a little faster. And it's not always some thinks-he's-a-high-powered-exec cock in a BMW TSi Quattro SSX-Class either; it's just as frequently a lunatic with a Kancil filled with his 1-5 year old offspring jumping around without fucking seatbelts.

We just don't give a fuck anymore.

Ever tried changing lanes during rush hou traffic? Oh, that's right; you can't. Not onecar will give way to you andwhenever there *is* a gap an entire battalion of motorcycles will speed and honk at you without slowing down onebit, fuully confident that you will give way to them.

We just don't give a fuck anymore.

Sometimes, the powers that be set fucking absurd speed limits on roads that simply can handle more. But seriously, driving at 150 kph on them? While tailgating another guy doing the same speed with barely an inch between you two? And driving up at full tilt right until you almost touch the bumper of another car using the fast lane to overtake a kilometer-long slow moving queue, LED halogen lights at full blast, honking your horn, hoping to terrorize the sane person in frontof you into driving at dangerous speeds?

We just don't give a fuck anymore is the simple answer.  It's ""I I I me me me mine mine mine"" now. And those of us who *do* give a fuck usually end up getting killed or severely injured by those who don't.  ","1346459171"

Despite game 3 being a close game for a long time, I don't think Legion were ever in the driver's seat there.  CLG may have been taken to 3 games (unlike any of the other semi-finalists), but to me, they may be the most dangerous team left in the tournament.","1346459173"

SLBM, ICBM, and bomber-delivered nukes were all targeted at the same targets redundantly in case some failed to get through and due to inter-service rivalries that had branches fighting over targets.

He never said who did it, but we all knew. Things went on like that for awhile - prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. The Sisters kept at him - sometimes he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not. And that's how it went for Andy - that was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him, and I also believe that if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him.""

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","Me and my 2 friends started...almost completely differently than you.

We were hanging out after class(college) and decided to go to a few stores that were close by, shits n giggles, nothing else planned for the day. So We went to Toys R Us, and were goofing off, and started playing with the Nerf swords. Then we thought it would be fun/ny to get the nerf guns and shoot at each other in the back yard of one of their houses(friend 1), its a nice size, we thought that would be fun.

Looking at the guns, they have different varieties, and a few of them shoot little water pellets(i thought that was pretty cool), and we were just shooting the breeze, when friend 2 mentions paintball, and friend 1 comments on how its expensive, and we hated on it for a while, typical banter for non-paintballers. Then friend 1 mentions airsoft, and how he had picked up a nice little spring pistol from a flea market...And so a week later when we got together again we went to walmart(shoot me now) and I picked up a noob clear spring(i thought it was a good deal, like $15 and it came with a lazer!) and friend 2 picked up one of the full plastic(gears and stock) M4 AEG's, and we went back to friend 1's house. Unraveling everything, neither of our guns shoot horribly well, but we bought them so we figured we would at least have a game. Went out to the woods near where friend 1 lives(good thing about Florida, forests everywhere) and played...

Lasted 20 minutes before ragequitting and now we know better and have metal gearboxes and not 20 dollar walmart brand guns...

Funny trivialty, we joked about paintball being expensive, but putting money into gear and shit, Ive spend more than friend 1 but less than 2, and ive probably put at least $5-600 down already(M14, side arm, and then gear)","1346459181"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","I'd prefer they went a different route and forced each team to be within +/-50 total population of each other, with a minimum cap of 300, so that all forces were forced to be close to even regardless of continental population.  With 3 continents, this should prevent any one side from getting screwed over due to overpop, and it'd force some sense of balance at all times.

It's much more important that the 3 sides stay balanced despite one side having more available population than making sure that all 3 are capped at any given number.  And that's still, assuming worse case scenario of each pop being at 300 but one's at 350, a 16.5% advantage towards the pop that's capped out, which is a far cry from one side being at 700 while the others are at 500.  That's still 37% of the population (350 versus the other 2 at 300) but at least it can't ever approach 40% under such a system without having extremely low population numbers.","1346459182"

However, I tear up at stuff rather easily, but it's never noticed by people.

In it, the author draws attention to a simple, now-vandalised, plaque placed by an anonymous soldier's mother on one of the forts after the battle. It reads:

*A mon Fils, depuis que tes yeux sont fermes, les miens n'ont cessé de fleurer.*

People are using the same password and emails across multiple websites and with the large amount of hacking's lately the people responsible more than likely have a HUGE database of this information.

I personally haven't been hacked, I have Gmail Authentication, ArenaNet's Authentication and change my password specifically for every service that I use. It really just seems like a lot of this is on the end of the userbase and not on ArenaNet's side.

Due to the amount of people that seem to have been hacked combined with the people asking to be unbanned and the normal tickets there is more than likely a larger than normal delay as a result.","1346459195"

The idea of not reading while writing, lest it ""morph"" your story is rather silly. 

You might be reading less while writing a great deal... but that is an issue of time and interest, not of fear of books as subconscious mind infiltrators. 

If you're reading a lot of fiction with a particular voice, it might start to effect your writing. But bear in mind two things: One, its reasonably easy to recognize this. Two, whatever your reading was published, and therefore has something, however small, going for it. 

Short of copying something down word by word, there is no such thing as ""stealing"" when you write. There are no muses. You write from what you experience. 

Stopping reading while writing is rather like trying to stop thinking while speaking. ","1346459197"

Perhaps you should work on that reading comprehension?

As I said, I never attributed those specific arguments to you. They're just made by people as shady and ignorant as you.

&gt;You call me a stalker as you searched my entire internet history. lol. Dude, by all means, go on. If I ever feel creeped out, the sheer quantity of data on me you have posted here is probably sufficient to have your mod rights removed, at least.

I sure did see what your username was associated with after you popped in here. I'm not going to be demodded for looking at your username. You can have as much of a fit as you want, it's just you trying to distance yourself from yourself.

&gt;I can certainly tell you I am entertained. I honestly don't get your reasoning. It seems to basically just make wild claims, and when you loose, copypasta everything said to you back to OP.

I'm not even sure what your last sentence means there. But great that you can laugh at yourself, I know it's certainly amused others who know what they're talking about. You've aid some truly stupid things.

&gt;I admit I make some wild claims, both in ignorance and knowledge. But at the very least, I source my claims with logic and reasoning, rather than claim that I'm right because I am.

You make stupid claims. You make insane claims. You make claims with no evidence to support them. You have engaged neither logic or rational reason in your claims. You've engaged the bullshit center of your brain to make a stupid claim even crazier. Logic and rational thought lead to none of the claims which you've made which boil down to, two things which you aren't educated enough to tell apart look the same to you, therefore they are derived from the same. I'm not right because I say I am, I'm right because it's what every piece of objective evidence points to. That multiple cultures build a bottom heavy geometric structure and have handrails is not proof of derivative works. ","1346459200"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;Perhaps not, but the fact is that every violent dictator in recent history has enforced very strict gun control that I'm aware of.

And so do many liberal democracies, so there is no logic to what you are saying.

&gt;You misunderstood entirely, I am literally referring to bears, mountain lions and rabid dogs.

Yeah I wasn't sure. In this case I see no reason to stop people from carrying a gun, but this is dramatically different to walking around suburbia with a gun in your pocket. It is also going to call for a radically different weapon, these kinds of arguments don't justify everyone having a right to a glock. In Australia we banned semi-automatics and continue to allow registered ownership of rifles and such for this very reason. 

&gt;The times you will need an airbag and a seat belt are pretty infrequent too.

I'm sorry I just can't see owning a gun as the same thing here. If you want to make this comparison then you should compare this to a flack jacket or something. A better comparison would be to say I should be able to drive around in a monster truck, because that way if I ever get in an accident its more likely that I'll just ruin the other guy and drive off unharmed. 

Guns are weapons, using them is an act of aggression not defence. That is basically where I stand, and you won't convince me otherwise, nor will you convince me that people should be allowed to just carry them around.","1346459200"

No, that is simply not true. Their own release stated that the reason for the downgrade was the dysfunctional state of our government.

It is true that for months we were being warned that we needed to decrease our deficit. However, that isn't the reason we were downgraded. If we didn't have the debt ceiling debate they would have kept on warning us like everyone else did.","1346459204"

I'm pretty socially inept in some situations. I never really dated, don't go out and party, drink socially with family/very close friends only, and live a pretty boring life. All in all I didn't miss out on anything I didn't miss out on the first 11 years of school. 

I'm sure there might be kids a little more in trouble socially than most if they were homeschooled for longer, but no worse off than the extremely unfortunate kids in public school. For example: Fat kids, red heads, goths, emos, 'slow' kids, poor kids, nerdy, skinny kids, tall kids, etc. If you're not fucking perfect in school, you're going to be discriminated against and it's going to hurt. 

 You know what though? I'm a better person for all of the shit I put up with during school. I'm nicer, treat people how I want to be treated, and I try my best to be friendly to anyone and everyone I meet. I got lucky in the end honestly, I was a poor, fat, red headed, nerdy kid.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Trogodytes serve the realms as a primary example of communication barriers.  Descended from marshes and swamps neighboring large mountain-ranges, 'Dytes have a hard time acclimating to the alien demands of apish humanoids.  Hailing from regions almost devoid of human life, 'Dytes developed a complex non-verbal language system so that members of their races can communicate without alerting predators.  With under-developed vocal chords and overdeveloped sweat glands that can be consciously changed to help them hide their scents in almost any habitat, 'Dytes have actually learned to communicate by transmitting scents.

A 'Dyte's cave is a humble thing to look upon at first.  With roughly four to six 'Dytes occupying a single enclosure, their home can appear rather garish with animal carcasses hanging from sticks, dead humanoids laying about and an abominable smell radiating from everything, most humanoids fail to identify the advanced state of 'Dyte society.  With individual scents being able to convey ideas, warnings, and even poetry, 'Dytes inscribe most of their local history on the walls of their home and use it to educate their children as they come of age so that they can also learn to adapt and blend in within their region.  'Dytes are also possibly the first race to discover alchemy, and have learned to create different alchemical formulas by letting them ferment in the stomachs of dead animals.  

Also, despite various rumors to the contrary, most 'Dytes find humans and other members of the ""Gorilla Peoples"" (such as Dwarves, Gnomes, Elves, etc.) to taste bad and provide too little nourishment for the work required to kill them.  Also, given the garish articles and complete inability to hide their scent from most predators, 'Dytes regard most of these races as barbaric invaders who harass most areas with brute tactics and become puzzled that predators are alerted to their apish locations after traipsing about in completely useless iron-plated camouflage that prevents them from swimming.  'Dytes are not saintly, however, and regard most humanoids with violence thanks to what historians now call the Goblin's Greeting Fiasco of 229 D.Y. (Kobold Calendar).

Goblins were the first of the ""lung-speaking"" races to bridge the language divide with the semi-amphibious Troglodytes.  Gormat Godkin, a Goblin scholar who stood at a colossal 5' 1"", figured out a rough imitation that 'Dytes could understand using vials of perfume in what he later called ""StinkSpeak.""  Troglodytes present were ecstatic to commune with another race, but were completely blind to his motives.

Gormat Godkin was in a rather bitter feud with a chain of humanoid villages that were fighting back against his caravan raids, and when a troglodyte encountered on the road ran away after Gormat broke a stolen perfume vial an accidentally shouted ""FIRE, RUN!"" in Troglodyte.  Before the Troglodyte fled, he completely changed his scent to confer a thank you and a blessing on Gormat and the next three generations of his offspring.  Noting the seemingly deliberate change in stench, Gormat put two and two together and began his plan.

Gormat wasn't able to say much, but what he did get across horrified the Troglodytes.  The Ape-folk, he claimed, liked to celebrate the building of bridges by killing Troll children and tossing them into the streams, engaged in horrific rituals where their females laid eggs inside their stomachs, and the males of the ape-folk would claw them out of the abdomen and kill their women.  Gormat also explained that in current Ape Hives, Troglodyte skulls were displayed in their wood-caves and 'Dyte skin was used to make their clothing.

Gormat won and lost at the same time.  After the 'Dytes raided the villages and found no Troglodyte clothing, they exacted their revenge by killing Gormat himself for misleading them.  However, the damage had already been done, and when the humans attempted to track the troglodytes back to their caves to murder them it started a cultural divide that to this day hasn't been properly mended.

All of this would have been lost to history had it not been for the work of Samory the Observant, a Kobold slave of Gormat and also his scribe.  Despite his diligent research, however, Samory has refused to translate his findings into Common or Elven given their propensity to kill most Kobolds on site and not recognize his people as one of the Higher Races.  Instead, Samory has been putting the final touches on his Magnum Opus: a scroll for Troglodytes that outlines the majority of humanoid weaknesses as well as a recounting of the various ""Anti-Trog Laws"" passed in most humanoid towns and cities.","1346459212"

That being said, I think they should clear up the ambiguity with child pornography laws. After United States v. Dost in 1986, 6 criteria were created to judge with child pornography, the problem is that they are incredibly vague.

&gt; * Whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area.

&gt; * Whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity.

&gt; * Whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child.

&gt; *Whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude.

&gt; * Whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.

&gt; * Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

All of these are incredibly vague.

1: How can you accurately prove that the focal point is the child's genitalia or pubic area?

2: Who decides what is sexually suggestive? What poses are generally associated with sexual activity?

3: What is an unnatural pose? How are they determined? What is inappropriate attire? Who defines what that is?

4: Self-explanatory

5: Who determines what sexual coyness is? How can one measure the willingness to engage in sexual activity? How do you know that is being suggested.

6: How can they measure whether or not it was intended to elicit a sexual response? What metric do they use for that?

It's basically rubbish, without scientific evidence to back up that criteria, it's mostly just opinion. ","1346459219"

I have been researching the effects of MDMA for a long time now, but I never try to pass off anything I say as fact, because truth is, we just don't really know. The study of MDMA is so vast that it eludes conclusive findings and even highly qualified scientists can't give you definitive answers. It's also a scheduled drug which makes studying it extremely difficult. By all means take everything I say with a grain of salt, **I encourage it**. What I don't encourage however, is the general tone of ignorance that accompanies this forum about the possible damage of MDMA. Most of what is passed off is just perpetuated broscience and subjective experience. I strive constantly to be one of the few voices of reason because we *KNOW* that MDMA can cause *REAL* damage.

The studies done in mice and primates indicate neurotoxicity. The overwhelming majority of evidence points towards neurotoxicity in humans. These were not perfect studies, so many drug-enthusiasts try to dismiss them because of this. Truth is, **we will never have a perfect study.** The nervous system is one of the most difficult and elusive areas to study. But why do we need the perfection in the first place? It's like playing russian roulette with your mind.

What I post here are points generally agreed upon by the scientific community. **I post the best possible explanations backed by the most amount of evidence**. This is what the study of science is all about. I try never to speak in ultimatums because absolute truths simply do not exist.

I think it's sad the amount of ignorance that perpetuates around this subreddit sometimes. It's so biased and one-sided it's become just as bad as going to the DEA site to get info. What we should be trying to do is minimize the damage, not aggrandize them.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","NFL players are all contracted to the NFL, rather than the individual teams. The NFL is one business, but footballers are contracted to individual clubs, each of which is its own business. Footballers are essentially assets for the business to which they are contracted, and each asset has its value that is dependent on several factors such as ability, importance to their team, remaining length of contract, and star status. Given the limited period for buying and selling, negotiation is cut-throat as each club tries to get itself the best deal. Once two clubs have agreed a fee, then the buying club also has to agree a new contract with the player.

A loan deal is exactly what it sounds like: The club who own the player's contract agree to send the player to another club for a fixed period, usually for a fee and/or a percentage of the player's wages, and the player will return after that period (unless the loan deal includes a clause for the player to be bought for a pre-agreed price).

Some footballers do earn $100m over five years. Wayne Rooney at Man Utd, for example, is reputedly on £250k per week. That's £13,000,000m a year, equalling £65m - or $103m - over five years.

Christiano Ronaldo likely received none of the £80m fee that RM paid to Man Utd. Some players may have a clause in their contract for a percentage of any transfer fee but I don't think that's very common. The transfer fee is paid from club to the other for the purchase of an asset. Ronaldo will make a lot of money from wages and image rights, as well as his sponsorship deals.

**TL;DR:** Don't compare it to the NFL Draft, compare it to a cattle market. I'll buy two of your cows please, I've loaned that guy's prize bull for a few days. My farm will do much better this breeding season now.","1346459227"

Replace cat with god. Remember, if I reject the axiom that gods exist, you first have to prove that axiom before your assertions begin to make a lick of logical sense. 

&gt;How we believe in God is that he is the most perfect being- simply because he created us. Anything he says is law since he gave us the basic gift of life- and salvation. In that sense, what did your cat give us?

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","This is exactly what is missing from modern FPS games, a lack of depth and a lack of advantage to the most skilled players.

The best example for me is Counter-Strike - several changes were made with the release of 1.4 that nerfed advantages skilled players had. Sorry for digressing here off the topic of Quake, but it might help illustrate what you are saying for some of the younger readers here who never experienced QW firsthand.

1. They made guns far more inaccurate while moving. Skilled players are much better at aiming while moving, especially at close range, and this put the advantage back with the camper and changed the pace of the game - rushing tactics became far less effective, things like circle strafing just led to being killed.

2. They removed silent run (tapping the movement key instead of holding down shift allowed you to 'walk' faster once you figured the trick out). Again, this slowed the game down.

3. They took out awp fastswitch - this was a technique where it was possible to switch from the sniper rifle to a pistol (or back) almost instantly, allowing the AWP to be used as an assault weapon. When mastered, it allowed a player to dominate with no support, even against multiple opponents simultaneously but it required very high levels of skill. You'd only see the top 5% or so of players using this technique, and the rest would be frustrated by their inability. Removing this took out probably the most spectactular aspect of CS from the spectator's point of view, and made the AWP far more of a slow-paced/ tactical weapon.

4. They reduced the accuracy of various guns (most notably the MP5), so that the bullets do not go where you are aiming the crosshair, but in a random pattern around it. This in effect replaces skill with luck and makes things more palatable for the noob.

The effects that these changes had were imo that:

1. CS became a 3 weapon game of just the M4, AK and AWP as a support weapon. In earlier versions, other guns could be worth buying too (particularly the mp5), but SMGs became pointless since you couldn't move while shooting.

2. CS became far slower paced and less exciting to watch and play. The popularity of HLTV etc seemed to plateau a lot earlier than it would have done because of this. Maps like de_dust became unsuitable for competition because the coordinated terrorist rush was no longer an effective tactic, and matches became slow affairs with 3 or 5 minutes per round of people creeping around, with some maps being almost hopeless for the attacking terrorist team and even matches having scores per half like 14-1 0-15.

3. Tactics became more important than skill on everything except FFA servers. When I play 1.6 now I am almost always top of the leaderboard on FFA servers but I just can't be bothered with the ponderous playstyle needed to not get taken out by campers playing teams. 

This in my opinion, as a result of Valve listening to whining noobs on their forums, killed CS. I didn't like source and I don't really want to try the new version.

**This is also why there are no good new DM games that make waves like Doom, QW and Q3A did**, because they fell into the same trap of 'accessability' - the need for first time players to have scores that aren't embarrassing so those with ADHD don't get upset or put off. But for me it was what made these games great, the fact that there was so much to learn. ","1346459232"

For everyone who is thinking piracy killed them, think about this.

Bandai US has had a horrible marketing department. A while back they announced they were disappointed with sales of Nichijou...... BUT HARDLY ANYONE EVEN KNEW THEY LICENSED IT LET ALONE RELEASED ANYTHING!

The same can be said for pretty much all of their releases in the past few years. ***How are we supposed to buy your product if you don't announce you're even selling it, or even hype it up at all??***

Blame their horrible marketing, not the pirates. I've been waiting to buy a ton of series from them for ages, a couple of which they *apparently* have already licensed and are distributing. Where was the announcement? Where were the trailers? I'm not alone in this either, a few of my friends are a bit pissed about this as well.

Wasn't there a quote from the Bandai CEO or someone from the Japanese side of the company that said something along the lines of *""Bandai US simply doesn't understand their market""*? I swear I read that somewhere not too long ago.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I had a discussion with someone else about this and we think the problem is in understand the true meaning of the statements.  

Does Ms. Rinehart believe that those who earn a daily wage through honest work shouldnt complain about those who own millions/billions of dollars?

Does she mean those who do nothing but drink/play all day should complain about those with money, either those who earn a living/daily wage and/or those with millions/billions of dollars?

If she means the latter, then yes I agree that those who work, who do their 9-5 should earn money and those who dont make an effort to work, shouldnt earn money.

If she means the former,  as in, you arent a billionaire/millionaire, because you DONT work hard, then she is partially full of shit.  I have no doubt that hard work does come into play when she took over her fathers business and I do believe she is a hard working person.  But I dont believe that her hard work is so astronomically more than the average persons that that is what propelled her into being a millionaire/billionaire.  I do believe inheriting your fathers Mining Company along with 72 Million probably had alot more to do with her fortune than her hard work alone.  

I think luck also has a little bit to do with success.  Having opportunities available to you as well as being at the right place at the right time.  I have no doubt Bill Gates worked hard to be where he is, but to say that Bill didnt take advantage of the computer technology that had been developed years earlier would be to not give credit to those who did all the ground work as well.  The era of computing was becoming alot more affordable at the time, and so no doubt there needed to be an OS with which people could interact with.  

Dont get me wrong though, I dont think luck/right time right place is the biggest factor in terms of becoming a millionaire or billionaire, but I do believe it plays a part in it.   

But again I dont know where she stands exactly, businessinsider has the full quote on their website and it actually seems to be a little less damning but also at the same time a little more damning.  

""Let's get through the class warfare smokescreen. We need to regain our roots and encourage people to invest and build. There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire. If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain; do something to make more money yourself — spend less time drinking, or smoking and socializing, and more time working. Become one of those people who work hard, invest and build, and at the same time create employment and opportunities for others. Australia needs such people.

""

The fact she mentions investing in her country and creating employment opportunities for others is nice, and I totally agree with it.  The fact she mentions class warfare has me a little worried that she may be against higher taxes for those who earn astronomically more than the average person, which I disagree with (but which is also a point of contention in my country, the U.S.)  I believe those kind of taxes are the reinvesting she is talking about, i.e. instead of her sitting on top of those billions of dollars, at least some of it should be taken out and reinvested back into the people of Australia, a million dollars could create many new middle class jobs.","1346459239"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A huge amount of law enforcement resources (police, prisons, courts) are spent on victimless crimes like non-violent drug offenses, prostitution, and underage drinking.  We would be a lot safer and better off if those resources were focused on real crime instead.

Many innocent people are pressured to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit, since they fear being found guilty and given a much longer sentence.  Some people say ""I didn't do it, but I don't want to risk it.  I can do two years, I can't do ten years.""  And most public defenders are either incompetent, or well-meaning and capable but totally overworked.  While there needs to be some sentencing incentive to plead guilty, there shouldn't be a huge gap like that so that many innocents get trapped, and we need to make sure that every defendant gets a competent lawyer who isn't too overloaded to represent them effectively.

Many laws are not enforced evenly against all segments of society.  That's especially true of the drug laws, which are enforced harshly against blacks and Latinos and the poor, and hardly at all against middle and upper-class whites.

I think the problem of frivolous lawsuits is exaggerated, but does exist to some extent.  They need a better way to sanction people who do bring frivolous or harassing lawsuits.

Most juries are not able to understand complicated medical or scientific issues.  Medical malpractice cases for example should be brought before a panel of qualified experts, not a jury of people off the street.","1346459244"

It is ignorant to ignore the the scientists and studies, *especially* if one doesn't understand the science. Its also not ""unscientific"" to point that out, whether or not you personally understand the science.

&gt;Science relies on the principle of falsifiability for continued progress. That means that no matter how sure you are of something, you have to be open to new data that may contradict it.

Yes, and the deniers fail to offer any new data.

&gt;I have seen too many people make reasonable cases in support of their doubts about global warming (with citations) only to be met with immediate ridicule rather than an intelligent response. 

well that does speak ill of the person responding, but at the same time, imo, they are really rather ignorant, and if they have come to that conclusion despite overwhelming consensus over a decade old, i don't see much hope in convincing them. Usually i kind of roll my eyes and point out the obvious, without being condescending about it.

&gt;Often, these people know far more about the subject than the people who label them as ignorant.

i have definitely not come across this. They often have all the talking point lined up. But not actual knowledge, and generally not much critical thinking skills, almost all have suggested(i used to get into these debates a lot, like 3-4 years ago) that scientists were coming to false conclusions for grant money (face:desk)

&gt;Basically, I just don't like seeing non-scientists who have no clue about a subject try to borrow the credibility of legitimate research that they haven't even read in order to fuel their own condescending rants.

as apposed to non-scientists bashing and ignoring the scientists? 
us -&gt; scientists are smart and say there is global warming
them -&gt; no they aren't.

&gt; Science is about openly discussing data that may challenge your theory

its open to SCIENTISTS. If there were scientists having this debate, yes, fine. Great, debate. the point is that there ISN'T a debate. At least not a terribly controversial one. Yes, lots of specifics are being debated, ie, degrees of significance.","1346459249"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Well, a simple look at the Christian sects will show that a single idea of god can have numerous interpretations - there are other examples in other religions of differing interpretations of the same single idea of another god. Quite simply, if there is a god, 99.9% of all religions have to be wrong. It's either every religion except one is wrong, or **all** of them are wrong. They can't possibly all be right, it's simply impossible.

Denying that ancient polytheism is true, one must also deny that at *least* every other religion except one is wrong as well. If some are wrong, then others must be wrong - only one can be the right god, or none of them are the right god, or there is *no* god at all. This is what I'm trying to glean from people of various faiths - why they believe the way they do that their god is the right god.

As for me stating that I am an Atheist in the OP, I did so to clarify - but take a close look at what I've been communicating - I have been nothing but respectful towards others and their beliefs.

I'm not thrilled with the democratic platform either, but at least they're not trying to restrict civil liberties as much as the republicans.

Clearly there are important functions to government, but there are so many things that we should not be spending money on.

For what purpose?  Are the taxpayers being treated fairly?

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","I honestly don't know why you believe this. Here are excerpts from the [factsheet on circumcision](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/circumcision.htm) provided by the Centers for Disease Control.

&gt;A systematic review and meta-analysis that focused on male circumcision and heterosexual transmission of HIV in Africa was published in 2000 [5]. It included 19 cross-sectional studies, 5 case-control studies, 3 cohort studies, and 1 partner study. A substantial protective effect of male circumcision on risk for HIV infection was noted, along with a reduced risk for genital ulcer disease. 

.

&gt;Another review that included stringent assessment of 10 potential confounding factors and was stratified by study type or study population was published in 2003 [6]. Most of the studies were from Africa. Of the 35 observational studies in the review, the 16 in the general population had inconsistent results. The one large prospective cohort study in this group showed a significant protective effect: the odds of infection were 42% lower for circumcised men [7]. The remaining 19 studies were conducted in populations at high risk. These studies found a consistent, substantial protective effect, which increased with adjustment for confounding. Four of these were cohort studies: all demonstrated a protective effect, with two being statistically significant.

.

&gt;Three randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted in Africa to determine whether circumcision of adult males will reduce their risk for HIV infection. The study conducted in South Africa [9] was stopped in 2005, and those in Kenya [10] and Uganda [11] were stopped in 2006 after interim analyses found a statistically significant reduction in male participants’ risk for HIV infection from medical circumcision.
In these studies, men who had been randomly assigned to the circumcision group had a 60% (South Africa), 53% (Kenya), and 51% (Uganda) lower incidence of HIV infection compared with men assigned to the wait-list group to be circumcised at the end of the study.

.

&gt;Male circumcision may also have a role in the prevention of HIV transmission in the United States. CDC consulted with external experts in April 2007 to receive input on the potential value, risks, and feasibility of circumcision as an HIV prevention intervention in the United States and to discuss considerations for the possible development of guidelines.

.

&gt;As CDC proceeds with the development of public health recommendations for the United States, individual men may wish to consider circumcision as an additional HIV prevention measure, but they must recognize that circumcision 1) does carry risks and costs that must be considered in addition to potential benefits; 2) has only proven effective in reducing the risk of infection through insertive vaginal sex; and 3) confers only partial protection and should be considered only in conjunction with other proven prevention measures (abstinence, mutual monogamy, reduced number of sex partners, and correct and consistent condom use).","1346459261"

I've been hoping/rooting for third party from the time I found out about [Badnarik](http://www.ontheissues.org/Michael_Badnarik.htm) in the 2004 elections but as with Ralph Nader and Ross Perot in the past, the fear of third party candidates splitting the vote keep D2 and R3 in line for most part - they turn out in less numbers because they're less enthusiastic, maybe, and that can make a difference, but they rarely ""throw away their vote"".

If the U.S. adopts other voting systems like Approval voting, then third party candidates stand a better chance, but until then, that's unlikely. In the meanwhile, we'll still have two parties, but the way change manifests itself is in the changing character and charter of the parties.

Edit : And oh, to answer your question, yes, I can see some of R3 voting Gary Johnson this time, for eg., and if some of D2 will probably vote green or Johnson, but the majority of R3 and D2 will still probably stick to party lines.

Start with examining what exactly it is that you're worried about, followed by WHY you feel that way. Why are you so threatened?

There is absolutely no need to rush into this, and that could actually be really devastating for your relationship. Take things super slow.

Okay, some people spoke out, but it was generally met with the response, ""Well, that's a shame, but you know...the President has to do these sorts of things sometimes.""

No, no he doesn't. And if Bush had done it, you bet your ass that it would have been yelled about *everywhere*, accompanied by droves of comparisons to Hitler. In doing this, Obama has denied the specific set of fundamental human rights established at the founding of our nation and set a precedent whereby any future president can now kill anyone for anything without any trial or evidence. It makes me absolutely livid that this man can somehow be awarded the Nobel Peace Price. What an absolute joke.

As for his healthcare system, it still amazes me that so many people seem to know so little about its fundamental organization. It does nothing about insurance companies constantly charging more to drive up profits other than freeing them from the rules of a market economy by forcing consumers to purchase their product. It does nothing about pharmaceutical companies inventing disorders and paying doctors to prescribe their medications at insane costs other than killing importation reform to prevent competitors from other countries from offering reasonable alternatives to overpriced medication. It does nothing about the neglected field of free health centers other than increasing their costs by requiring significantly more reporting to qualify for grants.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Thank you for your post.

It has been annoying me for a while that people don't understand even the basics of the EC.  Some people seem to even forget it exists.  They say things like, ""If we don't vote for ___, everything is going to hell in a handbasket"" when they often don't live in states where their vote really matters.  People take issue with my decision to vote for Gary Johnson, but Obama is going to win this state regardless of what I do.  

I think to have issues with the popular vote vs. the EC is misplaced.  We honestly don't know what the true popular vote is because the EC does affect if some people vote or not and also how the politicians campaign.  Perhaps if some states weren't ""guaranteed"" blue or red, people's voting behavior might be different.  We don't know.  

Personally, I don't know if the EC is a good thing or not.  I think we have plenty of tyranny of the majority as it is and I'm not sure if going to a popular vote would change much in that regard.  I think that it is certainly possible that campaigns would start *even earlier* and have to spend a lot more money because they would have more ground to cover, rather than just the 10 or so states they do now.  

But maybe if the average person felt like they mattered as much whether they lived in California or Iowa or Wyoming, things would be different and people would care more about the process.  Or they would just do what they did before.  Hard to say.  

I also don't think that the EC would keep us from electing Kang or Kodos and instead go with a third party in that situation.  Maybe...but I'm not convinced.  I don't see how the members of the EC would be smarter than the rest of us.  ","1346459270"

Of course our ability to vote does not stem from our intelligence (hence why owning land and passing literacy tests are no longer necessary) it stems from the basic principle of our declaration of independence: No taxation without representation. This extrapolates to, no authority without representation. Implying that regardless of who we are relative to one another we are all governed and in a democracy have a right to say how we are governed.

Edit: I would actually say that the voting age needs to be lowered to 15 or 16. Most kids (18-20) don't vote anyway but I feel that minors are more and more being given the responsibilities of adults (prison) but none of the benefits (independence, lack of first-amendment rights/curfew, in-ability to control your own finances to prepare for your future).","1346459272"

"reformstorm","t5_2uhlg","Diversity gives a wider array of tools with which to deal with adversity.  Diversity means that if a niche needs to be filled, then there is more likely to be a person, or group of people, with the skills or mentality to fill that niche. 

When problems arise that need different points of view to be able to solve, then diversity gives that capability of different viewpoints.  Homogeneity leads to stagnation.

&gt;How to deal with ""diverse"" people in society? Deport them. Like I said.
&gt; 

Define what is not a ""diverse"" person in modern american society?
Do you propose to deport a 3rd generation person of Vietnamese descent?  Do you propose to deport a descendant of a black slave?  What about a person who traces their heritage back to Ireland and happily celebrates St Patricks day?  Do you deport them?  Where do you deport people to if their family has been in the USA for generations?
Or are recent Mexican immigrants the people who qualify as ""diverse"" enough to qualify for deportation.

What about a person of Native-American stock? Do they get deported? Or are they the only people who qualify as non-diverse when considered in the context of the USA.

Do you deport the Amish? Where?

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;That's pretty fucking important.

And it's pretty fucking easy to develop social skills outside of a school environment.  Let your kid play in sports leagues, take him to the park, make play dates with other parents, sign them up to a club that interests them (i.e. astronomy club, chess club, etc),  teach them how to buy/sell stuff to people in the market,  etc. etc. etc.

The commonly held idea that schools are a positive social environment and homeschooling is ""lacking"" a social environment is a complete myth.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJHt-m3VX6o

In fact, Schools often put kids into a very negative and even dangerous social environment, where they are bullied and mocked by their peers.  There is also a huge problem of drug gangs in schools, where kids in inner-city schools are being recruited into violent drug gangs at very young ages.  

Kids are  forced into school, against their will.  If they don't like it there or are even scared, they have to go else-wise they are usually subject to punishment from both the teachers and their parents.  The kids don't even get to grade their teachers, or give any kind of real input as to the quality of education they receive, and how their experience could be improved.  Often, kids can't even get away from bad teachers and it's next to impossible to fire teachers in public schools.

To put it bluntly.  I am in no way convinced that the public school system gives 2 shits about teaching the children ""social skills"".  The kids seem to be used as nothing more than collateral for the teachers unions to extort their salaries and benefits from taxpayers.","1346459293"

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","A lot is wages too. The board refuse to let us take on debt to pay wages and a lot of the players that people wanted to see brought in would have to be paid high wages.

http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2012/02/arsenals-mystery-dance.html

Read that if you dont fully understand our financial situation. I get just as pissed as everyone else when we do this, but there is a reason behind it.

Building the stadium saw us rack up a large amount of debt. These debt payments are about 20mil a year. That is 20mil that the club would normally be able to put towards player wages.

On top of this we have our kit manufacturer and sponsor deals. Both of these were made during the stadium building and most of the money from the deals was up front to help pay for the stadium. Because of this we make less annually than we would normally. These deals are both up in 2013 and 2014. Those new deals will give us more to put towards wages.

Again it all comes back to the stadium. Without the new stadium there is no doubt that we would be right up there with the best of them because the club would have somewhere around 40mil more to put towards player wages annually. We are one of the most profitable and valuable clubs in the world, our lack of ability to pay competitive wages is directly related to the building of the new stadium.

Just read the article. Our wages structure is shit, but there are other reasons beyond that that dont allow us to buy players even when it when we have money for their transfer fees. Remember there is more money involved in buying a player than simply the transfer fee, and wages is usually where Arsenal fall short.","1346459300"

Yes, there are nice guys out there who are great in bed. Part of forging a great sexual relationship is knowing what you like and how your body works. So, devote some time to figuring out how that works, and when you find a future relationship that's emotionally fulfilling, make sure that you communicate openly about your sexual needs and wants.

If you believe in karma, then start trying to do some extra good in the world. Worst case scenario you lose a little time making the world a better place to live.","1346459300"

"DepthHub","t5_2rmpy","&gt;But are you advocating the removal of some (legal) content from all reddit? 

SRS didn't shut down /r/jailbait. The admins did. SRS may have helped, but they didn't pull the trigger there. I'm sure some SRS members would love to see /r/mensrights get shut down too, but we both know that's not going to happen because they don't do anything even *questionable*, which could not be said for that little den of ~~pedo~~ephebophilia that I'm sure you're referring to.

I can advocate for the removal of /r/atheism as default, or /u/skeen and /u/tuber getting demodded all I'd like, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen. I think /u/jij is getting hamstringed by them and that he could do a lot to turn the sub into not an awful place that makes me embarrassed to call myself an atheist on reddit, but all those angry words and e-mails to media outlets wouldn't do anything, because atheism isn't questionably legal. The atheism subreddit has never and probably will never be reported on in a very negative light by a major news show. The atheism subreddit would never provoke a campaign that escaped the bounds of the site to have anything done to it. These are not things that would happen because of a sub about not believing in a magic sky fairy.

Reddit is a business first, and as a business, being known as a place that harbors pedophiles (And even if you do argue that it's ephebophilia, we both know that the common man *doesn't care about that nuance.*) is rather bad for business. 'Legal' content or not, ""[threatening the structural integrity of the greater reddit community](/r/jailbait)."" doesn't mean it made some people angry, at least to me. It means that either there was a real legal issue there, or that advertiser money was at stake, both of which threaten the structural integrity of the greater reddit community, as the presence of the former, or absence of the latter can make the greater reddit community *no longer exist*.","1346459310"

Free-market economics is applied conveniently and inconsistently by the GOP to gain votes or funding. Every major political party in the whole world does the same thing.

You also make a major implicit assumption in the inability of society to construct efficient infrastructure in the absence of a governing body with the power to reappropriate uncompensated property (taxes). That is questionable, and very far from the objective truth you hold it to be.

Not all roads have been built by the government. America used to have many private ones.

It is also extremely misleading to point to successful government infrastructure projects (for example, the transcontinental rail systems of the 19th century) as empirical support for government spending. It is very possible these projects or suitable alternatives would've been implemented if the dependence on and anticipation of government intervention wasn't so ingrained into the economy. After all, the government doesn't grow our food or build our houses...and when it tries to, saying that it fails miserably is an understatement.

One could also flip your argument the other way around. The private sector allows the public bureaucracy and civil service to continue. The list of countries with poor economic freedom and limited opportunities for the pursuit of private property and the list of countries with poor governments are remarkably similar.","1346459311"

Big problem right there buddy. That's at least $100 a month or around a week's worth of your wages. You can make tasty sandwiches and bruchetta and have fruit for dessert for $1-2/day.

Oh wait what's this?

&gt; I'm 19 so I live at home

How about just making your own lunch from your parent's grocery bill? I just nearly doubled your savings right there.

I don't know where you live or how far away work and school are, but consider cycling, public transport, or carpooling to cut costs.

EDIT: I'd like to preempt you by saying, if you don't have the time to make lunch, consider that to earn $5, you probably have to work 20-30 minutes. It takes 4-8 to make lunch and costs nothing since you live at home.","1346459318"

Most of the chewable things in their cage are in pretty good condition, so they can't be too destructive.  All else fails, the leftover material is enough to make 6 or 7 more hammocks, and I can just hit a craft store or thrift store when it's used up.

There was an incident at a party that I held. A crasher got out of hand and became violent. I put him on the ground and made him compliant.

This is the thing that really surprised me:

The technique I used was one that I'd drilled thousands of times. It involved clawing through the eyes, tearing the throat out and crushing the neck. But when I actually used it, I overpowered the fellow completely and put him down onto a concrete floor without even giving him a slight bruise.

I think that the underlying *intent* really mattered when I was in the moment.

I don't think I would have regretted hurting him. But in the moment, something in my conciousness knew that I didn't have to. And that come out when I used the technique.","1346459323"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","No worries. I just read it and realised I didn't define what ""dry brushing"" is.  Just in case you don't know, dry brushing is when you get a (usually old) brush and load it with a small amount of lighter base colour.  For example in my one, a lighter/slightly different shade of ochre.  You then wipe ALMOST ALL of it off onto some paper towel.  I mean, it should barely be showing at all.  You then lightly drag the brush repeatedly across the surface of your model.  After several times doing this, the raised parts of your model will start picking up the small amounts of paint, giving definition/highlights to the model:

Classic example would be base coat with silver dry brushing to give that effect of worn metal:

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","Funny that you say so because one aspect of Tribes that really benefits stalemates is easy flag returning.

If players had to carry their flag back home attackers would had a chance at actually getting away from the enemy base, which is THE reason getting the last flag in Blitz Katabatic is so hard and the reason the game is so PTH centric.

This crates a window of abuse since players could take the flag deeper inside their base. Also, it may actually make retrieving nearly impossible. 

Automatic return times would fix both problems at once.","1346459330"

"travel","t5_2qh41","I have visited NYC many times, and always use Priceline or Hotwire (90% of the time, the former). 

For NYC it is very important, when attempting to find accommodation at reasonable rates, to consider the following: 

1) Are you willing to stay in Brooklyn/Queens, or do you want the 'Manhattan' experience?
2) If you do want the Manhattan experience, are you open to the whole island, or do you want Midtown (as most tourists do). Financial District and Upper East Side/Upper West Side are cheaper, and even moreso is Harlem and Washington Heights/Morningside.
2) Are you comfortable with couchsurfing, or do you want the privacy of your own room
3) Are you ok with www.airbnb.com as an option, as someone else recommended?

I'm also looking to go early October, and my investigations thus far tell me that prices, for whatever reason, are higher than I normally pay. However, these do tend to drop the closer you get to your travel dates. Risk is, of course, that they might not drop, or that they even go up (rare) if you don't book early.

So you know, for a hotel in Midtown East (usually it ends up being Intercontinental Barclay or Radisson at 51st/Lex) I bid around 120-150 CAD/USD a night and it's accepted. This is what you should aim for.

If you have questions about doing NYC on a budget...I consider this to be my field of expertise :) Give me a PM if you want.","1346459338"

You can go to the emergency room to get checked out. Your insurance should cover some or all of the bill, but it might not. Be aware that, though they will treat you, you may have to pay something eventually, and if they want money they will probably bill you after they charge your insurance provider (unfortunately, insurance in the free market means you can end up paying some or all of the cost). The hospital will be able to tell you if they accept your insurance and may be able to estimate whether you'll owe anything, but they probably won't know for sure until they try to bill your insurance provider.

You can call your insurance provider (the number should be on your insurance card somewhere) and get a referral to a doctor that they'll cover. This might take a while because you'd have to set up an appointment and there's no telling when they'll have space in their calendar, but it's worth trying so you can get an idea of which doctor to go to in the future. They'll also know what procedures they cover and which they don't.

You can also talk to your school's health counselors to ask where they can refer you to with your insurance - they might already know. 

I would suggest calling your insurance provider and asking for a referral, and seeing if the problems you've encountered before are covered under your plan. Then go to the hospital or your school's health center.","1346459344"

"talesfromtechsupport","t5_2sfg5","I don't work with any Software Engineers, but I do work with a very wide variety of people, and I think I can safely generalize:

It depends on the type of person you are. As far as I am concerned, there are 2 types of 'computer-smart' people. The first: those that know some stuff, but admit when they don't know something. (This is the type that every IT person *should* be, because none of us know everything)

The second type is people who think they know everything, and, despite the fact that they have to call you for help, think that whatever you tell them is either wrong, or they otherwise don't want to hear what you tell them.

I actually enjoy working with the first type. Whether they know a lot or a little, these kind of people typically want to work with you rather than against you, because they understand that they don't know.

The second type, in my opinion, is usually worse to deal with than a 'regular' person.

In both cases (but more often the second), people will sometimes try to fix something themselves and actually make a problem worse. The first type, however, are more likely to own up and make life easier for everyone involved.

I would imagine that software engineers would be easier to work with in at least one aspect: they will understand that programs have limitations, and that not every program will be able to do everything you want it to do.

As far as other types of engineers (and other people who would be considered 'smart' based on their job alone), I don't think it makes any difference. I know a few architectural engineers, and most of them are total ass-hats. So are quite a few doctors (except, for some reason, most eye doctor's I've worked with are generally okay). Lawyers are too, but their secretaries are generally pretty okay to work with.

A more straight-forward answer: I don't give a shit whether you know a  lot, a little, or nothing at all. I don't give a shit if you tried to fix it yourself and made it worse (hey, shit happens). What I DO give a shit about is that you are honest and willing to work with me.

Also, as an interesting side note, in my experience accounting/payroll/financial people seem to be the best with computers.

To put this into perspective, I don't support just a single company. I work for a small IT business with hundreds of small business and individual clients (and, including our boss, there are only 5 of us total). Again, I haven't done work for any software engineers though.

I guess I probably over-answered the question... oh well.

TL;DR: It probably helps a little bit if you are a software engineer, but makes no difference if you are any other kind of engineer or 'smart' person.

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","&gt; First, you should note the use of the word ""intangible"" in that section of code.

Of course. An amortised expense that is carried over to later periods will appear on the balance sheet as an intangible asset.

Are you sure you've got an extensive business background. Basic accounting terms seem to be confusing you.

Capitalizing a cost means that the cost is taken into the balance sheet as an asset. Expensing a cost means that it appears on the profit and loss statement as a expense.

Do we need to go over what an intangible asset is?

&gt; You are again trying to put words in my mouth. I never said this.

You claimed that all industries can expense all costs, ""[**Every** company expenses their costs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/yptqu/i_had_a_green_job/c60y82q)"" and so they are no different from oil industry exploration and development costs.

Is it your position that ""If I owned a gold mine I could expense every bit of cost that went into exploring, modelling, extracting, processing and selling that gold.""

And do you understand that expensing all those costs is different from amortising them?

&gt; So what's your point in all of this?

My original point was what was contained in the linked article about oil subsidies in the US. They are estimated at about $15,000,000,000 per year.

But since you've been claiming that oil companies do exactly the same as every other company, my point is: No, oil companies get subsidies not available to other industries.

&gt; Other industries do similar things, but whatever.

1) This is different from what you've claimed above. You've said that the situation is exactly the same for all US businesses: ""Uh, every corporation writes off expenses"". (In the contest of expensing of exploration and development costs).

2) It's not very similar. It has its own part of the tax code that only pertains to oil, gas and geothermal wells, and the OECD found that tax breaks such as this totals billions of dollars of subsidies.

&gt; Keep in mind that the $10B isn't a direct cash subsidy, but a tax break.

There's no material difference. It's $10,000,000,000 that is in the fossil fuel company's net profit that would have been in Government coffers.

&gt; It does appear, though, that you are no longer arguing that the subsidy should only be applied to domestically produced oil.

This tax break is for exploration and development activities within the USA.

&gt; Finally, what do you propose?

Stop subsidising the fossil fuel industry is important, and that means applying the costs of externalities such as climate change to the cost of production.

&gt; Barring the removal of the corporate tax, you are talking about increasing the price of oil by at most 3%.

Not if externalities such as climate change and environmental damage are included.

&gt; Keep in mind that is only when oil prices are high. In low price years, corporate profits are so low that it wouldn't change the price of oil at all.

The price of oil (and every other commodity) is set by supply and demand, not the cost of producing it. Since the supply of oil is carefully controlled, the effect of changing the subsidies will have zero effect on the price, unless significant sources become uneconomic, thereby reducing supply beyond the ability of producers to respond to. But there are not many uneconomic ways of pulling fossil fuels out of the ground. To make a loss you really need to spill 5 million barrels of oil near the coast of a first world county. What it will do is change what resources will be left in the ground, but that is a long term effect.","1346459348"

"asiantwoX","t5_2tg6f","Best way to learn Chinese or any language is to USE IT. The first language anyone acquires is through listening and speaking, not listening, speaking, and trying to become literate on a once a week basis.  Best thing anyone can do is to stick the kid with a native speaker of the language as a caretaker (e.g. Grandparent) or to actually go to the country where the language is spoken.  

I really did wish that I had a grandparent to take care of me and force me to speak but I didn't. I wish we had money to take vacations to HK in the summer but we didn't. Hell, I wish my mother could have left the radio on to Cantonese language programming but I'm lucky she can operate a microwave without it needing to be ctrl+alt+deleted. Now I resign myself to watching lots of Cantonese tv online and listening to Cantonese podcast/radio and my ability to speak is at least somewhat retained. 

After all these years, I can say with honesty that my ability to speak the language was earned through work by myself and had I let my mother dictate any of it, I would have tried even harder than I did to openly denounce all things Chinese.  I love her but it angers her to no end when i tell her she was the reason I hated the Chinese language in the first place and that I will never not be resentful, let alone thank her, for what she inflicted upon me and my brother.

The economy Romney champions is one where the rich extract money from everyone else and create nothing, they use the government to subsidize them then hide the money overseas. Electing Romney is a scary proposition, the man stands for absolutely nothing (or for every side of every position) but while the right is so worried about getting rid of Obama they are going to put a man in office who is everything hard working blue collar americans stand against. A man who is going to push us further away from a manufacturing economy and use neoliberal policies to expand the wealth of a few while screwing over the rest.

Anyway, interesting question. American football is pretty stop and go, so it's easy to switch out the defensive and offensive teams. That being said, each team has players who specialize in both defensive and offensive positions. For example, a team on offense still has players on the field who protect the quarterback. Defensive players who must guard the receivers on the offensive team, hence they have to be equally fast so in the case of a turnover during a pass (interception) the player who stole the ball is able to run it as far as possible.

I think this would turn out to be an ever better set up against Phantoms than using Throw with the Sentinel.  I found that with using that Throw set up, that quite frequently the bastards would pretty instantly raise their shields and block my Throw and most often I ended up just killing them completely with my Acolyte.  But with Singularity, once their barriers are gone they're completely defenseless and, perhaps most importantly, they can't block that shit once they're down to just their health.  Good for Hunters as well.  People may call Singularity a crappy power, but even before this thread I was already using it for this reason.  It's a great source of pulling a Nelson laugh on Hunters and Phantoms - it's just so satisfying to see these such infamous enemies float completely helplessly in the air like that entirely at your mercy.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","&gt;Note that this isn't me asking her out. This is me lettin' her know how I feel. If she feels the same, then yay! We can see if we'd make a good pair and if so, get into a relationship. If not then, I'll lick my wounds and get over it. 

I'm trying to tell you though that this exact logic right here is inherently flawed.  You *have* to ask her out because it's only through dating that you both actually figure out if you would make a good couple.  You say that if she feels the same, then yay!, and you both figure out if you both would make a good pair.  But, what do you think that ""yay!"" entails?  You both sitting down at a table, comparing your likes and dislikes and coming to rational decision about your relationship status?  No, of course not.  That ""yay!"" should be you both going on dates where you do stuff you like, you do stuff she likes, and you do stuff that you both like.  Then, after spending time together and seeing each other in a variety of different situations, you both look longingly at each other and just know you don't want to date anyone else for either a while or possibly forever if she does indeed turn out to be the one.  So, yes, you are asking her out, regardless of your intended meaning, but you're also not asking her out.  You're trying to be as passive as humanly possible to limit your own vulnerability so that essentially she has to be the one to really put herself out there for anything to happen.  And, to that point, you can't seek a relationship with someone if you aren't willing to actually be active about your interest and really put yourself out there.  You might fail, but your current method ensures you will never succeed.  So, don't bother with this passive stuff and ask her out for real.  No sing-songy letters trumpeting her perfection.  Just ask her out, go on a date, get to know the real (not fantasy) version of her, and actually learn if you like her or the dream.

Meanwhile, closure is an illusion, at least regarding relationships.  You never get all the answers.  You never get the feeling that you did everything you could.  You will always think that if you have just did this differently or that differently, maybe it would have worked.  Or, ask yourself what if you made one last grand romantic gesture?  And, this time you mean it.  This time will definitely be the last.  The other times you weren't serious, but this time you are *really* laying all the cards on the table and will *really* walk away this time.  But, so long as your quest is closure, you will still stick around and keep trying at the slightest hint of interest or possibility.  If you want to move on, then you just have to move on.  No letter.  No flowers.  No balloons.  No writing a girl's name in lights on a dorm building.  You just leave it, and let time pass.  Only time grants closure.","1346459358"

Language and logic are both man-made and circular, and they can't save you from where you are going. When every human is extinct, logic will also be extinct.

If God is an abstract human invention, so is logic. If one is skeptical of deity for being man-made, shouldn't one also be skeptical of logic for being man-made? Nietzsche said ""Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world.""","1346459359"

It is a terribly discriminating world out there for fathers in your position...schools, courts, social perception. It's a battle against the near-automatic presumption of mother as custodial parent...with little regard for the fact that there are fathers who are more suitable, more willing and/or more able to raise the children than the mothers are (or absentee mothers, altogether). There are **many** deadbeat moms out there dodging child support and their parenting responsibilities (not saying your children's mother is or isn't...just that the concept of a mother who wants nothing to do with her children is all but disregarded as a myth in society). The mindset is evolving, but very slowly (and much slower in some places than others). Keep up the good work and don't let 'em get you down.

"WhiteRights","t5_2rjto","The old race is a social construct meme. Race isn't a social construct. It is a biological fact of centuries of selective inbreeding with different evolutionary pressures. 

If race was a social construct why is it so effective in determining and predicting disease ? Why are Black 1/2 as likely to experience atrial fibrillation as Whites?  Why does sickle cell occur in 1/12 Blacks but only 1/100,000 Whites if race is purely an illusion. 

I can go on and on an on with examples of actual scientists, e.g. not sociobiologists using race as a statistically significant predictor for a host of outcomes.

As far as life not being a competition between groups you are of course wrong. The viewpoint that it isn't a competition is solely that of a liberal Westerner and a confused one at that. Most Western Liberals are of course ""Atheist"" but they fail to follow that thread of thought to it's logical conclusion.  

Two things that are overlooked are :

1. Populations in different geographic regions are subject to different evolutionary pressures and this leads to true human bio-diversity. This of course also leads to competition between groups. There isn't an animal in the world without inter and intra species conflict? Why would we be any different? 

2. Following Dawkins selfish gene theory, racism or ethnic nepotism would be a highly adaptive approach to promoting your genes vs alien neighbors.

As for the superglider, I love it, but again, the concave isn't enough (for me) to be sliding comfortably on. That said it's an amazing commuter, pumper, dink-around-with-some-freestyle kind of board. The supermodel is tried and true and the most reputable choice. The concave is aggressive and the deck is stiff which fit's your bill nicely.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","The thing is, Steam Greenlight *isn't* about finding new games, or operating as the sole/main method for marketing a game. At least, not yet (maybe when they add support for concepts). True, it's useful for getting your game out there in front of a lot of people, but as mentioned, most of those people are coming from the youtube comment section.

Greenlight is a way for developers to use their already existing marketing methods to get a better chance of getting onto Steam, so instead of emailing them, waiting 2 months for a rejection letter, not hearing anything, then trying again in a year, they just put it onto Greenlight, and get all their fans to vote for it. This takes the job of sorting through the shit games that get submitted out of Valve's hands and puts them into the community. Getting on Steam has *always* been a popularity contest, it's just before hand, it was the developers job to prove that their game was popular (by explaining in their submission how many people are excited for it). Lots of games got lost with that system, stuff like La-Mulana's remake, and basically, it didn't work.

Greenlight isn't perfect, however. As mentioned, it's too easy to submit stuff like Halo or Minecraft, or really terrible joke games. But people have mentioned getting banned from the community features for a week because they tried to submit Command and Conquer. It hasn't stopped people yet, but as word gets out, the copyright submissions and fake games will hopefully die out. Same for everyone on the forums asking for Mass Effect 3.

And as mentioned, the percentage is likely set so high to prevent the Minecraft submissions from instantly getting into the ""approved"" category. I hope that Valve is willing to look at games that hit 10%, or 20% (with the current numbers), or change the numbers as time goes on and fewer people pay attention to Greenlight.","1346459368"

There are two couples, A and B. Wife A has a child with Husband B. Husband B applies for child benefit, and is successful. In Canada, the child benefit money is always paid to the wife, in every situation. Since Husband B is the one applying for the child benefits, Wife B is given the child benefits, (regardless of the fact that Wife B is not the mother).

And then AngryHippogriff decides that this situation is fine, except for the sexism - ie that child benefits is not paid to the father in any situation, even if the wife of the applying male is not the mother. 

He then adds extra information about how much the two women earn. I don't see the relevance, but there we go.

His eldest at age 12/13 (when I knew her) fit in so well with adults that she not only sometimes kicked our butts in political arguments but once at a house party someone served her scotch because he genuinely had no idea how young she was!

His unschooled daughters pretty much did whatever they wanted all day, which, from what I saw, was mostly creating artwork (his youngest -- the shy one -- was very talented) and launching/running various money-making enterprises. They started with typical farm stuff -- tending the garden and animals and selling surplus vegetables, eggs, and rabbits to their neighbors -- then as they matured moved on to various online money-making opportunities like advantage gambling, creating and selling custom clothing in Second Life, gold farming in MMPORPGs, etc. I think the last time I checked in with the family the eldest (now an adult) was making her living in web design.","1346459378"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","&gt;The objective truth is that gender is not black and white.

Ok... that doesn't really address what I was saying.  The point is that it's not whether I think somebody is a man or a woman that determines whether they are, not is it whether they think of themselves as a man or woman.  It's whether they actually are a man or woman.

&gt;""Right"" isn't a label - it is a position. That you see it is a label speaks of your bigotry.

Of course it's a label; it's an adjective.  And just to be clear, I mean ""right"" as the opposite to ""wrong,"" not the opposite to ""left"".

&gt;Identifying as a man means that either you are a man, or it means ... what? That you are insane? Delusional? Well, since I've had an objective analysis of my psychology, and since that analysis shows that I'm neither insane nor delusional, then I must be female!

So, the comment you were replying to there was about you changing the subject to this being about SRS instead of self-idetification.  You didn't actually respond to that point directly, but since your reply was about self-identification, I'm guessing that you're not going to change the subject.

&gt;Well, since I've had an objective analysis of my psychology, and since that analysis shows that I'm neither insane nor delusional, then I must be female!

Your logic is incredibly unsound.  First of all, you're not objective; you're talking about judging yourself.  Second, being objective doesn't inherently mean one is right.  Before we go further down this path, are you sure you want to make this discussion about you and not a general case?  I prefer to keep it as impersonal as possible.  When it gets too personal, feelings inevitably get hurt.

To answer your question in the general case, a person who views themselves to be female, but isn't, would definitely be wrong, and may or may not be delusional.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I would never play her against blitz or leona and I would try to avoid playing her against taric.  If you're forced to play her against blitz or leona you should consider maxing W first, and potentially even maxing W &gt; E &gt; Q because you're not gonna get to do much poke---unless you get an early advantage in lane, then definitely go for Q for the damage in exchanges.  You shouldn't really rush an Athene's as support...get philo hog, kages if you can finish it before 16 minutes.  get boots as late as you can (i.e. get them as soon as you feel you really need them, not before---this could be very early or very late, depending on the lane) and then go for shurelyas or aegis depending on whether you need the engage or the defense more, what your jungler is building, etc.  work on managing your mana better and you shouldn't even need chalice---although if we're dominating the game I like to go chalice DFG athenes :)

As far as ADCs go, sona basically works with anyone.  With Ashe, Corki, Cait, Ezreal, Draven, Sivir play a poke lane.  With Trist, Graves, Varus play an all-in-at-6 lane (you can also allin at 6 with ashe or corki).  With Kog or Vayne you need to be pretty passive at first because your ADC won't be able to exchange well but once your carry snowballs, you should just chase them down with E and ulti and kill them.

I don't really like playing Sona against Ashe or Cait because they're too longrange, but you definitely are able to; you just won't be able to win as hard.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","And now you are redefining what an operating system does. The iOS operating system power millions of devices, and those devices produce extremely high levels of customer satisfaction. Although it does not do everything you want it to do, the operating system is not broken. Perhaps you're hung up on an end user's ability to modify the OS. Unfortunately for you, ""infinite end-user customizability"" is not a defining characteristic of operating systems. It is a characteristic of *some,* but there are plenty of operating systems that do not share this trait. It is, in other words, a value-add not a core feature. (1)

Or perhaps the root of your anti-iOS opinion revolves around the app store policies, rather than the operating system. iOS can, and does, communicate to app stores in addition to the primary one run by Apple. Companies who participate in the iOS Developer Enterprise Program (2) run business-specific app stores through which employees can download apps. A restricted ability to communicate with third party app stores is not a limitation of the operating system. It is a configuration issue. Perhaps you think this is splitting hairs, but the statement that ""iOS has been configured by Apple in ways that limit its attractiveness to open source enthusiasts"" is a very, very different statement than ""iOS is objectively broken."" The former statement is debatable by people interested in honest discussion. The latter statement is the rhetorical equivalent of a fart.

(3)  When in response to my admonition, and to my correct usage of the words ""objective"" and ""subjective"" you said ""learn to debate kid,"" that was an ad hominem.  You did not attempt to refute my assertion. You lol'd and suggested that I was a kid, implying that my assertion did not require refutation. Ad hominem attacks are not used by people who are winning arguments.

No one is suggesting that you have to like iOS, or that you need to have anything good to say about Apple products. But you are repeatedly and consistently making a mistake common to youth, of defining the world according to your opinion. As someone who has been voting since the Reagan era and who has seen many people go through this cognitive stage, let me encourage you to shed that bad habit sooner rather than later. ""I don't like this, so it's broken."" ""That doesn't do what I want, so it's broken."" Those statements sound immature, uninformed, petulant, and entitled. You can get away with this attitude in the work place if you are head and shoulders above your competition. But if you aren't as smart as you think you are, this attitude will make extra work for yourself, will cause pointless friction with coworkers who disagree with your opinions, and will earn you a reputation as someone who is difficult to work with. 

Fortunately for you, the solution is simple. Instead of saying, ""[product] is 'objectively broken'  because I disapprove of the way it behaves,"" try saying something like, ""I don't like [product] because I value [x, y, z] and [product] doesn't reflect those values.""  The former statement is an expression of hubris; as such it makes any listener less likely to take you seriously the next time you open your mouth. The latter actually communicates what you think is important, and why. The former statement will never change someone's opinion of the topic you're discussing, it can only change their opinion of you. The latter argument actually *can* change someone's mind on the topic.

I have never been to Japan but I understand this completely.  I suspect that there are two factors influencing this.  There are many ""japanese"" restaurants that are being run by Koreans and they have different ideas as to what they want from their food.

And then there are japanese restaurants that are trying to make themselves more accessible to Americans in general.  I live in California so I have access to both mexican food and mexican food for white people.

That said, you can find decent japanese food.  I'm not saying that one has to go to New York to get Gogo Curry.  You just have to look for it.","1346459399"

You have to be careful to make sure the password reset email is legit when you do this, as it's a common phishing attempt as well. That makes sure the password reset link won't work if someone else uses it. I also delete all password reset emails and remove them from the trash so they can't be recovered.

Maybe they are not training as hard as they could be because they might not be able to play.

Maybe they are taking risks because of the same reason.

Maybe some of the older ones are given time re-evaluate their careers and get to spend more time with their families, thus they decide to retire early. 

So many effects just by NOTHING moving forward.","1346459411"

"BookCollecting","t5_2sdrj","Found this at a used bookstore this afternoon. It's a pristine copy of Phillip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" and I don't use the term ""pristine"" lightly. It has a couple of minor dings in the dust jacket but otherwise the book looks as if it just came from the printers. Doesn't appear to have ever been read at all. 

Inside it states that this is the ""First Printing"" and the copyright page reads exactly as it does on this list of First Edition points: http://www.fedpo.com/BookDetail.php/Portnoys-Complaint 

A few issues though... I read on the above fedpo link that the first edition's price was centered on the dj flap w/ a clipped corner (should read $6.95). The link says that this was due to an error w/ the original printing and the price was added later, thus the centered price w/ a clipped corner.  As you can see from the pics, mine does NOT have a price on the DJ at all, and it's not clipped. Could this be an early printing before they made any corrections? The fedpo link says that the clipping/centered price was due to the wrong price being printed - but could it be because of a missing price?

It looks like the dust jacket is missing one of the reviews for ""When She Was Good"" and also, the book itself is black instead of navy blue - and does not have the PR initials on the front.

So I'm really curious what this edition is. It says First Printing, but there are things that don't match right. Can anyone shed some light on this?

Can anybody shed some light on this for me? Is this the real deal? If so, I think it's worth something. I only paid $5 for it, so I won't be out anything if it's worthless, but what do you think?","1346459413"

Keep in mind that 10 million is an extremely conservative value, as some definitions of ""Holocaust"" include up to 17 million!  The first two paragraphs of [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) are actually pretty informative with references at the bottom.

Despite eating a vegan diet, my cholesterol was like 209, before it was like 220. When I went hard core whole foods, plant based, primarily vegetables, it went down to like 169. That was about a year ago and I've eased up on the ""primarily vegetables"" bit some, so I'm not sure where that leaves me now. It will unfortunately probably always be something I'll have to keep an eye on- I've had cholesterol issues since I was a toddler and have a family history of high cholesterol. Hopefully my diet will ease me through the heightened cholesterol that often comes along with menopause, though I have a few years to worry about that :P

Edit: And I do want to say I wasn't eating horribly during the 209 phase. I'd say the biggest shift from that to the 169 was less grains and of the grains they were all whole/ brown, rather than like 50/50. Maybe more legumes instead of seitan, too. And a whole lot more frozen peas :) My body just seems to have a history (beyond cholesterol, mind you) of being difficult.","1346459416"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not your judge either, but you realize you are doing that to other people's property, right?  And that's not very cool, y'know what I'm saying?  Shit if you want to fuck a shoe, be my guest, but I have a feeling that if the shoe's owners knew about it they'd protest - it's not just an ownership issue, what about you leaving your genetic material all over their possessions?  There's a bio-waste issue there, not to mention it's just a little unpleasant to imagine being tricked into touching it.

Your aim is fine, you want pleasure - I think that's your right and in no way would I ever suggest you were wrong for indulging in it.  But I would ask that you think of the owners of these shoes, and how they will then interact with their possessions.  I'm sure if someone dropped a load (or a dick) in your shoes you'd like to know before you got your feet sweaty in 'em.

Also, just because I detect a little tiny bit of it in what you wrote, I'm going to go out on a ledge and ask you to be mindful of not just the people's possessions but of the people themselves.  As someone who struggles with sexual identity and has long pondered the objectification of beautiful women in my life, I would caution you to remember that the ""gorgeous women"" whose shoes you take are in fact people too, just like you, and deserve the same amount of dignity and respect that you yourself deserve.  That they are gorgeous or women does not change how you should think of them or their property, nor does it mean they are deserving of being the unwitting (and possibly unwilling) victim to your manifestations of pleasuring yourself.

Having fun with yourself is one thing, exposing others to harm or mistreatment without their consent is another.  While I don't have a problem with your fetish, you need to realize that your actions are on the very borderline of being irreperably harmful to both yourself and the people whose shoes you take.  Be careful and be conscientious.

Now, sexually, as long as you don't look like me we're good. I either want someone bigger (either taller or more muscle) than me, or someone smaller (shorter) than me. Being the same height would be a little odd, I think. I could be a top or bottom, but I think I'd prefer being bottom. I like BDSM too.","1346459436"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In order of reaction:
Modesty, or in this specific case the aversion to the human body, is an emotion reaction with no basis in averting harm.  I consider that outdated, and something needing to be done away with.  Also applies to your holey pants: I see nothing wrong with it, objectively.  For purposes in a school code, I could somewhat see it being banned, despite by lack of objections to it, but if it's clothed, I see no issue.  And for pieces of literature on shirts, I still have both of my Hacker's Manifesto shirts, now framed to prevent (further) damage to the lettering.  They were greatly beneficial in High School, heh.  Wouldn't the better choice between (possibly painfully) hiding an erection and having an audience/troupe mature enough to not give two shits be pretty obvious?

The professional comment was that a lot of schools justify a dress code by saying ""In the 'real world' you'll have a dress code, so we're preparing you for it!"", which is a ton of bullshit.  In general, if someone has a dresscode that isn't primarily a safety code, chances are they aren't actually *doing* anything.

Further, developmental rates are hugely divergent, especially in high-IQ individuals.  An individual with an IQ of 140+, for example, tends toward independent study and strong personalization as early as the age of 8.  This is sometimes misdiagnosed as ODD, relatedly: plenty of people see children developing a sense of self as a bad thing, and that's ludicrous to me.

The guy distracting the class could've been a douchebag, or some fundie could've been railing about it being inappropriate... in the first case, sure, he might be being a dick and punishment is cool, in the latter, the complainer should've been punished for being a dickbag.  The fact that, in both cases currently, the person in the clothes is dubbed the issue is a bit odd, don't you think?

In the cases I've seen where there is no dress code, I've seen some amazing things, even though I generally have no interest in aesthetics as a whole.  There's also the form/function thing: I went to a school in MD where there was no real desscode (was actually stated as ""no nudity, no porn, no drugs"").  Never once saw an issue.  There was a girl on swimteam who wore her swimsuit to classes, because she'd swim a couple laps between classes (15-min changing periods), and no one paid it any mind (especially since she won ""glory for the school""... kinda neat, I always thought).

http://www.aclu.org/blog/religion-belief/texas-school-district-refuses-acknowledge-first-amendment

That last link is not just about hair, it's about denying someone's religion because of dress code, and has since been resolved, the others were just on the first page of a quick Google search into the matter, and these were specifically about long hair, since it's one of those I deal with.  Also of note is that, in Texas, a minor cannot bring charges against an organization without the support of his parents, so in a lot of cases, parents just tell their kids to deal with it, which is absolute bullshit in itself.

Also of note:
""**Colorado Indep. School Dist. v. Barber, 864 S.W. 2d 806 (Tex. App. Eastland 1993)

In this case male students successfully challenged enforcement of a school dress code which prohibited male students form having long hair or from wearing earrings. The court felt that there were several problems with the dress code, most significantly that the code prohibitions were discriminatory, as they were based on sex."" -- http://www.aclu-wi.org/youth/rights/law.html ([edit]: Yes, it's a link to the ACLU's WI site, but the case is considered national precedent, even though it occurred in Texas)

Also, I was actually insinuating the opposite: Until we get rid of religious and traditionalist bullshit, perhaps the schools *should* be parents, to prevent parents from, say, teaching their children that Evolution is ""clearly batshit"", to quote a fellow student in Biology.  At least then people would have a greater vested interest in improving schools... Yeah, overly optimistic, but things are terrible now, and at least people can (mostly) agree that schools shouldn't take a stance aside from one of provable facts.","1346459437"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","My original intent was to convey to you sympathy for the scenario in which ""authorities"" outnumbered you, but then I realize the cops were outright righteous in handing you that ticket. You were an crude and rashy in dealing with your situation, rather than having used logic to explain to them, you literally bashed out on people doing their job. I'm sure you would've realized that's how cops deal citizens on the verge of a nervous breakdown, then again something tells you're a transplant -not that there's anything wrong with that, but I absolutely detest the transplants that move to the north side and deem themselves pseudo-intellects on anything remote that corresponds to the city-related matters. You remind me of a girl I met from Loyola that claimed that Hyde Park is extremely dangerous. The ironic part is that she's a native Chicagoan that hung about an odd mix of transplants ... and once again, I emphasize that there's nothing wrong with being a transplant. You live in Edgewater right, or so your tag says ... therefore I assume you don't pay property taxes, and therefore rent? A whooping majority of them south side families own their houses, meaning their revenue contribution far exceeds yours. Hell ... tobacco, alcohol, and food   taxes ""decree'd"" by our fair city. So please, if you're going to use the example of filling out a 1040 form, then at least be specific since that mostly applies to state and federal taxes. So when you're going about south side folks not paying their taxes, they actually ... in an odd manner than goes back to the city revenue when buying those ""luxuries"". And don't tell me buying beer from you local favorite dive bar contributes to paying city taxes, cause you're only helping them prolong their stay and profits and pay their licenses and property taxes. Something tells me you're not entirely aware of what's really going on in the city ... of course we know what a shithole Englewood is, not the south side ... but at least there are those with efforts in improvising the situation for the denizens of those communities. Most people from Englewood have little to no choice in exploring out of their options, blame economic inheritance, and stereotypical reinforcement. 

So you're going to try to convince your alderman, from the 48th ward, to side with you? Geez, personally, I hope he brushes you off, because not only are you ironically wasting time and ""taxpayer"" funds, but you're wasting their time as well. I hope your fine is doubled for the sheer lack of respect your displaying towards the city. You could've made it easier for everyone and yourself by being courteous to the sergeant, whom was a chick as well! Could've pulled a move here and there to have persuaded her to discard the matter, but no; you decided to be an asshole.

But he got so excited and I was so close to coming that he just started using his fingers (fingers and tongue combo always gets me off the best), and I came and it was great. UNTIL I REALIZED that he had pushed the tampon string way up inside. Freaking out, I started crying and went into the bathroom and tried and tried to pull it out, but I couldn't get it.

It is a conspiracy book and I have said why you were wrong. There's no evidence to support your claim, just some kooks with no field experience. If you never read the website why did you say elsewhere that it's a website you frequent. More lies from you.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I can't believe you're spreading that hate. I am all for gender equality, but the extremists on both sides are appalling. Most shocking to me are the privileged men who complain and whine on that mmo troll subreddit that is Mens Rights.

This next election could literally take away a woman's right to decide when to have or not to have a child, even in the case of rape, not to mention a woman's right to decide about her own body. I agree that this form is biased (if real), but at the same, most times the mother is the most involved parent who takes the child to and from school and takes them in for the first registration. I assume so from experience, though I'm not supporting it nor saying it should continue, and the fact that these categories seem to be the easiest way to sort data for the school's administration. I think it is silly to accuse the school of actively hating and excluding men, though I am puzzled why father wasn't a category when step-mother was. Perhaps a place where the divorce rate is high?

I do feel for the OP. I think both genders are equally capable of caring and nurturing children, and I'm sorry for whatever unfortunate circumstances have left him with full custody. I think anyone's ability to be a parent depends more on their individual traits; it doesn't add any information if you include gender in that list of defining traits.

If you want to change our society, raging at the other side of the argument pushes everyone further away from common ground.","1346459446"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Okay, besides your completely unfounded and absolutely incorrect ideas about who I am and where I am from:

I don't know why you don't think there isn't a relationship between American foreign policy and these acts. Here, for example, is what the 7/7 bombers in England had to say about why they conducted these bombings: 
&gt;Your democratically-elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people all over the world. And your support of them makes you directly responsible, just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters. Until we feel security you will be our targets and until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight.

I don't know why you feel this fight is about anything other than what people claim it to be: do you really find it so irrational that people might react to the kind of violent attacks we've made on their societies with violence? Do only Americans have a unique ability to exercise violence against the people who injure them? No. For god's sakes, look at your fucking government and what it does. Look at how many people in the Middle East it has killed in the past decade. So you call the response to that ""blowback""? It is obvious. It is human. It's not good or fair or effective, but it's not surprising, either.

Also, conflating the Taliban, an Afghani organization composed of a backwards students movement out of Pakistan, with al Qaeda, an international organization made up of wealthy middle class men from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, etc., seems like an elementary mistake. Learn something about the world you are bombing and shooting up, you ignorant cuss.

Do you feel passengers should be charged as well for getting in a car with a drunk driver? Similar to assisting in a murder?

I have mixed feelings on DUIs. Like you mentioned your BAC wasn't anywhere near completely annihilated. I feel police should base it upon your receipts to prove how much you had. This would be tough since people buy women drinks all night but I feel BAC doesn't fit the bill per everyone's weight etc. 


People can drive just fine after 5 beers and some can be idiots after 2 mixed drinks. I don't get why bars have parking lots. And enforcing DUI is like telling a kid he can't run the bases after hitting a home run. 

Yes one can call a taxi but if one wants to go out it gets quite expensive. 3-4 drinks may equal $20 then another $25-60 for a ride home in cab. So going out 3 times a week can get up to $150. 

I'm not saying DUIs are bad but for something with expensive life changing consequences, the testing doesn't seem fitting for everyone. 

Many women I know say a man with a few drinks is still a better driver than a woman. 

Don't take my views too literally. I feel the laws are flawed. ","1346459467"

10 hours later and 2 comments; I'll accept anything now ;)

&gt; Do ligans in flaxseed (if used daily as a supplement) have any detrimental effect on men trying to gain muscle mass? 

I haven't looked into it specifically, so take the following FWIW; I doubt it.

Many, and by many I mean *a shitload*, of compounds are estrogen agonists. These compounds can act on and induce activity at the estrogen receptor.

*Technically* they are estrogen-like, but it they have enough affinity for the receptor (% of binding to it) and a low enough potency (% of power in inducing the receptor-like effects) then they can outcompete actual estrogens and induce an anti-estrogenic effect.

Like; if estrogens are floating around at 5 molecules and induce 5 units of power per molecule (woo, abstract units!) then that is 25 cumulative  'estrogen units'. If lignans only have enough power to induce 2, but they outcompete some of the estrogens, we can have 2 estrogens bind and 3 lignans bind ((5+5)+(2x3)=16 'estrogen units', a lesser amount)

Since I haven't seen any evidence of lignans actually impairing muscle growth or otherwise giving men breasts, I would assume at this point in time their estrogenic activity isn't too strong in either direction. I have to make this a transient statement though, since 'lignan' is a hella vague category and 'flaxseed lignans' could actually be 20+ different molecules :/","1346459474"

The way it works is that you can have many people in the room, but only 2 are playing. Everyone else watches. The winner stays, and the next person comes in. 

The thing about Gunz, though, is that it's not a regular shooter. It has tricks that can take a long time to learn (you need to get your fingers used to certain patterns), and you should know them to be good at the game.

As for PCIe SSD's with 2.0 those would have to be some seriously fast SSD's to eat up 16GB/s throughput. If you have 2 running that can eat up about 2GB/s or more on graphics intensive games you may notice a slight bump but nothing drastic.

That's the problem - we are taught to expect it.

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","okay, so ask for suggestions, someone who played scraps for a long time makes suggestions, and you ignore them?

1. you should never make scrap twin, scrap dragon should be more than enough, and you should be utilizing other synchros for defense, such as stardust. Stardust + Scrap Dragon on board is really strong, very hard to handle for your opponent

2. Spy  + Descendant + Tsukyoumi allows for very strong combos that allow you to establish a very strong set up, since you can sometimes get fairly weak hands that require some waiting before being able to get your standard chimera into beast to synch with, or, allow you to get free tribute fodder for scrap golem, as well as something to destroy for your scrap dragon (or scrap twin, if you decide to run it)

3. Scapegoat is up to you, i personally dont like it, sure you can run it, is it bad? no. is it amazing? no. its preference

4. Scrapyard is okay at 2, again, its just preference, usually you just want to tutor into your beast with other cards, like summoner monk, thats why i suggested bumping monk to 2, as its basically a scrap yard that allows for an instant scrap dragon

5. Dark decks will still be prevelant, but pretty much only dark worlds, so its up to you if you want to run the shadow mirror. Only add Tsuk if you are running 3 spy, 1 descendant, or else its effect to abuse spy is not worth running, as you will extinguish all your GKs before even having to reuse the effect.

6. You scrap goblins are mini-reapers, and you have some answers to LSS in the form of 1 card scrap dragons, but again, prefence, i wouldnt play it, but you could argue that there is room for it

Thats my full dollar, as apposed to the 2 cents i gave earlier, try not to be so hostile next time after asking for help","1346459498"

Yeah. Several points that are kind of all over the place. I'm suggesting you focus on just one, if you're really interested in levying legitimate criticism. 

As you say in the comments here: ""This will be downvoted to hell, proving my point perfectly."" Setting aside how mealymouthed that sort of comment appears and ignoring the flawed reasoning that is so clearly evident, I'd still agree that this post is tremendously likely to be downvoted. And so my suggestion is that you make a new post focused on one specific point and actually provide what you think is legitimate criticism on that point. 

What you've done in this post is (a) list several topics for which you think democrats deserve criticism, (b) failed to provide the actual criticism, (c) claim that legitimate criticism of democrats is unacceptable in /r/politics, and (d) post a passive-aggressive comment about how your shitty post is going to be downvoted. 

Now, if all you want to do is vent, _congratulations! You've done it. If, by chance, you'd actually like to provoke meaningful discussion, I think you've got to ante up first.

Though your first point stands, albeit a little differently; it is difficult to port on the PS3 because of the way the console is set up. If you start developing the game for the PS3 instead of the 360 you would have an easier time porting over, see Ubisoft.","1346459506"

"crossdressing","t5_2rmf8","I did serious research years ago on CD wives. One real concern they have is that the man they love is on a slippery slope and will eventually reveal that a sex change is the desired goal. They fear losing their man and also their family and security they value. It is important to ask her concerns and assure her that you simply want to fully cross dress. If in fact you want to join a local group, tell her. If you want to step out, tell her. Come to an agreement on what she can tolerate and set limits. Then stick to those limits.
My wife, for example, is 100% supportive but has asked that I limit my""going out"" to business trips since I  travel often, and not dress locally and risk running into friends or family at the mall. Of course I dress at home.  By revealing that you desire to buy a wig, it appears to her as an escalation but to you it is a logical step.  Remember that once you agree to parameters you both need to stick to them. In time, she will become more comfortable and you can renegotiate the parameters. Just remember that wives want stability, they want nothing to interfere with their economic security or job security, they want confidentiality, they want family to never ever find out, and they want you to be discreet with neighbors. They dislike anything they perceives as risk taking and they want absolutely no risky sexual exploration as it might bring disease home to them (among other obvious reasons).","1346459509"

Ha ha, in my mind, it wasn't about giving her a problem, it was about setting yourself up for an easier way to travel and set up somewhere new, to make a new life for yourself.

&gt;She didn't even give me a chance, it was a flat out no.

Oh, I hear you. I had a girl like that. I did not wait six years but I got a ""zero per cent chance in forever"" from her. Six years is a long time, true. This same girl I mentioned, she has this other guy I was friends with tied around her finger. It is really a shame, but that's his fate, not mine. You could look at it this way: you learnt your lesson and you will *never* wait that long again. Shitty, but when you get out of high school your world will get a lot bigger and there will be a lot of women in that world. Plus, you said you were rejecting girls! Your situation is shitty, but there are at least other women who *want* to be with you.

That actually sounds like a pretty decent short story. Remarkably so. When I started reading what you wrote I was like ""Oh, seems OK"" but then you hit up the twist! That's a pretty good twist, I'd say. Opiates give people a real run for their money and a lot of former (and present) addicts over in /r/drugs say to stay away. I had some oxycodone when I got my wisdom teeth out and, well, it was pretty great. I am (luckily) pretty strong-willed but I can see how it could become addictive. I was not being facetious, by the way, I actually think the story is pretty decent. If I didn't think so, I would say so (or probably just not mention it at all).

Hm, it does sound like you have kinda shitty parents, dude. That *BLOWS*. Seriously, parents fuck up lives. Maybe you could learn to manipulate them into getting your way rather than butting heads, you know? By learning some psychology you might be able to make them think that *your* idea was *their* idea, then you'd get your way. I mean, eventually you would be moving out on your own and you wouldn't have to deal with them, but until then, you could kinda ""work the system"" or something. Fuck, though, I hear you. Parents are assholes sometimes. They have no idea what they are doing. I mean, they basically were like you or me at one point, then they kept getting older, fucked someone, and boom, a child they have to raise. They seem to think it makes them special, just having a kid, like it gives them the right to make rules and order an independent life around.

Maybe [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) could help deal with your parents? I dunno, it is pretty popular but I never read it myself. I have heard good things, though. Sorry, dude. You got shitty parents, and no one deserves that lot in life.","1346459511"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt; Blind devotion is a terrible thing

So is the gratuitous use of overly-pejorative terms

&gt; there is reproducible (no pun intended) proof that it is horrible for humans to commit incest

Citation needed - especially of the claim that ""it is horrible ... to commit"". It is understandable to consider it ""horrible"" for those on whom it is committed, but I strongly doubt that you know of any ""proof"" of horror for committers (And if you do I'd like a go at critiquing it). Or else it's just a plain ol' value judgement (and I have problems imagining what could be ""proof"" of that).

&gt; On the question of incest, why is it important to you that I question it

Incest is not important to me at all, just happened to turn up as the particular example. It's questioning yourself that's important, because:

I do find your extreme dislike of ""blind devotion"" [attractive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor), because (in short) you appear to have a blind devotion to the idea that one should not have blind devotion.

And I do encourage you to [question yourself more](http://youarenotsosmart.com), because I notice that in [asserting](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/yyff7/when_christians_say_the_bible_shouldnt_be_read/c60x567) that you are prepared to question your basic [tenet](http://www.wordnik.com/words/tenet)s you actually do no such thing, but just offer further justifications for why [you are correct](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/). In the paragraph that follows ""Yes I am perfectly prepared to question ..."" there is actually only one question, and it is directed at me, not at your tenets.

By gratuitous I do mean ""uncalled for"". I think your judgement of the stories as ""stupid"" is gratuitous because you can not know that they were created by people who lacked intelligence. They may very well have been created by highly intelligent people using the very best ""evidence"" available to them at the time. Even allowing for the fact that stupidity could be one possible reason for modern thinkers to still use those ancient stories - that still does not suggest that the original story-tellers were stupid, and certainly not the stories themselves. I think that calling such stories ""stupid"" betrays an uncalled for over-confidence in ""reason and logic"" which completely sets aside history, psychology, linguistics, knowledge and (especially) compassion.

&gt; These stories set the tone for a book that has been used by countless fanatics to take away others freedoms.

True - but I'll just call attention to the grand sweeping arc starting at ""sets the tone"" by noticing that calling the stories ""stupid"" ""sets the tone"" for the opposite (and equally obnoxious) fanaticism which tries to justify taking away religious freedom. 

&gt; Apparently God is still mad at me ...

So what? He's, like, totally not real. :-)

&gt; Logic tells me that these are story devices attempt explanations of the human condition, and to scare children ...

If you want to just hate those people then logic is a good tool to hit them with. But the outer layer of blubbery belief insulates them from all sharp weapons like logic - never saw any of them affected by it anyway.

We need to get under the blubber. If we are ever going to get them to discard it, we'll need to first understand why good parents would feel the need to scare children. How would they feel about having to do that?

&gt; These religions are formed around the idea the questioning core tenants is morally corrupt. 

Why? 

Because they were scared! And often because they are.

&gt; why is it important to you?

Because I would like to reduce the pernicious effects of religion in the world, so I would prefer to reduce how scared the religious people are, so I prefer less scary atheists.

I avoided sport Tae Kwon Do like the plague, preferring to fight without padding. This teaches you to, you know, *not get hit*. And to not do stupid shit like they do in the olympics (Judo has this problem, too) which is more or less just gaming the system, but is terrible from a self-defense perspective.

So I'd say that the Tae Kwon Do skills that I ended up with were actually pretty useful in a real fight. I could dodge punches pretty well, and throw side kicks that launch people through cheap drywall.

BJJ is probably the most useful for self-defense, but both Judo and TKD have really useful elements, too, that take over in different spheres: Judo for grappling when standing, TKD at fighting distance while standing, and BJJ when on the group.","1346459523"

That connection cannot happen until said bodily function has happened a few times, and it takes some people longer than others, hence why some children master potty training in a matter of weeks and some can take years.

He probably knew he felt weird, but didn't know he was going to throw up. You can clearly see he is trying to stop it, since his hand is over his mouth, and he probably cried after the puking stopped for being sick and embarrassed. ","1346459526"

I really enjoy my iOS quality that eats away at battery life and causes crashes forcing me to factory reset my device every once in a while. That iTune synch feature comes in handy to restore all my stuff after a factory restore as well. At least when it does work and doesn't lose all the stuff I backed up like contacts, songs, apps, and the like that it cannot seem to find. But hey it is an ""undocumented feature"" not a bug according to Apple, that allows me to save space on my iOS device by refusing to copy stuff I own like contacts or stuff I bought like apps, songs, movies, etc.

I also love how when I click on something, it actually clicks on a different place on the screen causing advertising to come up in apps and open up the wrong web site in Safari or cause my freenium game to spend gold when I didn't want to spend it. I also love how Apple has that ""no refunds"" policy, and also how easily the touchscreen breaks costing $200 to fix at the Apple Store by a Genius.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I dont disagree, US isnt the bastion of freedom it used to be for practical real world reasons and maybe some corrupting influences. I also wish foreign policy had a more stern interest in supporting democracy than keeping the status quo but its not the worst thing in the world to have a pragmatic superpower that knows that choosing democracy and freedom does not always lead to world wide stability so managing the world is a little complicated. Thats the way it is though, strategy is about fortifying yourself among your allies and keeping strong bonds between them, sometimes at the expense of non allies who want to go their separate way. And believe it or not, Bush did diplomatically behind the scenes try to push democracy in egypt but politicians would tell you that it was only because he was naive at the time in believing that democracy will always lead to true peace. The US isnt an angel but it isnt a devil like other superpowers and so many empires before it and the peace time we have now is because of that. Its all about stopping the emergence of a another hitler. Once countries stop fearing US, they will begin to act recklessly. Thats the psychological power US has on the world and its a positive one. You will never find the US supporting massacres and thats more than I can say about the rest of the world that either prefers to stand in the side lines or the others who are more than willing to fuel conflict.","1346459530"

Schematics for the Wall and the watchtowers, schematics for sorting/adjusting some things within the lower wards (AKA 'The old city'. The place that got sunk between AA and AC and was STILL used as the location for AC.) It was sharp's plan to elevate himself to Mayor through winning public favor by doing it.

It wasn't found till almost a year or two after release...and I THINK it may have been the Devs who actually had to tell people about it. Or the devs told people about another secret in AA. Forget which of those 2 it is...","1346459532"

Nothing wrong with any of those, but they're not what I sat down to DM.

As a side note, I've found Incarnum to be a similar to psionics, both thematically and mechanically, in that it defines a way that people work internally, and lets people use that to express their will on the world.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I initially found myself in the gym because I needed a place to duck into to  evade some cops who may or may not have noticed the blunt I'd been smoking at a nearby park. 

I then returned to the gym when I realized it would be a useful hideout to avoid my 250lb (now ex) girlfriend who was pissed that I (may or may not have) done the no-pants dance with her equally plus-sized roommate.

While there though, my goals evolved as I discovered that there was large volume of women's sweaty workout clothes at the lost-in-found that could be looted and sold lucratively to the rather large cohort of perverts on eBay. I began returning weekly to support my financial endeavors.

As weeks passed though, and management changed (became more wary of my business venture), I too, changed. I had taken notice of the activity the other suckers were involved in there, and gave it a whirl, mostly as a goof. Turns out, if I stand in front of mirror, flash the most badass face my awesome visage can muster, while air-punching with the pink neoprene dumbbells, and singing ""stronger, faster"" over-and-over again in my head, I can temporarily drown out the voice in my head that tells me to kill myself.

Whoever is paying for the 400msp out of pocket, huge thanks. We were planning to make winner flair instead but MSP is definitely a better reward.

Couple thoughts on all this:

I would suggest looking at donownsyou's idea for WBC. It's a good idea but I'm not sure it would work in practice:  http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftxbox/comments/xd8a9/new_way_to_do_the_weekly_build_contest/c5ldvx5

---

Also I'm thinking posting all 4 WBC's now takes away the point of it being a Weekly Building Contest. I do see the purpose of posting it all at once, so builds can be planned ahead of time. Another idea would be to keep the first 3 themes as weekly then if the Battlefield Scene is expected to take longer we could create a Monthly or Bi-Weekly Building Contest. That way we have 2 contest going on at once. Well... just an idea for now.","1346459551"
"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;I've answered this, personal experience, friends, news. While this is not damning evidence, it is evidence. I am not going to study everything before I voice an opinion. I have not stated anything as fact, you could note the use of the word ""probably"" above (please don't start saying all blacks probably spend their welfare checks on sneakers, it will not change my opinion, nor will it make it any more/less valid.

Probably has a definition. If you don't want to use it right that is your choice.

Blacks probably spend all their money on sneakers. I have personal experiences and photographic evidence.

Occupy guys are slackers with no clear mission, and want society to babysit them so they can smoke weed. I know this cause I met a few. Thus, all of occupy is probably this way. After all, humans are shitty.

I've only met good cops, so every cop must be good. Thus, everyone else is lying.

Also, not informing your opinion is the very reason this shit happens at all. The cops using excessive force aren't informing their opinions either. They deserve to be criticized for it, as do you.

&gt;Yes, this one. It shows that you are excluding yourself from your sample even though your own actions contradict you statement, unless of course you smoke all day, don't vote, burn crosses, and think americans should invade other countries and kill the inhabitants.

But the black, asian, etc. thing is A-ok? I'm not excluding myself there after all.

&gt;I also have cops in my extended family, they defended the actions of the officer who choked me while my hands were cuffed behind my back, despite the fact that I was wrongly detained and was not a threat to anybody. To hell with them.

And a couple black guys broke my nose once. I didn't immediately turn to ""in my experiences, black guys are violent"". 

Sorry you know shitty people. Try not to generalize based off that to suppose a systemic problem with too much authority when you have no clear evidence.

&gt;Data on this subject is not wholly accurate, as many cases go unreported, unrecorded or swept under the rug.

Data on this subject is not wholly accurate, as many cases are over reported, out-right fabricated, or used in an effort to get charges dropped or obtain money.

See how easy a cop-out that is? You made the claim that the officers I met were nice because it was a formal situation, but in an informal situation their perceived authority would lead them to not act the same. You have to back that shit up.

&gt;No, what you are saying is true in some cases, and false in others. As I said about cops, ""All bets are off."" They are people, and they will react as any individual might, unpredictably.

As I said about blacks, asians, whites, wtc. 'all bets are off'.

*If you want to argue cops probably have near or slightly over the violence rate of most people, I could hear that argument. If you think violent incidences occur more frequently with them due to the nature of their job, I could hear that. But you have no evidence to justify grouping the majority of officers into your supposed ""informal"" supposition.*

&gt;Again, you seem to want to use outliers to make your arguments, in other words, stretching my argument to absurd conclusions. If you believe the experiences of me, my friends, and stories in the news recently are outliers, just say so, no need for dramatics. And you've been asking for proof all along (though I've given it, and you don't accept it), yet have provided none to back up your own arguments.

You haven't demonstrated any sort but outliers. You used UC Davis, which as I have shown, is evidence of Occupy acting like a mob. I'm glad they were broken up with non-lethal force (even though I agree with their movement). Even so, this was an extraordinary situation, not a day to day occurrence. I honestly don't see the big deal with the Jefferson memorial guys either. Sure the law is unjust, but that's not the police officer's job. They enforce the law, and the court is where the real changing begins. While it got a little rough, it certainly would not have been, if the protesters would have calmly put their hands behind their back. The one pushed to ground was clearly resisting arrest when his friend grabbed him, and then refused to put his arm behind his back. 

I can't comment on your experience, except that if you had one bad experience, with the huge amount of cops out there, it's pretty much an outlier. Doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed and punished to full extent of the law. But it doesn't give you enough to lambaste a group of people for ""over-authority"" when most are apparently very responsible with it (gotta have data of a systemic problem, which it would clearly be).

The dramatics were too show you the danger in using information on the media, sans data, to reinforce a confirmation bias you are already looking for based on your personal experiences.

** I gave evidence for the claim I made. He said the police are all bullies. I said I've met some that were nice. You said they probably wouldn't have been in an 'informal' situation, due to people liking to exercise authority. You back your shit up.**

For some evidence: http://www.policemisconduct.net/2010-npmsrp-police-misconduct-statistical-report/#_Excessive_Force

According to this, extremely biased to your side report, there were 4,861 unique reports of officer misconduct in 2010 (involving around 6500 officers). In 2006, there were around 800,000 officers in the US (including FBI).  This is around a .6% incidence rate. I consider that outlier (still too high, but there were always be some bad apples). Around .002% of our population was involved.

Note this does not include reports that were thrown out, or ones ""swept under the rug"". ","1346459551"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","men do have rights.  if you have a child with someone, you gained a son or daughter, who you may have custody rights with (at least partial) unless it's been ruled by a court that you can't, which is another issue entirely.  These rights can't go any further without infringing on someone else's.  It's not like children happen by accident: sex, even with birth control, carries some responsibility.  The obligation to pay child support doesn't give you more rights than the mother, which is really what this argument is suggesting: that the fact that a man has an obligation to care for and/or support a child that they did not want somehow means that they should also have a say in whether or not a woman can choose.  If the man doesn't want the woman to abort the child, they also can't have that right since men can't develop a fetus into a child using their own body, and can't exchange their rights with their partner.  
It may not always end up in a good situation, and some people may get upset, but the extent to which a man's rights as a willing father are violated are lesser than the extent to which the woman's would be if she were forced to carry (and be legally obligated to care for) an unwanted child.  The balance in this case must tip towards the woman's rights, because she stands to lose significantly more freedom than the man.  

If the choice debate were able to be solved with a single silver-bullet argument, it would have been by now.  The fact is, we live in a society that tries for equal rights, and unless people want to admit that some should have more rights than others, it's clear that women must have the right to choose, because taking that right away takes away far too much, for far too little.","1346459554"

Some have suggested that Romney may have been treated for such a disorder. If both candidates on the GOP ticket suffer from the same disorder, that's not good. It would impede their ability to serve as they would feel compelled to lie to the American people about things that don't need to be lied about.

"AskModerators","t5_2uwjj","I was a moderator of /r/pics for several months immediately after their current ruleset was introduced, taking the subreddit away from memes &amp; facebook screenshots to focus once again on actual pictures, photos and art. The amount of traffic there was simply insane. A new modmail every 15 minutes or so, spam filter was *constantly* full and the reports queue needed clearing daily. My global modmail &amp; modqueue were *completely* useless because it would be 95% /r/pics traffic and 5% everything else. One of the reasons I eventually stepped down is because I was neglecting a lot of my smaller subreddits because I had gotten out of the habit of checking my modmail and modqueue, there was just so much there that I could drop hours into it and hardly make a dent. By contrast, the /r/bestof modmail and modqueue are pretty light, closer to /r/EarthPorn in traffic than /r/pics. It doesn't drown out the rest of my subreddits and I can give them all the attention they need.

To answer your question, I definitely prefer small to medium sized subreddits over the huge default subreddits. I don't understand how some moderators can be involved with not one, not two, but *several* default subreddits and not be overwhelmed. I have a very strong desire to completely clear my queues when I sit down to moderate, so the fact that I was putting hours of work into the /r/pics queues without ever clearing them was severely bugging me. I'd probably be tearing my hair out if I modded more than one subreddit like that.","1346459557"

&gt;He supports gay marriage, unlike Republicans who want to make a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage.

False. ""Paul said that he supported the right of gay couples to marry, so long as they didn't ""impose"" their relationship on anyone else"" which fits into the self-ownership principal he advocates tooth and nail.

&gt;He supports women's rights. Sorry that I don't agree that an old, male politician should limit my reproductive choices, you asshat.

Oh I see. So anyone who opposes Obama is clearly against womens rights. Classy. Don't even know how to respond to that.

&gt;He appointed the first Latina to the Supreme Court.

Oh that's very interesting. You mean the Latina that is pro-life, right? This certainly backs up your last comment, you asshat. But I suppose there's a little wiggle room because you said ""old male politician"" and not ""middle aged female supreme court judge""

&gt;The first bill he signed into law was the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gives women more freedom to fight for the same pay for equal work.

Great! Whole heartedly agree. Long over-due.

&gt;He fought to make birth control standard preventative care for women. In the US, one out of three pregnancies involves complications, and there is no paid maternity leave. Amnesty International has declared a maternal health care crisis in the US, and President Obama is doing something about it.

That's great. In fact there are a lot of work-related complications for extended leaves that should be addressed, this is one of many. Government imposed birth control, however, is another issue entirely. Why force a group of Americans to fund something they are strongly against? But that's commonplace nowadays.

&gt;The DREAM Act- Our President says we need to prioritize who we are deporting. There are millions of illegals here. We should provide a path to citizenship for those who were brought here as children and have no criminal record and are in school or the military.

Once again, that's great, but a large majority of border-jumpers are forced to do so because of the long, arduous process of gaining entry into the united states. I believe the visa waiting list is about 4.5 million now (give or take a few hundred thousand) One could also argue that these immigrants are forced into crime because they are unable to make a legitimate living. Why chastise people with that in mind? Doing something like this will just encourage boarder jumping because now they are sent the message ""you can gain citizenship before you die"". Maybe we should work on making the waiting list a bit shorter rather than circumventing it altogether. I'm all for legal immigration, the DREAM Act does nothing but hand money to ""coyotes"" and other criminal entities while causing a lot more people to get killed, simultaneously punishing those who try to immigrate legitimately.

&gt;He supports a strong middle class and wants to extend tax cuts to the middle class. in comparison, Romney would end tax breaks on mortgages for middle class people I addition to ending their tax cuts.

Yes, impose more taxes on the rich and slack on the poor. makes perfect sense. We are entitled to more of their money because well...they have a lot of it. Right? It is statistically proven that these sort of 'forced compassion' techniques do not make it in the long run. You should read a book called ""the Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society""

It outlines how underprivileged families were able to find help just as well -- and almost always better-- without government intervention. After the government stepped in and began ""regulating compassion"" there was a 2-3 percent welfare recipient success rate increase before our nation saw a sharp and unforgiving plummet that gains velocity with each consecutive year. Fact of the matter is that the government was originally put in place to protect our liberties, not us. That is the root of all of our problems. I could easily go through and find a dozen things I think Bush did correctly, that does not prove that he is a good president. Especially with things so broad and (in the scheme of things) insignificant as abortion, gay rights, etc. Don't get me wrong, these are great things to care about, but being pro-gay is pretty insignificant in the realm of things like what sort of laws a person puts in place, government spending, economics, or foreign policy. The things you mentioned are things put in place to distract people from the fact that, oh say, he created an executive order that allows a president to circumvent congress and seize all American assets (food, water, utilities, etc.) without a moments notice. Or the fact that he has enacted innumerable laws that conclusively prove he is in bed with corporate interests. I would love to see gays get married, I'm bi-sexual myself. But I'd rather be wrongly chastised than live in slavery and poverty under the Federal overlords. Just food for thought.

You can believe whatever you want about me. I know what I'm talking about and I thought reddit did, too. It is clear that most redditors are just following whatever is popular.

Did I present any evidence or argument? No. Just like when someone gets dumped and they say ""really? After all we've been through? I can't believe you!"" the other person generally doesn't say ""you did not give an analysis of what, exactly, ""we've been through"" and simply threw out baseless mudslinging"". I was metaphorically dumped by /r/politics.

Just because someone does not present a well-formed point by point analysis with citations and pie charts does not mean that they do not have a point. The redditors I mentioned know who they are and they know what I'm talking about. Anyways, enjoy your red vs. blue mentality based on trivial issues.

It might be that once someone becomes a Keyblade Master they travel the worlds searching for someone that will become their own apprentice, kinda like Terra did with Riku and Aqua almost did with Sora. They both saw that both children had the power to wield a Keyblade and wanted to give them that power. It's also possible during Eraqus' early years as a Keyblade Master he traveled the worlds, met Terra and Aqua, gave them the power of the Keyblade and came back years later to see if they wanted to train with him and they agreed. I was always kinda annoyed that BBS never really cleared up how someone is even picked in the first place...

"funny","t5_2qh33","It's not derogatory, it's dialectal. ""Fotze(n)"" as a dialectal synonym is mainly Bairisch (this includes most Austrian dialects), and also exists in subgroups of Fränkisch, especially Moselfränkisch, as a synonym for slapping or generally fighting someone, which is also commonly in use n Bairisch. The etymology of ""Fotze"" as a dialectal, and in modern use mostly derogatory, term for female genitalia isn't entirely clear, but it might have the same stem as ""pussy"". It's also unclear how ""Fotze"" gained the meaning of ""mouth"" or ""slap"". 

""Fotze"" is derogatory mostly in context, although given that dialects are weakening in favour of a trans-German TV dialect, that might not be true anymore. If you use ""Fotze"" in a derogatory manner, however, I'd say this is worse than ""cunt"". It appears as if Australians and British people were using ""cunt"" relatively freely and in a bantering context. This will *not* work with ""Fotze"", unless you mean ""mouth"" or ""slap"" and are in an area where people still understand vulgar Bairisch dialect (vulgar in the original meaning). As an example, in areas with strong *Bairisch* dialect in Austria I could say ""Moch dei Fotzn zua!"" and it would be understood as ""Shut up!"", and ""I *fotz* da glei ane"" would be understood as a warning regarding an upcoming physical altercation involving slapping. By contrast, ""Du Fotzen!"" would be an invitation to fight only incidentally and mainly an insult. ""Fotzen"" can also be used as somewhat crude synonyms for women as a whole, as in ""Die is a geile Fotzen"" (""She is a fox"", but cruder, or ""She's horny"", if literal), and to form superlatives, such as in ""fotzengeil"", (""cunt horny"", which *can* be taken literally, but might also mean something like ""very, very good""). ""Fotzentrottel"", meaning a superlative of ""idiot"", was rather popular when I was a child. 

Now, ""Muschi"" is complicated. It's a term that can be a term of endearment for a woman, it can be used to refer to a female house cat (or a cat of undetermined gender), and it is sometimes used as an early word for female genitalia to girls, although that use will probably be rare nowadays. In a sexual context, it is a term for ""vulva"" that would indicate some level of sexual repression to me, possibly because I learned of ""Muschi"" in pre-adolescent context as a synonym for vulva or vagina.  Further, ""Muschi"" can not really be used as an insult, at least in Austria and *some* parts of Bavaria, it would be comical to do so. It's like an adult attempting to insult someone with ""You are a doodoo!"". Areas where ""Muschi"" is used as a term of endearment for women often also have the synonym ""Mietzi"" as such a term, which can also be used as a nickname for women named ""Maria"", especially the older generations, and also for cats. In Lower- and Upper Austria, ""Mietzi"" with a long ""i"" would be used for cats, and with a short ""i"" for Marias, but that distinction doesn't exist ~~any~~everywhere.

So yeah, long, very much biased by my immediate environment, and probably unnecessary. But there you go.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Obama wants to make it so the people can't survive without the government

Honest question: Example?  Source?  Most of Obama's economic initiatives have been tax cuts for small businesses.  Obama even backed the JOBS bill, which is a firmly pro-business piece of legislation, deregulating venture capital and rolling back regulations to pre-dotcom bubble.

http://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/president-obama-small-business-plan-one-big-idea-tax-cuts.html

&gt; The difference is that with Romney, the American dream of being able to choose to work harder and take risks with less red tape (regulations) on getting started and having to figure out tax codes and laws and such.. in essence simplifying things to make it easier for people to start businesses with less money..

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","You definitely have a case. Whether it is a tort claim or a workman's comp claim is the major issue.

Company property is not definitive for whether it is covered by WC or not. Because you were in Texas solely because of your job, it's likely that the entire trip is covered by WC... unless the only reason you were on an escalator was because you did something WAYYY out of the consideration of the business trip.

For example, you are in town for a weekend conference... escalator at the hotel? Probably WC. Dally over to the river for a quick white-water rafting adventure before the evening lecture? Probably not WC.

Were you at a mall? Hotel? How closely related to business was your escalator incident?

Unless it was WAYYYY outside of business, you are stuck in WC.

To give an idea of leniency think of this scenario:

Driver drives a truck for Company. On one of Driver's routes he detours a block away to get some coffee. Then plans on returning to his route. On his way, he gets in an accident.

This is definitely WC.

Same Driver, same Company, same route. This time he takes an hour detour to go check on his mom's dogs because she is out of town for the weekend. Get's in an accident on the way back.

This is almost definitely NOT WC.","1346459595"
