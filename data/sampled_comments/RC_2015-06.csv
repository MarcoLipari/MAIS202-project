I don't think channeling your inner... is the proper transaltion! 
That would be: sacar/canalizar/mostrar tu ... interior

I meant ""to think that you are someone else, often in a bragging context""
Examples:
-Ha resuelto un problema de física y se cree Einstein.
-Se cree Usain Bolt por haber corrido unos metros.

It is less used without the bragging part:
-Tomó drogas y se creía Napoleón.

And it can be confused with the regular use of ""creer"" (believe), but with another use of ""se""
-Se creía todo lo que le decían sin comprobarlo
-Él es católico, se cree que Adán y Eva existieron.

The proper use of ""se"" is really hard to explain, in Spain we learn it in secondary and high school grammar classes (ages 15-18) because it's a real mess, and I don't remember anything about it since I'm a science student!","1433116800"

It's not lazy legislation. It's legislation that understands that there will be false positives (people in the vehicle and not intending to drive) but allowing these false positives saves far mor elites than there are injustice of penalizing people who are actually innocent. 

If you don't want a DUI, don't drive, turn on a vehicle, and sit in the drivers seat. Pretty damn simple. 

(Yes I'm aware not all laws are able to be reduced similarly like this, but I feel this law is just fine as is and saves more lives in the long run).

Our apartment covers water as a utility so we wouldn't need to worry about that but we would have to worry about the electric bill for running the drier. That has a $40 allowance per month.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Though the exact failure rates of may vary from model year to model year, there was never a point where the issue was fixed.  There have been a number of reasons for EJ257/255 failures through the years.  There were oil pickup tube failures in the earliest generation (05) but that seemed to work itself out.  There are ongoing failures due to clogged banjo bolt filters in the turbo oil inlet, but those can be avoided by maintaining a shortened oil change interval, removing the filter or replacing all of the turbo oil plumbing with an aftermarket kit.

All that said, there has never been a real fix or even an official explanation for the ringland failures.  They seem to effect some percentage of all of the 2.5L motors.  There are many people on the forums that believe the culprit of this to be a problem in the factory tune that allows the motor to run lean under certain conditions.  If that is the case, a good custom tune should help avoid this problem.

Unfortunately there is no date of manufacture after which there are no issues.  The the EJ25 in particular can be a fairly reliable motor, but absolutely requires proper maintenance.  If you are looking at buying this car you really need to see if there is maintenance documentation, and I can't recommend having a pre-purchase inspection done enough.  A leak down and compression test should be included in that.  If it is or has been modified then you should be extra diligent!","1433116805"

Such experimental procedures are only possible with the extensive research into the mechanisms of firearm injuries that you say simply doesn't exist. 

As I said before, the ban applies only to the political aspects. It does NOT apply to research into the treatment of gun injuries.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","I have similar issues and the reason why is because I don't feel the sexual desire when that happens. Only my need for validation for it to go well. What helps me is to think of everything in your interactions that you legitimately find sexually attractive and let your arousal and tenson build. Spend some time to sit and think what you are attracted to. Then embellish and indulge a bit on the healthy ones. See a florescent bra strap that is showing to the side of a girls' shirt? Maybe it's the way she smiles at people, or moves around. It could even be the shade of nail polish she is wearing. A genuine compliment to someone who spends some time to look nice, especially if it's something that turns you on, and  something she does that lets her show off her personality (oh god I love it when women stick the flower in the hair, I don't even know why) makes escalation much easier. 

I say cut down masutrbation to once week ish, and instead of porn, let your material come from your interactions. 

If you escalate when you're not feeling anything,or are focused on ""needing something to work"", it comes off as forced, needy, and creepy","1433116813"

In none of those countries did the military openly attack a peaceful mass protest.  I'm aware of the ability for human atrocity, I just don't think it will happen here.  You're free to disagree and arm yourself for the likelihood, I just think you should spend your time worrying about problems that might occur. 

&gt;Hitler rose to power legally in a democratic nation.

Sure.  And he wasn't overthrown by German citizen militias with WWI weapons.  He was defeated by a foreign military.  

&gt;Kent State Ohio military personnel killed protesters. 

You don't think that's an isolated incident? They killed 4 people.  That's not what we're talking about. 

&gt;Might want to rethink your 0% likelihood.

Nah.  But go ahead and spend thousands of dollars on guns and ammo because you're paranoid. 

&gt;I mean fuck you don't think citizens are ever oppressed violently by their own governments? 

Did not say that. 

&gt; In what world do you live?

The one where you wouldn't stand a chance in a firefight with the US Military.  And the one where the US Military wouldn't allow themselves to be used against the citizenry.  You know, the real world.  How's your bunker btw?   Got enough spam? 

&gt;As for me I'm stuck in the real world and prepared to fight to maintain my liberty and yours as well if it ever comes down to it.

Well it's never come close to happening in our entire history.  So history seems to favor my view. 

&gt;I hope it doesn't, but if it does I'd rather not be throwing rocks and hitting with sticks.

(4% for normal hitboxes, 2.4% for the larger one, 1.3% for the chain one - note that's the coefficient, so multiply by .43)

That's compared to Spectral Blade, with a further range (granted it only hits forward in about a 90 degree cone) at no cost and no cooldown (Explosive Blast has both) yet Spectral Blade has about 7 times the proc coefficient.","1433116815"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","The argument is not that God is the uncreated thing, but that the uncreated thing is God. As should be clear from the dialogue in [*Laws X*](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/laws.10.x.html):

&gt;Ath. If we were to see this power existing in any earthy, watery, or fiery substance, simple or compound-how should we describe it?  

&gt;Cle. You mean to ask whether we should call such a self-moving power life? 

&gt; Ath. I do. 

&gt;Cle. Certainly we should. 

&gt;Ath. And when we see soul in anything, must we not do the same-must we not admit that this is life? 

&gt;Cle. We must. 

&gt;Ath. Then characters and manners, and wishes and reasonings, and true opinions, and reflections, and recollections are prior to length and breadth and depth and strength of bodies, if the soul is prior to the body. 

&gt;Cle. To be sure.

"hemp","t5_2qsai","I don't appreciate your tone. That you have wasted $12,000,000 in taxpayer and other dollars while collecting a CFO's salary, isn't a testiment to hemp. 

A researcher in Sweeden conducted many tests on unprocessed hemp in hempcrete. The material was roughly equivalent to that composed of processed hemp shiv. 

While you say that a plant can't meet all the variety of uses, we are currently failing at incorporating the by-products as is. Most of Canada's hemp production is for seed plants. The tech for processing seeds is cheap. The current market for oil and hemp flour has been pretty steady. A seed plant and a CBD rich plant are not mutually exclusive. What is exclusionary is legislation. You can't harvest the CBD because it's classified as a regulated substance, it's illegal. 

A farmer growing hemp loses out on the CBD potential as well as the shiv potential. Hemp shiv is not available on the Canadian market. A friend just built a hempcrete house and had to import from Denmark. When I say shiv is not available, I'm a university researcher and I can't legally access any. But I can buy weed anywhere. 

As for use of fertilizers, organic hemp is worth far more in Canada and almost all of ours is certified organic. 

Hemp's immediate future is in building material, biocomposites, energy, supplementary organic material, organic foods, cosmetics and medicine. None of these require fibre plants. But all of them have fibre.

The processing of fibre is really something that should happen as it becomes the last wast by-product of hemp, not as its primary resource.","1433116826"

I am a little salty and pretty aggro right now, (external stuff, not because of your comment) I should have edited my language.

I'll quote you and then breakdown what I take issue with in your thought process.

&gt;I said I am tired of people using this sub for money. This includes voting rings and handing over disproportionate power to moderators who then act as gatekeepers. 

Obviously I'm with you on this one. Voting rings are dumb, the people can and should decide what content belongs on the frontpage, it shouldn't just get hive-minded up there by having a super positive rating when it comes out of the new queue.

&gt;Reddit was once about people just sharing cool stuff that they thought others would enjoy. Nowadays it's used more and more as a platform to make money. 

I take issue with this. Whenever you link to somewhere on the internet someone is making money off of that. Page views, ad revenue, whatever. The big difference here is that if you don't post your own content you are relying on blind luck to have any chance of being posted, and you have no control over the time of posting or the title.

A few years back when the sub was smaller and there was less content my friend and I would make a video once every week or so. We would usually make it to the top 10 or so even though the videos weren't especially good (I was pretty proud at the time, but looking back it was pretty cringey). The difference between a [good title](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/smgpc/league_of_noire_the_carrying/) and a [bad one](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/usgpw/new_quality_discourse_4man_premade/) can make your hours of hard work feel worth it, or make it feel like a complete waste. I don't want a lot. I don't want to be the next pewdiepie, or dunkey, or whoever, but I would like to be able to recoup licensing costs and I for sure would like to take myself out for a nice dinner to celebrate.

Really though, I just want people to see what I made, and reddit's suspicion of OC creators makes that very hard.

&gt;The strict rules on this sub encourages such content.

No, they really don't I've had problems in other subs of videos being pulled from the number one spot because we toed the line with some of their rules, and it's no different here. Moderation doesn't help content creators. If a video fails because it isn't good (or sometimes just bad luck) that's fine, but heavy moderation is just as restrictive to people who like to make content as it is to people who simply want to view content.

Sorry for the wall of text, if you don't agree with me that's fine, but I just wanted to explain my point of view better.","1433116827"

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Juggernaut is not in any top-tier decklists, and I doubt there will be any popular netdecks that contain it. On that grounds, you could dust it.

HOWEVER, If you wanted to throw it in a deck, control warrior would be the most likely archetype. Games can go long, making chance to draw the mine high. As a 6-mana, 5 health creature, it would most likely replace either Sylvannas or ~~Iron~~ Shield Maiden.

On replacing Sylvannas, I find that in a lot of cases, her deathrattle doesn't get much benefit. Usually my opponnent would do a suboptimal trade to make me get nothing, put a lot of small, usless stuff on the board, or would have a way to straight up remove it. In these situations, IJ could be better (unlikely, but possible).

On replacing Shield Maiden, yes sometimes that 5 armor is extremely useful with shield slam, but if you are facin a lot of control, IJ could be better. Control v control games usually result in the warrior having a LOT of armor anyway. In these cases, you can look at it as shield maiden heals you for 5 making a 5 health differential between you and your opponent. Iron Juggernaut's mine does 10 damage, making a 10-health differential. In a control heavy meta where both players draw most of their decks, IJ replacing one of the Shieldmaidens is a valid choice.

All in all, if I were to open an IJ, I would keep it because sometimes it's fun using surprise cards.","1433116829"

&gt; You are here using the term ""philosophy"" ambiguously. I am there referring to the study of philosophy as a formal academic discipline, not to the informal consideration of philosophical questions by individuals.

If anybody was using it ambiguously it was you, but my point still stands either way. 

&gt; The question I raised is about whether academics are doing a good job helping people towards that end or not.

Well considering that the majority of philosophers are moral objectivists it doesn't seem the study of philosophy leads many people to reject the idea that there is a real right and wrong

Unlikely.  You'd probably be wondering why a gorgeous actress so far out of your league is suddenly grinding on you and trying to eat your face.

Either situation is a mental c-c-c-ombo breaker because they're both highly unexpected events and your brain would probably wonder if you're being set up or something else.  My prediction is that in both situations you would bail out or freeze up, had you not been able to think about them in advance.","1433116829"

I could even tell you f(A) is .5, and |f(A)-f(B)|&lt;2^-N for some large N.  Now you have no way of knowing how many digits of X you need to generate to even potentially put it in that range with any probability.  It basically becomes a game of who picked the bigger N.","1433116831"

I prefer to keep it on a peak than to get it die slowly on 30 seasons though) is starting at the end of June with a special with all people that played before (including the 3 champions).

About your questions there aren't really any other show similar to these two except a couple of episodes in 2 popular varieties. These kind of episodes, however, are more focused on long/physical chases (often through a large urban area like Seoul) with very simple but deep rules so what you see is more improvising and betraying each other for fun (and sometimes just to make it entertaining) than complex strategies. Also, the people playing it aren't really very intelligent people and that's kind of the charm. The point is to don't take everything they do that seriously. 

I'm a infinity challenge fan (see my flair) so it's pretty much obligatory to recommend you some of them. Just try one and see if you can get hooked to the difference that you will see in the style. Also, the show isn't really about this, so look for the episodes when they do this.

"battlecats","t5_2tsiy","All right let's see. It's too bad you don't have Macho Legs, cause he really is useful here against those Rain D. Do you have Paris? That cat can substitute too. If you have Ubers they can help too (depends on what Uber).

Line 1: Crazed Macho, Crazed Wall, Eraser, Crazed Whale, Crazed UFO

Line 2: King Dragon, Crazed Dragon, Jamiera, Bahamut,Ururun


You won't need Rich Cat here, so just stall the Pigeons de Sable for money here until you reach max efficiency and money. After reaching max money and everything, spam the Crazed Cats (Whale, UFO, Dragon) plus King Dragon (a handful, like 3 of each if possible). Once you hit the base, BOSS PARADE! I was honestly surprised with this level. Shit tons of bosses and took me a few tries to finish it too.

Anyways first up is Kory, Camelle and Nyandam. Just send out your casual Crazed + King Dragon to finish him however the Rain D's will start appearing (they are the true pain in the ass here) so start sending out meatshields (2-3 of them, depends how many Rain D's there are) plus Bahamut and Ururun. This is tricky, cause you won't be able to hold them off well if you don't use meatshields but you might get shockwaved to death. Just hope you dealt enough damage to Kory to finish him (if you killed him before the Rain D's come, good). Now comes a critical part, you should do enough damage to the Rain D's here and try to synch their attacks using Cat Cannon (including Camelle). Your army will probably get wiped out after this, Jamiera won't be useful until the Rain D's die. If you get cornered, spam meatshields and stall till you can summon your Bahamut and a few range cats (I'll go for Crazed UFO with this one, if you have Paris she can knockback better). When I did this they almost reach my base, a few centimeters away but killed them. If you managed to kill the Rain D's take a breather and send out Jamiera to deal with Camelle (watch out for Nyandam, so you should still spawn meatshields) and send occasional Crazed Cats + King Dragon too. A Teacher Bear and Dark Otter spawns occasionally, they aren't much of a threat with meatshields but they will kill your Jamiera before he reach Camelle, so deal with them. If you can summon Ururun/Bahamut, go ahead. After killing the Camelle, Nyandam is left and you can take him on himself. I think the Teacher Bear and Dark Otter still spawns until he's dead, be careful. Wall Doge also spawns here. BOOM! You thought it's over? A Pair of Angel Sleipnir comes out of the base. Not much of a threat with 3 meatshields, Crazed Cats and King Dragon. Sending Jamiera's help too. You should have Bahamut and Ururun to deal with them faster. After killing them only Pigeons and Wall Doges remain, and you have won the stage.

Honestly, not everything will go according to plan. This stage requires you to adapt every now and then. Change your strategy according to the bosses/enemies you will face and the situation you are in (how many are them, how far are them from your base etc.) I just give general tips in handling this stage and possible scenarios. Challenging and a fun stage! Goodluck! (Tried this with Tesalan Pasalan recently, walk in the park XD)","1433116840"

As for having never been kissed, again, totally normal no matter what you may have heard. My first kiss was when I was 19, but more importantly it didn't happen then because I hit some magical age but because it was the right time for me. Take a deep breath, trust me, you will be ok.","1433116841"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Honestly, I don't see why this is being misinterpreted as gender inequality. The reason ISNA highschool did not want to play is not because they see women as inferior, but rather, because islam teaches us to avoid mingling with those of the opposite sex to avoid physical attraction between a male and female. This is the same reason women are told to dress modestly, and men told to lower their gaze. The muslim team was not aware that the other highschools boys team consisted of some girls, which is ISNA's problem. To make up for their mistake, they offered to forefit. The other school, instead of accepting a forfeit, offered to substitute their girl players for boys. 

In Islam, we are taught to respect women. They are our mothers, sisters, daughters, and we have the utmost respect for females. Islam came at a time when daughters were seen as a burden and people would bury their kids alive if they had daughters. Islam was against this and saved people from ignorance. If you read the Qur'an, you'll find no religion elevates the status of a woman like islam.
This article has nothing to do with gender inequality.

I remember one a while back that was a tumblr blog that was just some young otherkin/head canon kid playing with imaginary friends because they had no real ones.

One of the closing statements on their tumblr was that this was a place for them to play around and feel like they were interacting with the outside world, and that they just wanted to be left alone to do that.

The amount of hatred it got was borderline psychotic, and I genuinely felt bad for the kid. Worst off, if memory serves, they deleted the blog shortly after.

The worst of us bullied a lonely, isolated kid out of their sandbox because we didn't like the sandcastles they were building. It was honestly fucked up.

Going through it right now.

&gt;How did it turn out? 

So far, so good. But we had LOADS of communication about it. He tried out for the reserves almost 3 years ago and got knocked back. Then he decided that if he was going to try again, he was going to go for full time. He did a lot of work on himself and while I wasn't thrilled with the idea I supported him all the way.

&gt;Im also concerned about being together. I feel like we would basically have to get married to stay together with him being in the military and i dont know if im ready for that. 

We're not married and have no desire to be. We are recognised by the military (Australian) as an ""interdependent couple"" so we still get the same spousal benefits.

&gt;Also how would i have a career myself if we would have to move every 4 years or so? 

I don't know about the US but here there is heaps of support and guidance for military spouses in getting job transfers, retraining and setting you up in new locations. That said, I am not comfortable with relocating at this point and depending on his posting, I may opt to stay behind and he will live on base. We haven't decided yet.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Gross as it is, I think it's basic supply and demand in this case. You have far less women and more men at a Comicon. This would be even more true at a Comicon speed dating event, which most women at the con would give a ten mile berth, given their (perhaps unfair) impression of what the dudes at it would be like. Put it this way: I'm female, I read a ton of comics (my name is from a Red Lantern comic), and you could not actually pay me to go to that, based on what I know of certain male comic fans. So, they waive the fee to make it more appealing to women. ","1433116846"

Face lifts are performed by making an incision underneath the hairline and pulling your skin back to stretch it flat. It pulls your eye sockets, making them longer and more almond shaped.

It was the Venezuelan military that asked a group of civilian opposition leaders to head a new government. Those civilians were not prepared to take power and made some mistakes. There was infighting in the military, and finally a group loyal to Chavez brought him back.

The US government quickly recognized the new government, and it was later shown that the CIA knew about some of the plans in advance. But there has never been any proof that the US supported that or any other coup. ","1433116848"

My original comment stated that the game is not finished yet, which is a fact, one which you don't seem to understand. Not only is it not finished but it wont be in a phase where they should care about something as trivial as weapon sway for probably another year. Putting resources towards something like that is just a waste of everyone's time.","1433116849"

Suppose you are sw developer, an a client tells you: Hey, its impossible to deploy our Java based application in less than 30 minutes, with 15 manual MUST be done steps to complete in the middle. If thats the case, and we all agree that manual deployment is an issue, my response would be the same that i have gave here: ""I dont need to be familiar with your deployment process (to know that is non optimal)"". Simply based on the FACT that others are able to do it fast and automatized under similar circumstances. So, in KI example, there are plenty of games that i own, and they provide incremental updates: Forza 2, Forza 5, Halo MCC, Wolfenstein, etc.. So, why KI just requires to download the entire game every single time theres an update? Why IF rest of games in my catalog do the same thing well?

What counts as a ""Black Art or Athletics""? Is it art that was simply made by black people, or is it art that is made using traditional African themes/motifs/techniques and speaks about African culture? Same with Athletics. Are we celebrating people just because they're black? What's a ""Black"" sport? Can Black people appropriate sports, because I thought Basketball used to be white.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Youre funny! and have a delusional mindset on comic characters. Which is fine, there are so many 'off-chutes' and 'plot-devices'. But you don't seem to know very much of the Watchmen world either. 

I've seen the movie and read the comics before.

&gt; I don't want to get into a 'nerd war' about this. There are so many links out there stating his powers. A simple google search would tell you why your entire argument is wrong.

Funny you say ""nerd war"" when you yourself call yourself a geek in one of your previous comments. Regardless, this is a hobby that people are passionate about, just like Football, Pokémon, Movie critique, and others. Also the links out there will state Dr Manhattan has 2 powers. They are: *Time Sensory* and *Matter Manipulation* that is it. Sure there's some fallacy links that say he has omnipotent powers because those people don't really understand much. Just because a link says it doesn't make it true.

&gt; Your perception on physics and time are severely lacking as well (thats what Dr. Manhattan has complete control over...not ""mid-tier""). 

Actually I'm right. Dr Manhattan has never shown feats beyond basic mid-tier matter manipulation. When he stopped the missiles, he only stopped 99% of them. And when he builds machines he makes them with parts, he doesn't create them out of thin air - Captain Atom or Silver Surfer would be able to do that, making both of those guys high-tier (which means both of them would make Dr Manhattan their bitch)

&gt; Also, judging by your post history, this is all you do. There would be no changing your mind anyway. 

Not really, I do other things with my time, especially on reddit. Like I said above, it's a hobby I really enjoy and many others enjoy, and the fact that I've been doing this for a while kind of gives me some credibility with what I'm saying here. 

I feel like you saw the movie or read a bit of the comics and went on the Dr Manhattan fanboy-train and just went with it. There are SO many people who can destroy him. I'll give you 3 examples of how so you'll be satisfied (and I can back all of it up with proof if you want me to)

* Reality Manipulation/Warping

* Power Cosmic

* Power Mimicry

Silver Surfer, Firelord, Galactus, etc. Have the Power Cosmic, which is basically an evolved version of matter manipulation. 

Franklin Richards, Mad Jim Jaspers, Jamie Braddock, etc. Have reality manipulation, which is basically the ability to grant wishes. If Franklin Richards said ""I don't want Dr Manhattan to exist anymore"" then you better bet Dr Manhattan will cease to exist and that'll be it for him. There's 2 ways.

Protégé, Hope Summers, etc. Have Power Mimicry, which is the ability to absorb someone else's powers. Protégé's power mimicry was so strong that he nearly defeated the Living Tribunal with it. And the Living Tribunal is a dozen tiers above what Dr Manhattan wishes he can do.

Hopefully this changed your mind, there's a lot of people who fanboy Dr Manhattan really hard and are like leeches with letting go of it, it's hard to accept that your idol isn't as powerful as you thought and there's other characters who'd wash him out.

What makes Awakening any less of a Fire Emblem game than Radiant Dawn and Genealogy, two games that get a ton of praise in the community but shook up the FE formula *just as much as Awakening?* And why do *you* get to decide what one is a real FE game and what one isn't?

Oddly, I almost texted him last night after my sports team (which he hates) DOMINATED. I know he was watching the game too and kinda like that he was thinking about me and that he was the one who texted first. He has zero reason to reopen communication with me unless he's trying to hang out again (he has multiples of the object in question). I texted back, so we'll see how this one goes. Probably nowhere, but it would be nice to have a bootycall in the neighborhood again.

Still puzzled by the guy I've been seeing for the past few months. Three ish months of dating (with extended breaks for travel), limited communication, no DTR or exclusivity talk, but there's something there. I'm beginning to lose interest because he travels so much and I want someone to be paying a little more attention to me, but I also want to figure out what his deal is first. Really can't figure him out.

Going out with a 30 year old on Friday. Haven't dated anyone more than a year or so older than me in a while so it should be interesting for novelty's sake alone. He's a big texter though and I had to tell him to knock it off because my phone's a piece of junk.","1433116860"

&gt;Somewhere out there is someone who is right for you.

As for pluralizing:

If you're typing and can italicize, do it like this: *there*s. If you cannot italicize, you can write ""there""s. And though some will get their knickers in a twist at this suggestion, if you can't easily italicize and want to skip the awkward-looking *s* after the quotations marks, you could write *two there's in a row*.

**Is it slander to warn my neighbours about bed bugs?**

&gt; I live in BC in a 3 story frame building. About a month ago, I started getting bites. As soon as I found out it was bed bugs, I told the landlord. I was sprayed last Friday and this Friday. Between the 2 days, I found out that my neighbour, who shares my bedroom wall with their bedroom wall, has had them for over 2.5 months and has been sprayed 5 times. I most likely got them from the walls. I have already cleaned like crazy and have thrown out a bunch of stuff. I am moving out at the end of June and kinda want to warn people. But can I without legally being responsible? Either way, I was thinking of waiting until I get my deposit back before doing anything and mailing letters as I am moving to another province.","1433116864"

Ironically this might mean an even shorter big man, since they would be able to get out to more rebounds, since longer shots tend to produce longer rebounds, they would tend to also be able to shoot threes better, and they would tend to be able to guard people shooting threes better etc, which might make threes even more self reinforcing.","1433116866"

Well, Italia has one of the best food in the the world! And they eat a lot too! Try all kind of pasta (bolognese is my favourite), lasagna and pizza. Porchetta is excellent too and of course, the wine! 

As for tips, well, Italian don't really speak engish a lot. Just ask ""Parla inglese?"" and if they say no, don't insist further. Even in restaurants and shops it can be hard. Some city are full of tourists tho, so you can anywhere. The beaches are not that great. Honestly I think the best deal is to take a car and ride in the countryside: you'll find beauty everywhere.

"crossfit","t5_2qqfd","I don't do rebounding box jumps and I don't jump from 15 foot ropes (and literally don't know anyone personally who does).  Not convinced kipping pullups are hurting my shoulders don't properly, but I train with strict and just use them in WODs.

I do think I've been coached properly by someone who dropped a grand for a two day course. To me this is the biggest flame that gets pumped out. It doesn't take that much official training to do a whole host of jobs.  People who coach at boxes do it because they love it (it sure ain't for the money). Most are obsessed.  There ability to properly coach me is based off way more than their level one. It's based off the years they've put into there craft (performing and coaching) and there general passion for proper form.  I'm also not sure what I want them to have beyond that? More weightlifting training? Sure I guess. It just tough for me to get worked up about this when I've probably been coached by 50 different coaches when you include drop ins and find the coaching to be remarkably consistent across boxes.  Also whats the joe who goes to their local gym getting? Nothing? Some kid with a physiology degree who is just ""designing individual programming"" by reading off the gold's gym template?

An exercise? Sure if ""an exercise"" has a too high risk-reward ratio I don't think it should be done. But if by ""an exercise"" you mean ""crossfit"" I would argue studies shows the injury rates aren't higher than gymnastics, distance running, or soccer all of which we treat as perfectly acceptable exercise. I would also argue that the rewards are huge. I weigh 20 pounds more than I did a year ago and yet my blood pressure and heart rate are down. I'm not getting that at my local gym or neighborhood clubhouse. I wouldn't go or I would go and spend an hour and burn maybe 400 calories or work something absurdly specific like ""traps"" or ""calves.""

"Naruto","t5_2quts","Possible powers for Bolt...

- **Tenseigan** (The tenseigan is awakened when Ōtsutsuki chakra is fused with Hyūga chakra, Hyūga chakra coming from Hinata &amp; Ōtsutsuki chakra coming from Naruto. Also the Tenseigan is shining blue, Bolts eyes are blue)

- **Senjutsu** (learned via Konohamaru)

- **Lightening Style: Flying Thunder God** (with Uzumaki chains)

- **Fire Jutsu** (learned via his master Sasuke)

- **Uzumaki Sealing Jutsu** (learned via Karin)

- **Transmigrant of Hagoromo** (remember that an enemy stronger than Kaguya is going to show up)

---

Heres my running theory on Bolts powers...

- Bolt doesnt seem to have Byakugan, the factor that prevents non Hyūga from using gentle fist is the fact that they cant see chakra because they lack the Byakugan, bolt lacks the Byakugan. If Bolt were to learn senjutsu he would be able to see chakra, also since bolt is a Hyuga he has amazing chakra control. This would allow Bolt to use Gentle Fist Senjutsu","1433116868"

In like two of my history classes and in my government class we were told that Japan refused to surrender after the first bomb and so we sent a second one and even then they refused. The only reason they did was because the Emperor personally came out and told them to stop fucking around with the Americans. And what I've heard was that the emperor comes from a long line of a family that's ruled Japan since all of recorded history and so he's basically sacred to the Japanese people. My teacher said that in theory we could've threatened to bomb the emperor and they would have given up but I don't know the legitimacy of that. If we had bombed the emperor then it might have just caused extreme resentment and even more Americans and Japanese people would have died. ","1433116868"

Due to the particle vibrations I don't have any knowledge of the equations for the simulation (it is essentially a blackbox problem). I'm using the Wavelet transform to denoise the system of the vibrations and keep the desired jumps between cavities (the particle jumps from microcavity to microcavity within the polymer).

I tried TVD because it seemed like an easier implementation of the Wavelet shrinkage. 

The two methods you have proposed seem appropriate. So if I do the TVD and finite difference peak detection, I should be able to pick out the significant jump. Otherwise use the wavelet method with the Haar wavelet. 

Just a quick question though, how would I quantify that the Haar wavelet is the best mother-wavelet to use?

It is good, if you wanna join and play in the mud with the plebs, when you see someone stupid in the next 48 hours, just remember the power of voting.

&gt; I figured that you wanted to restrict voting somehow, but it never will, and never should, happen.

It will happen in the future. Nothing stays forever the same. Imagine a day where politicians have to speak clearly and intelligent to their constitutes and not to pander for petty votes from bigots, racist, UN-educated low status people.

I feel bad for you

I'd love to talk as well.  You can get ahold of me at jessicamikell@gmail.com or just check out the website first: fixieedits.com
I am heading through your neck of the woods this summer and am trying to build some beautiful write-ups of companies and photography so that every story is strong and so that I can get to everyone in person to make sure they are getting the most positive write-ups for all.  I'd love to come and visit.  
What I'm really aiming to do is show everyone's best side and assemble a sort of magazine of companies out there innovating ways to tell their stories -- you can tell me yours and I'd love the chance to show you working on a boat if I can take some photographs.  I want an absolute win-win situation, so I want the story I write to be transparent and you can see the final draft and input before we decide where it would best be showcased (I'm very new to the reddit world).  I can't imagine needing to take up your ""real"" time, which I understand we are all a bit low on.  We can talk while I am there or Skype, email, etc. so that I can get a sense of your story and tell it well, but it shouldn't be too onerous.  Thanks!  I'm so glad you are doing what you're doing and I hope you get to spend your days using that full suspension in the PNW woods.  I just got my daughter a hardtail and we hope to be on our way soon.

"" Remember, though, that it is not lawful to ask for more than the first and last months’ rent. Some landlords will try asking for a full year’s rent. ""

I was asked to pay 1st month, last month, and 2 extra month on the spot when I signed the lease (which also resulted in questionable receipts that does not match the lease...)

So... does that count for anything?

I've been looking over this:
http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/upload/TheNewcomersGuide_E.pdf

and thats what I found, now I dont know if it... applies to my case but I hope it does.

Also, I understand that your trying to help and solve this case for me, but I think you misunderstood. I know I messed up and I know that this is a mess - I searched up a lot of other things rather than bait and switch because I memorized what it was during class (PHIL 215).

Now, in terms of how it applies - I dont really know, i just know WHAT IT IS!

So like from where I stand,

Bait - They advertised something completely different from the original plan - its actually funny because I remembering asking them a ton of times over the phone if it was a 1 year lease.

Switch - When I got there, they didnt really explain to me what it was - they explain the payment, rules, consequences.

I MEAN YES!! ITS MY FAULT!! But!

""The “switch” occurs when a salesperson pressures the customer into purchasing a higher-priced product as a replacement, or if customers find themselves induced to make other purchases while inside the store.""

I do feel pressured into it because it was the VERY LAST FEW DAYS THAT I CAN GET A PLACE TO LIVE!! (that and I only had 2 days left on my other place) &lt;--- I can argue that the saleperson pressured me because they only showed me what I knew and never explained what was actually written - YES AGAIN - MY FAULT - but in my mind this is still a clear bait and switch and the receipt is just something that I can use as a defense.

I'm not exactly here for you to care for :&lt;

I mean, its great that you care for me and I thank you for it - but it was never an requirement for you so you dont need to feel bad &lt;3

Currently, I'm looking over the guarantor fund receipt - the most important line is ""The guarantor fund is applied to the 2nd last and 3rd last month's of the 12-month lease concerned with the above tenant and property.""

And then, I really hope this last line doesnt excuse them for forcing me to pay 4 months rent on the spot.

""This guarantor fund is provided in lieu of a signed guarantor form. A guarantor form is not required when a guarantor fund has been paid, per the domus lease process.""

because I can prove that I paid everything on the same spot - through my banking or just the receipt (cause all the receipts are dated April 25, 2014)

EDIT: Quick question, what if the the landlord is not mitigating or in my case - mitigated the damage very late.

I heard that if they didn't mitigate at all - they cant sue me for rent, but what if its very late? like 2 months late?

EDIT #2: I read that ""It is also illegal to have a locker deposit, for a building storage locker, though a refundable key deposit can be asked for though not for more than the replacement cost of the key."" - I lost my keys during march, and i got it replaced for $45 (from domus), but my deposit is $200 for my key (I also have the receipt) can I use this in my defense as well?","1433116873"

One thing I've noticed is that opposing counsel and the court get most pissed off when you are about to win and they really don't want you to, so it can be exciting once you realize you are on the right track.

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","In your opinion. Personally I know what I'd choose between maxing again and running another marathon.

You're still missing the point, nobody cares if you're impressed or not, it's still a massive personal achievement to most people, and it's how they feel about their own accomplishments that matter, not your opinion. I personally was bloody thrilled when I maxed, even if I did what the guy in this thread did and maxed early by accident.

I agree, being maxed in 2006 is more impressive, but that's still not the point I'm trying to make, although I think your argument is flawed because more people complete accomplishments every day, maxing is no different, so I don't see how that's relevant. Even if RS had never changed since 2006, many more people would be maxed now 9 years later than were then. Time erodes how impressive an achievement is far more effectively than most things.

In that case it was a poor argument, because you literally just compared them.

Why are sports and Runescape so different? To use my own sport as an example, bicycles 20 years ago weighed a lot more than they do today, the gears and wheels were awful and sports nutrition was basically non-existent. Compare that to modern road racing and we have a massive technological advantage over those that came before us. Why is that any different from something like Seren Stones?","1433116878"

"justneckbeardthings","t5_2xp02","&gt; Not sure why all the libertarian hate though. People call libertarianism anarchy lite. 

This is a misnomer, given that anarchy has always been anti-capitalist. It's really just feudalism-lite or, more accurately, rebranded classical liberalism with a Randian slant.

&gt;The same can be said for the Democratic party being socialism lite and the Republican party being tyranny lite.

Ehh, I wouldn't really say that either. The democrats are not very further left than the republicans in the grand scheme of things (within the context of the US they are, but then the only socialist parties in the US never really hold significant office--the last one to run for the presidency was arrested for trying to attend a debate). Democrats very rarely work toward proletarian ownership of the means of production. They may be in favor of nationalization of a lot of industry, but they are still quite firmly working within a capitalist rubric.

I'd honestly just lump the two together and call them both tyranny, but I would be including neocolonialism and not just the horrid shit they do inside the country. Keep in mind we still use slave labor and that both parties get some use out of it. It's not quite North Korea, but it is still a very, very awful place for a significant portion of the population to live.

The history of politics is interesting stuff. If you're interested in anarchism and socialism you should look up Engels, Bakunin, and Kropotkin for introductory stuff. Marx is better if you have some grounding in it or if you just like to dive into things and learn as you go. That said, Marx/Engels/Kropotkin/Bakunin are just starting points and a lot has been done since then. They will, however, give you an excellent grounding in the basics. Oh, and I'd drop Engels as soon as possible since he had some very odd ideas about people.

The reason we require a certain karma level to post is there were too many hit and run users. People who would ask questions but never give thanks or have a dialogue with people who spent time to help them. Because of this we decided on the policy to only allow question post from users who have shown they are capable of having a discussion and contributing. If your posts gives solid content (like an AMA) or is about helping students please stand by as it will be reviewed and possibly approved.

We also ask you to only submit after reading the subreddit rules. We get a lot of reposts and things that are covered in the FAQs, and our readers get sick of the same things coming round. The fact you didn't know you need 10 comment karma to post shows you likely didn't read the sidebar and possibly missed the info we've already placed there to help people.

The only reason R- and S- are found in a lot of pharmaceutical names is because frequently one of the two enantiomers happens to be more potent, either generally or for the desired effects.

A perfect example is amphetamine, which has R- and S- (also notated as d- and l-, and the l-amphetamine happens to have more cardiovascular effects, while the d- is more specific to the beneficial effects for ADD and the like.

""They"" are not begging for more protection. That's not what police do. Police nearly never proactively stop crimes from happening or interrupt them while they are going on. 

Police investigate and arrest you after you commit the crime. Why don't you steal from the store? You totally can grab it and run out, and you most likely won't get stopped. But you don't do it because you know you'll get tracked down and arrested for it. 

Now let's pretend that every time that store called the cops, the cops came and shut the store down for the day. If you own the store and someone shoplifts, do you call the cops knowing that it will actually cause more of a problem for you than the shoplifter did?

People in places like Baltimore don't trust police officers. They don't trust police officers because of the violence they commit and the fact that they are nearly never held accountable. So when a shooting happens, people don't turn to the cops, because they are more afraid of them then criminals.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Maybe you should think about this more in terms of a real scenario.

In EVE you can live in wormholes. Wormholes have no stations, and require you to live out of ""player-owned starbases"" (POSes) which are essentially a big bubble that bad dudes can't shoot through and have enough defenses to stop a small number of people from killing it. One consequence of POSes is that unless you are meticulous about your security, you typically store all of your ships together in a ship maintenence array (SMA) and all of the items in a corp hangary array (CHA).


Now say you've been in the corp living in this wormhole for a while, and a large group rolls in and starts killing your corp's POS which happens in two stages across a few days. Everything you have in there is effectively going to die. Wanting to get your stuff out, you contact the CEO of the other corp, and he agrees to let you safely take stuff out as long as you steal everything and pay them a cut. Some people will do that, some people won't. In fact, some people join wormhole corps just to get access to the hangars and to steal everything. Is the CEO being a dickhead to you? You can just steal all of his ships from the SMA and quit the corp, etc. ","1433116884"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","What I'm saying is that the statement isn't one that anyone should read as a universal truth. It's a line tucked into a specific argument, written in unique circumstances. Paul knows that Christians mess up; that's one of the things he's writing to the church in Corinth about, rebuking some of the folks there. 

I think there is something there to critique though. Paul's arguing that since Christians now have the Holy Spirit, they're not subject to the same moral/conscience shortcomings as the people of God had before the coming of Jesus. Maybe the lack of difference in moral fortitude of Christians versus non-Christians is a compelling argument, but idk.

The game certainly is without flaws but I'm beginning to wonder if I ironically had avoided all of these nuances because of the way I'm playing the game:

So far, I have not dabbled with the crafting system at all. I read into it a little bit and it looks like this system was added specifically to this version of the game. It looks like it didn't exist in the original version. At least I can't find anything that says otherwise. Damn it.

I've also maintained the same party for like 95% of my play through. I actually have an *excess* of skill points and nothing interesting to dump them into.

I just recently changed the protagonist's class to the dragoon, and recruited a sword master. I was pretty annoyed that when I recruited the sword master the game threw his items into my inventory and set him to level 1. I think I played through roughly 5 random encounters and managed to get them to a level where they could contribute to the story's battles. Again, maybe because I like grinding these issues didn't upset me too much. Now I can easily see how/why that would annoy others.

I wonder what other issues I may have overlooked...","1433116888"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Sorry, you're telling me I don't get to blame an organization for demanding dogmatic adherence, whilst providing no justification for any of its claims? How come we get to blame extremist factions within religions for their wrongdoings, but never the religions themselves?

That's a blatantly obvious double standard born from the desire of the majority of the population to live with confidence in their beliefs and avoid doubt. Doubt is the death of any dogmatic organization, religions included, and we get to blame them for that at the very least.

&gt; Faith (in Christianity) looks to a higher, just, loving, perfect power and asks for mercy and encouragement.

Don't you dare. If you want to claim that the 'higher power' of any religion is perfect or loving, then you are claiming that the people in those religions are completely immoral. Why? Because you're claiming they all think everything the being allows from genocide, to cancer, to rape, etc. is acceptable.","1433116888"

Basically, he tackles religious people like they're something on the bottom of his shoe. Heck, anyone that disagrees with him. This isn't the optimal way to change peoples minds. Nor does it reflect well on other prominent Atheists (especially those that associate themselves heavily with PZ, like Dillahunty).

Here's the opening paragraph from Atheist Ireland's statement on the matter.

*""Atheist Ireland is publicly dissociating itself from the hurtful and dehumanising, hateful and violent, unjust and defamatory rhetoric of the atheist blogger PZ Myers. The final of many, many straws were his latest smear that Ayaan Hirsi Ali is ‘happily exploiting atrocities’, and his subsequent description of Atheist Ireland’s chairperson as ‘the Irish wanker’. We are also asking all ethical organisations and individuals to consider how you can help to reverse his harmful impact on both individuals and the atheist movement generally.""*

I'm pretty sure him and Matt are still 'tight', and I'm a big believer in ""A man is known by the company he keeps."".

If you'd like any examples of PZ getting out of line, i'll do what I can to dig up some stuff. Hope this reply is good enough for now.

I've felt down before, but it's all about your attitude. Get out there, be proactive and get some hobbies. Even volunteer. Once you have meaning to your life, things will get better and the relationships will come naturally.","1433116893"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt;I realize that there are famous women guitarists but its almost like they will never be as well known as their male equivalent. 

There's aspects of music where sexism has happened for a very, very long time (classical musicians have had an uphill battle with this for years which has, for the past few decades, started to come down).  So it does happen.

However, I think this is more a function of the male equivalents coming first.  Unless you really stand out in terms of your playing in some way either with a unique sound or style of play, you're going to simply be swamped by a number of great guitarists.

It's why I think guitarists like Gabriela Quintero and Bonnie Raitt succeed, in large part because they provide a sound that either nobody does (in Gabriela's case) or they're the clear leader of a specific aspect of guitar (which would be Raitt's case, there's just not as many dedicated slide guitarists).

It's stiff competition to be a renowned guitarist.  It'd be great to have more female guitarists, but only if it's on the merit of being a great guitarist that just happens to be female rather than used as a selling point.","1433116894"

""We have received many questions about our recently presented research paper on gluten contamination of probiotics including which probiotics should individuals consume.  Our response is below: We have not named each probiotic, principally because there is so much batch-to-batch variability based on prior studies of supplements that we would not be comfortable declaring any probiotic safe. We usually do not recommend probiotics in the treatment of gluten related disorders. It is unfortunate that concerned patients are looking to us to police this issue, and we frankly do not have the resources to take on members of this large industry one by one. We hope that the public will direct this concern to regulatory authorities, who are ultimately the only ones with the ability to solve this problem. Peter HR Green, MD

"oculus","t5_2uni5","Typically? From what I've seen generally you can expect it to command a price premium of about 20% for awhile once it gets that low, but when the market normalizes again it will do so around the new flavor of RAM. This was a lot less onerous for DDR vs SDR, due to the SDR 133 spec outperforming DDR 200 in some instances and not commanding any substantial price premium. With DDR2 there was no such impetus for the new tech to drop, but it eventually happens due to the number of fabs producing the new flavor of memory. Usually I'd expect it to take a year or more before the prices of DDR4 drop down to about even with DDR3, but things have been slowing down in the industry. I mean, we used to see a new GPU chipset every 6 months like clockwork that was effectively two of the prior chip. Now CPUs aren't capable of shooting up in clock speed, rollouts take longer... 

Still I'd be inclined to think that the price premium on DDR4 will be closer to 25% Q1 next year compared with the nearly 100% it is commanding right now. That's really just a guess though, market forces can always drive it down faster or keep it higher longer. Given that I'm one of those few fools who dove into DDR 200 and paid a substantial price premium on the motherboard and RAM to do so, and then saw SDR 133 come out and outperform it... I'm always inclined to wait until the price premium is less substantial now. A lot of the cost increase of a DDR4 system right now is the motherboard and processor that will support it, and once there are i5 CPUs that support DDR4 there will be lower end motherboards rather than just high end parts. Of course I haven't really been active in the industry in a few years, there are probably people who have more insight into this specific transition. I'm just working off what I remember from having been around for the jumps from SDR to DDR and DDR to DDR2. 

So, TL;DR: Eventually yes, but in time for Q1 2016? It's unlikely, but the price premium should drop substantially over the next 7-10 months.

"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","You make some excellent points. However, I have to disagree with you on one of them. Regarding your inclination to find LaCour not guilty on the charge of making up his data, entering one of his quotes regarding mistakenly using simulated waves as evidence. I think that you are giving him a bit of a free pass here. Even assuming that this is true (i.e., he did simulate repeated measurements on the response and used them for sensitivity analyses), this would do little to explain away some of the most damning (empirically demonstrated) accusations by Broockman et al. 

For instance, the distributional similarities between ""study 1"" and ""study 2"" in LaCour's data - supposedly two separate non-probability samples from the same population (LA County) - and their joint similarity to the response distribution of the same construct for a nationally representative sample, are not explained away by this potential mistake by LaCour. 

The fact that wave 2 was statistically indistinguishable from wave 1 with a normally distributed shock added to it would not be explained away by this mistake.

Overall, the Broockman et al report analysis is so devastating because even as particular issues could be explained away by common mistakes, there is another irregularity not addressed by this mistake which could not have been produced without deliberate manipulation of the data to produce a desired result.","1433116896"

The Tri-Hone is good, but I found the natural stones do not work well on the very wear-resistant steels (D2, S30V, etc.). I tried sharpening my composite blade Leek (CPM-D2 edge) on my Tri-Hone years ago, and it seemed like I was cutting more stone than steel.

Free-hand offers more flexibility. It does have a higher learning curve than the guided systems. I have a set of DMT 6"" benchstones, and those have served me well.","1433116897"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt;so I think I overeacted to protected my scenario from being destroyed.

As someone that GMs for my kids mostly, but am running a PbP for mostly in experienced players on a different game, I've often found that my best ideas never come to fruition because the players have some other idea about what they want to see happen in your world.  When your eight-year-old daughter decides that instead of buying some weapons and armor for her Fighter, and instead spends all of her cut of the treasure on a pet pig, then the whole storyline e of how these characters are going to advance your story gets completely derailed and you wind up making another easy adventure for them to play because the Fighter in the party doesn't have the tools to fight with.  That adventure details the system even more, and you at some point realize that they're never going to find out why the Lich King wanted to kill your ten-year-old daughter's Mage in the first place, let alone defeat them and save all the other Mage kids, because they don't really give a fuck anymore, and you find yourself building adventures where the Fighter, the Mage, and the Scout travel the land looking for a boy pig to marry the useless girl pig, and also a pony for the Mage to ride because she's jealous that the Fighter has a worthless pig but can't afford a pony because they cost too much money that the party makes not looking for the Lich King.

Plus the pig can't fight, it just gets tugged along everywhere on a leash made of rope, and they don't want to enter the crypts because they'd have to tie the pig outside and the Fighter's worried some bandits might take the pig, and the rest of the party isn't going to enter the crypts without a Fighter.  

Now you're totally frustrated, and you're over it all, but if you start barking then everyone stops having fun.  So you can railroad them into a story they stopped caring about as soon as someone spent all their treasure on a pet pig, or you can accept that the big story is probably not going to happen like you hoped with a group of inexperienced players.

If having fun is the point, you have to be willing to accept that your story won't work out quite like you hoped.  If watching your players fi some role in a story you're scripting and directing, there's a chance your players won't want to have fun, and won't want to keep playing for you.

Our GM in an AFMBE game we play says we, even as adults, have never taken the story in the way he hoped it would go.  We sandbox it and go nuts and he's always struggling to make new maps on the fly because we lose sight of the main goal all the time.

In your case, I'm not sure if they lost the linear grasp on where things are supposed to go, but it sounds like they (or at least your GF) lost sight of didn't understand how you'd hoped the game would be played.  She was having fun playing with her own style, but you and maybe the others weren't.  This might be something that should have been hashed out before hand.","1433116898"

"ideasfortheadmins","t5_2qqhi","Your point about /r/all is valid. Maybe downvotes would count for consideration in /r/all but not within the local sub for anyone with a downvote-shadowban. And if that's not possible, then maybe this reason alone could kill this idea. Actually, the idea seems to be very unpopular so far and is thus probably dead anyway, but this is the only reason that I see so far for not doing it that I would consider a real concern.  
  
As far as trusting all mods to use it properly, or mods applying it to everyone in their sub, I really don't see a problem with that since the effect would be limited to their sub (with the exception of the aforementioned /r/all issue). It's up to mods to take action to shape the subs that they run, and if they want a sub where nobody can downvote then that's up to them to decide. If mods do that and users all hate the sub because of it, the users will create a new sub with different mods who don't do that. But I think that it's probably far more likely that there are a small number of people who misuse the downvote button on a regular basis, and the vast majority of mods would only downvote-shadowban those select users. Furthermore, I think their subs would all be much better off for it.","1433116898"

"adventuretime","t5_2s54g","""So you don't like that they portrayed puberty. I think it's refreshing to have a show where the mc actually grows realistically. But to each their own.""

That really comes off a pompous. My entire argument is all about character development and I do love seeing growth within the people in any show. Adventure Time doesn't necessarily have realistic character development due to the absurd scenarios it comes up with. Now it's my fault for not mentioning that I only disliked Finn by the end of ""Hot to the Touch"". He's perfectly fine in all the other episodes and I think the execution for Finn's ""journey for purpose"" in Season 5-6 was well done despite it stemming from this episode. I won't deny that I really disliked episodes like ""Too Old"" where he becomes unlikable to me as result. (Glad that he's become more mature now)
Seasons 1-3 did have Finn maturing as it went on, what are you talking about? The early episodes were definitely lighter in how they showed examples of growth but they're definitely there. Examples; ""Ocean of Fear"", ""What have you Done?"", ""The Duke"", ""His Hero"", ""Go With Me"", ""Mortal Recoil"", ""Too Young"", ""What Was Missing"", and ""Dad's Dungeon"". The recent episodes have been very different and meaningful in their developmental episodes that it's hard to even compare from the older ones.

""And it seems to me you just don't like Flame Princess either. Plenty of new characters are constantly introduced. You don't think there's such a thing as love at first sight?""

And this is the statement that kinda pissed me off. When did I even say that I hated Flame Princess? I don't like the first episodes that she stars in, but not the character. In fact, I love ""Vault of Bones"" and ""Earth and Water"" for the arcs they gave her. 

Then the more absurd implication you got from my reply was that I hated the introduction of new characters. I have absolutely no reply to that. If this is what I hated, I wouldn't be watching this show, since it has a HUGE focus or lack theroff on the main characters to show off the lifestyles of other people. Season 6 happens to be one of my favorites for this exact reason.

Love at first sight then getting a good relationship in one day is what I don't believe in. Finn may have started loving Bubblegum the moment he saw her, but she doesn't have the same feelings. (not until she turns 13 I guess.) I think love at first sight is the most immature way to ever show a character developing a relationship. Most of the time, the two only look at the physical traits of each other and end up disliking each other personality wise later. Pretty much every teenager believing this falls into a state of depression when their lover breaks up with them only a few months later. Oh. And Finn does the EXACT SAME THING.

So what you're doing in forcing oxidation in a semi controlled atmosphere. This is NOT passivation but to understand the distinction is fairly complex so take my word for it.

Rust like everything else is based on thermodyamics, that untreated low carbon steel has lots of available energy on the surface, you make those oxides form which takes away energy from the surface and thus makes it harder for rust to form. There are far superior corrosion protection methods which fairly simple to preform but none are this easy.

EDIT: This only applies to plain low carbon steel (sub 0.2 weight percent carbon) don't try and get all fancy on me . Be careful with medium and high carbon and alloyed materials. ","1433116899"

Yeah, I think part of the reason dub voice work is done differently than normal is because the VAs have to read scripts and do inflections that match the lip movements more than carry the real meaning and emotion of the line. Some notable exceptions are Watanabe dubs, as he is a fan of western culture and makes his shows with dubbing in mind, so they're pretty much aces across the board.

2. The person is asking for a can of soda because they just want the can. Your response is humiliating to them, and they must sit there for the rest of the flight having been dressed down by the flight attendant, surrounded by people who witnessed it. You also plant a seed of doubt into the people surrounding the passenger, wondering if they were, in fact, going to do something dangerous with the can.

""*I lied about the whole thing.  I was bitter, and I threw someone under the bus because I finally had the opportunity to.  I'm sorry.*"",

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Seen at KMQY today. Happened probably a couple weeks back or sometime. Word I received was a student was on their first solo flight to another airport as apart of their PPL training.

KMBT is a 50ft wide runway and KMQY has two runways, the usual from KMBT given to people is Runway 32, which is 100ft wide. This difference will usually cause unfamiliar (and sometimes familiar) students to flare too high or too low.

My understanding is they flaired too high with too much speed, ballooned, then neglected to add power or backpressure and barreled it nose down into the runway. Somehow it suffered a tailstrike during the whole process but I don't know how.

Student attempted to taxi back and take off again before realizing the damage.","1433116902"

DC's even got a whole advertising initiative about the diversity in their upcoming titles, but so far Doctor Fate doesn't have a spot in it.

In some cases it's incredibly good for you. Did you ever wonder why the French and Italians live for so long, even though they smoke and drink every day? Red wine has Resveratrol in, which is insanely good for you, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it said it could make you fly, the amount of positive aspects to it. Two glasses (200-350ml) per day and you'll live to 100. It even inhibits growth of cancer cells, so the wine simultaneously stops the lung cancer and many other ailments caused by smoking. Beer also contains a similar anti-oxidant but just not nearly as powerful. Spirits don't do much for you but some liqueurs are very healthy, they taste like shit, but they're healthy!

"ABCDesis","t5_2yfr0","I'm an IBCD (Indian Born Canadian Desi) if that makes sense. My family immigrated to Canada when I was 14. I'm also of Goan origin. A lot of what you say is true. 

**Jobs**
 There's a bit of a subtle difference though that I've noticed. IBCD's from places other than Punjab tend to be employed in white collar jobs , whereas IBCD's from Punjab tend to do be employed in blue collar jobs. CBCDs of Punjabi origin tend to be split between blue and white collar jobs. A lot of CD's also tend to run their own business.

**Community**
 The Indo-Canadian community here is very strong. Most of the people here are from Punjab and have a strong sense of cultural identity. This also has a lot to do with Canada being a mosiac whereas the US is a melting pot. In Canada, people of Indian origin celebrate their culture and are proud of it. 

**Young Adults**
 As for guys here, they tend to work out and care about fitness, grooming and the way they dress. This is more prominent among CBCD's than IBCD's. Another things i've noticed is that they also tend to have facial scruff, and this is true for me as well. They also tend to be confident and active. Since most of them are of N. Indian origin, they also tend to be taller. 

With women, they also tend to be care about fitness, grooming and they way they dress. I usually find them shy, and usually tend to hang out with other CBCD girls. They tend to be on the shy side.

As you mentioned, they mostly tend to hang out among themselves, but are not racially exclusive. 

As for me, most of my friends are racially diverse although a lot of them tend to be of Chinese origin. 

**Dating/Relationships** 
 I'm of Goan origin and we tend to date/marry 50%-60% outside our community. Within the Punjabi community, people tend to marry mostly within their community. With guys being more confident, fit, well dressed and taller,  Indian women tend to be attracted to them. If found that a lot of CDW(Canadian Desis Women) will only date Indian men, only Indian and White men or some with an aversion to their culture or wanting to define themselves outside of their culture will only date white men.

I've noticed a few posts on this forum where US Indian women are more likely to be in a relationship with a white guy than an Indian guy. I've also read some posts from other forums where white men say how easy Indian women are in the US. I don't really know any American Indian men, but from what Hollywood portrays Indian men in the US as, I have a general perception (as you mentioned) that they nerdy and weak. Regardless of if this is true or not, portrayal affects perception.

I remember she didn't want me to watch the sex scene in it but didn't mind me watching the general nudity. She also watched it first before watching it with me and determined that if it did anything, it would really make drugs unappealing to me. 

Of course I immediately sneaked the blockbuster tape away to watch the sex scene and it was a delight. 100% unscarred for life. Still one of my favorite movies.

"Shoplifting","t5_2qyxh","I'm an 18 year old Asian kid, moving on to college in a few months. I don't really remember what I stole the first, but recently when I was 15/16 I stole Chocolate bars from gas stations, grocery stores, any other place. I just really wanted chocolate, but I hated spending money. Most of the time my parents would buy it for me, but I always felt bad because it was their hard earned money spent on me. Money wasn't always an issue when I was a kid but back in 2008-2012 my parents lost a large amount of money in the stock market through land idk much about it, they never tell me. In my freshman year of high school I saw these two girls haul a bunch of candy from a Target, and thought cool. Free candy, they gave me some :)

I just joined here a few days ago when I wanted something but didn't want to buy it. My cousins BF shoplifted a huge Lego set from Barnes and noble and I thought it was pretty impressive how he pulled it off. So I went there to find a new hobby a few days ago and stole an item worth $20, everything went smoothly. But I saw that nobody gave a shit and it made it seem more easy to do it. I'm sorry I'm not directly addressing the questions. I'll try a bit better. 

I steal because I want some things, candy, food, toys, games. Things that I want but can't afford to have. Yeah I can do without it, and I can deal with paying it. But having the blow in finances just sucks for me. I consider myself pretty poor with both my parents making a lot of money in cash, but it is kept away really securely. I try not to harm their finances and try not to harm mine. I only steal once in a while so I don't give the store too much shrink. 

I come online to talk about it because I can be kept anonymous. I like the community here because we can openly talk about what we do frequently or occasionally without having a negative stigma around us. I talked about stealing with many many people and they always look down upon it.

Shoplifters don't always seem to be who they are. They can come from many backgrounds and demographics. Some more than others. For me, I want people to know that I steal from places in little quantity that it isn't going to hurt them. Maybe a $30 here and there or a $200 for a multibillion dollar chain. I try not to hurt their business too much.

For Lp, I like them. They are honest people just doing their jobs. If they catch me I would just run. But for the most part, they are doing their jobs to make a living. So it's understandable to me. They can lead me to fine and jail, which is bad for me, but I would just find an excuse to pay for it or just run.

If you want to talk some more I'd be open to talk.","1433116916"

No worries, anything I can do to help just ask away!

I've posted this before, so I'll just copy paste, if you got additional questions I'll do my best to answer.

1) Take a piece of cork board, break it into a suitable piece.

2) Glue cork to base, use super glue, be generous, cork soaks it up. After applying glue I like to put something heavy on the piece of cork so it gets pushed into the base. 

3) take some PVA glue, mix it 50/50 with water, slather it generously all over the cork.

4) Wait for cork to dry.

5) Check where the model will stand on the base, I like to draw with a sharpie so I know where it will be.

6) Take more PVA glue, put it where the cork isnt on the base, put some randomly on the cork too.

7) dip base in sand, wait 8+h to dry.

8) Pin model and mount to cork. (this is optional)

9) basecoat everything, I like to base in white, but use what you like.

10) Paint base (cork and sand) in grey, I use Cold Grey from Vallejo.

11) Paint everything with Dark Tone, I like the dark tone from Army Painter, make sure you get it everywhere.

12) Once dry (takes 30+ mins to be sure) dry brush with a lighter grey, I use Stonewall Grey from Vallejo.

13) Dry brush the edges with a pure white, I like Citadel paints Praxeti White.

14) Add flocks in different colors, I used Hobby Round: Green Static Grass, Hobby Round: Meadow Blend Flock and Hobby Round: Dark Green Static Grass all from Gale Force 9

Games are just a lot superior as way to have fun: you just sitting there comfortably, pressing random buttons, and it makes you feel good. Repeat, until you find yourself dying from hunger or lack of sleep. Perfect drug, isn't it? (Diablo III, btw)

"comiccon","t5_2qzn8","Current Uber driver (and SDCC attendee!) in San Diego. Just to give you an example, surges went up to x5.0 last weekend after the Rolling Stones concert last weekend. Attendance was around 50k. This morning for the Rock &amp; Roll Marathon, surges were also around x5.0. There's usually surges around 1.4 - 3.2 on normal Weekend nights downtown, so yep. Plan for an expensive ride... That being said, who knows if a lot more drivers will sign up between now and then or if drivers who normally don't drive downtown show up. Plan for the worst and be pleasantly surprised if you get a cheap ride!","1433116920"

Was this something that was flat out stated at the event?

They're from 1st and second gen, they haven't been seen since Unite. So they'll be returning with some tweaks, just like the Dunes in MH4G. 

&gt;The only other possible mechanic is a customization for the village.

We've seen one trailer, there are tons of possibilities for what they could add. 

&gt;I still see it more as a build up for another addition of the main series.

This goes back to the core of this debate, you and I seem to have different opinions of what counts as ""main series"". It sounds like you only count the first game of each generation as main series. I count all of the titles made by the core dev team with the same core gameplay. The games that they put out roughly once a year in Japan. This includes not just Tri and 4, but P3rd, 3G, and 4G as well. MH1, MHG, MHF1. If it plays like the rest of these games and is made by the main series dev team, it's main series in my eyes.

I explain the feasibility of terraforming the moon, mars, and venus, by saying many large probes are sent out at once to do their part in terraforming. It would take a long time but after a few decades and a hell of a lota funding the planets would be habitable. So basicly more sophisticated ion engines.

"HyperV","t5_2rraq","Yes. Performance when your NICs don't support VMQ and SR-IOV.

3 scenarios:

1) a single 10G nic with a single VMSwitch with a guest VM

2) a Team of 1 10G nic with a single VMSwitch with a guest VM

3) a Team of 1 10G NIC with 2 Net-LBFOTeamNICs with a single VMSwitch on one of them and host communication on the other

In scenario 1, the NIC runs in VMQ mode and if it supports SR-IOV, any VM on that switch can do 10Gbps and the network traffic will use SR-IOV to move packets from the NIC to the VM Memory space without using CPU cycles.

In Scenario 1 with out SR-IOV or VMQ, the NIC runs in vRSS mode. This allows the VMs to each access up to a theoretical 3.5Gbps, and a huge amount of CPU cycles FROM A SINGLE CPU CORE will be spent ""grab-the-packet-from-the -NIC-and-copy-it-to-the-guest-VM-memory-space""ing. 

In Scenario 1 with VMQ but without SR-IOV, all of the system's CPU cores will share in the workload of moving packets to and from the NIC. 

Scenario 2 is mostly the same as scenario 1.

In Scenario 3, traffic destined to the host (NetLBFOTeamNICs without a VMSwitch), will run in vRSS mode (faster), and traffic destined to a VM (NetLBFOTeamNICs with a VMSwitch) will share cpu access to moving the packets.

------------

TL;DR: You REALLY want to follow best practice design guides. A hypervisor should have a 10G NIC split out using Net-LBFOTeamNICs for host communication, and a separate 10G NIC dedicated to VM Traffic that supports VMQ and SR-IOV.

Ideally, you should have a team of 2x 10G NICs that has 4 Net-LBFOTeamNICs (management, heartbeat, live migration, backup, (optional: storage))

Then, you should have a separate team of 2x10G NICs dedicated to Guest VM access, with VMQ and SR-IOV enabled. ","1433116921"

"fixit","t5_2rf27","This shouldn't be too hard to fix.

What you can do is get some leather paint and repaint the swoosh. I've had good experiences with Angelus.

I can't tell if the picture is silver or white but here is a link to silver (they also make white for sure): 
http://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Acrylic-Leather-Paint-1oz-Silver/dp/B00HRJPVS8

If you decide to paint, here's what you need to do:

1. Wipe down the swoosh thoroughly with acetone. When the shoes come from the factory, there is a coating of sealer on there that, unless you remove it first, the paint won't adhere well. It may have already been removed by your washing but this will make sure it's gone evenly. If you go too far, it'll start removing paint and start hitting the letter, so don't be too vigorous.

2. Next you can start painting. The trick with painting is you have to use VERY thin coats. Use a good nylon craft brush and when I say thin, I mean reaaallllyyy thin. Like almost like the brush is dry. You're gonna be putting on like 6 or 7 coats so don't worry at all about getting full coverage on the first few coats--you're basically using the paint as a primer for itself. I can't stress enough how thin these layers need to be. If it's too thick, the paint will crack when you're walking around. Thin enough will allow it to flex.

That's pretty much it. My wife and I customized our shoes to match our wedding (Air Force 1's) so it was a good learning experience. Good luck!","1433116921"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","imo, there are ""player development coaches"" who should really be asst coaches, but are given head coaching jobs for some reason. They are Mark Jax, Scott Brooks, Monty, even Brian Shaw etc. You can even add Kevin Mchale to that list, he should be the lead asst coach, workign behind the scenes with players, and not be doing the playcalling. 

Then there is another group of coaches who are the ""take it to the next level"" coaches, who are really good with play calling and building chemistry and doing whatever it takes to take the team into the next level and push them to the upper echelon of teams. They are Steve Kerr, Bud, Phil etc. Phil Jackson is the most popular example of this group. He didnt play a huge role in player development, Doug Collins did that in Chicago before Phil got there, but Jordan won zero titles in Chicago before Phil got there. Shaq won zero titles before he was coached by Phil. What Phil did was focus on team chemistry, and made sure his players were disciplined within his system and achieved tremendous success. A lot of these guys are in college right now (personally I believe Shaka Smart would be in this category if he ever makes the jump to the NBA), but the NBA for some reason just keeps hiring and rehiring the same coaches as head coaches. 

These are two major groups of coaches, of course they are generalizations, and there might be coaches who are a mix of both, but for the most part i've seen coaches either fall into one category or the other. ","1433116922"

Now the real game changer you need to buy is a die grinder. Get one with a cut off disc attachment, carbide burrs, and the quick change discs. You will be able to take on (and destroy) anything. Zip through anything with the cutoff, grind out anything with the burr, and sand/prep surfaces in a flash with the quick change.

"rugbyunion","t5_2qkbe","I'm really stuck, rarely watch Slade play when he hasn't impressed me, surprisingly good defensively and him, JJ and Ford has the potential to be so so good. However as mentioned his inexperience at international level can make a difference, but I do feel he'd thrive on it!
Balancing the backs a bit with Barritt is where I struggle to decide, I really rate him. Obviously defensively he's class, but he can carry very well and working off Ford's distribution he really could do some damage or create space for JJ.
Farrell is the perfect bench 10 for us, come on to see out a game, defensively solid and superb kicking game so I wouldn't have him at 12 personally.
Really interested to see who Lancs goes for, he rarely makes the wrong call. In Lancs we trust.","1433116923"

"philadelphia","t5_2qh24","It's a great city! I am moving back after bouncing around the East Coast for the last five years. There are tons of nice neighborhoods with plenty of things going on. 

Fishtown/ NoLibs definitely feel like their own little neighborhoods. Center City will feel like a bit of a trip due to the whopping 20 minute transit ride. (Who needs to leave when everything is there... is a very common belief among people living in these parts of the city.)

I'm moving to Old City which I like because it has its own stuff, for sure. But it's also a 20-30 minute walk (as opposed to subway ride) to Center City. If you ride a bike, it's that much more convenient. This area also hosts a First Friday art gallery walk, so this brings a nice little thing to your doorstep each month.

People saying South St./ Graduate Hospital are not wrong. It's definitely up and coming. Probably a tad less expensive than Old City and Rittenhouse. Which, honestly, Rittenhouse is pretty expensive, and you are in walking distance of all the same stuff. It's really great for location AND price.

Have a blast. Philly has a ton of things to do. Young couples do live in the city, so you won't have to feel without. I don't know about Denver, but Philadelphia is a very economical East Coast city. (Having now lived in Boston, NYC, Newark, Hartford... I have a bit of an idea!)

Geek culture- check out N3rd Street! It's so much fun! They're located in Old City but will do meet-ups throughout the city. So much fun. Also, Old City has lots of galleries and stuff that may be good for your fashion designer wife. Anyway, sorry, rambling. 

If you are able, try to take a weekend trip to bounce around and get a weekend feel for the different locations. You can hit all of Philly in two days pretty easily. There's a ton to do, but it is not a difficult city to move around in (at least... the places lots of people like to go are easy to get to).

Hope this can help.","1433116924"

I ended up leaving to go work at a transitional living program for veterans. 

When I left that job, I pointed out to HR that a person with an MSW and a license was serious overkill for the position. From what I understand, they tweaked the requirements and actually found someone better suited. It was nice to hear they listened.

The transitional housing program. Ugh. That could be a damn novel. Sparing all the gory details: I was worked to the bone with little to no support, expected to flawlessly do the work of 3-4 people, and was constantly criticized at every turn because everyone assumed that I knew everything because of my MSW. I spent most of my time there being a stressed out trainwreck of nerves.

I had planned to quit that job but my agency beat me to the punch by letting me go for pretty vague reasons. I was upset for a while, but then I realized they did me a pretty huge favor. Luckily I found a much better position, where I'm at now :)","1433116934"

"AskMenOver30","t5_2y9pw","You can make refried beans in the crock pot.  It's a frequent trick of mine.

Depends on the size of your crock pot, I can't give you exact recipe because mine might not fit your pot.  Here is my smaller batch:

1 lb dried pinto beans (occasionally I'll mix it up and use a blend of pinto/black or other beans.  Try to keep size the same so they cook at same rate)

Either soak overnight 

-or- 

cover with 2"" hot water.  Bring to boil.  After full boil turn off heat and let sit covered 1.5 hours.

Rinse beans, discard the soaking water

1 medium onion, quartered or coarse chopped

1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and coarse chopped 

2-3 cloves of garlic

1 tsp salt

1 tsp or more cumin

Chili pepper &amp;/or chili powder based on how hot you like stuff

Throw everything in the crock pot &amp; add water until at least 1/2"" to 1"" of water covers everything.  Cook on high, duration will vary depending on your pot, if you did the quick soak or overnight soak, etc.  Check it on a regular basis (every hour?) to make sure water doesn't get too low, if water gets low the beans near the top will cook but not get soft.

Cooking time will be 2-4 hours.  When the beans are nice &amp; soft, everything else will be even softer from long cooking time &amp; plenty of water in the pot.

Take a potato masher and go to town.  Have with corn chips, rice, tortilla, whatever.","1433116935"

I've been using the Dolly Wink liquid eyeliner for a few years now and I really like it! The pen tip is easier for me to use, and it tapers to a small enough point that I can get it between my eyelashes pretty well and not annoy my waterline in the process. Unfortunately, it could also be something in the ingredients themselves that's irritating your eyes, so if changing up your technique or the consistency of the eyeliner doesn't work, next would be playing ingredient detective and seeing what the bad eyeliners share in common.","1433116942"

"WGU","t5_2se63","I think setting aside specific time each day to do studying/school work on a regular basis is what will allow you to have the most success. For times like you are talking about what worked well for me was to talk myself into just 15 or 30 minutes of studying. No matter how busy your life is, there is no way that you can't find 15 minutes to study. In addition, as long as you complete at least 15 minutes per day studying you will continue to make progress. You'll find that often when you start with the intention of only doing it for 15 minutes, you will end up spending a lot more than that most of the time.

Do your best to make progress every single day, and you will certainly be successful. What might be most important is to always remember why you are going to school in the first place. The sooner you finish school, the sooner you reach your main goal. Hopefully, you are enrolling in school in a subject that you find enjoyable, but of course you will also be taking classes not directly associated with that which you enjoy. Just always remember your goal and the reason you are in school in the first place and you should be able to keep yourself motivated.","1433116943"
"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Oh boy, you were me at that age, I didn't get my first kiss until 21 and have sex until 3 months ago at 22. I think this is more common than you realize.

Except you have a leg up over me in that  you have an active hobby that you're building a dream out of and that can actually help you a lot. See you're meeting people with common goals and values and interests. Your problem is that you're putting this girl on a pedestal.  I imagine you do this a lot. I know I used to do that and on the one instance it led to something I was so infatuated that I didn't see heartbreak coming and it nearly fucking killed me inside whereas if I just approached it seeing what would happen I probably would of noticed he was am emotionally unavailable doofus  with no life goals early on, shrugged my shoulders, and been like ""next!"" That's the thing with infatuations. They cause hurt followed by disappointment in the opposite sex. This girl is one of millions just like this. There's probably at least 6 other girls in your classes who you just haven't talked to yet because you're hyper focusing on one person and can't see the worth in others. She's just cool and happens to be super pretty so that makes her a special snowflake to you. Physical attraction does matter but you'd be surprised how physical attraction can simply vanish when you start seeing their flaws and how it can somehow materialize from ""I guess they're ok"" to ""they're the most beautiful person I know"" because of discovered real compatibility. 

Try just befriending people men and women with the sole intention of making friends, not finding an object of infatuation. You'll be surprised how much that helps. If you really want to get to know this girl better try talking to her more. But don't hedge your bets on her being the one.","1433116943"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt; He's saying that, for the way that the series had been going from the SNES, it wasn't a good Zelda title.

Because he's misunderstanding the reasons *he* enjoyed the game for some kind of core ""charm"" or ""real"" Zelda-ness.  Which, ironically, makes him exactly the kind of snobbish bullshit fanboy that he's complaining people who disagree with him would be.  He played the original Zelda and enjoyed X, therefore anything which reduces X makes it a ""bad Zelda title.

&gt;I don't think he says that one way of play is better than the other. He does say, however, take a look at what made certain games really, really good and how later games try, succeed, and often fail to imitate their successes.

Except that his entire ""what made certain games good"" is what core aesthetics appealed to *him*, and he counts as failure any game which catered to other asesthetics of the original game but which were less engaging to him personally.

He's the guy who plays pokemon solely for combat (ignoring that there were always other core aesthetics) and then complains about the introduction of non-combat-focused gameplay elements which fulfill other aesthetics.","1433116944"

But as for fluidity and general skating ability overall that takes time. Most of the people I play with have been playing for their entire lives and are quite a bit better at skating than I am, but the important thing is to not get discouraged. Get out there every chance you can and practice skating drills.

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","I'm not an expert on this but i've felt the same way op.
My thoughts on the topic are:
Food that breaks down slower keeps you fuller longer...therefore complex carbs are better than simple carbs.  Also I imagine low gi carbs might be better since they have less of an effect on insulin secretion = slower/less uptake of nutrients by cells (however this could be bad if it's post workout where YOU WANT cells to uptake nutrients).

I also think fats keep foods' flavor on the tongue longer so that helps as well.

Also, fiber is indigestible so it just stays as bulk food in your digestive system so that should keep you full longer.","1433116950"

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","Two separate issues though. There is the issue of tribalism in Iraqi Kurdistan which surpasses any traditional conservatism and paternalism you'd see in most non-European places to some degree and is closer to what you see in areas like East Africa (also probably why FGM still has a stranglehold on both areas), but this is about affirming rejection of a particular political quasi-religious doctrine (ISIL's doctrine) which even the most patriarchal Sunni Kurd in a small community is likely to reject. The Yezidis are party to the same tribalism, even more so in some ways as they try to preserve a blood memory and ancestral links through swearing off intermingling and thus they maintain their ethnic integrity. Yet making a statement that the brand of ""Islam"" recently descending upon them will have no place in the KRG is about protecting their own life and livelihood. As long as there are Kurdish Islamists who have joined ISIL's ranks, and there are (seems an uncomfortable subject for some to talk about...), nothing can be more expected than an identity crisis among particularly lax Kurdish Muslims.

You can only have 3 subs (and a flex), and you probably don't want a team on your bench, so you have to choose one role for which you stick with a single player, and the rest you can have two.  Take two adc's and mids for flex options, then choose who is best of your top/jg/supp starters and get the two best subs for the other two roles.  ex. Rush is a great jungler sub, but if you have reignover already you don't need him.  Kasing, Mithy, and Promisq are good options for supports that are possibly available right now if you need a second one.","1433116951"

http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/

The critical sections are in Section 2.A, which defines the relationship between the user and Steam:

&gt;Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use (except where commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable Subscription Terms). This license ends upon termination of (a) this Agreement or (b) a Subscription that includes the license. The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of the Content and Services, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.

And Section 9.C, which describes what happens if Valve goes out of business:

&gt;Valve may cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any time in the event that (a) Valve ceases providing such Subscriptions to similarly situated Subscribers generally.

So what all this says is a) you're not buying the games, you're sorta renting them, and b) if they go out of business, you don't get to play anymore.  

I suppose it's possible that they'll come up with some sort of parting arrangement to let you play the games, but the way the subscriber agreement is written, they are under no obligation to do so.  ","1433116952"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","This kind of culture isn't limited to Afghanistan. Actually, I'm from the UK, and there's a long history of this among the British upper class. Basically, it was considered ok in British middle-class culture to fuck young boys as a hobby for posh, wealthy men. This has been a part of British culture for centuries, but has come under fire since around the 1980s. My personal belief is this is because of the culture of sending boys to all-boys boarding school for most of their childhood up to age 18, where (a) they are abused by teachers, who are attracted to work in those schools, and (b) they abuse each other because they're horny and never see girls, and plus are encouraged by the teachers. It's similar to the Catholic church in some ways. Like you said, abuse breeds abuse.

Interestingly, you find a similar culture in Hollywood in the USA, where moguls in charge of talent recruitment have ""proteges"" (pretty young boys and sometimes girls) who get roles in films and so on for being nice little pleasers for various people in the industry. I've heard some of the most famous male actors were subject to this kind of thing when they were younger. It's pretty fucked.

I still think it's more limited than in places like Afghanistan, where the culture of abusing young boys (I don't even think they think of it as abuse; like you say, they think of them as ""girlfriends"") is pretty mainstream. I lived in the U.A.E. for 4 years as a teenager, and if you were a white boy you were under perpetual danger of attack from various kinds of men there (they see white skin as feminine).

But of course, we know nothing of this - the only people who suffer from oppression, rape and all else are women, in the Muslim world or anywhere else.","1433116953"

He has still got amazing skill and is a great MC but I think he is just currently being over-hyped because of his return, his new larger pop audience being brought into the grime scene, the recognition by large hip hop rap stars, and the hype from his supposedly soon to be released grime record. I know it sounds like I'm hating on old Skeppy, but I love him, but for what it's worth I think ultimately he'll drop some more poppy grime tunes, reap the money and fame and expand his fan base to teenage girls in the U.S. ","1433116953"

"Xcom","t5_2si6x","Well, that's just a mess and no doubt.

Since the cover DR isn't being applied, this would seem to imply that the `XGUnit.AbsorbDamage` conditional `if(IsInCover())` isn't triggering, thus preventing any DR. This further implies that the Cover status for the unit is being properly updated, but that for whatever reason the to-hit code isn't utilizing it.

Both overwatch and suppression reaction fire both trace to `XGUnit.TakeOverwatchShot`. From my reading of it, the actual to-hit calculations are buried in the native function `XGAbilityTree.SpawnAbility`, called with the line: 

    m_kCustomAbility = XGAbility_Targeted(XComGameReplicationInfo(class'Engine'.static.GetCurrentWorldInfo().GRI).m_kGameCore.m_kAbilities.SpawnAbility(7, self, arrTargets, GetInventory().GetActiveWeapon(),,, bReactionFire));

There are two classes at work in `TakeOverwatchShot`:

1) `XGAction_FireOverwatchExecuting` (which derives from `XGAction_FireImmediate` which derives from `XGAction_Fire`). **Action** classes appear to be primarily related to animation-handling. 

2) `XGAbility_Targeted` (which derives from `XGAbility`). **Ability** classes appear to be primarily related to handling the underlying logic associated soldiers executing abilities/actions.

`XGAbility_Targeted` is where the methods `CalcHitChance` (a native function which computes the actual hit chance), `CalcDamage` (a function which we've heavily modded for LW), as well as UI support functions all live. The master variable `m_iHitChance` is a member of `XGAbility_Targeted`, and is retrieved with the accessor `GetHitChance`, which is what we've recently been modding to allow adjustments of hit chances (the original calculations are buried in the native `CalcHitChance`).

Even worse, `CalcHitChance` isn't typically called from visible code -- it's a native function that is only ever called from *other* native functions. In Long War we've added one call to it in `GetHitChance` in order to force a recompute of certain to-hit values in certain cases (fixing bugs, implementing Deadeye, etc).

Now, the bad news is that the above `XGAbilityTree.SpawnAbility` call is a native function, and it appears that the to-hit chance is being computed within that function. `SpawnAbility` isn't invoked when taking non-reaction-based shots -- only for reaction (overwatch/suppression). Regular shots taken under player control use `XGUnitNativeBase.FindAbility`, another native function. This occurs in `XGAction_Targeting.state'Executing'.RealizeNewTarget` with the code:

    kAbility = XGAbility_Targeted(m_kUnit.FindAbility(m_kShot.iType, m_kTargetedEnemy));
	if(kAbility != none)
	{
		SetShot(kAbility, true);
	}
	
Both the regular firing mechanics and `TakeOverwatchShot` invoke `XGAction_Targeting.SetShot` (for overwatch it's handled in `XGAction_FireImmediate.SetShotImmediately`). However, looking through `SetShot`, I can't seem to find any calls to native functions where the native `GetHitChance` could be getting called from.

My best supposition at this point is that the `SpawnAbility` function, when called with the optional `bReactionFire == true` is ignoring the unit's current cover state and is instead dynamically looking for cover near the unit and using that. To get around this will require some trickery. The particular challenge here is that `TakeOverwatchShot` is called for both overwatch reaction fire (including Covering Fire against units in cover) *and* suppression reaction fire. However, there's no local information about which case is being handled.

However, currently there is no case of `TakeOverwatchShot` being invoked with the optional `bReactionFire` parameter false. If the `SpawnAbility` is causing the problem because of the passed `bReactionFire == true`, then making Suppression shots not count as ""reaction fire"" for this purpose may work fine -- especially because we are already giving unit Opportunist to negate the effects of reaction fire anyhow. This change would involve changing a single line in `XGUnit.TakeSuppresionOverwatchShot`, changing :

    if(!TakeOverwatchShot(kTarget, true))
    07 5A 00 81 1B 10 76 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 54 CC 00 00 27 4A 16 16 

to

    if(!TakeOverwatchShot(kTarget, false))
    07 5A 00 81 1B 10 76 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 54 CC 00 00 28 4A 16 16 

The above change should test whether or not it's the `bReactionFire` parameter in `SpawnAbility` that is causing the erroneous calculations regarding cover.","1433116956"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","Bitter is an element of their flavor; blanching bitter greens, then draining them well is the traditional way to remove some bitterness.  I really have not found that blanching makes much difference unless the bitter comes from oxalic acid, which is not found in [http://richardsfarms.vpweb.com/Tree-Collard-Information.html](tree collards).  Always, younger leaves have less bitterness.

I think your instinct to simply amp up competing flavors makes more sense.  Here in the American South, we use the sweetness of corn (like cornmeal dumplings or bacon fried cornbread crumbles), the hot/sour of chili vinegar and the fatty saltiness of cured pork as foils for the bitterness of collards and other bitter greens.

Less traditionally in these parts, I like them cut into ribbons and wilted with a little oil and water and finished with mustard oil.  The labeling on mustard oil here is a bit spooky, but we have eaten a lot of it, so do your research and make your own assessment.  Bonus points if you go on and make a favorite tarka for dal, but use it to dress the lightly cooked greens.  

For a soup, it might work to blend them with either black beans or adzuki for a sweet balance.  The broccoli cheese dodge would work, but what you are doing there is slipping a disliked item into a liked recipe in hopes of masking the disliked element.  I would go in the opposite direction and dress sauteed ribbons of the tree collards with a ""red eye"" gravy to let the coffee modulate the bitterness, or braising celery, then filling it with a collard puree with citrus peel, or working with a cocoa based spice mix for a timbale.  All of these would intensify the bitterness, but also make it the star and let folks explore the range of bitterness as a taste. ","1433116956"

As a street sam, suggest maxing out agility to 6 using attribute points.

Suggest using switching attributes with cash.  You can do so much more if you slice your body a bit more.

Warning: that sinner quality could bite you if other runners knows about that.

Put a suppressor on your guns.  Keep it quiet.

Ares Light Fire Silencer only works on one gun.  The Light Fire.

You don't need a platinum stick right now.  You can deal with a silver credstick.

**Suggestion:**

Reduce the biotect group to 1.  Save the 10 karma for something else.

You have 3 weapons groups.  2 of which are weapon types.  Suggest sticking to 1 weapon type.  That way, you could use the other points for some useful stuff (like better perception, etiquette, gymnastics, and running).

So, your leg is 6 to strength and 6 to agility.  For running purposes, you are fine.  However, you are most likely going to walk funny because one leg is about 1.5 times stronger than your body.  Just saying.

Instead of toughness quality, suggest buying aluminum plating or get used titanium.  Main reason, you can get +2 to soak and +2 armor (replace 2 with 3 if you buy used titaninum plating).


Personally, I like smartlink into the eyes and put contacts and glasses to make up for missing stuff.  A lot cheaper than putting it into cyber eyes.

Get some datachips, bug scanner, micro-tranceiver, jammer, white noise generator, disguise tool kit, endoscope, metal restraints, and some rating 6 stim patches.

Max out fixer c/l for use.

If you can, suggest buy mnemonic enhancers.  Helps out on knowledge skills.","1433116956"

As I understand it, 'lucid dreaming' is just when a person is aware that they are dreaming.

I guess it's possible there might be an observable difference in brain behavior?

edit: Forgot to mention, I do believe that lucid dreaming exists/occurs in some capacity; I've experienced being aware of my own dreams, other people have had similar experiences, and like I said it doesn't seem like a particularly radical claim.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","College years, I got off my second shift job (out at midnight) and had a final exam in physics the next morning at a university that was about a 2hr drive.   I asked my parents to crash on their couch to save me part of the drive in the morning.  My sister was still living at home at the time (in her early twenties then).  I set my old school plug in alarm for the next morning and crashed on the couch.  My sister got home late drinking that night and thought it would be funny to turn my alarm off.  I woke up about 30m before the exam started, and I was 60 minutes away...  Flying down the highway in on pure adrenalin, I got a stopped for driving 97mph in a 65 by an unmarked police officer I passed on the right!  (I'd like to shake that man's hand for not taking me to jail right then and there, he told me to ""slow the fuck down, idiot"" and let me go).   I made it to the exam room over half an hour late, and the professor let me take the exam but said I wouldn't get any extra time.  This was the last requirement I needed in order transfer to a university and get in a degree program.  Luckily I passed the exam.  If that police officer was in a bad mood that stopped me I would have had my drivers license suspended and I would have had to wait a year to retake the course (~$2000) before applying to a four year university.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","All the girls I've had the pleasure of kissing have been more than pleasant. All except one...

So I'm in college at a friend's house party. There's the usual drinking, games, dancing, etc. One girl takes a liking to me, and frankly I was like a baby calf when it came to women at the time. Just wobbling around trying to find my legs, still very much a virgin. She started initiating the conversation, dancing, flirting. I was just trying to hang in there.

Apparently it worked, because towards the end of the night, the crowd dwindled down, I decided I was just going to crash there and she wanted to stay too. Hooray! My roommates walked 45 minutes home just so I could have some privacy while I became a man on the living room couch.

One of them tossed a condom at me on his way out as we were getting into bed, that I didn't catch and immediately lost. Shit. Oh well, we can still have some fun! We began making out furiously, and while I was no expert, I did have some experience in the art of kissing. And I quickly found out that unfortunately my eyes had deceived me, as I hadn't been flirting with a girl that night. I had been flirting with a vacuum.

It's the only way I can describe her kissing style. She sucked on my lips like she was a leech trying to draw blood. At first it was kind of fun, but after a minute it was weird and annoying, and soon it was downright painful. When she wasn't inhaling my lips, she was using her tongue to check me for tonsillitis. That was almost welcomed compared to the anguish of her Hoover-like mouth. She also would kiss my neck and ear, and the same techniques were applied. Like she was siphoning poison out of a snake-bite wound.

I couldn't take it anymore, so I tried to move on to other things, which she wasn't interested in doing. Fair enough. I tried kissing her as gently as possible, hoping she might take the hint, but no luck. I was running my fingers through her hair when suddenly... the condom. It was tangled in her hair. How she didn't feel it I'll never know. I threw it under the bed and said I was tired, and went to sleep. I had been through enough that night.

The next day I had a speech for a class, so I got up early, said goodbye, and walked home. I enter the kitchen and a roommate is there.

""Hey buddddyyy, how'd it g-OOHHHH SHIT YOUR NECK""

I had the mother of all hickeys on my neck. It looked like Pangea, with little islands on all sides. And it *hurt*. I tried popping the collar on my shirt but nothing could contain the beast. I hated public speaking as it was, there was no way I was giving this speech with this girl's recreation of an early world map on my neck. 

I skipped the speech and all my classes for the rest of the week, wasn't allowed to make it (or another test) up, eventually failed two of my 4 classes, leading to me dropping out and coming home to try community college. I saw her once on campus. The PTSD kicked in and I began sweating. She smiled and started walking toward me but I just stumbled away and disappeared into the nearest building. The flashbacks were too violent.

So instead I'm just gonna post a few random songs that I think would give you a rough overview of the kinds of things I like:

[Swans - Telepathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfUuGNHRQPQ) (Groovy, atmospheric, has my favorite lyrics of any song I've ever heard, also it's Swans and I fucking love Swans)

[Kayo Dot - The Antique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X6FKD1EX_o) (Starts off slow then goes into holy fuck mode, I think it's a perfect example of post-rock/metal and dynamic, quiet-loud-quiet music in general)

[Drexciya - You Don't Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUJtlVKHAj0) (I dabble in electronic stuff, not enough for me to really consider myself an expert, but still, the interest is definitely there)

[Lil Ugly Mane - Radiation (Lung Pollution)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJrll5fwhqY) (Same thing with hip-hop, I like it but I'm not an expert in it)

[Ryoji Ikeda - data.matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5hhFMSAuf4) (I think I'll just let this stand as an example of all the weird, minimalistic experimental stuff I like, even though most of it is a lot less accessible than this)

[Deathspell Omega - Phosphene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN_i4p2T1GA) (And of course I really enjoy face-melting extreme metal)

[Prurient - Poinsettia Pills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpIO6wmzQVU) (...you've also gotta have some face-melting noise to go along with the face-melting death metal, too)

That should give you a rough outline of the stuff I like, although this only really scratches the surface.

It's actually kind of embarrassing to have music tastes like this sometimes, everyone seems to assume that I'm just a hipster pretending to like this stuff in order to look smart and open-minded, when I really just honestly love music in all of its different forms.","1433116961"

I assume bruising/scarring/inflammation occurs after numerous procedures as well, which has to suck..

I imagine the prisoners aren't exactly being calm and kind either when this ""medical procedure"" is repeatedly being done to them by their sworn enemies, which probably pisses off the military guys even more and makes them less likely to be gentle..

Also, if the hunger strike ends due to the pain of the procedures, so too does a bunch of media scrutiny, which is probably seen as a win by those in charge.","1433116961"
"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","That place made for so many interesting stories. In highschool, my student home (12 boys) had what we called 'prank wars'. Basically the junior hallway verses the freshmen hallway. Plastic wrap over toilets, muscle rub on the toilet seats, late night mattress flipping, and 'pledge bombs' - modified aerosol cans that self sprayed until empty (left the room covered in cleaning residue) were my favorites. 

Best part of the school is that you're superclose to many of your classmates after graduation. We all had similar backgrounds and experiences at one of the worlds most unique schools. Some of us graduate to be successful and some of us fall back into the same loop of poverty and misdirection. It's really hard to break that cycle even with schools like Milton Hershey. 

Worst part is that it was really structured and rule orientated, but for good reason. It's hard on a kid to adjust from a home with no structure, no supervision, and no rules to a new home with all of that. Many kids cannot understand/appreciate why such rules and restrictions are in place and end up doing their best to get out of the school. ","1433116961"

The only thing stopping this feeling of his sanity slipping away is lack of consciousness and he found that by suicide. Now look back at the drawing and try to see that.

Anarchism isn't about a lack of governance, but about a lack of political and economic hierarchy.

The aim is to essentially establish personal freedoms to the highest degree for all individuals, allowing for a society based on free organization.

Plus, Mayor can be played in a number of fun ways. Something I've done recently is claim mayor without revealing, trying to get protection from a doctor who could still heal me, and basically acting like a leader of the town by asking questions and voting.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt;So you think Dogecoin or whatever low-fee alt-coin is superior to Bitcoin?

Dogecoin's low fees comes from a combination of lower security and perhaps (I don't recall their block reward scheme) more inflation. So I don't think Dogecoin offers any advantages over Bitcoin. If the Dogecoin developers somehow figured out a way to achieve lower fees given the same level of security, same level of centralization risk, and without higher inflation (or any other compromises that I'm not listing), then I'd hope the Bitcoin developers would adopt whatever breakthrough the Dogecoin devs discovered.

&gt;I'd rather not rely on intuition when messing with Bitcoin.

Yeah, not trying to convince anyone by stating my intuition. Just using it as a hypothetical for my main point about under what conditions a ccy could overtake Bitcoin.

&gt;Agreed. Though replacing won't be instant, and as soon as we start seeing this switch, it's easy to adjust, easy to know the risks, and easy to make that call. Rather than relying on intuition.

OK, this was my main point, so it sounds like we're in agreement now that a low fee ccy could take over. 

I don't want to have a standard ""should we increase the blocksize"" debate here. I think ""no, let's wait"" is a reasonable position. It seems like a lot of the people on team Gavin believe that it's important to act far ahead of time (Gavin keeps saying this). Apparently the other devs disagree with this and think they could act pretty fast if anything went wrong (See Greg Maxwell's post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/37vg8y/is_the_blockstream_company_the_reason_why_4_core/crqnxh8). If that is true, then I'm much more amenable to waiting, and I think ""let's wait"" advocates should hammer on that point more.","1433116967"

The whole pocket of air might be moving 100MPH but the thin air density should allow it to cut thru the bird and the bird should move back?

Opening up blood vessels should in theory reduce muscle spasms and knots. It should also allow increased waste flow which, if you were to scientifically prove this, you would look for increases in urinary waste. 

It would have to be done on a large number of people who would have to be their own controls. A statistically relevant increase would have to be observed and the samples would have to be controlled for dehydration possibly by ignoring the water and counting the waste-per-timeframe.","1433116971"

It's just interesting, whether coincidental or not,  that the Andrews Sisters performed the song -- a song involving apple trees (family visits to Andrew's presumed family's apple farm, Ali's quote to Spencer,""Your family has the worst apples!""), family (mother, father),  geographical distance and communication (Ali on the run and her and A's communicative style), a lover's lane (like the kissing rock and the tree stump carved with Ali and someone else's initials), a soldier (gas masks, Charles' bomb shelter), ""guy next door"" (love thy neighbor posters),  loyalty (various angles of loyalty present on the show, i.e the entire Hastings family protecting one another, the DiLaurentis family protecting one another, Ali making/ensuring her friends stay loyal to her, etc etc)

The song was performed by the Andrews Sisters consisting of 3 women. Andrew + 3 women/sisters. Hm. It is also interesting that the show has had an event (the night Ali went missing) and clues in Charles' bomb shelter lair consisting of color coded groups of 3 (the red, green, blue children's handprints hanging and the 3 red, green, blue skeletons print hanging). 3 Ali lookalikes were involved the night Ali went missing: Ali,  Bethany,  CeCe.

I actually kind of like Shephard as a name, probably because I love flower and nature names and it reminds me of that.

Kaiser seems weird to me as it means emperor.

I love te sentiment behind Traveler, but I dont think I'd use it as a name. How about Nocona (means traveler)?
Haha I just scrolled a bit further and saw Nokola there. I think either Nikola or Nocona is better than Nokola, he might be teased about cola, or no-cola...

Love Lysander, and would never have imagined to see Ragnar anywhere else than my naming book and in Scandinavian countries!
So I obviously love it, but maybe it is not practical in an English speaking country because of the word rag? I dont have that problem because English is not my native language, here it would just be a weird/cool/different name.

I love Theodoric! And due to it having more syllables than Emric I am not bothered by the fact they have the sme ending.

I only know Nicholai spelled Nicolai or Nikolai.

If you like Pharis, how about the Arabic Feras? Maybe even Philemon?

Cynan makes me think of Cyanide and Adonis of the Adonis complex, might be a bit much to saddle a kid with.

If you like Osmand, how about Oswin, Oswald?

I like Malachi a lot. Malik has a good meaning (king) and it is Arabic name s I like this one a lot, way better than Kaiser.

Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, ""I have found the Scroll of the Law in the temple of the LORD."" He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 2 Kings 22:8

Is that really true? Once the hummingbird hovers, that should be no surface that can transfer and ""exert"" the force onto the hummingbird anymore to continue to move it 100 MPH - shouldn't there be some decay? If the bird was fixed on the seat, I would agree it is already moving 100MPH forward but once it hovers, I am not too sure.

The whole pocket of air might be moving 100MPH but the thin air density should allow it to cut thru the bird and the bird should move back?

What would say then to a situation where the car is stationary and the hummingbird was ALREADY hovering and then the car accelerated? If you say the bird will then move back, then shouldn't that indicate that the bird has to be fixed on the car for the force to be transferred to the bird in the situation where the bird was fixed in the moving car and then hovered?","1433116977"

Definitively not, Crit Draw is the one mandatory skill you should have on every GS set.

I say, drop the Kushala Daora GS as well as Elemental Crit and go for a GS with more Raw. Here's a couple of examples:

* Cera Cymmetry
* Ukanlos Skycleaver (Caps at white sharpness)
* Demonlord Rod
* Ostracon Oblivion

The current best GS in terms of Raw is the Black Fatalis Blade, which is currently unavailable, sadly. 

The Great Sword set I run is this:

     Helios Helm X
     Kaiser Mail X
     Kaiser Vambraces X
     Torso Up
     Grand Yamato Gusoku

With a Draw Jewel 2 in the chest. This also needs 1 slot in your weapon, but I'm pretty sure you could do it without. After you gem in everything else, you get Sharpness +1, Sheath Control, Crit Draw and Focus. What's good about this set is that you can gem in any other skill if you have the right talisman. I managed to put Attack Up (M) on top of everything. I use Cera Cymmetry, in case you're wondering.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the Seregios GS (Rogue Sedition) is also very good, since it doesn't need Sharpness +1 and auto-sharpens itself, which allows you to get really creative with your set.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Being outclassed makes a champ bad. Or bad in the eyes of players who discuss competitive and high elo metagame.

Diana is ""bad"" right now. Why play Diana over Fizz Kass?

My point is that ""bad"" in league is comparative. As youve noticed Elise is perfectly fine and very playable as much of the metagame for champ picks isnt super important for soloq. But in high elo competitive when a champ is outclassed they are not ever picked. Elise got overnerfed to where she no longer has a niche for what she does well.

Same with Diana. Diana is more than playable but has a big problem with lane presence and ganks pre6 which Fizz does not have and unlike Kassadin is more restricted mobility wise. Both Diana and Akali are great at deleting squishies but are bad in competitive because they do not have a big enough niche.

Youll find right now almost every champion is good in their own way save for a select few despite being considered bad champions. There are very few bad champions if any. There are many out of the meta picks that are very playable or even strong picks in soloq that are considered bad because said champ isnt played in comp or 5s.

There needs to be a disclaimer on a lot of posts when talking about champ strength as the metagame doesnt directly matter to like 95% of the playerbase and the strong champs are the comfort picks.

"amateur_boxing","t5_2ss7o","Hey, one of the guys on this sub posted a link to Jack Dempsey's book on fighting. Here's the thread;

http://www.reddit.com/r/amateur_boxing/comments/37m6wf/championship_fighting_explosive_punching_and/

In it there are really good descriptions of the nuts and bolts of a lot of the punches, and also ways of learning them from the start. He teaches the hook by teaching the body turn associated with it, without using the arms for the first stage. Progresses onto throwing elbows to learn the movement, up until throwing the full punch. Also describes the 'shovel hook' which might be useful to you.

No one should base their partners' experience, commitment preferences, loyalty or any other characteristic on the number of people they've had sex with.

Lots of partners means you like sex, first and foremost. This is good, sex is fun and healthy. 

It doesn't impress most women, however. There are exceptions to the rule, but most women I know don't want to *know*. 

Yes, knowing what you're doing in bed is good, but like I said, the number of partners means nothing. I've had partners be horrible in bed that had been with over two dozen women (can't confirm).

Let your actions, your behavior and your willingness to listen, learn and satisfy your present partner show what kind of man you are.

I hope you can begin to see him as he is now, more alive than he has ever been, and longing to be with you.

For example, with my L/L Ra team (Ra/Dmeta/Toki/Echidna/GZL/Ra) matching a bare minimum 6 combo (3 orbs of each color+heart which is already 18 orbs on the board) will get the 49x multiplier, but the total damage the team will do is around 1.3~1.4 mil damage.

So thankfully I do not have to deal with the craziness (at least directly) like a lot of you.

It's odd though, because I don't care much for my birthday. Never have. Just another day to me, and I always say something to the effect of ""we should be celebrating my mom, she did all the work!"" quite genuinely (although I do quite love my Mom so there's that... I may have also kept her in labor for 30 minutes after my twin was born, then decided to go sideways, and force a c-section....)

Not intending to shame anyone or be holier than thou at all, just, saw this and kinda had an ""OH, wow, never thought of it from that perspective...."" moment...

That being said it's totally a cultural thing and it's something quite prevalent in many cultures, and I recognize that I am not the norm. 

So just a different perspective I guess! I got one today too.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Monitor speakers tend to be very neutral, in that they will be designed not to color the sound too much.

Will you damage your existing speakers?  No, not bloody likely.  You may, however, not really enjoy listening to them much.  So no, you don't *need* monitors, but you might want them.

For home solo recording an interface like the 2i2 or its competitors is generally all you need, as they tend to come with DAW software.

Now, back to monitor speakers:  Mine are plugged directly into my Presonus interface box (akin to the 2i2) and I can use the dials on the box to change the mix between hearing what's being recorded and what is being played back.

Big bang black hole is in the same category as [single electron](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe) or [last Thursday](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism). The only difference is big bang black hole is widely accepted and is deemed as true only through faith; we really don't have anyway to say it's true. All 3 of these can not be disproven and all 3 can not be proven. So even though you think you're a skeptical person you don't seem to see your faith in a theory as fact is the same as a religious person as God being real. The only difference is what you have faith in. A skeptical person should always assume something could be true but it's the probability that makes it true or untrue, I get this from [James Randi](https://youtu.be/qWJTUAezxAI) the world renowned skeptic and atheist.

They reverted the morally ambiguous Cerberus back to wall-chewing crazy bad guys. Shepard's haunting dreams, the Rachni, Udina; none of it is influenced by the choices in previous games. A lot of things that are boil down to a number on a report card. The Geth ""good"" ending has them remove the thing that made them unique and interesting in the first place. Not to mention, solving the problems with the Geth also solves the Reapers objectives. Nothing more on Elcor, Hanar, Volus or any of the other races, but instead more magic blue space elves stuff. Didn't even get to see Palaven. A laughably deadpan space ninja, who just shows up out of nowhere, looking cool with a sword. I'll leave it there, I think.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","Lanes aren't really fixed in DotA.

Generally the ""safe"" lane isn't really safe in average pubs, since people often don't bother with wards and rotations or trilanes. The only real benefit to going down (or up) there as a carry is the access to the nearby jungle. So if you have a carry that does well at laning (like Gyrocopter) or the enemy doesn't have strong laners it's not that unsual to leave your position 1 in the offlane. And offlane/pos-3 Void is still a thing (EG ran it not too long ago), since Chronosphere is still a big utility spell and Void can catch up fairly quickly if the rest of the team creates space later on.

A lot also depends on the enemy draft - if they have something like a Broodmother the safer lane will probably still be the offlane since Broodmother won't let you get much in your safelane.

As for mid pay attention during drafting, if there's no hero that can play mid well then pick one yourself. There are plenty of carries/semi-caries that can go mid (SF, Drow, ..), some supports (Skywrath .. Rubick? Oracle?) and many heroes that can be played either way (Lina, Veno, Zeus, ..).

Reddit hates Skylar because the way the show is written sets her up as an antagonist very early on and, despite Walter's obvious character change in later seasons, she has been hated for so long that people don't care (plus: man jaws). 

Reddit hated Sansa because, up until recently, she was a very weak-willed character that basically let things happen to herself without ever retaliating. 


I do believe reddit as a whole is incredibly sexist, but there are reasons for the flak these characters get. ","1433117003"

A floorperson walked behind a table that had an ongoing hand, saw a card lying on the floor, and PICKED IT UP OFF OF THE FLOOR, reached under the arm of the dealer who was busy splitting a pot AND SHOVED IT INTO THE MUCK on the table. The dealer never noticed it and none of the players said anything. That deck now had 53 cards and made it through 7 downs before a flop came out that had two nine of hearts on the board. They went through the tape, saw what had happened, and every dealer who had been at the table since then, including the floor, got written up.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Hello. I went from Bronze 4 in season 3 to Platinum 4 in season 5. Was your average player who played a lot with their IRL friends.

1. I would play Riven mid in late season 3. It got nerfed and i started to play Riven top/Kha'zix top in mid season 4 to gold. I went 31/1 and went instantly from bronze 1 to gold 5 in a weekend.Season 5 now i used riven top/reksai jungle/kayle top to get to platinum from gold 5. Just main 1-2 champions in 1 role and play whatever is good in the other lanes if you are stuck there

2. You don't have to carry to win a game. Every role has equal chance of carrying. There is no such thing as ""Easiest to carry from role"". The roles carry in different ways. The easiest way to carry is by having a lot of map pressure. Mid,Jungle and Support have the most map pressure. ADC and Top are usually there for pushing the side lanes. That being said, if you like playing split pushing top and know how to apply pressure properly, then that could be there too.

3. Trolls and Feeders happen in every division. Can't do much about them except for ignoring them. I usually /mute all when it start to tilt as anything that can be said might tilt me more even if it was a joke or whatever. Just try not to feed them and use the DST strat from sky to deal with them. Gotta remember that most people are there to win, so don't make them aggravated by responding to them. If someone is trolling in champion select. Dodge. Its worth 3 lp over the 20+ you could lose. If someone else dodges, get out of que and wait 2-3 minutes before going back in.

4. Mute people if they say something stupid. Chances are you going to tilt from that. Try not to talk accept communicating timers. Spam ping so people listen. Most importantly is try to go into the game not with the mindset of winning, but learning. You want to learn to get better and not win over and over again. You also want to avoid playing with friends and talking to them if they are lower elo. Just eases pressure. 

Hope i helped

My first coop terms was during the recession and there were less jobs available. I ended up in something unrelated to my degree but even those jobs help build soft skills and give experience that make your resume look better for the next time.

My second term was in my field and I was really happy with the work though it wasn't what I thought I wanted to do.

I then got a chance to do exactly what I thought I wanted to do in the future only to learn it wasn't for me. I am super glad I figured that out BEFORE graduating and getting stuck in a career.

My fourth term I went back to that second employer. They took me on again and then hired me full time once my classes were finished.


Some benefits: making enough money to cover next semester's tuition (usually), getting offered part time positions during study sessions (so more money), getting experience, getting stuff to put on a resume, networking, etc.


Hope this helps!","1433117008"

The Chevy cobalt is also a pontiac G5, the impala is almost a G6, etc etc. if the cars weren't just trim variants, they used the same platforms. 

Lots of companies use badge engineering. Kia actually started as a badge engineered ford company. When ford owned a large stake in Mazda they shared lots of platforms like the ranger and B2/3000 trucks. The FRS and BRZ is a badge engineer venture between Toyota and Subaru. It's used to make platforms more profitable most of the time. ","1433117012"

They were living the seen with their breath. They would do it again and again. They would mention Allah in almost call their conversation.

"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","I think it's only good in pubs versus lineups that have heroes with lots of core items that can't find room for diffusal. A lot of agility heroes already can buy diffusal but possibly refuse to because of reasons they've invented in their head, like PA, Viper, Morphling. They have other items that help also, like Mek viper, BKB PA, and ehtereal blade morph. But if you own a Warlock's early game with good golem kills, you'll have won a huge part of the game if they're devoting farm to a core warlock. 

You can buy it on supports to act as a Lotus orb, Abbadon sort of effect. Or you can buy it on heroes with any attack speed that don't have a desolator. 

I don't think he's going to be a huge meta pick right now as long as Phantom Lancer who even weak competitive drafters have glaring in their head as diffusal carriers. 

If he's strong right now to you, people who you're playing against just aren't used to playing against it probably or countering it effectively. The same could be argued for any unpopular hero, especially in pubs, where if your average pubber hasn't seen an elder titan in a while, they won't remember to build armor and magic resist.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","You have oneitis, the same oneitis that has screwed over many men throughout history. You are not special, remember that.

That being said, oneitis exists for a reason: for you to mate with a woman, reproduce, and stay long enough to raise children. Relationships usually start going bad after 2-7 years. 

I disagree with red pill in that its bad to avoid commitment. You have to go into commitment knowing that its likely going to end in separation. But that doesnt mean it wasnt worth it while it lasted. You die at the end of life too, but that doesnt mean life wasnt worth living.

My advice is to go ahead and follow your instincts. You're in love with this woman, thats nature telling you to reproduce with her. Chances are you will eventually lose her, just like chances are you will die at the end of your life. If you know this going in, you will cherish your good times together ever more, and when things go sour, you will be emotionally prepared because you knew it was inevitable. Good luck","1433117014"

"OneY","t5_2s5ni","I think I get what is meant by 'mansplaining'.  There are guys out there who will presume knowledge of all sides of the gender discussion / gender issues / any / all issues, and will proceed to (for example) explain to women at great length why or how they should make certain choices with respect to reproduction, attire, personal conduct, appropriate behavior, and so forth.

It's a sort of paternal condescension that belongs in the age of the dinosaurs (and that's just a figure of speech; it didn't belong there, either).

The problem, as I see it, is that too often it's used as a blanket attempt to invalidate anything that anyone with male reproductive organs is saying.  It's frustrating, although it's worthwhile to know how it feels because it's precisely what men have done to women for a long time.  

That doesn't mean it's justified in the least, of course.

In short, if I'm explaining something because I've assumed your ovaries have interfered with your cognition, that's mansplaining.

If I'm explaining something because you legitimately don't know what's going on and I can tell that (in the same way anyone can tell that someone needs something explained independent of gender), that shouldn't be mainsplaining.

And no, I'm not claiming the authority to be able to objectively determine when which thing is happening.","1433117014"

"witcher","t5_2sebi","I'm on the credits now, don't know what I'll do with myself now. Honestly one of my favourite games ever, I had myself hyped up beforehand and it just blew the absolute shite out of my expectations. I was so happy with my ending, don't know how much they vary though. The main characters were so good. Only thing I found weird was after doing all of Triss' side quests you can't really talk to her again since I romanced Yenn. Would've liked another conversation between the two before the end of the game. I loved how attached I got to Ciri aswell.

I really hope they eventually try something more with the Witcher universe, because it's huge and there's so much lore to use. I'd hate not to see those characters again, even if we weren't playing as Geralt.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","&gt; how do I tell if they're useful or will screw me over long term?

Generally, useful investments try to track the market. Stay away from investing in single companies (no matter how rich that one friend got off AAPL) and stay away from high (&gt;1%) management expense ratios (MERs). This is how much the institution skims off the top of your balance, regardless of your portfolio's performance.

PC Financial's mutual funds are not terrible (~1.2% MER) and may be good to start out, but you will want to (within a year or two) figure out how to build your own low-cost (&lt;0.5%) portfolio. It [matters in the long term](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/092613/pay-attention-your-funds-expense-ratio.asp).

&gt; Is it a scam to go to a professional for help? If not then how would I find such a professional?

Not a scam, but many professionals are primarily salespeople. If they are pressing you to buy a specific fund, they may have their own financial interests in mind. The first financial planner I spoke to set me up with a savings plan that worked for me, but he was getting a commission on everything I saved (1% on every deposit, and the funds had a 2.7% MER). Consider finding a [fee-only CFP](http://www.moneysense.ca/directory-of-fee-only-planners/) to evaluate your situation. You will pay them once.

&gt; Are there websites for investing? If so, how can I tell which ones are reputable?

I use [Questrade](http://www.questrade.com/). Some use TD Waterhouse. I think those are the main big ones in Canada.

&gt; How will I report investment gains or losses on my taxes?

~~You will be issued tax slips around April, usually a T3 and a statement of RRSP contributions. This goes box-by-box into your tax software and is pretty straightforward.~~ (not as simple as that!)","1433117019"

"virtualreality","t5_2qp9o","Firstly, cheers on this! Not many people talk about sex openly so it's refreshing to see it in VR subreddit! WOHOO!

Second, VR porn is pretty much masturbation (much in the same way cybersex or solo-ing fleshlights are actually masturbation), but sex is still the foundation evoking our orgasm. And masturbation can serve to teach us about sexuality and the human mind in general, so I suppose it's dual purpose. And people don't feel ashamed to admit you jerk off, we all do this! I can't tell you how many vids on VR sex I've seen of people fronting like they have a sex slave/they happen to have relationship(s) were sex is abundant. It maybe the case for some, but that's not how it works for the majority of the population who have limited sex partners.

As a dude, I'm pulling for the women to really rally behind the tech as a way to interface with the male dominated world we live in today. Perhaps, in some way this will lead to empathy which will lead to increased knowledge+wisdom of gender roles, which will lead to better relationships, which will lead to better sex. It's not a slippery slope, in fact it's what I (and various researchers) have found builds the best foundation for partner interactions. 

Thus ends my two cents. 

edit: I didn't account for VR porn were a partner is in the room. It can be more grounded of a grounded experience/stimuli that way! (If people are interested in VR related sexual experiences at all)","1433117028"

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Alright, I'm going to address this the same way I always have whenever it comes up, just a bit more aggressive this time. 

**YOU GUYS CAN INFLUENCE THE CONTENT ON THE SUBREDDIT USING UPVOTES AND DOWNVOTES**. Shocker, right?! If you don't feel like relationship posts fit the subreddit, then **downvote them**. Seriously. On the same note, **upvote stuff you want to see more of. You can't complain that text posts don't get enough love when they _don't have any votes at all_ because you don't vote on them**. That's like adults that complain about who was elected for president/PM but they didn't vote when they had the power and means to. Come on, people! Use what you've got!

If you *use downvotes and upvotes to set a sort of silent guideline as to what everyone wants to see and what is going to be accepted, then people will start following that* because they don't want the flack/negative karma that may come with unwanted stuff. 

Two other points: This was made four hours ago as it currently stands. **MOD MAIL US AND WE'LL SEE IT WAY SOONER.** The button is to the right. And no, don't personally PM one of us. We like to keep all our mod related stuff where every one of us can see it. We're also not going to start banning everything a handful of people have a problem with, because then the sub becomes too controlled, and it will turn into ""DAE THINK LE MODS R LITERALLY HITLER?!?!?!!1!"" And yes, stuff like that does happen. Especially in a subreddit with teenagers. Y'all are a salty bunch. 

TL;DR: **Use your damn voting powers before complaining about content you don't like**. Think something is overdone? Downvote. Something needs love? Upvote, for the love of god, _upvote it_.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Hey, a Redtick Coonhound! I have one of those, and she is the world's most amazing, friendly, and adorable dog. I can confirm that they *love* people and get hysterically excited when they get to see or meet people. If they don't, it's probably because they're either older and have calmed down, or for a sad reason (e.g. abused/neglected hunting dogs). But we've only had our puppy for two months, and she's only an estimated 4.5 months old, yet we've already had great success in teaching her to calm down when greeting people. She's still obviously excited and happy, but it's ""showing interest and wagging her tail, and rolling over for tummy rubs"" kind of happy, not ""trying to leap on someone's face"" kind of excitement.

The great news about coonhounds is that they are extremely intelligent and love to please, so training them is fun and not difficult. Our puppy learned some things just by watching our other dog (e.g. to go poo outside only), and learned other things, such as sit, stay, come, etc. within just a few repetitions of the commands/hand signals. With the sole exception of a fear issue that is completely specific to her bad experiences as a stray, training her has been an absolute breeze compared to any other dog I've had to train.

If you are prepared for the amount of exercise that coonhounds need, and either have a tall fence or some other solution for having your hound spend time outside without running off after a squirrel never to be heard from again, then I'd say go for it! I would definitely not let the ""greeting excitement"" thing be a dealbreaker, since I think that will be easily solved by training.","1433117030"

"news","t5_2qh3l","I wouldn't be surprised if illegally-obtained firearms were used in a large portion or the majority of firearm-related crimes, but it all ties back to the relative ease in acquiring a firearm in the United States. There is no disputing the evidence that more gun control leads to lower homicide and violent crime rates. People use firearms because they're incredibly effective at what they are designed to do and they're not difficult to obtain. Right now, our gun laws are more or less archaic compared to the rest of the developed world. It's, quite honestly, depressing that we Americans cannot discuss the issue without reactionaries derailing any discussion that tries to happen. When you put firearms on an untouchable pedestal, you cannot complain when people start using them for shitty reasons. The solution is very simple: more progressive gun legislation, but because of our obsession with guns, we'll never see it. That's just the unfortunate reality that we live in.","1433117030"

That's fine I don't care, but the cool thing to do if you're the *enemy* is to finish the game quickly so that the poor jerks on the other team can get on with their night.

To me wasting an extra half hour of someone's time when they're stuck with griefers so you can clown around feeling like a big dog player because some idiots fed you on purpose? Fuck off!

They could play an extra game in that time but you're locking them into this one because you won't finish and you want to pretend you're an actual good player for once?

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I completely understand and respect your point of view too..  I honestly don't eat out weekly or even monthly, so it's quite rare for me. But I think at least for me there has to be some balance between dieting and occasionally doing social things with close friends and family that yes, do sometimes involve food or eating out. Like I said, if it was a random work event I would have just declined to attend.. but this was my only brother's birthday, and if I had objected to the restaurant that he chose I would have been accused of being selfish/making it all about myself and basically caused a ton of family drama, or if I had flat out declined to attend I would have gotten a ton of guilt and talking smack behind my back and again, being told that I'm being selfish/not making an effort with the family, blah blah blah. Maybe it's an age thing to some extent too? I'm 26, I'm at an age where my family still has some control over me.. although I've lived pretty independently since I was 18 they did kindly pay for a quarter of my tuition and if I don't do exactly what they want in terms of attending family events I immediately get ""you're such an ungrateful child, we paid for you to go to college!, how can you treat your blood this way?""

I agree that eating as a means of socializing or as the only means of socializing isn't healthy on a frequent basis or when consuming thousands of calories in one sitting.. but the whole point of my post was that occasionally (and by occasionally.. I'm literally not recommending this more than once or twice a year), you might feel that you have to attend a social setting that involves an expectation of heavy eating (such as a buffet). Maybe that isn't true for some people, but in my family at least it's true, there are occasionally situations I can't easily get out of attending. So my point was that I still stayed under my TDEE for the day and there are ways to do an occasion like this without totally sabtoaging your weight loss and your emotional/mental health (if you're like me, and overeating/bingeing leads to depression). 

I think your viewpoint that all socializing that involves eating should be avoided is a touch unrealistic for many of us? I mean, I totally get where you're coming from, binge drinking and over eating and most restaurants are unhealthy.. but for most of us it's not going to be possible to totally avoid any and all social situations that involve eating/food/restaurants for the rest of our lives. Most of us have families/friends/partners that occasionally expect us to come over for meals/parties/go out, life events that prevent us from eating a meal or meals at home like weddings, work, travel/vacations, etc. So it makes more sense to work on self-discipline, work on continuing to reduce portion size even more, and on general strategies then to flat out say that socializing that involves eating is out forever.","1433117031"

The mood of the song is pretty serious and that's cool but it didn't fit the imagery of the music video. Study your favorite artist, and observe EVERYTHING about their art. MV's, Vocal production, Fashion, marketing, etc. All of that stuff is why they are in the position they are. 

overall if this is DIY, then it's impressive. but always scale your vision to it's fullest potential.

Nothing is stopping a signatory to the TPP from trading with non-signatories. If a non-party country [x] and a party country [y] have tariff and NTBs that are higher than those what TPP members have, the cost to trade will be higher, meaning there will be little incentive to trade. But if [x] and [y] want to create an agreement where they lower such barriers to eachother that makes it lower than what [x] has with the other TPP members, trade will be easier there.

&gt;The leaks have been pretty consistent, the parts which people are objecting to the most haven't been changed, nor have politicians addressed contentious areas to the public such as IP law, especially when relating to patents and, as an example, if protections that Australia has against evergreening will have to be removed.

But, in the end it was God who did it all and has the right to do it however he wants to!

My pastor was funny, engaging, convicting, and the worship was off the chain! I really loved it and, while I didn't learn anything new per se, I did learn how to gracefully and tactfully speak to a large audience about such controversial subjects.

From &amp;amp;quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&amp;amp;quot;  
NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Robin....     So each of the knights went their  
           separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of  
           Ewing, accompanied by his favourite minstrels.  
MINSTREL (singing):  
  Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  
  He was not afraid to die, oh Brave Sir Robin.   
  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.   
  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!   
  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp,   
  Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.   
  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away,

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt;Seriously, it's so fucking easy to do it better than this.

Actually it's not.

The issue is that using the PPPoE protocol if the ISP hashes your password at their end, then to authenticate you, you'll have to send your clear-text password to them so they can hash it and compare that to the stored hash. It's called [PAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_authentication_protocol) and it's susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks which is why it's not commonly used.

The alternative is called [CHAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol) and the way it works is that the ISP sends you a random string of characters and gets you to encrypt that string with an md5 hash using your password as a key and then send the encrypted string back. The ISP then uses your stored password to encrypt the same string using the same cipher and, if they match, you're in. However to do this, they need to store your clear text password at their end.

I, too, am no security expert, however those folks who *are* experts have apparently deemed that CHAP, while not ideal, is a more secure option than PAP and it has hence become the defacto standard. And that's why ISPs store your password in clear text.

This is why UTIs are fairly common the first few times having sex with a new partner. Your body sometimes needs time to develop immunity to new pathogens. In others, this immunity may never develop, which can lead to recurring UTIs with one partner but not others.

If you're already having problems with recurrence though, keeping a close eye on minimizing skin bacteria by frequent washing for both you and your partner is certainly a good idea. Lots of other stuff could be going on though, so don't just keep repeating the same acute-antibiotic-care strategy. Find someone to dig into treating the chronic problem.","1433117044"

How much will you be making off just nannying?

&gt;2) Well, maternity leave would be 6 weeks without an income but I feel like our savings would really help out over those 6 weeks

Is this a 6 weeks you take at anytime, or after the baby is here?

&gt;4) If he bails, I'm pretty screwed. Considering we fight very little, have lived together for two years, and overall have a good relationship I highly doubt he would do leave. He wants to keep the baby and does not want to adopt him/her out.

Big question. Does he **want** to have a child? Have you allowed him to answer honestly? Did he express wanting kids before this? The fact that he's talking about you guys not being able to financially cover it (though it sounds like you guys have got a pretty solid financial system) screams to me that he does **not** want this child.

This is your future if this is the case:

Have you tried R&amp;B yet? I imagine with your hair type you'd LOVE it. I've yet to find the right amount for my hair because I keep thinking I'm not putting enough in but when it dries it's super greasy because I used too much. However it makes my hair INCREDIBLY soft. I can only imagine when all my damage grows out and my curls come back that this stuff will just give me the most bouncy and soft ringlets.","1433117045"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt; Simply thinking that doesn't make you a bad parent.

You have to understand that children are incredibly perceptive. They are tuned to learn from their parents and that means they will observe everything. Even a toddler will know full well if you feel disappointed in them even if you do not tell them. If you directly act on your negative thoughts that is surely worse, I agree with you there but it's incredibly unhealthy for someone to repress their disdain or disappointment in their child and harbor it in their mind rather than address it and fix the thought processes that led them there.

 Is it healthy to feel disappointment in your child when they're living their life well and to the best of their abilities? no, it is not, no matter how common it is. Even if you have the self control to not act on your disappointment directly (most parents would find this incredibly difficult) at some point or perhaps across multiple smaller points you will slip up, tiny comments, criticisms. Your disappointment will become crystal clear over time but more dangerously the motivation for your disappointment will be shrouded. This will lead to dramatic problems with the child's perception of you and of themselves. 

&gt; one thought doesn't neglect 18 years of good parenting.

I feel you're getting bogged down in the semantics of what I am saying. Of course having one negative thought does not make you bad or unable to parent, claiming that the thought is 'natural', moral  or justifiable however and refusing to let it go is a huge problem.

&gt; do you believe in thought crime?

This questions seems to come a little out of the blue considering how different parenting is to a justice system but you are welcome to argue or discuss my answer all you want. 

Most modern ethics systems are based on 'thought crime' in the form of intent. It is wrong to steal, but it is more wrong to steal for the pleasure of it than it is to steal to feed your family. Your actions were identical but the thought behind the action defined the crime. 

Another example would be running someone down in your car. In a modern justice system you will receive much greater punishment if you ran someone down in rage than if you did so accidentally. Even if the devastation caused is the same the thought was the real crime. 

The example of the paedophile is interesting and much more complex. Sexuality can not be inherently wrong, even if you are attracted to something that is not morally or socially acceptable, it is not something that can be prevented, fixed, or rationalised like rage or greed or hatred. You are not doing wrong by thinking how you were programmed to think, you are doing wrong by refusing to attempt to address your thoughts. Which I suppose tangibly relates back to the parenting topic. ","1433117046"

The whole tub of peanut butter is ~700 calories I believe and there's a lot of it.
Mix it all together until it's thick with some water or milk, zero calorie sweetner, low fat chocolate, whatever you want and put it in the freezer.
Take it out before the Main Event. Boom, you have delicious, sweet chilled peanut butter pudding.

I'd recommend giving Desperate times another look over. Desperate times is purely about memorization and anti tear gas cans. All you really have to do is take down a number of enemies to win at the end. To stock up, near the end keep Marvin waiting and i think there will be a key to open the roof padlock to get a weapon/supplies. The garage gate should now be open so you can run in there and loot some weapons in that tunnel. There should be a key on a dead guy on the dog kennels now that will unlock the safe on the second floor east wing. I feel sorry for him, all he wanted to do was check on the dogs. Plus i could've used the extra damn help.

Pretty much just either equip the AI with some extra firepower, or use them as bait as you take care of the zombies and you're good to go.

"conlangs","t5_2red7","Ah, on the conlang skype group chat their is an Irishman named Michael who sometimes talks about Irish, I thought it may have been you there. 


People say that they are able to speak Scots for the status of being bi-lingual without actually learning the language. Whenever I bring it up they say their large amounts of English is due to Scots being related to English. Though there is a very clear difference between native Scots features and English ones. The two languages split off one thousand years ago so differences are to be expected. But people aren't prepared for just how different Scots can be. 

There is The Scots Language Centre but unfortunately the people that run it are the same type of people I described above. They only post poetry in what can barely be called Scots online, and any new ideas that aren't theirs are met with aggression. I have even been called out as an outsider due to my very Gaelic name (My ancestry is mostly Irish, Gaeilge speakers from Mayo in fact, and from Donegal being an Ó Domhnaill myself) despite being a native speaker who has lived in a Scots speaking region my entire life.  Curiously you don't have to speak a word of Scots to apply for the head of the Scots dictionary position, I mean if you are going to manage a dictionary, it helps to be at least fluent in the language. Could you imagine the mess if a Spaniards who didn't speak a word of English managed the Oxford dictionary? Well thats what is happening with Scots. Its an ugly mess. 

How do the native speakers of Irish fair? Does it survive as a spoken language by the natives as an everyday language?","1433117051"

Pretty good if you combine them with Yuck 90's as well, though that can be said for other line infantry as well.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Don't see why everyone is bringing up that Dyrus tweet as if he got completely outplayed top by Flaresz. Flaresz got his lead with a roam and surprising to no one, Hecarim with kills wins just about any lane. 
Not saying Dyrus played perfectly (in fact he fucked up a few times in teamfights) or Flaresz is bad, but top lane as a duel really didn't happen much. After that though his build path was terrible, and TSM completely outplayed them in terms of objectives, which has me wondering how people can say the game was close.

It was 8 turrets, and 4 dragons with a big CS lead mid as well. The game looks closer because Hecarim was able to trade 1 for 1 a few times due to his amazing burst on Turtle and Dyrus.

Overall much better play from TSM today than yesterday. The games early on played out fairly similarly, with TSM grabbing a modest 3-4k lead, except today they pushed that lead with smart fights instead of terrible positioning and hesitation that happened yesterday. ","1433117053"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The claim isn't that every person's ultimate purpose is to experience God's goodness. The claim is that, because of God's goodness, all things exist for the purpose of enabling as much goodness as possible - whether the individual ends up experiencing that goodness or not.

You want to stick with this? God is all knowing and knows full well that in creating some human beings, he will actively be facilitating the torture, murder, rape, and abuse of many others. Of course they have the free will to choose not to do so, but God knows what they will and will not do. While I'm certain you don't always feed your son candy, I highly doubt you would willing facilitate his torture, rape, and murder in the hopes that his future perpetrator MIGHT not do it. That is quite a strange definition of a being who called himself the source of all love and goodness.  

&gt;so I wouldn't argue that it's impossible for the child's death to have a good reason, like you seem to be arguing. I don't think you have sufficient information to make that argument.

I am not arguing that a child's death has a good reason- that's the argument for accepting God's plan and his divine knowledge to which we mortals are not privy. I'm arguing that creating a fetus and killing it in the womb before it even experiences life seems to absolutely contradict God's purpose in creating humanity in the first place. Unless of course you're saying that about 30% of all pregnancies are collateral damage to teach people about love and God's comfort. 

 &gt;What I do have, however, is the perspective to judge that God is good. Which, if you were wondering - I acquired by doing what he says, believing him, and drawing nearer to him.

Which is nice and I'm sure brings you purpose in your life and comforts you when you can't understand why things happen in your life. You know, like when the ancient Greeks explained that lightening was Zeus striking his hammer. Or that Poseidon would sink the ships of sailors who had not sacrificed properly to him. Or that the cattle of a farmer died because he had a secret sin. Or that plague killed thousands of people because their ruler defied the will of the gods. Or that a man lost his wife and child in child birth because Artemis was not there to protect them. It's all reasoning from people who did not have the resources to understand the world that existed around them- and the book that tells you all about God was written at the same time, using the same reasoning as the Greeks used for their gods, as the Egyptians used for theirs, and the Hindus used for theirs, etc. I'm a historian. I'm not in any way saying that ancient humans were dumb- they were exceptionally smart and resourceful in the way they manipulated the world around them and they are the foundation of the world we now live in. However, they were limited in their ability to understand everything and in the absence of information, they found ways to explain the unexplainable, which were supernatural beings. The only difference between what you believe and what the Greeks believed is that they recognize several beings and you recognize just one.  ","1433117054"

Huh? he's using 70 years of data.  How is that set up to fail?  

&gt;How is the growth of my initial $1000 investment different if I continue to add to it throughout the 40 year time period, in addition to dividends, compared with what's shown in the Appendix?

Continuing to add to a position has no bearing on implied risk or portfolio volatility. 

&gt;According to the Appendix, even if I end up in the bottom category (1/6 chance) it still suggests I would likely have far more than my initial investment of 1000, that seems like a good bet to me. especially given the upside depicted.

Some things I've noticed:

Power higher to taxi.

Keep the back pressure on during take off/roll out.

Try not to brake too heavily if you can avoid it, it can tear the taxiway/runway up. You'll get good at planning your taxi and not braking against power. I actually fly a plane without toe brakes so I've had to learn to steer on taxi not brake hard to turn. 

The narrowness, well you've said you're happy with that already so I'll just leave that. 

Don't know what the area is around your field but mine is just more fields so get good at working out landmarks to set up your approach instead of being able to see the bloody big airport like I did when I was learning. Obviously I was looking for landmarks, especially reporting points, but I could usually spot the massive airport. Now I need to set myself off a set point and try spot the field surrounded by fields, it's been interesting but so satisfying to set yourself up 5 miles out on final and not have to do anything but hold your planned descent. 

If you're used to using piano keys and numbers for your landings things are going to get a bit interesting. We just have gable markers and sticking it as close to the line as possible is great fun.

Enjoy it, grass fields are a lot of fun and make me feel a bit old fashioned which I enjoy. ","1433117058"

How about...

"freelance","t5_2qhs9","So I tried to hire a rails guy about 2 years ago.  I was building an MVP and I tried to hire him because I knew it was something he was interested in.  Basically, I found him by searching for Triathlons and Rails developer and he was one of the few people who came up.

So you could imagine how I felt when he said he would do it for $150 and hour.   I told him it was coming out of my pocket and he wasn't interested in lowering his rates... thats fine its how it goes.

But put yourself in my shoes.  Why should you make $300,000 a year.  The answer is probably that you shouldn't.  Its just that you are in a small pool and the rest of the world hasn't saturated the market to drive your rates down. Your salary is because you are really in demand.  I'm a freelancer too, so I'm not mad at you getting paid, but you need to relate to common man money... which $300k a year certainly isn't... not even in SF. 

My advice.  Keep stripping bags of cash off any corporate sponsors who'd like to pay you.  Particularly if its a bank, govt, mega corp type job.  When the little guys come around again, give them a special rate... because you know, sometimes $75 an hour is still a ton of money to a guy paying out of his pocket.

Also, to get back to your original question... every new client you get, keep upping it $10 an hour.  Some will back away, some won't.  Eventually they will all back away...  drop your rate slightly from there, and bobs your uncle.  ","1433117067"

&gt; I should also mention that he is not depressed

What is this based on? This reads like textbook depression. Depression is not always about sadness, it usually feels more like apathy, or a lack of feeling. I am not a doctor but I would strongly recommend he see one.

Your BF sounds just like me 1 year ago, when I stopped going to CS classes, stayed in my room all day on the internet and eventually attempted suicide.

Let's chalk up the symptoms:

&gt;slowly transitioned

&gt;I should note that he was NOT like this when we first met,

&gt;slowly faded away over time.

Depression can come and go. That's usually how it happens. 

For me at least, I feel like I've been moving in and out of patches of depression my whole life. I certainly wasn't contemplating suicide before I went to uni.

&gt;he lost contact with friends 

Unwillingness to socialize.

Once I stayed in my room for three days straight. I didn't even have enough food for three days. I felt waves of hunger wash over me because I would rather starve than face the people I was living with.

&gt;He has made almost no friends at school 

&gt;he does not have friends to spend time with

This could be a symptom or a cause.

For me it was both, it was sort of a deadly spiral. I didn't really know that much about CS, so I didn't get on too well with the other people on my course, who were always having conversations I didn't understand. This rejection, or more the fact that it was my own fault I wasn't making friends, certainly contributed to the way I was feeling.

&gt;He does not try to make acquaintance with professors or students in his CS classes and never really met new people when we first came here

&gt;not gotten a job

Could be caused by a feeling of low self worth.

Before I went to talk to someone I'd think something along the lines of, ""Why would they want to talk to me?"" And when I couldn't come up with anything, I'd just keep myself to myself.

&gt;awkwardly refuses to socially participate because it is ""too late"" and it would ""be awkward"" which I think is just masking the fact that he doesn't want to be involved

&gt;he is in that apartment ALL DAY

Retreating from social situations.

If you hate the way you look, why would you want to go out and be seen? If you hate how awkward you are, why would you want people to hear you talk?

&gt; in social settings he doesn't know how to behave. 

This isn't really a symptom but I believe it could be a cause.

Social awkwardness just gives another reason to withdraw from the world and to hate yourself.

&gt;He is a year behind in computer science from the rest of those in our year and now has failed a 100 level class (not like 101 or 102, this was his 4th class, but still) that is not really known for being that difficult.


Apathy.

Yeah. I basically stopped going to my classes and couldn't care less whether or not I failed them. Eventually I dropped out altogether. 

&gt;when I visit him after work he is unwashed in his pjs 

&gt;sheer laziness.

Lack of motivation.

When you think of being motivated you probably think of acing a test or getting a promotion. Head on over to /r/depression. Having a shower is comparable to climbing mount doom when you're depressed, let alone standing up in it. Forget having a shower, try getting out of bed. Chances are he's slept all day, and has only woken up a few hours before you got home. Also chances are he's ashamed of that, and how lazy he is, another reason to hate himself.

&gt;moldy dishes and piles of laundry to the ceiling

&gt;I am starting to feel increasingly put off by his behavior or lackof

&gt;he does not shower 

&gt;him agreeing and being nicer/cleaning or exercising a bit for a day or 2, and then reverting back to his ways. 

More lack of motivation.

Washing regularly is a mountain for depressed people. You can forget doing laundry or the dishes. Those are actual chores.

&gt;He has gained about 20-30 pounds since we met

Overeating.

With me it was under eating, but this is also texbook depression.

&gt;he is deeply hurt by me suggesting he shower 

Self hatred.

Why is such a simple suggestion hurting him so deeply? Is it because you're scratching at something deeper?

Imagine the boy you started dating. Now imagine that person becoming depressed. How would that be different to the boy you're dating now?

Notice that I haven't once mentioned video games. Video games are not the problem here. They are not even the cause of the problem. CS students and video games go together like rolls and royce. If video games caused this kind of behaviour, nobody would be able to finish a year, let alone the whole course. It is possible he has an addiction, but I strongly suspect that it is being allowed to flourish because of a deeper underlying problem, his depression.

If he's anything like me, he misunderstood what CS was going to be like and he finds it boring as all hell. He also finds going into social situations to be humiliating due to the ""troll like"" behaviour that comes naturally to him and therefore avoids them at all costs. Maybe he shouldn't take my advice since I attempted suicide but I'd suggest studying something he actually cares about. For example, I'm studying film now.

I honestly have no idea why you don't think he's depressed.

**Second, with regards to you:**

You have to ask yourself, are you in love with who is is or who he was?

&gt;we grew close

&gt;he has been my rock

&gt;he has helped me

&gt;my boyfriend can be motivated 

Past tense! Past tense! 

I'm going to assume the latter then, and lay out two options:

Option one, you break up with him.

This will probably be the favourite of /r/relationships.

You don't owe him anything. Sometimes relationships don't last, that's life. You'll probably be happier without him and you've mentioned having other options if you do want another relationship. 

He may see it as a kick up the backside or he may get worse. Either way, nothing that couldn't have happened if you had stayed.

In this case, I do suggest that you talk about depression with him before you leave. It could save his life so it's probably worth it.

Option two, you stay with him and try and help him beat his depression.

A pro of this option is that you can pick option one at any point if things don't go to plan.

This may involve him going to therapy, taking medication with serious side effects, or several long and emotional relapses, so don't expect an easy ride. Success is in no way guaranteed and the struggle will never truly be over.

This will be much less enjoyable in the short term. In the long term, it may not even be worth it. You might just end up leaving him anyway. Even if it does work out, you could probably have ended up just as happy if you had left him, maybe by dating someone else or just by doing your own thing.

Relationships can survive, so if that's what you want then go for it, but make sure it's the right choice for you personally. It's not selfish to not date someone.

&gt;I do not know how to approach it without seeming like his mother, an opportunistic gold digger type trying to stay with her engineering bf, or a shallow bitch who dumps her bf for not having friends. 

All good points.

For the first two, it seems like you've chosen to stay with your bf, in which case beating his depression becomes important. This could be seen as motherly mollycoddling, or someone attempting to get more out of their boyfriend for personal gain. As long as you support him in his struggle, rather than nag and watch over him to make sure he's doing what he's ""supposed"" to be doing, then you won't seem motherly. If you make it clear that you're doing it because you care about him, then you won't seem like a gold digger. Perception like this isn't something to worry about too much, but it's a handy thing to consider. Self loathing could spread to hatred of you if you attempt to battle his depression with him.

As for being ""a shallow bitch who dumps her bf for not having friends,"" just be clear that it's his actions that are causing the breakup. Focus on the hygiene and his apathetic attitude rather than how other people see or treat him.

If he asks, ""Wait, I'm depressed so you're dumping me?"" don't give him reasons. He's trying to get flawed logic out of you so that you feel guilty about leaving, or at the very least so that he can rationalize it not being his fault. Don't rise to it. You are not obliged to give reasons.

Anyway, if I've missed anything at all just comment or message me and I'll reply. Good luck with whatever you choose.

Subjectively, sure.

&gt;&gt;(Caricatured Subjectivism) Moral judgments report simple preferences, ones that are exactly on a par with preferences like preferences for a particular restaurant or for ordering tuna.

And:

&gt;&gt;(1) Assume caricatured subjectivism for reductio.

Fortunately no one *is* supporting this.

&gt;Which is what you are claiming.

Nope.

&gt; You can't have both be you absolute favorite.

Sure, but there's no account of personal preferences that entails that I have two absolute favorite flavors of ice cream, so I'm not sure where you're going with this.

&gt;You don't need to. 

Of course not, which is why the argument only operates on existentially quantified versions of premises 4 and 6.

&gt;And if your issue is with self-contradictory views, you have a problem with any sort of religion, and even atheism (you can define 'god' as atheism, which means atheism is the position of believing atheism doesn't exist.).

I don't think any religious claims are true and I'm not sure why I'd be committed to Quineian holism.

&gt;Just that you can't have two contradictory opinions.

So you're saying that 4 or 6 is objectively wrong?

&gt;4 and 6 don't follow because morality is not objective.

4 and 6 are defended within the framework of moral subjectivism.

&gt;It's an opinion that it's wrong.

Yes, which is all that's needed to motivate 4 and 6 given subjectivism.

&gt;There's an assertion in there that subjective opinions are objectively fact.

Where is this asserted?

"breakingmom","t5_2y6ap","From my experience as a (former) daycare teacher (i dont know where you are or the circumctances/rules surrounding the center your child is in) it could be your teachers superiors who are pushing her to encourage you to get your child to feed herself and to get on a one nap schedule. When i was in an infant room, at 12 months old the child was to be on a one nap schedule, and the nap was always after lunch. [Which is stupid and i fought long and hard with mine, because if a baby needs to sleep, they need to sleep. But we would have to adhere to the schedule which would make for very cranky, screaming kids come lunchtime.] What kid wants to eats then? 

My suggestions would be to just keep giving her pieces of food, try everything. Babies need to try a food 75 times before they can decide whether or not they actually like it. Even if she gags. i know it sounds bad and looks bad, and can get messy, but thats how she'll learn. Put some stuff in front of her while you are feeding her puree's. Or you could mix pieces of cooked rice into the puree's. DO you make your own or buy jars? Something else i used to do was mix pieces of , say, cooked carrots into a carrot puree, or some peas in the pea puree. Then she will gradually adjust to the texture.

EDIT: Just read through the posts and wanted to say that Early Intervention is great. YOu could mention to your pediatrician that the daycare teacher expressed some concern and they can get you a referral and send someone out. I had a child in my class with this exact same problem. The EI lady came in and showed us some tricks to use and some different techniques and 'chew' (i hate to call them that) toys to help stimulate her senses.

No, I tried to use language that isn't very definitive as a result.

&gt;You presented one article, and one based on a trope--namely that there are significant barriers against diversity in STEM.

Apologies, don't have much on hand at the moment and I was busy posting a massive batch of sanity. Got any specific things you want proven, disproven, etc...?

&gt;I disagreed. I did not find our conversation intellectually stimulating. Sue me.

Eh, i'll refrain.

&gt;Also, if you're going to be a ""feminist,"" you may as well admit your buffet-style approach to the ideology. Being a through-and-through modern feminist would entail accepting Dworkin, even reveling in her fire-and-brimstone tactics, as they propelled the cause of you and would-be victims everywhere.

I don't think you know much about feminism tbh. As Dworkin was at ends with other feminists. Sex-positivity/negativity in particular was incredibly dividing.

To pretend you need to be Dworkin to be a feminist is like pretending you have to be Mussolini to be a conservative.

&gt;You are grossly magnifying the content of one single, short exchange online and trying to turn-table using ad hominem attacks on what you perceive to be my emotional disposition.

I'm merely noting what I seem to be observing and explaining your behavior, though you are right there isn't much here to work off of, barely enough for a pattern, more than enough to predict one though. You're free to react as you please, there's nothing wrong with irony or being angry. Even thinking it an ad hominem.

&gt;And while your logic is lacking

I'd take that as an insult but (actual ad hominem warning) logic is more or less what I do.

"CoonTown","t5_351zk","I can't think of anything that happened to me personally at the moment. Though one does come to mind that my parents witnessed.

They were at a local grocery store and there was an elder chimp in from of them at a checkout line. Apparently her cart was FULL of food, and take a wild guess her payment method. You guessed right, gud ol' food stamps. I think this was before EBT. Anyway she was all ready to pay when the cashier asked for a couple dollars. Apparently this broad raised hell over this. Dem food stamps sposed to make things free, right? Well you can't buy light bulbs with food stamps! When she realized the error of her ways she let out a loud ""I's sorry, I's sorry"". According to my dad she had no more than four or five teeth in her mouth. So she paid for the light bulbs and that's pretty much it.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The point is that culture and society creates civilization and if homosexuals feel like the society they live in doesn't cut it for them they can always go off and create their own.  

Replace the world ""homosexuals"" with ""niggers"" in your statement and you sound like those good ole boys I mentioned earlier. I'm sure that's what lots of racist southern Americans think of Black people in their ""society"".

Casual discrimination like yours is bad because you won't even honestly admit you dislike homosexuals for nothing more than the fact of being gay. You talk about society and culture as some sort of justification to your irrational opposition. That's crap though, you can choose to believe what you want. If the people in your society want to be bigots you can join them if you want to be a bigot. Or you can consider it and think for yourself ""No, I don't want to discriminate against homosexuals because that is wrong, regardless of what other members of society say"". 

This is how actual social progress is made, once a certain point is reached in activism and political agitation, the majority will drag people like you, kicking and screaming, into accepting policies that will come to benefit society. 

We don't need everyone in society to be ready, we just need 51% to realise that discrimination is a bad thing to reinforce in a society. Also to say society is not ready is a bullshit excuse to cover your own discrimination. If ""society isn't ready"" you try and make it ready.

This is partly the reason I'm having this discussion with you because I genuinely hope I can (and I'm highly doubtful of being able to) make some dint into your opinions and try to get you to empathise with someone in this kind of situation.

Like if you had a homosexual child yourself im sure you would never want to make them feel excluded from society simply by the fact of being homosexual.

Can I ask you how you feel if you had a homosexual child who wished to have children with their partner but couldn't because of the opinions of people like you?

How could you justify excluding your own child from having children, excluding yourself from the possibility of grand children?

*""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."" - Adam Smith*

In other words, I never said that businessmen were inherently kind and generous. What I am talking about is a matter of economic infrastructure and societal wealth, not a matter of kindness and generosity. Nobody wants their children to work, but when your society isn't wealthy enough for people on the bottom to afford to eat otherwise, then you will make your children work in order to not die of starvation.

&gt;Also, in 1933, that was the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis in American history.

Which was caused by the government.

&gt;The depression didn't lift until years later.

...Because the government kept prolonging it with policies that were intended to fix it.

&gt;So the argument that child labor disappeared with an improving economy is false. 

I don't understand how that follows.","1433117084"

This sounds much quicker than our current system which...is a bit worrisome to me.

It could stop stories if reaction times and ships were able to assemble and go that quickly.

It would also seem to allow the IB to raid a place like the Vale then get back to IB waters incredibly quick, with the Vale having no hope of responding. Maybe I'm overblowing it though. A breakdown would help to understand it a bit better and see how big the changes were.

The transaction tax is naturally opposed by the financial corporations based in London, and therefore also by the Government thanks to hard working lobbyists. Personally I think it should go ahead, but one can understand the reluctance considering how heavily our economy relies on the presence of these banks and so forth.

Surprise surprise, not every European foot fits every European shoe. We want our extra sausage because to forgo it would be to forgo common sense.

I don't want us to leave Europe, but the whole system would work a lot better if the German's gave up on this idea of a federalised, homogenous Europe and permitted lots of extra sausages for everyone. Let the nations compete again, let them retain unique economies and characters. Diversity has always been Europe's greatest strength.

The phrase ""emotional drama bitches"" is full of so much derision it's almost comical. There are many opinions in it that I dislike:

1. Emotions are bad

2. Showing emotions is bad

3. Being a woman is bad (ever hear a guy called a drama bitch?)

4. It is acceptable to put down the person you're in a relationship with

The sad part here, your buddy is clearly having communication issues in his relationship. Sounds like he &amp; his gf aren't able to really talk. He's asking for advice from his buddies and they say, ""Just ignore her unhappiness. She clearly can't tell you the truth."" They're encouraging an unhealthy pattern of not communicating and not believing the girlfriend when she says she needs something.

Also, whether or not you've been in a committed romantic relationship is not the deciding factor on if you are capable of having (or recognizing) emotionally supportive relationships. You can develop healthy relationship patterns through your family, friends, etc. So don't doubt your faith in the individuality of people.  It is that understanding that will help you find a healthy relationship.

How to deal?

1. Recognize you have different relationship expectations &amp; don't bother trying to talk to them about relationships

2. Don't hang out with them

3. Tell them that since there are 3.5 billion women on the earth &amp; they might know 1000 of them (or 0.00002 percent). That doesn't make them qualified to speak for all the women on earth.

"runefactory","t5_2tkdl","The numerical upgrades now:

Okay there are a slew of great upgrades, but most aren't accessible to you yet or are hard to get.

When considering stat upgrades I usually consider Str above all else, but I'm personally a glass cannon type and am good at dodging, to me, 1 str = about 3 vit to me, but I would probably consider at your point in the game 1 str = 1.5 vit or 2 vit or so. Obviously if you're a mage type replace str with int, though I gotta say that considering the power of some Rune Abilities, melee is more effective until you have a fairly high int value, and the best spells. This is mostly because of straight punch and cyclone rune abilities being overpowered though. I'll mention this later.

Anyway, the best upgrade you can probably get right now to my recollection is Grimoire scale, simply because it gives a helluva lotta Vit and a decent amount of str at this point in the game.
Grimoire scale is 50 str, 160 vit, 50 int, and drops from the Grimoire, the second last boss in Leon Karnak, there's a teleporter to him on the left side of the entrance area. Get as many of these as possible, and I suggest using at least 2 of your Tenfold steels on this (that is, one tenfold on two different equipment slots).
Legendary Scale is a close second, it gives you 10% drain when used on a weapon, which gives 10% of any melee attack back to use as hp back to you, and has half effect against bosses. Some enemies are immune to drain like golems though. Obviously useless if you're a mage type. I would personally use this on a weapon with a tenfold to get 90% drain, which makes it so that as long as you deal more damage than you're taking (which you probably will), you won't die unless bursted very fast, you still have to be wary of big boss attacks.
If you have access to them, Big Crystal flowers you can grow give 20% resist to a particular element, you can use this with a double steel to get 60% resist, if you have enough of them, this is a cheap way to get 100% resists against Fire/Wind/Earth/Water, extremely useful since you won't have to worry about almost any magic. These only work on armor, which is fine since your weapon slots are important for other upgrades.

A brief mention to Big Bird's Comb, you can get these at the Cluck Cluck Nest from giant clucky's, they give 50% Faint Res, so you don't get the status effect Instant KO, which, like the name implies, kills you in one hit. This can be useful against certain enemies and a specific boss. Using two will give immunity of course.
Also, Cursed Doll gives 15% Seal and Paralysis res, Seal Res is particularly useful. Get it from the Mannequin boss (the boss you fought to get Dolly back), Ghost Hood can also be used for 30% Seal res. Not really necessary, but helpful.

Little Crystals are 80 atk, and are fairly common, probably the one you should use on most gear simply because they are fairly easy to get.
Orichalcum is 95 Def, pretty decent since you can easily get it in Leon Karnak by mining, if you need to fill slots, use this.
Crystal Skulls are 60 M Atk and 195 MDef, consider it if you need more M Def, or if you're a caster type, get it from the sarcophagus in Leon Karnak. May need to do save and do some soft resets.
Right and Left Rock Shards from the two statues in Leon Karnak are good for raising you status resists and giving some good Def and MDef. You can pop them on each armor slot for a decent amount of status resist if you want.
Fire Dragon Ash from Fiergaenger is a decent upgrade if you want to go through the effort, not really necessary.

Those are pretty much the good upgrades for now. Once you get a few levels into Rune Prana, the enemies start dropping great items, especially the Dragons, Crimson scale is probably the best item at that point in the game because 140 Str is too good, and the other scales are good too. The Regular Dragon Scale gives 140 Vit, and the Blue Dragon Scale gives 140 Int. You may as well use all of them if you have upgrade slots available. Of course, make the better base equipment too once you're able. Good luck guys.



Bonus tips:

Rune Abilities are super overpowered, a few in particular; remember you can use any rune ability with any weapon, it just costs extra RP. RA RP cost is based off of the RA's weapon though, so having a decent skill with the weapon the RA is meant for is good.

Straight Punch is a rune ability I think you get in Rune Prana at some point from a chest, I'd have to look it up to remember, anyway's it does a massive amount of damage after holding it for 2 or 3 seconds, it's probably going to be the first ability you can get to hit the damage cap, 99999, and you can get that much damage without having ridiculous gear too. The base damage is ridiculous.
Cyclone is another good fist RA, and deals a fair amount of damage too without the leading time and deals in a AoE area. Fairly useful.
Double Kick is probably one of the best early RAs, it's a fist RA that's like Cyclone but hits twice instead of 4 times. Cyclone deals about 1.5 times more damage total, but also takes about that much more time to execute, not really sure which one deals more damage to be honest, so it works well if you don't have Cyclone or Straight Punch. The fact that it's a shorter time is good though, because it allows you to hit and run easier. Probably going to be your mainstay for a while.

I know those last few are all Fist RAs, but Fist RAs are pretty overpowered, so there you have it, those are probably the best RAs. I will mention the other good ones though.

Twin Attack is a quick RA that does decent damage, useful for hit and run tactics.
Naive Blade is an interesting longsword RA that lets you counter attack if the enemy hits within about a quarter second or so. If you counter you get about a second of invincibility and deal a fair amount of damage, not as much as straight punch though. Requires great timing and knowledge of boss patterns and mechanics though, so not for newer players.
Steel heart is a longsword RA that makes you invulnerable to getting pushed away from enemy attacks for a duration of time, maybe about 60 seconds or so. Also stops you from getting knocked down. Very useful, but also a double edged sword, since you normally get mercy invincibility frames if you take abour 4 or 5 large hits in about 2 or so seconds, but it will stop you from getting them, so bosses can more easily one hit kill you if you're not careful.
Millionstrike is a decent Spear RA that does decent damage if you aim it properly. Has far reach so can be useful if you have low range.



I do want to mention levels.
So pretty much leveling up doesn't matter pretty much whatsoever until post game when enemies just have super overwhelming stats. The amount of time it takes to level isn't worth it since gear helps 10x as much. At level 750 my base stats are around 3.5k, pretty decent... until you consider that my stats with gear and food are 35k atk, 15k def, and 12k mdef. I practically have 10x the amount of base stats. However, gear doesn't give you any max HP, which is useful as a buffer, so there's that. Not to worry though, you will get all the levels you need from farming the materials you need to get good equipment. I think I was like level 200-ish when I beat the game, and I know I was below level 150 when I started Rune Prana. I play on hard mode.


Oh and yeah, food buffs. These are actually way more important than you might think, and are the reason why I prefer the Str/Vit/Int over Atk/def/etc. I think 1 base stat = 1.25 of the derived stat. Food buffs can give roughly a 25% increase from your base stats, I would personally recommend Salad since you can probably fairly easily get it to level 8 at least if you've been leveling you crops, and maybe level 10 if you have level 10 eggs. It's a good all around item. You probably won't be able to make anything better until you hit Sharance Maze for the Bread+ you need to get the Level 80+ recipes.

There's defensive early game minions like armor smith, draw minions in loot hoarder and acolyte, and then thaurissan enables insane combos.

Some builds run Grom and/or Boom, but this build focuses on working towards the 2 win conditions described above. 

I'd recommend watching strifecro's YouTube channel as he's recorded a number of grim patron warrior games and offers good insight into the decision making process while piloting that deck.","1433117092"

The system is an attempt to appeal to casual and hardcore - casual players will like seeing their progress every season (""I made it to rank 8 this time!"") whereas the hardcore/good players will grind up to Legend fairly quickly and shoot for specific rankings (""I made it to top-100 legend this time!"").","1433117092"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; And yet, it's confirmed that it's Shepard waking up after Destroy going as presented, not some hokey dream-sequence followed by still being at the beam.

Again, I'm not sure what it is you're trying to prove here. Perhaps you should read the articles you linked again because it just confirms what we already know,  Shepard is alive if you pick the destroy option. This flies in the face of the fact the Star-child tells Shepard he will die if he picks destroy. 

IT is, imo, a much more believable explanation than a face-value interpretation of choosing the destroy ending, which implies that Shepard, who was on the outside, on of the Citadel *as it orbited Earth then detonated*, and was somehow able to survive and end up back on Earth. It takes many more leaps in logic to explain that result from a face-value perspective.

I'm a path of least resistance kind of guy - I don't wave my hands to explain something away like Shepard surviving an exploding Citadel in orbit. I'll use the pre-established rules of indoctrination to show it never happened to begin with.

&gt; That's the problem. IT supporters treat it like a religion, starting with the conclusion they want and then trying to twist events into fitting.

You misunderstand me. I'm saying the ending of ME has more emphasis placed on the internal battle of Shepard. He resists indoctrination then the galaxy is saved in an off screen battle then we see the aftermath. I've already stated no on-screen final battle is a weakness of IT, but if it's an intended interpretation then as I said, the emphasis of that becomes solely placed on a depiction of Shepard's survival past the Reapers' final attempt to force indoctrination upon Shepard.","1433117092"

&gt;__Ephedrine__ (^i/ɨˈfɛdrɪn/ or /ˈɛfɨdriːn/; not to be confused with [ephedrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methcathinone)) is a [sympathomimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathomimetic) [amine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine) commonly used as a [stimulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant), concentration aid, [decongestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decongestant), [appetite suppressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite_suppressant), and to treat [hypotension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension) associated with anaesthesia.

&gt;Ephedrine is similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs [phenylpropanolamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpropanolamine) and [methamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine), as well as to the important [neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [epinephrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine) (adrenaline). Chemically, it is an [alkaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid) with a [phenethylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) skeleton found in various plants in the genus *[Ephedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra_(genus\))* (family [Ephedraceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedraceae)). It works mainly by increasing the activity of [norepinephrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) (noradrenaline) on [adrenergic receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptors).  It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.

&gt;The herb *[Ephedra sinica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra_sinica)*, used in [traditional Chinese medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), contains ephedrine and [pseudoephedrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine) as its principal active constituents. The same may be true of other herbal products containing extracts from other *Ephedra* species.

""Everyone, it is time to discuss the next phase of our war for power. Originally, it was our plan to move onto the Stepstones, but news from the region seems pretty clear that Westeros has taken up the cause of hunting the pirates after the... unfortunate seizure of the Dornish flagship. While this does not have a clear effect on our plans, I have exchanged a few letters with Lord Regent Lucerys Velaryon, who our Archon has previously met with, and we agreed that we can live in harmony. For this reason I think it best to not march on the Stepstone pirates, but instead gain more power in Essos.""

The crowd was delirious on the Klein and Nash goals to come back within 1. Then the Wild went right back down the ice and shoved one down our throats to shut us up... and then BRASS!! and then DUUUUUUC!! and then ZUUUUUC!! to finish her off.

But if it's info relevant to their current partner knowing what they like/don't like, or if a certain behavior is caused by it, then that's fine.

Alas, mine are LDR and I don't intend to ever move into the same town/state combo so what they say of me and the sex that happened doesn't really affect me.

As far as not wanting to face anyone, you got to own your sexual interests. For one, those two things aren't even that nasty in the first place. Pretty sure they are more common than you think and his current lady is just bitch trying to make you look bad. Chances are, most of those people don't even care about the words of a wasted chick.

There are houses that are shared spaces that are reasonable there (ymmv) and och.unm.edu has a lot of general listings for available housing and can be searched by distance from UNM (depending upon your carness).  

Food:  

Tons and tons of food here.  Nob hill areas has NM food, many varieties of east asian and fusion, americana food, italian, fine dining, etc.  it's a good area to be in all around.  I'd recommend walking/ biking around the area for both food and housing purposes to get a sense of the places at night and during the day.","1433117107"

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","&gt; She tries to Help Harry the only way she knows how [...] So she's fighting her own subconscious which is trying to protect her from pain, and trying to protect her family, and trying to save Harry from what she believes is something thats Horrible and that he is just an ill-fated victim. 

This is extremely questionable, and not shown to be her motivation in the books. It would hold more weight if she hadn't continued her behavior after her attempt to ""save"" Harry obviously hadn't worked. You're switching gears here, you can't argue that Petunia's hatred was justified and then argue that her harsh treatment of Harry came from a place of love.


&gt; he puts her family first because when he leaves it's all she's going to have left.

Harry is a member of her family. End of story.

&gt; Harry himself is literally a threat to their well being, the more they attach themselves to him the more danger they are going to be in when someone comes to kill him. 

This. is. not. Harry's. fault. Harry does not deserve to be treated like shit because he had the temerity to be targeted by Voldemort.

&gt; He continually pushes friends away, he never accepts help, he blames himself for things out of his control, and he tends to lash out at anyone that tries to get close to him.

This isn't the same as Petunia at all. In some ways it's the opposite.

Harry pushes people away because he doesn't want *anyone else other than him* to get hurt, Petunia pushes people away because *she herself* doesn't want to get hurt. 

Harry blames *himself* for things that are out of his control. Petunia blames *Harry* for things that are out of her control. 

I'm not sure where you get Harry lashing out at people who try to get close to him. He has no problem befriending Ron/Hermione/etc and he's generally perfectly polite to new people unless they're actively threatening him/his friends. We don't see him snapping angrily at strangers who tell him he has his mother's eyes. He fights with his friends occasionally and lashes out at them once or twice in OP, but that's long after they've actually become friends.

&gt; He's also overly protective of the ones he loves, so much so that he can be abusive to people who he feels threaten them. 

Petunia is protective of her husband and her son. Harry is protective of his friends and pretty much anyone who thinks half-deserves it. His anger comes because of the situations that he's placed into, and given what he goes through, I think he's doing better than expected. Petunia's anger is bitter and consistent despite the fact that she's had 13 years to come to terms with her situation. Not that I'm telling her to get over her sister's death just like that, but Harry's anger is much more heat of the moment and situational.

And again, she's also expressing her feelings against a small child who does not deserve a modicum of blame. Harry's expressing his feelings toward teenage peers and adults. And Harry is a teenager himself, so he is not held to the same standard of behavior as a thirtysomething mother. 

You really really need to stretch it to find parallels between their personalities. 

&gt; The worst that we see in Petunia is there in Harry too, it's just balanced out by the fact that he rises above it where Petunia Succumbs to it.

This is true in that all human beings have a worst and a best. But the idea that Harry and Petunia have similar personalities and that the difference is that Harry has more inner strength is extremely questionable. Harry might have a lot of inner strength, but I don't think it requires Herculean-level inner strength to give a toddler a bedroom rather than forcing them into a cupboard.

The only reason I compared her to Harry in the first place is because you're suggesting that Petunia's grief and anger over her sister justified her abuse of her sister's orphaned son.


&gt;  Petunia has a very Human response to the situation, all her actions are understandable, and to paint her as this monstrous child abuser who knowingly inflicts pain on Harry is just a gross over dramatization of what's happening.

I agree that she is a human rather than a monster, but **if you think she's not a child abuser who knowingly inflicts pain on Harry, then I don't think we read the same books.**

&gt; Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. 

-

&gt; ""I suppose we could take him to the zoo,"" said Aunt Petunia slowly, ""… and leave him in the car…""

-

&gt; ""Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!"" she cried, flinging her arms around him.

-

&gt; Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.

-

&gt; As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished. While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.

-

&gt; ""Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!"" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. 

-
 
&gt; The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray.

-

&gt; Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. ","1433117108"

To quote-

 ""dyrus getting carried. perhaps tsm should get get flaresz cuz he looks quite good.""

And you responded with the usual defense brigade about how if XYZ hadn't happened then Dyrus would have dominated him. 

They forced the enemy onto Hecarim which denied Dyrus comfort champ? Maokai was open and pretty sure that is Dyrus comfort champion, not Hecarim which he only played at MSI with pretty underwhelming results.

Dyrus misses ult in lane and doesn't get a solo kill 

Doesn't call tops movements so Bjergsen gets killed mid

Solo killed twice, once while overextending hardcore without vision

Overheats himself in a teamfight so he doesn't even equalizer, negating the entire purpose of picking rumble

But yeah Dyrus is fantastic and it's the team that never puts him in a position to succeed...

Keep in mind that to win worlds Dyrus will likely have to go against the likes of Koro1, Acorn, Flame, Duke, Flandre, Smeb, Marin, Huni, etc. I don't understand why TSM fans want to stick with Dyrus so hard when it is not doing their team's chances at worlds any favors.

At what point in time did it actually come across as a good idea to alienate the majority of the world's population- cis gendered hetero sexuals- ontop of whites and males, to a cause they might other wise have been convinced to join had you just been an adult instead of a sack of shit?

You SJWs treat people like total ass, over react at the slightest provocation, make excuses to be angry about just about any thing under the sun, you defend the indefensible when it suits you, you ignore the obvious, refuse to use reason and logic, and jump aboard every bandwagon the media launches and then move the goal posts when it turns out to have been a burning ship from the onset. Then you start acting like an absolute fuckface when confronted with your bullshit hypocrisy, and you try to pawn it all off as a joke?

So basically there's a whole host of people who use 14+ skills, and the skill deck will only allow 12.  I recommended in their official English posting that they allow up to 10 slots, but also automatically give us every class skill free from the start, since that would cover a lot of individuals issues and only leave a few fringe cases (I use 20 skills no exceptions!)","1433117114"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","First off, try not getting so hostile, simply trying to make a good conversation happen over a topic that tends not to get talked about in a good light. I understand that having a mechanic or set of mechanics in a game to handle this topic would be preferable than just talking, I get that, I want that for the medium as a whole. In no ones mind can what I said come across as wanting to have intercourse displayed in games, I don't need to see that to understand the process of what happens, I don't think anyone of age needs to see that, but that was not the point of what I said, I was merely pointing out that we seem to be settling on a rather lackluster endorsement of what a relationship is in this medium, I personally have no problem with the face rubbing minigame, but I was hoping a discussion could be opened up on the topic as a whole and we could all maybe just talk about what we'd like to see more of, less of and everything else in the community and the such.
Iteration does indeed take time, but that shouldn't stop us from being able to talk about what we'd like the final iterations to look like, talking about subjects does more to help than hinder any dev in finding good solutions to an otherwise awkward and underdeveloped topic, I actually agree with you that most people seem to be taught a rather poor way to approach this particular subject. As far as your comment regarding my experience with the game Awakening, I've played it, quite alot, I understand that Fire Emblem Awakening did not treat it as a reward in the sense you probably think I inferred, there was no scene or video to give gratification, what there was however, was the unlocking of an additional battle and character for the player, who was generally stronger than their parent characters, thats a reward.
Thanks for admitting the dishonesty in your previous statement, and I agree the subject can make people uncomfortable and I appologise if you thought I was condescending, I saw an opertunity to open a dialog on a subject I'd actually be interested in discussing with someone who appeared to share a distinct opinion on the subject, I can safely say now however I would rather not even broach the subject, I'd rather not have someone see my want to talk about a medium I love and parts of that medium that could use being talked about more openly and think themselves being attacked and being a snarky fuck in response.

For example PPMD (Dr. PeePee) is ranked 6th. Most people would agree that he is at least the 3rd best in the world. He only really goes to huge tournaments and when he does he typically places very high. I think the last tournament he went to was APEX where he got 1st over some very high level competition.","1433117115"

  The closing of Gitmo had absolutely nothing to do with whether Congress funded it or not. It was not going to be closed, but it did make for a good campaign promise and photo op for Obama when he was elected. 
 The thing most people don't get is, these people running for President are not privy to a lot of classified material while running. So they make promises based on public opinion. Once elected and they actually start being briefed on things they quickly realize that they can't do what they promised. So they then go into blame mode and the American people buy it hook, line, and sinker. 
 None of you, not a one knows why Gitmo was not closed. That is only known by select people. 
 Btw, a lot of those ""torture"" video's were not torture, they were humiliation techniques. They are made to make the person feel less than human so that they will talk.
Whether you want to believe it or not, they do work. The real torture you will never see and does not take place in high profile prisons such as Gitmo, at least not on the scale you want to think it does. 
  So really, a of you blaming Bush or Obama can do so all you want but it won't change the fact that they know things that 99% of the American people will never know and that is what they base decisions on. ","1433117116"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I feel like I know exactly what happened here. You legitimately freaked her out and she felt her being upset was justified. And then rather than forgiving you and letting it go or talking about it more and then forgiving you and letting it go she just sat on it and nursed her bad dfeelings. Suddenly instead of seeing the good in you, she just saw the bad. She was STILL upset so she didn't hug you. Because she wasn't hugging and allowing herself to feel close to you, she started to feel distant. Which just made it easier to see the bad.

You need to stop apologizing. Your last communication looked pretty good, except the part where you talked about being that pitiful guy in school who it shooting out of his league and how your feelings are hurt. 

All of the good communications have the same key components in common: justified irritation, consequences, and holding her accountable for her actions.

You need to STOP doing nice things for her. Now. Treat her politely, but if she doesn't treat you as more than a roommate, you stop treating her as anything else. Do not rearrange your shifts, do not cut your beard, do not feed her, do not hug her when she comes home. Women (people?) do not respect people who let them walk all over them. I sometimes literally have to TELL my bf to stop doing nice things for me (i say exactly what) if I know I am not appreciating it enough or can feel my emotional reaction is veering towards entitlement rather than gratitude.

This relationship can be saved, but you need to keep those pounds off, show her that you COULD get other women if you wanted, and that you are CHOOSING to be with her because you love her...but you definitely don't love this version of her so maybe you should reconsider. That should be the message you're blaring through your ACTIONS (not words; keep the talking of your feelings to the minimum--she obviously doesn't care, she's past the emotional turning point of empathy with you. You can get back there, but she isn't there now).","1433117117"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","* this does not make their claims about the bible *true*

* this does not make the services they provide helpful (you can build a Catholic hospital in Africa but if you don't promote the proper use of condoms and fail to reduce the spread of HIV, what's the benefit?)
* ""most charitable"" should not be confused with ""most money donated"" since not all the money donated goes to helping people and instead goes to proselytizing, or goes towards housing for church officials, or goes towards paying legal fees, etc
* among nations that have money to donate to causes, Christianity is the dominant belief system - saying ""Christianity is the most charitable organisation"" ignores this fact

&gt; If there are other groups that do more then let's hear about them. 

There are plenty of secular organisations that don't involve themselves in religion in order to do good things. Many of these organisations (either through intent or necessity) keep fairly transparent records on how their money is spent. These organisations are open to members of all religions and beliefs, and tend not to discriminate. Here's [one of many lists of secular organisations](http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Secular_charities).

-The girls don't like it and support each other and wear long skirts out of protest, claiming the school charter does not prohibit it.  
-The school has enough of their disobedience and bans them using the religion aspect to enforce their power.  
It started as teacher vs. student power struggle and then moved to religion and the media jumped on it?   

Having gone to school in Belgium, I have to tell you. Conflict about piercings, dresses, cleavage, showing the bellybutton/shoulders or not and other ridiculous fashion fads are not uncommon.

lets just say your source less comments are true, who cares if it is more pay, and more benefits for less hours. Your screaming ""at least the employers are honest about it"" while we get less and less of the share of the pie. Well fuck man, I would rather you lie to me and pay me 40% more.

This is what I gather after stripping away all the rhetoric about hands up don't shoot and police free zones. 

I'm sorry as hell that more people than not subscribe to the ""they asked for this, reap it"" line of reasoning. I didn't think badly of NYPD as a department until they pulled this slowdown of arrests, nor did I think badly of Baltimore PD until this. Imagine if the fire department stopped enforcing fire codes, and just responded to fires. Or no more preventative medicine in favor of ER only. It's just not an option to do that and maintain a civilized society. 

Innis people would stop saying stuff like reap it. It isn't going to help to rub people's noses in something you think you're right about, especially if people are dying. You risk alienating those you most need to reach.

Sweeteners are available, generally aspartame or saccharine based, in shops.  Stevia based are available from Amazon or Rakuten.

No point in bringing more than one container of peanut butter powder, you can buy it from Amazon. A bit pricey, but available. As far as the bread, you won't be able to bring enough to last you the entire semester, but Lawson's, a local convenience store chain, sells a low-carb bran bread.

As far as restaurants, yakiniku, sushi (order sashimi), gyudon (just don't eat the rice, or order without), ramen (you can order without noodles, tried it this weekend, it's still REALLY good), McD's and other fast food (you can request lettuce instead of bread at most stores), yakitoriya (stick to salt and not tare), steak houses (usually served with rice or corn, just ask them to hold it).

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; So how are you going to reconcile that with disciplining the troops that just won the Eastern front?

I think this is a really poor example because the Soviets had zero problem disciplining their troops with extreme prejudice when they choose to.  Moreover the troops aren't really the authority structure, the party bigwigs were. The party bigwigs got all kinds of perks that would seem to violate the egalitarian principles of the communist state and they usually vanished instead of being publicly disciplined if the higher-ups decided they were out of bounds.  

You're not wrong, I think you just picked a bad example here.","1433117127"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well...cohabitation and premarital sex are not allowed in our brand of Christianity. As you might expect, everyone is in a hurry to get married like there is no tomorrow and; I kid you not, have a horde of children they have not planned for. So, the couple is getting married in a week and decided to organize a small party at church to celebrate...something (I wasn't paying attention). Some people decided to write anonymous tips for them and have a lady read them out loud. We then had the pleasure of listening to a plethora of stupid things such as:

*Be submissive to your husband

*The wife has the responsibility to keep the house clean

*Respect your husband, he needs it more than love

*Love your wife (you expect a reasonable bridegroom to say: I wouldn't be marrying her if I didn't)

*Pray together every morning and every night

*Pray together three times a day

*Last but not least, share the same toothbrush

As I write this, I feel sorry for the woman getting married. She will most likely have to give up her ambitions and dreams to become a breeding machine for that loser. When he acts up, she will have to put up with him no matter what because she needs to be a ""good"" wife , and divorce=hell in her mind; or which is more terrifying, being ostracized by her church and family forever. She will become as spiteful and depressed as my mother while taking care to never let the world know it. After spending her life in a bubble of ignorance and fear, she will die never having known how wonderful it feels to own one's mind. Or maybe I am full of shit and she will let go of that nonsense...I really hope I am. ","1433117128"

"Indiemakeupandmore","t5_2w8pb","I also picked up Vanilla Passion, Vanilla One, Daisy's Blend, and Vanilla Beauty. They are all lovely, but it depends on what type you are looking for. Vanilla Passion and Vanilla Beauty are both much more sugary with the cotton candy, marshmallow fluff, and frosting-type notes. I really like Daisy's Blend and it has vanilla essential oil, but it also leans very sweet with the vanilla marshmallows. It also has a floral touch with the sugared petals addition if you like creamy flowers + dessert vanilla. Vanilla One is the most simple of the bakery vanillas if you are wanting to avoid all the extra nuances. Wild Vanilla is more complicated and is my favorite, closely followed by Daisy's Blend. I haven't tried the one from that collection with bananas yet, which also sounds fun. 

I really enjoyed everything I received and I hope this mini-review helps. For a non-vanilla, Pirate's Punch (unisex summer fragrance) was awesome when I stole a tiny bit from my hubby. I'm actually wanting to order again so I can get some full-size, but also so I can try others. The prices are very reasonable and the owner really goes the extra mile. For example, her samples are 5/8 dram, which is a larger starter size than most other shops. The packaging was really cute and there was candy, too. If you do end up ordering, I'd love to hear what you end up with and what you think! :) ","1433117130"

[Unstuffed Bell Peppers](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/08/unstuffed-bell-peppers/) - I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. And since I was making rice anyway, I didn't add the rice while cooking.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The main event would be the USA fighting a two front war against Russia and China for control of two key geographical spheres,  Eastern Europe and the Pacific. This would involve the U.S. backing their European NATO allies and an (as yet) unofficial alliance of East Asian nations that are already nervous about China's growing power (Japan, the Phillipines, Vietnam). I really don't believe China and Russia want to ""rule the world"", but they want to be the dominate force in their region and we already see they've begun on a path to attempt to roll back Americas dominance and influence in their perspective neighbourhoods. At this point, it seems far fetched that it would come to large scale conflict, but things seem to be lining up that way. China and Russian are large powers that seem to be saying they are ready to challenge the current world order that is completely within the USA's control. The problem is, once the U.S. Is distrCted and can no longer enforce its order at will around the world, all the other simmering conflicts will start to pop off. India vs Pakistan. North vs South Korea. Israel vs Palestine.

Also, if you get on the bandwagon, get actual birks (or a close brand) instead of buying the cheap knockoffs from a place like payless. The payless ones aren't going to be nearly as good for your feet, and since that's a big bonus to birks I feel like it would be kind of a waste.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","My parents don't know about my diagnosis or the extent of my current struggles. My mom is BP1 with borderline features and has never been medicated and has no insight into her illness. She terrorized my childhood. My father was a huge support to me in her post-manic multi-week catatonic depressions. He knew she was ill and we both tried to get her to get help but this made her rage with psychotic delusions. 

Despite his alliance with me, he was also incredibly passive with her mood episodes and I was the one that had to deal with all of the traumatizing confrontational crap and emotional abuse. I suspect (based on some of his other beliefs) his idea of help was therapy and not medicine. I don't think he subscribes to psychiatry. 

While I think he would be sympathetic, I think he would freak out about the drugs and cite natural approaches. I can't tolerate that crap, and I don't want either of us to lose respect for each other. He's a science guy, which makes this all more baffling. 

My pdoc really wants me to talk to my dad about what I'm going through (he agrees talking to my mom is a disaster best avoided; he suggested we slip her some lithium in her coffee,haha) but I'm reluctant. I get support from several close friends, my husband and my mother-in-law; she knows everything and manages not to be intrusive. It hurts me to say this but she is more of a mother to me than mine has ever been. It's the sad truth. 

Sooo, I'm avoiding the discussion with my family. I wouldn't be able to deal with their invalidation, and I'm tired of being the ""adult"" in the family. I don't want to stoke the fire that is my mother.

I suggest giving your father some books. It really helped my husband. I wouldn't be able to talk to him because it would just make me break down into tears. I  also know how hard / irritating it can be to talk about your condition to others. Let your dad know that unless you experience it, you will not be able to understand. You're  only asking for his love and support. Conversely, let him know you appreciate his support but let him know if things feel too intrusive. ","1433117133"

Fucking thousands of them. It's bloody terrifying to observe; you can't even tell they're there until you get close.

Last night the same team I got to the Lighthouse with got absolutely stomped for 3 straight hours. I don't know what changed, but we just couldn't make it to 5 wins. The same thing happened last week after making to the Lighthouse (on my Titan both times). 

I will be giving ToO a break for a couple of weeks now, super frustrated. My point is that if even players like myself (who have had some success in ToO) are going to give it a break for a while, what does that mean for those that haven't been able to muster even 5 wins?

OP's concerns are absolutely valid. ToO, through virtue of its own nature, will be its downfall. Only the very best will stay and eventually they will have very few to play against. I'm not sure if they can fix this one. They'd have to introduce tiered matchmaking - which goes against pairing people based on nconnection. ","1433117136"

"polandball","t5_2sih3","What I am about to say is from personal experience. First generation (adult) immigrants identify mostly with their country of origin and see themselves as outsiders living *in* America, not as Americans themselves. Their native language is obviously Spanish and if my parents are anything to go by, either read, write, &amp; speak English decently (understanding a native speaker talk is quite difficult though) or don't give it much effort and still speak at a basic kindergarten level (badly) even after 20 years (looking at you dad) and instead opt to only speak with other Hispanics. Although to be fair, my dad is ~60 and my mom (women learn languages more easily) is like 15 years younger. Their children on the other hand are raised American (for our intents and purposes, those raised here since early childhood and have lived here all their life are second generation) and speak English as their native language (with a native accent as well) but also Spanish since their parents speak it and force you to learn it. Third generation and beyond are all monolingual English speakers.

From my personal experience, all people raised in the US are fully American and speak English as their native language and tend to have all the subtle behavioral attitudes of Americans as well as being used to American ways of doing things (e.g. units of measurement). To put it simply, everyone raised in the US is  American in basically every single way regardless of whether their parents were. How strongly people identify with their heritage differs on a person by person basis, but no one would consider themselves ""not American."" For some context, I was raised in Eastern Orlando, FL and my schools were always 40-60% of Hispanic descent. Me, along with the other Hispanic children, were all raised in the US since birth or early childhood. No one spoke Spanish, no one...ever. Not the Hispanic teachers, not the Hispanic children.

Use the shuttles when available (trust me it's as hard for an uber to get you to and from the convention centre as it is for a shuttle that's free).

&gt;What benefit would there be to cover-up a flat Earth? or that we don't rotate? There's nearly no motive that could explain it.

You should not reject a physical truth about the world because of the how and why of the coverup required.  The physical evidence is extremely strong.  Examine all of the physical evidence first, then worry about the how and why of the coverup afterwards.

&gt;""The Moon Landing Argument"" of that this footage was doctored in some way. While there isn't many arguments on why people would cover-up a flat Earth, there are reasons why people would want to convince others that we live on a flat Earth.

Yes, no single video should be taken as proof of anything.  The evidence does not end here though.

&gt;The balloon wasn't high enough to see the curvature of the Earth. It really didn't seem too high to the point that you could see it.

For a sphere of circumference 25000 miles (what we are told) the formula for curvature is 8 inches * (distance in miles^2).  For example, if you are standing on the earth and look at something 50 miles away it should be 1666 feet below the horizon.  But this doesn't happen.  Lighthouses would not work if the earth was a sphere.

If you are willing to look further, there are a lot of proofs.  This video is a good start:  https://youtu.be/kFjG4jpUhQI","1433117138"

Click on the 'delete' option above under the title to remove this before submitting again.

The tags: *indie*, *alternative*, *mashup*, *cover*, *remix*, *experimental*, or *instrumental* on their own are not good enough. If you only used one of these tags, that is the reason for removal. Please add a more descriptive tag to your title that tells us something about the sound of the band.

For example: rock, folk, blues, jazz, electronic, hip-hop, world, punk, metal, soul

Tags like [instrumental piano], [electro remix], [experimental jazz], and [indie rock] work just fine.

If you *did* include a valid tag beyond the generic indie/alternative, then you are using a tag we don't recognize yet.

"indieheads","t5_2zj24","I'd definitely recommend having two guitar players though.  At first it will be fine, but later on, you will really need two guitars to make songs come together.  Anyway:

The White Stripes are very easy.  For example, Fell In Love With a Girl only requires five chords and the chorus is the same as the verse except the first chord is an F# instead of a B.

A-Punk by Vampire Weekend would be a fun song for you guys to play.  There's plenty of good tabs on the internet for it, and you'll have exactly what you need to play it(guitar, bass, drums, singer).

The Killers fit your composition as well.  Mr. Brightside isn't difficult if your guitar player has a bit of experience playing guitar.  Even if he/she hasn't, the intro isn't hard to learn.

The Strokes don't have many difficult songs, but you'll definitely want two guitars.  Someday doesn't sound right with chords, it really needs the chiming of the other guitar.  The same goes for just about any rock 'n' roll song.

The biggest thing is finding songs you all like and want to play.  I really, really think you should have your vocalist learn guitar chords, it will sound so much better.  Feel free to ask more questions.","1433117143"

How did you feel and react to finding out your sentence on being sent to prison? How was it when you first arrived, and also when you were about to be released?

Do you think there could be any simple improvements to the system? Did prison work for *you*?

Is our prison and gaol system good, working just about, or failing our population both in and outside of bars?

You've created a false dichotomy that doesn't exist. The majority view is that the Bible has literal and figurative elements. How much of either is unknown but as science proves one thing or another, Catholicism ""evolves"" to align their views.

Yes, maybe something believed today will be proven wrong tomorrow, but that's really no different for a nonreligious person,  i. e. the age of the earth or universe proven wrong. 

Of course there are certain aspects that will not change much for Catholicism, like believing in God, but science has nothing to say about a god and that's the foundation for the religion. While the age of the earth is of minor importance to Catholics, so they might be more willing to budge on that belief, the belief in God and Heaven are non negotiable","1433117144"

"Fibromyalgia","t5_2qwut","Honestly, I *hate* explaining it. I prefer not to if I can get away with it. It took me a long time to accept my limits personally and even longer to admit them to others. I work at a music venue where sometimes heavy things need moved like flight cases or crates of beer. I used to just move them when asked because it avoided a discussion about why a man in his 30s couldn't do it. Now, I'm simply honest and say I can't. I still hate the discussion where I have to go into the whole explanation of what's wrong with me and how it affects me, but sometimes it's necessary. It's worse when people there ask me to do stuff that's outside my limits and they think I'm just lying to them that I can't do this stuff because of my illness. After all, they see me in the venue day after day, appearing happy and normal and they want to know why I can't travel 20 miles to some event they're having. I just explain and hope they understand. I know that some people *still* think I'm making this shit up, but I can't waste a single moment worrying about those people. Some people think I should just ""buck up and get on with it"", some think I'm full of shit, but, thankfully, some of them understand and are sympathetic. Life ain't easy when you're young and appear healthy, but you have real limitations like ours, but we get through it because we have to. Good luck with wherever life takes you, but just remember to never let it take you somewhere you don't want to be simply because you don't want to express what fibro does to you.","1433117144"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I do.  Work with a  teacher.  That's what I was told and it made a big difference. 

There are many types of meditation.  Some for focusing the mind while sitting, some walking, and countless others.  What I studied most is called Vipassana Bhavana.  Vipassana means to see clearly (to see things as they really are), Bhavana means cultivation.    

Mindfulness Meditation is another similar form that  has gone mainstream through the acceptance and promotion of many health care professionals here in the US.  There are many  books and tapes on this but I haven't looked into them.  Mindfulness meditation is a trimmed down version of vipasanna but without heavy contemplation of the Buddhist Dhamma (anicca-dukkha-anatta or impermanence, suffering, no self) intrinsic to Buddhism.  

The biggest pieces of advice I  can offer are ...

Go into it with an open mind.

Forget about a destination, there is none.  As soon as we start grasping for something we miss the point of practice.

Practice, practice, practice even when you don't want to and there will come a time that you do not want to.

As for teachers.  There are a number of ways to go.  

1. There are online courses that are definately worthwhile.  Most will give you instructions and assign a teacher to work with you by email or other means.  

2. There are retreats you can attend.  Some are short (2-3 days), some are long (10 or more days). Almost all of them are free (beware of those that aren't).  They will feed you, lodge you and instruct you.  At the close you have the opportunity to donate to the organization that will use it for the next retreat.  You're paying it forward so to speak.

3. There are more informal classes through community centers in most cities.  I don't know what the level of instruction is or the qualifications of the teachers but I imagine you'll find some good ones and some not so good ones.

If you're interested in the actual Buddhist aspects (keeping in mind there are two basic schools (Theravada and Mahayana) and many different sects within each) I'd suggest downloading a copy of The Teachings of Ajahn Chah.  He founded a well known temple in Thailand and taught forest tradition practice.  Awesome man.  You can down load the book for free in a number of places.  Google will get you there.  It's definately a worthwhile read and enjoyable too.  He had a sense of kindness equal only to his sense of humor.  Neither were lacking.  He has been very influential to many westerners over the years, Buddhists and non Buddhists alike.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Go get some legacy prime lenses! The beauty of mirrorless cameras is that you can adapt pretty much all legacy SLR lenses to it without any optical corrections. Those legacy lenses and adapters are dirt cheap (well, not insanely cheap anymore since everyone with a mirrorless camera is buying them, but still inexpensive), for example, most 50mm f/1.4~f/1.8 primes can be had between $30~$60 and probably even less if you know where to look. Some of these are fairly sharp even when wide open like the Canon FD 50mm f/1.4 S.S.C. or the Olympus OM Zuiko 50mm f/1.8. There are also many legacy 135mm f/2.8~3.5's to choose from which you can use as inexpensive portrait lenses. You will need to focus manually with those lenses, but a6000's focus peaking and magnification features make it pretty easy to nail focus accurately and quickly.","1433117148"

Well. It comes down to what you prefer- if you'd like a happy, optimistic fantasy world, go with 9- but if you don't mind some cyberpunk elements, Final Fantasy 7's easily the best one to jump in with. Give the graphics a chance for an hour or so- they cease being an issue fairly quickly. 

I'd advise against any of the pre-PlayStation games (1-6). I've been playing them through again lately- they just haven't held up anything like as well as 7 and 9 (or even 8, at a push). If you must play them, 5's mobile port is superb- and a lot of fun (though light on plot). Avoid 6's mobile port like the plague- it revamps the graphical style in an absolutely terrible way that alters the tone of the game, and doesn't really add much in the way of substantive enhancements. See if you can play the SNES original instead. 

6's characters and atmosphere are impressive for the SNES, but 7 blows them away in every way possible- and Chrono Trigger's a much better put together game than 6, if you must go with something from that generation. ","1433117149"

If the cellphone bill is 60+ or more, call them and get it down. Or sell it and get a cheaper one. Life can go on without a fancy 800$ phone, you can buy a phone at walmart for 50$ and buy 10$ prepaid cards . How much are you spending on food? Average is about 300$ biweekly , once again I need a better breakdown.

"androidcirclejerk","t5_2shqy","I've always avoided /r/AndroidMasterRace because of their seriousness regarding ""Android's objective superiority over iOS"", but holy shit, this recent debacle really takes the cake. I'm not saying that everybody on /r/AndroidMasterRace brigaded /r/iOSMasterRace, because I know that's not true, but the elitism and fanboy-ism is definitely prevalent in most of the posters there.

When /u/Darthcow posted [a post telling AMR subscribers not to brigade](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AndroidMasterRace/comments/360myz/dont_brigade_riosmasterrace_guys/), I felt that that would be a turning point for AMR. The commenters seemed much more mature than I expected. However, when I saw the post about the brigade on /r/androidcirclejerk and /r/SubredditDrama, along with the people defending it on AMR, I once again became very disappointed in AMR.

After reading about the ""No peasantry week"" that is starting tomorrow, I feel that AMR really is taking a huge step forward in making it a better place. I still think that it will take a long time before it becomes a more mature place, but it is getting there. Even having a sticky telling people not to be hypocritical fanboys would probably help.

Regarding the other circlejerk subreddits, ever since /r/iOSMasterRace and /r/WinPhoneCirclejerk has been brought to light in /r/androidcirclejerk, I was stoked that we could have a ""rival subreddit"". It made the experience much more interesting and funnier. Especially when we had representatives from these subreddits post on this subreddit. In the end, we're all just trying to have fun here, and where's the fun when it's just one person (figuratively)? As a known heretic once said;

&gt;""every hero needs a villain""

\- Koush, #1 heretic

---

In summary, AMR really needs to grow up. I think the mods there should remove posts that even subtly encourage downvote brigading, like the mods on /r/androidcirclejerk. I hope these ""rival subreddits"" really grow so that they are less vunerable to downvote brigades.

EDIT: If this is not the correct place to post this comment on, let me know and I will remove this to post it on the other thread.

I'm not so sure about the quality of the Zotac card, but I don't have much experience with their products. I would suggest going with EVGA or Gigabyte. You may even want to look into getting a mini ITX card, but those are generally not as good.

If you're gaming at 1080p (without many plans for future upgrade) then I would stick with the 970. My 960 runs modern games like Witcher 3 and GTA V at 40+ fps ultra, so a 980 would be a tad overkill. One thing to consider, however, is that you're coming from a 280 so the performance increase is going to be reasonable noticeable but not worth spending nearly $400 on a new graphics card. If you're set on upgrading it, go for a 980, but also look into getting a higher resolution monitor.","1433117153"

Don't underestimates sumos in the twisties. The narrower the road, the more advantages a sumo has. A sportbike is only better in wider sweepers where you can carry more speed, but then you are already in illegal territory on the street.

Overall the sumo would be the obvious choice for me. It's a far more versatile type of bike and definitively more fun at road legal speeds. A sport bike would be better if you plan on doing a lot of higher speed distance riding, since then the wind protection and possibly more comfortable seat will matter.","1433117154"

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","While you are most likely correct they are using the username as the primary key, I don't think this is the reason why we can't change names. As a developer myself with pretty extensive DBA experience under his belt, I know for a fact all they would need to do is add in a new field and call it something like DisplayName, so if the primary key is in-fact the current username, it remains unchanged and whenever a players name is displayed it simply uses the DisplayName field instead. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best ones.

Presumably when you see a users name it is doing some kind of SQL query or whatever to get the usernames name, they just need to query by the ID and pull out the new DisplayName field and use that for the display value instead.

I am not sure if you have used Steam before on PC, but they let you change your name as many times you as you want. A full history of your username changes are visible, you leave an audit trail every time you change your name. Sony can do this, they just don't want too.","1433117157"

Clayton C. Anderson, US Astronaut, Retired

Good question, simple answer!  The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP.  While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of ""seeing"" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement.  Over time, astronauts download the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer.  This onboard/zero-gravity data is compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight.  The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit.  (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days).  This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space.  For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc.  Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.

Other watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).

"spacex","t5_2srow","&gt; The 4800kg figure is expendable v1.1

Incorrect;

&gt;SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell says Falcon 9's reusability is already designed into the rocket's first stage, including the weight of the landing legs that would otherwise detract from the rocket's performance. She also said Falcon 9 retains 30% performance margin over the company's advertised mass-to-orbit capability of 4,850 kg to GTO – margin SpaceX is using to conduct operational trials of a reusable Falcon 9 first stage.

[Source.](http://aviationweek.com/blog/nasa-cnes-warn-spacex-challenges-flying-reusable-falcon-9-rocket)

It is all a bit confusing so it very possible that the 4850kg figure advertised is indeed in reality for reusable, but including the future upgrades (ie v1.2). Just so that it is clear; i think that it is *unlikely* that SES-9 will have legs but what you originally linked does not explicitly says that it won't. There is no direct proof of that, just us assuming. So if i was betting, i would be betting against the side i am really on, while hoping for legs of course.","1433117159"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","They shook me to my core as a kid. I was born and raised in Maine, not a lot of diversity there in the 70s and 80s. I was young but curious, and they blew me away. 

I had *no clue* what people of color went through in America. I had never met a black person. I, like many of my young friends, simply assumed that everyone was equal now, because of the civil rights movement. 

I had loved the Beastie Boys and was exploring rap when 'Straight Outta Compton' hit, their frustration and rage was palpable, and their message was clear. I was in love.

That their film is coming out now, during a 'Black Spring' makes my heart sing. 

Though I am cynical, I do not believe that the reactions to the murders of innocent black men could have been predicted- so while my jaded heart says that Hollywood is cashing in, they couldn't have known that *this* was going to happen.

I was a skinny, awkward, white Native kid. My skin too pale for the rez, my insides too red for the outside world. N.W.A opened my eyes to the inherent racism in the ""system"" and led me to read 'The Autobiography of Malcom X' (As told to Alex Haley) and to keep reading, to keep seeing and to raise my voice.

Did they have a ""philosophy""? Fuck yeah they did. They wanted to tell the world what they experienced, day in and day out. They made sure a skinny, awkward kid in Maine knew that questioning authority was not only a good thing, it was a *necessary* thing. 

The OP's dismissive tone rankled me, for too long people have dismissed black voices crying out about oppression and their lives in White America. My whole life, people have poo-pooed Black Americans who spoke out about laws applying to them differently, and ""Driving While Black"". Now, in the days of smartphones and video instantly uploaded, we are catching more and more authority figures with their pants down and lies in their mouths.

How much longer will people dismiss people shouting the truth?

The OP may not have liked their tone, attitudes or message, but to dismiss their entire message and philosophy and claim it was a grab for money really stuck in my craw.

 The Earth belongs to all and all share in the responsibility of caring for it. Land divides only exist on maps, my friend. 

That being said, yes, some land was taken much less ethically than others. But, it wasn't stolen. It has never BELONGED to any race of humans. By  continuing to state that the land has been 'stolen', your shaming any white descendants that clearly had NOTHING to do with what went down hundreds of years ago and that's fair to no one. Do you think that American Indians like to continually be portrayed as victims? No. We don't. We were and are a strong people, and that view point is boarder line insulting. It's like continually reminding a rape victim's grand-daughter of the indignities that her Grandmother suffered.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","You're really overselling the Bills playoff hopes last year by saying that they were only eliminated on tiebreakers. It completely ignores the context of the AFC playoff race.

The week 11 match-up between the Bills and Dolphins was understood to effectively be an elimination game for the loser. After the week 11 loss, their playoff hopes dwindled significantly. The unexpected victory over Green Bay rekindled them, but they followed that up the next week with a narrow loss to the then 2-12 Oakland Raiders--sealing their playoff hopes. They finished at 9-7 after getting a gimme win in week 17 against the Patriots who had already secured the first round bye.

All that said, I agree that the Bills have talent, but the problem with the team is where they lack talent. Nobody is questioning their defense, but their offense is still a major question mark. They have a strong group of running backs, but unless they've got a very good offensive line (see: 2010 Jets) or a very good quarterback (see: 2013-present Seahawks) to compliment LeSean McCoy, I'm not convinced that any amount of talent elsewhere on the roster is going to make up for the weakness.","1433117164"

Although Mass Effect is my favorite game series (and maybe favorite fictional world in general) I didn't get ME3 until a few months after it came out (wasn't available where I was living at the time) so I wasn't expecting much from the ending and didn't leave too disappointed. The thing that really got on my nerves about ME3 though is that it felt like you had way less dialogue with your teammates. After each mission in ME1 and ME2 you could come back and talk it over with your crew, ME3 you'd walk up to them and they'd just say something to your character but there wouldn't be any conversation. I noticed they did a lot of that in Inquisition as well, I'm hoping it's not a trend when it comes to Mass Effect 4.

If there's one lesson to be learned from the Witcher 3 it's how to do fuckin side quests. I'm hoping we see some deeper stuff in ME4 compared to Inquisition.  ","1433117168"

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","Yeah, but ""MMO"" just means lots of players - it'd be a mistake to automatically assume that guilds need to be part of it. I suppose it could be considered a failure of communication if the initial pitch did not make it clear enough, although I keep reading ""friends"" on the kickstarter, which is different from guilds.

I certainly agree about it being difficult to cater to both groups. Unfortunately, a side effect of guilds in games such as these is that sooner or later they try to affect the world they exist in, both in a way that is often irreconcilable with the setting and that irrevocably interferes with single players' experience in a way that leaves them unable to do anything other than either submitting to their demands or trying to find ""unclaimed"" areas (of course it is just a matter of time until those would be claimed as well).

In my opinion, the only kind of game where single players and proper guilds can truly exist side by side needs to be designed for and around it from the start, meaning a greater resistance by the game world against guilds stepping over the line and messing with factions that, for all intents and purposes, have much greater resources and assets than one or two dozen pilots.

It's not impossible, just ... very hard to do, and it'd require a lot of mechanics (and thus developer resources) designed specifically for the preservation of this balance between both types of players.","1433117173"

That sounds crazy, but no matter how you slice reality, a cat doesn't go back to being alive, and this can be confirmed through experiment in that cats don't remember being dead. Quantum mechanics is merely another way of describing reality. So, since it matters not what the reality is, if QM says X occurs on observation of vector state *n*, then the vector state should be confirmable even without ""observer"".

The Schrodinger's Cats paradox clearly illustrates that a vector state is independent of an observer. Another practical application of superpositions and the observation principle is that the cloud having created a vector state 5 seconds after the Big Bang would require an observer...

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","Train conductor, grew up in Texas on the Louisiana border. Don't really know much about his younger life, as he didn't talk too much about it. He was full of tidbits of advice and wisdom. Loved photography, pancakes and spicy food. He came to every single one of my dance performances or other functions. He lived about 6 hours away from me. But he would drive from Tyler, TX to Denton, TX at least two weeks out of the month to just hang out with me. Bring me stuffed animals, chocolate and we'd go fly kites or do whatever the hell I wanted to do. Grandpa was my best friend growing up and when I was a teenager, he took the time to listen to my view on life, even if he didn't agree with it. He accepted me for who I was, just as I was. Never let a day go by without telling me how proud he was of me and how he wanted me to follow my dreams, no matter what they were. No matter how unobtainable or silly the dream, follow it. Also a great dancer, he'd slow dance with me to Bing Crosby's ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart"" and sing it to me while dancing. Very positive influence in my life and I'm sorry that he is gone. Died from renal failure. Was adamant that I was to never see him in the hospital, to remember him as he was so I never got to fully say goodbye.

Some of my favorite youtubers include:

For humor: Byze, KYR SP33DY, Benvelope.

For entertainment: Therussianbadger (currently my favorite)

Slow and hard or fast and hard.  Not gentle, I enjoy gentle sometimes but it's not enough stimulation to make me O.


I like him to continue but often push him out involuntarily when I cum, unless I am on top, and even on top I usually jump off and we have to start again.  It's very intense.  But if he can keep going, often the pleasure gets magnified and I get many orgasms and that is amazing.","1433117179"

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Might get downvoted but this is what I think. 

I'm not working with Amway, but I was just short of a year. I love the products Amway makes and think it works great and great alternative compared to other name brand products. Nothing but good experience from them. 

Amway is just another business along with Isagenix, Cutco, etc..  These business is part of a different business model that not many people know much about and take short time looking into. In a way, they are just like any other businesses in my opinion. 

In my opinion, they aren't scams, at least Isagenix and Amway in my opinion. They are legitimate and legal to the extent of my knowledge. A lot of people think they are scams because they buy stuff, lose money and don't go anywhere. Well that's what's going to happen if someone doesn't have the work ethic, belief, or ambition to work their hardest. If someone truly works their hardest, learn, grow, and doesn't give up, they can and will succeed even if it's in a year or 10 years. 

One reason that a lot of people fail to strive is because of negativity and lack of support. Saying ""it's a scam"" or ""you're wasting your time and money"" isn't going to do any good so why say it. If you disagree, still give support and positive choice of words because in the long run, it will help and might help them push for success. Should be like that in any situation to an extent. 

If you have questions, don't ask her. Ask her mentor who had more knowledge. Why? Because let's say your have something wrong with your car and she/he just got a job a dealership with minimal experience. It's common sense to ask the mechanic teacher her instead of asking her to find out what's wrong with your car. 

That's all I have to say, my opinion and not a debate/argument. Therefore if anybody does reply to this, please choose your choice of words and be respectful because I'm not here to be against anybody. ","1433117179"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","I browse here for a few reasons but mainly for the occasional great picture that slips through the cracks. I know it's popular to say this sub is a circlejerk at times but there's a good reason: it is. Is this the fault of the mods? Not entirely. The attitude amongst the majority of posters seems very self entitled, as in if you disagree or even try to bring up an alternate view, even one you don't agree with, you'll get downvoted and labelled a troll. One thing that sticks out for me was Joe Hockey's cigar pic. It was instantly labelled as some kind of Bond villain puffing away after sending a few dozen minions through a trap door. I don't agree with the government but I was able to look past the politics and see that picture as a guy relaxing after working his arse off and not seeing his family for however long. Sure, the thing he was working on fucked a lot of people etc but through all that he's still a person that got snapped in the same way celebrities do. I tried pointing out that everyone deserves some privacy but of course because it was Hockey I was downvoted. Really? I question a lot of things including Kochie having a go at the organ donation thing but on that day Kochie was an absolute hero, like I think I was the only person to think there may be something else behind it. Everyone else blindly followed. Yet if it were Tony Abbott saying the same thing it'd be questioned mercilessly and derided as nothing more than a stunt. TV and politics aren't too different, you know. I often get attitude because I post on CJA, too. Why? Does it bother someone so much that another person takes their stupid non constructive posts elsewhere? Would they rather those shitposts end up in here? It's really weird. I don't really have much opinion about the mods in here except they seem to be on stuff rather quickly. /u/dredd is touted as a tyrant by some but to me he seems like a teacher in their 30th year who has seen it all and is just sick of bullshit, waiting for the home time bell which never comes.

You think on a public road you are flying, but when you are on a track with nothing else to pay attention to but your riding, all of a sudden 100mph feels slow, and you are hanging off the bike even more then you ever though possible. 

You WILL drag your pegs, so dont be spooked by it. You will have to learn to ride the bike in a more ""sit up and beg"" riding style as the low pegs, and high bars make ""kissing the mirror"" a hard thing to do. 

I have tracked my 650 Bandit, and I race a 400 Bandit both standard bikes with standard pegs, you just need to get more than 1/2 an ass cheek off when you are cornering. 

As for prep...

At LEAST safety wire your drain plug.

Tape your lights over with painters tape, then duct tape (less of a mess when you are done to take off)

yank all your mirrors off

I would flush your brake fluid for fresh DOT4 stuff.

Make sure you have at least 75% ware left on your tires

make sure your fork seals arnt leaking

Most importantly have fun, on your bike you wont be running superbike times, but you will still get up to pretty quick speeds. Don't get carried away with trying to ""keep up"" with someone who passes you, work on braking/lines/throttle control.

As a racer/TD instructor the biggest thing I can tell you is--- Work on CONSTANT throttle. Its not an on/off switch. That is how you keep/maintain corner speed which will drop your lap times fast. ","1433117183"

The other, unsaid, implication here is that you have to eat healthy to not be fat, no, all you have to do is not eat thousands and thousands of calories a day. ""Healthy"" food is always great to have, but you don't have to eat healthy just to not be a waddling sack, all you have to do is eat less.

"bravefrontier","t5_2zich","You are misinterpreting what I am saying. When I talking about the Diminishing atk, I was talking about the boost relative to the sphere. At 100, the Sphere boosts 75%. Quaids SBB total would be 495%. This results in a 17.85% increase in damage. Now lets say Quaid is at 90%. Quaids SBB total would be 510% due to extra skill. This now results in a 17.24% damage increase. Its not a small drop but it still exists. This continues to 50% HP where it then becomes a 0% damage increase.

The problem with saying that Quaid synergizes with this sphere better then others is that his ES still works regardless of sphere equipped. It is kinda hard to see but Quaid does not benefit from this sphere anymore then any other unit. If you start to think about it, it will start to make sense.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Given that the comments noted were borne out of a G7 meeting, I think it's a bit of a quick judgement to condemn the US for ""one-sided"" pressure. No representative from Greece would have been at the meeting, and Canada, the US, and Japan would have only the other EU members to speak to. Since the topic of international business and finance is certainly one of the top concerns of the G7 (and four of the members are EU states), it makes sense that the issue of Greece's financial instability would be a forefront topic of the meeting since further destabilization could have significant impact on all of the G7 economies.

If, as you suggest, the US were to step in and offer bailout plans to Greece, that would be a direct indictment of EU governance and a serious insult to all her members. I do not think that would pass lightly.

The EU should find a solution to Greece's economic issues, and the US should not interfere. But the US should certainly be free to speak to the urgency of action and the global impact of failing to act.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","I don't know. I like to win, I play to win, when I win I enjoy it when I lose it makes me want to win more.

I play about 3 games of deathmatch before I play competetive, and I usually come in first in at least one of them. Not always, but I will at least usually make top 3 in one of them, and if I don't place in any of them I may play another, I might decide I'm off, or maybe the people I'm playing with are just that much better, but I want to win. I am driven to win.

So you play to get better, wouldn't trying to win be the same thing? If you aren't trying to win then how would you get better? Are you getting better without trying to win?

So I play normal deathmatch with 10-15 minute rounds, and I maybe win one or two, which makes me feel better, more confidant in my play, and then I go to competetive and I do my best.

I asked a legitimate question, these small victories do feel nice, and I wonder why you wouldn't want them. Okay, they feel like a 'gold star for spelling dog' but the first time you spelled dog you damn well felt you deserved that golden star. That golden star was an accomplishment.

Sure, you don't feel anything from a deathmatch win, and I don't understand that. Even if I win all the death matches I play in a day every day for a week, which honestly has happened, they all still feel good, they're motivation to do the next one.

I don't know, I just feel like deathmatch is more of my personal skill, I win it by myself, there are no team mates that suck causing me to lose, if I lose it's because I wasn't good enough plain and simple. Hackers don't have the same advantages in DM as competetive, a single player can't do as much damage in deathmatch. In deathmatch someone can be 30 and 1 and you can still beat them.

I don't know, this is just a long post saying that if you aren't playing to win, I don't understand why you're playing in the first place.","1433117189"

"Spiderman","t5_2rw42","I feel like this needs to be said, because some newer fans seem to lack some knowledge on the history of Peter Parker (mostly because of the bullshit DBS keeps spouting.) People seriously need to quit acting like Marvel is going the Ultimate route. Casting young isn't a Ultimate idea, alright? Peter Parker was 15 years old in the 616 universe. Everytime somebody says casting young is an Ultimate idea they just look like uneducated Spider-Man fans. Literally everybody who jumps to this conclusion is under twenty. I'm under twenty and even I know the history of Spider-Man. If you guys (which I'm sure many of you have) have been following Spidey comics in the last decade, you'll see a general consensus that the Ultimate line was great, but it lacked the great villains of 616 Spidey. Many people quit reading because the villains just weren't as interesting/menacing as their 616 counterparts. By the way, the ENTIRE idea of watching Peter grow up and GROW into an Avenger is a strictly 616 idea. Realize that they will use elements from BOTH canons and other lesser-known ones. As for the Goblin idea; I agree. In fact, most Ultimate-readers agree that Miles is a more enjoyable character than Ultimate Peter, but they also agree that 616 Peter is more enjoyable than both because he's got this certain charisma, charm, and history that neither can compete with.
/u/realpunyparker Shut the fuck up. Once again, I never said I hate Ultimate, you fucking hypocrite. It's ridiculous to think they'll focus primarily on the Ultimate when nobody is asling for it. For fuck's sake, people don't even want a highschool Peter anymore, they want college Peter. Stop acting like you're my father, alright? You being older and still using reddit constantly (as you are) and obsessing over Dylan is creepy as hell.
/u/Redgohan147 I am simply stating that a faithful Ultimate adaptation is out of the picture. Also, planning doesn't matter, his plan never came into fruition. Therefore it is strictly 616. I doubt he'll he in highschool for more than two solo films, so he'll also be growing older quickly. /u/justmespidey www.viewcomic.com have fun man, you'll enjoy it.","1433117193"

* His current .173 ISO is near his '12 career high of .174, set in Coors. Let's tentatively mark him similarly for a dozen HRs full season then.  
* His career high in SBs was 27 and not 19. He may be getting the green light on the base paths more often but that doesn't make him a *good* base stealer. The break even point is 75% for successful SBs. Fowler's at 73%, so around there. If we extrapolate to his career high in PA's, that puts him at exactly 30 SBs. And that's if he maintains his current, career high pace. BsR (Base Running Runs Above Average) is a metric that includes SBs, CS, and taking extra bases. It's a pretty all-encompassing measure of value on the base paths. Fowler's only on pace for 3 BsR. He's already had four seasons above that.  
* His current BABIP is 57 points lower than his career mark so we should expect a huge increase in his BA, right? Not quite. Last season took a .351 BABIP to put up a .276 BA, both near his career marks. His increase in IFFB% and FB% will also hurt his BABIP. I'm comfortable pegging him at ~.255 BA, tops, rest of season. See my next point about LD% and Hard% for why.  
* That his LD% and Hard% are below his career norms hurts, not helps, your point about BABIP. Shitty contact leads to shitty BABIP. Those percentages are descriptive, not predictive, so it's not like he's due for regression. This is very important. His HR/FB%, on the other hand, is now 3.8% higher than his career mark. That looks fluky, which will hurt his already fluky ISO.  
* His BA/OBP/SLG/wOBA/RC+ are all below his career average. He's always had a good walk rate, so we can expect his BB% to rise by a couple percentage points and his OBP to rise by at least 30 points. It'd be higher if he was making better contact and helping his BA. He has significantly more value in an OBP league than a BA league.

So add that all up and what do we get? The same old Dexter Fowler. Couple more steals. Worse BA and OBP. The usual ""can't predict R/RBI"" caveats apply blah blah blah.","1433117195"

Also you have to realize that Lebron has ONE very bad side effect to being on any team, and that is no matter what, the media will tell you all about how he's the only one doing anything and attack the coach constantly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Claiming it's a lack of bipartisanship shows a real lack of understanding of the problem. Think of it like this: 

You and a partner are given 5 dollars every week -- collected from your coworkers -- for the shared company candy box. In the past you've been able to work with your opposite number, and while you liked different things (you like chocolate, he likes hard candy), you've always been able to come to some kind of consensus (you pick first and third weeks, he gets second and fourth, and fifth weeks are always Werther's butterscotch).

Now, say one of the owners of the company starts whispering in your partner's ear, saying how hard candy is way better, and he should forgo the deal you once had to lobby harder for hard candy. He starts offering your partner $5 every time he gets hard candy into the box. Your partner become less and less willing to compromise because he has a financial incentive to do otherwise.

Now that the boss has stacked the box, he drains it. To keep it all for himself, he starts using his financial leverage over your partner to fill the bowl with pebbles. The boss starts pocketing the money from your coworkers and your partner's requests grow more and more out of line with reason or logic.

This is what's happened to the GOP in the last 40 years. There was a New Deal consensus after WWII that led to years of unparalleled prosperity because wealth was widely distributed. Since Reagan, however, large groups with significant financial resources have consistently used their leverage to destroy the New Deal consensus and pull the GOP further and further to the right. What you have now is one party interested in governing (whether you agree with their policies or not), and another party that has become so extreme that working together with them would be a betrayal of the American people.

You throw out the special, and she's bought a wedding ring for the next full second and a half.  If you know anything about it's range, it's very easy to park yourself at the very end of the spin and put your weapon directly into Cass's poor, grinning face as hard as you'd like and there's not much she can do about it.  It's weaker than lance charges in that way, since it moves more slowly, which means if Cass happens to miss, the opponent gets more time to position.  
Similar to lance charges and that fast rolling-slash thing that sword-people use, it's just something that's gotta be learned and accounted for.

Nobody expected Parise, Kovalchuk, and Clarkson to be gone in successive seasons and there's no way to plan for it. Although the future isn't as bleak as it once seemed. We've been building from the back and our defense with Merrill, Larsson, Severson, and Gelinas is oozing with potential. Not to mention some of the guys we have coming through the pipes. 

This draft in my opinion is going to determine the direction of our rebuild, we have 3 picks inside the top 45 and a lot of young defensemen that can be worth something. I anticipate that one of Merrill or Gelinas will be moved for a young forward and at least 2 of the 3 picks we have in the top 45 will be used on forwards.

Lasers operate under a very strict set of rules.  Not all materials are viable as laser gain media, and those that are viable, are still restricted in wavelength (color) by the emission spectra of the medium.  Some wavelengths, such as ultraviolet, generally need to use exotic gain media called exciplexes that don't even exist outside of high energy states. 

The more detailed workings are beyond the scope of anything I can put to print, here.  However it should suffice to say that if there is a laser color you are not readily familiar with, it's not for lack of trying. 

TL;DR -  Lasers are NOT simple focused light.  You can't see it, but lasers light is very special, and creating new colors is not trivial.","1433117205"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","Here are my suggestions... I've been a little brutal and too prescriptive, but hopefully it'll help you more than if I was less critical.

1. Answer the details questions truthfully - I can't tell whether you're being serious about some of them: e.g. 'dropped out of space camp' and 'body type: used up' are probably joke answers, but are 'seeing someone' and 'does drugs sometimes' joke answers or serious - I can't tell. Single women will see that you're seeing someone already, and that'll be an immediate ""no"". 

2. Your self summary needs improving. I don't want to know the things you don't do; tell me the things that you do do. There's no mention of your hobbies and interests in the profile, so put them there instead. You mention you like intelligent conversation; maybe include a few subjects that interest you (e.g. philosophy, politics, science) - it may help spark a conversation.

3. Typical Friday Night section is really dull. You mentioned your work already in What Am I Doing, so no need to repeat. If you work every Friday evening, say something like ""I work Friday nights, but at the weekend I &lt;do something interesting&gt;"".

4. 'I am also a part-time psychopath, sell doomsday devices to communist and fascist countries' is not true (I hope) and not funny. It also hides the 'trying to write a book' part, which could be quite interesting. I would remove the first part, and elaborate on the book-writing: that sounds quite interesting!","1433117205"

I am not sure if that is the right word, perhaps a better description is that when I put on make up it almost looks like my face is drier, and it makes my pores stand out more and also sometimes highlights creases in my face.

My skin is pretty pale and is hard to blend in general.  It is not so much the skin on my neck that doesn't match, but when I am wearing a v-neck or other shirt where my collarbone / tops of breasts area is exposed, that area is extremely pale and almost sickly looking to match to my face.  I have been using revlon photoready perfecting primer (001), and then covergirl's clean oil liquid makeup in ivory (505).  I like this liquid makeup better than what I was using before (neutrogena ivory powder - too orange looking for me), but I'm just not sure I'm doing things right.  I apply the liquid make up with a brush and blend it all over my face.  

Previous to switching foundations I had experimented with wet n wild's reserve your cabana bronzer for contouring (another story...), and recently I have tried dusting my face with it after putting on the liquid foundation.  It does look a little better but I am still not confident.  The biggest area is my nose and my cupids bow, they look awfully dry after applying my makeup.

I am so new to make up, I have really never done any of it before.  Any help would be appreciated.  Also, I am interested in finding more pale youtube gurus if anyone has suggestions; I am pale with brown eyes, dark brown hair and thicker eyebrows.","1433117206"

I'm a tad late but I'd be intrigued of your answer as to the difference between Canada and the US?

In Canada, we are bombarded with commentators criticizing the US for many things, yet I feel as in Canada free speech exists only insofar as you support the popular narrative (feminism, left wing, gay rights, text).  I am pro gay rights and such, as a libertarian, but I have colleagues basically deemed terrorists for expressing any view contrary to the norm.

I am wondering, do you have any view on the difference between Canada and the US in this regard?

My personal view is that the US allows for more freedom of speech, as opposed to Canada, but i would be interested in hearing your view.","1433117208"

I'm not sure how much of that I can setup in GitLab. I know it has Merge Requests, but I'm not sure how to make them as robust, if possible.

I'm not sure about auto-merge, but Gitlab does have support for pull and push events.   My guess is if git merge can be run with no conflicts that gitlab will do it.

That for some, you don't need to know the back story, or the artist, the piece alone should speak for itself.  I can judge the song ""Don't Stop Believing"" on the merits of just being a damn good song, without knowing Journey, or the singer, or his views on lgbt issues.  The song is damn good and stands on his own.

In Some cases, knowing someone's views can strengthen my interest in their art. Finding out that Rabbit in the band Steam Powered Giraffe just made me MORE interested in the band, but they were already one of my favorites when I found out Rabbit was trans.

The only exception has been Orson Scott Card because it REALLY took me by surprise.  Speaker for the Dead is one of my favorite books. Andrew Wiggum was a completely awesome character, I loved the ideas behind a Speaker for the Dead, and I loved the idea of collecting everyone's story and trying to get the truth to build an accurate picture of a person's life.  Without judgement, without bias, just the story of someone's life.

Then I found out he stands against homosexual rights, it didn't help that I just finished reading Xenophobe and was severely disappointed in the story, and I just never read anything else he's done.  But Speaker for the Dead is still one of my favorite books, and Andrew Wiggum, as a character, is someone that I think is worth striving to be like, as he was peaceful and accepting of all.","1433117212"

It's much less likely for people to Click through, read the topic and whatever shit an OP comes up with then follow the links unless it's something really important or really interesting. Usually when there's an interesting article, YouTube video or whatever that is shared the relevance is summed up in the title. Mods have enacted this change because they hope that anything not fitting their rigid definition will disappear with time and they'll finally have their ""pure"" Sub.

As we've recently also found out you don't even keep to the rules you've made up, you base if you delete or leave something be on ""Mod butthurt"": http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/37zrc1/socjus_george_takei_calls_girl_courageous_for/crr4kol

Can we have some sane Mods come back again /u/david-me ? People that don't flip out and delete posts because you ""misgendered"" someone and don't moderate based on the amount of butthurt they piled up at one moment? I believe this guy is making a lot of sense: http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/37xoqy/just_a_word_of_caution_it_seems_a_lot_of_people/crqvcrc

I thought you guys could handle just trying to remove the most Off-Topic shit, but I'm doubting more and more that you are capable since you are making up retarded arbitrary rules that help noone, work against the basic principle Reddit is based on and add bureaucracy and intransparency and I'd rather have no moderation at all than one based on Mod-butthurt and attacking the userbase.","1433117213"

"starwarstrader","t5_37ffd","It IS a very nice-looking card, probably one of the best in the entire set.  

Traded for it earlier today.  

As to any sort of (long-term) value - that part is harder to figure given this is a Week 12 vs. a Week 11.

Lots of people are still hoarding Week 11 Vader/Funeral Pyre cards like crazy, and more than a few Jabba WV traders were hoping to do 1:1 exchanges for that card.  

The hoarding is, in some cases, a little EXTREME: One guy I saw today had *20* Pyre cards...:/

But for the lucky batch of traders who pulled first, a few other folks were offering crazy deals on things like a Vintage X-Wing, 3PO, or Tusken Raider to lock at least one of these new WV cards down, which I found a little surprising.  

A few who had Jabba (tried, and likely failed, LOL) to promote the idea of traders swapping them a Vintage Vader or Fett for it.

As the popular saying goes, ""Best of luck with that.""

Hoping to grab a spare of this tomorrow to see what people REALLY want for it.  ;)","1433117214"

5. The interior of Bombardier urban mass transit rail vehicles.

Re: #5, having grown up in Vancouver, I notice that the SkyTrain has a very distinctive smell that I can't even describe. It smells like ""SkyTrain"". A few years ago, I was travelling overseas in SE Asia, missing some comforts from home. I land in Kuala Lumpur towards the end of my very long trip. KL's rapid transit system uses the exact same rolling stock as the SkyTrain. I step into the KL train, take a whiff, and almost nearly cried. No jokes. It was a slice of home in an unlikely, foreign place. I would imagine Detroit's People Mover and Toronto's Scarborough RT would smell similarly as they use the same rolling stock as well.","1433117215"

"ehlersdanlos","t5_2spw0","Haha well to be completely honest I'm not sure if I have EDS, but I find a lot of the stuff I read in this sub very helpful in dealing with my shitty joints, which are at least a little bit hypermobile. I've only really learned that they are recently. I was told about some of it a bit before (while a friend did some private yoga instruction for me) but didn't understand that hyperextending meant I was doing something abnormal... hahaha. 

But the stuff I read from people here has really helped in how I approach managing my joints, and the techniques and equipment I use in making life a bit more accessible and less painful than it was before. I haven't subscribed to this sub becauseI feel like I shouldn't or don't belong somehow, I'm usually a lurker.

But, on to your actual question!

I don't really use and sort of brace or anything on my arms when I shoot. It took a lot of time and effort in training my muscle memory in my bow arm to have it so my elbow stays out of the way, it *really* wanted to lock and hyperextend if I didn't put conscious thought into it. I have some sort of injury the the base joint (MCP I believe?) of my thumb currently. Turns out my thumbs hyperextend as well, and I've apparently been picking up glasses wrong and hyperextending my thumb like that for probably my entire life &gt;_&gt; I've been taping it up here and there when it need it, but never found a method I liked for while I shoot, just for other activities.

I did have a fair bit of pain when I was starting out new, but I made sure to practice drawing and correct form in a mirror. I found good form was a major factor in reducing pain and unnecessary stress on my joints and surrounding tissues. If I felt pain in the ""wrong"" areas, the first thing I did was re-examine my form and make corrections until it didn't hurt anymore (obviously resting here and there if it was worse than usual).

Not sure what your exact wrist problems are, but maybe taping could be a better solution for a wrist than it was for my thumb. I'd think you'd likely get away with whatever you want on the elbow, provided it wasn't extremely bulky. I'm sure the ideal solution would be a custom brace/splint made by an occupational therapist to fit your hand/wrist and the grip of the bow. But that's not always an option for everyone.

Every once and awhile someone posts on /r/Archery with elbow issues that lead me to think they might have some hypermobility issues. The advice most people give isn't always as helpful and I see comments that seem a bit misinformed when it comes to someone with potential hypermobility issues.

So it's been a little bit of a journey figuring out how to do everything when most instructions and tips are aimed towards people without hypermobility, but definitely has felt worth it to me. I used to be fairly active, and now I can barely do a light jog to cross the street or even just walk for extended periods without braces. So it's been really nice to have something that I feel I'll be able to do for quite awhile to come, so long as I'm careful about how I'm doing it and don't try to rush myself through increasing draw weight. I also carry a *lot* of tension around my shoulders, so it's nice that archery seems to help that area feel more relaxed after I shoot.

I'm glad you're getting back into it though! And I really hope you find what works for you in your journey coming back to shooting. Sorry if I wasn't very helpful, I'm still pretty new to the realization that I likely have a non-standard body. But I'm trying to learn as much as I can along the way.","1433117216"

The ban on flavoured tobacco, I guess, sorta, if you don't think too hard about it, makes sense. Make cigarettes in fun fruit flavours and *maybe* youth might pick it up. But menthol? They've been around for decades, are not a new way to attract young smokers, and I haven't seen anything indicating that youths smoke menthols more than the rest of the population.

As I said, I don't smoke menthols, so it's not a huge loss for me - but I do think it's silly. Every once in a while I do enjoy a menthol smoke, so all this new law will have me do is buy a carton now to keep in the freezer should I want one.","1433117216"

The Empire as a whole I'd say is more prosperous, but seeing how there really is really no ""whole"" of the Empire anymore, aside from an Emperor, with all the current internal conflicts that are arising it really looks like it's on the verge of a civil war. The different powers in the Empire are prosperous alone though, so even if the faction does end up breaking down, all the separate powers look like they wouldn't fair TOO bad on their own.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;What is the evidence for lucid dreaming?

The same evidence for dreaming :P. But really, we've talked to people who were actively lucid dreaming during the conversation. That is, the person was clearly in a dream state, but was able to communicate and be consciously aware of what was happening, along with relay information about the dream in real time to an outside observer. With this, we have objectively determined that ""dream time"" is a subjective thing that mostly matches 'real time'.

&gt;Do you believe in it?

Considering I've personally done it, and there's a plethora of evidence for it, along with almost every sleep researcher ever studying it, yes.

&gt;, but what logical evidence do we have that lucid dreaming is a real thing?

The fact that I have done it. That you can do it. That we've talked to people who lucid dreamed. And so on. We know how to influence it, we know ""dream rules"", and it's quite plainly a thing many people do on a daily basis. It's very real.

&gt;We have only the testimonies of the followers who claim to have experienced it first hand, but can it be proven scientifically?

How do you think we figured out about it? We've done lots of studies with lucid dreamers. We figured out when lucid dreaming occurs (hint: it's not during all phases of dreaming, just specific ones). And a bunch of other stuff.

&gt;There are books written about how other people may be able to have the same experience, but are those techniques based on the scientific method?

Some are, some aren't. A lot of the techniques are based on how dreams work (content brought over from the previous day), along with things like CBT, external stimuli during dreams (you can still see/hear sort of when dreaming), and some other stuff. Then there's weird unproven techniques like taking b12 which some people say works.

&gt; Can they be reproduced under laboratory conditions?

Most labs studying lucid dreaming have people who can reliably perform the act. That way more study can be done. However, some common techniques have been reproduced in a lab. The most common is something called a ""reality check"", in which you do something that's physically unable to be done while awake, but can be done while dreaming. My personal favorite is holding your nose and then breathing through it. IRL you can't breath, but in a dream you'll breath fine.

The actual act of getting conscious in a dream is a bit tricky, since there's no guarantees that you'll be in a proper state to do it, or even 'have' a dream that night.

But yes, lucid dreaming is a very real thing that's been reproduced in labs, and people have had conversations with people who were in a dream.

I've also personally done it, so if you have any questions, ask away.

&gt;I am posting this here to get answers from people who ask similar questions about religion.

Lucid dreaming isn't magic. It's quite a real phenomena that happens. Saying it doesn't exist is like saying dreams don't exist. Lucid dreaming is just a dream in which you are aware it's happening.

It's also worth noting that you can be aware and have control, or have control but not be aware. Only the awareness is required for it to be a 'lucid dream'.

Edit: It's worth noting I've also tried to reproduce religious acts, but have failed consistently. Which adds to my disbelief of them.","1433117218"

"telescopes","t5_2qnl1","I can only speak fom my personal experience, and a zoom eyepiece (about identical to the Celestron) was the first thing I got after the kit eyepieces. The lowest magnification had a narrow 40 degree apparent field of view, and the highest magnification did not quite reach the maximum useful magnification. 

So the Celestron zoom eyepiece would reach a maximum of 87.5x at 700mm focal length (while 100-120x is possible), and a narrow 1.3° field at the lowest magnification. A 32mm Plössl will show ~2.5°, making orientation, star hopping and observing easier. 

I rarely use my zoom eyepiece at all. Part of the fun for me are the wide field views with a wide angle eyepiece. :-)

Should I be doing market analysis?

What I'm wondering is how you're supposed to plan the steps toward your goal when you don't know exactly how it works.

At 19, I moved in with my bf and his dad. His father was always wanting hugs and holding me a little too long until the day when he drove me to work and asked for a kiss. I kissed him on the cheek, like a dutiful daughter in law and then he demanded a real kiss, grabbed me and stuck his tongue down my throat. 

I moved out that same day.

What he did was deliberate. He is pushing you to test your boundaries. Nobody masturbates in their living room when they are sharing a home with their son and his gf unless they want to be caught. His subsequent behaviour demonstrates that. 

Move out as soon as you can. He's gone this far and he'll go further next time.

You also should know that [scientists have identified a particular gene linked to being transgender](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-science-of-transgender-20140730), and they've done [brain scans which indicate that transgender brains appear more similar to the gender they most associate with](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-science-of-transgender-20140730), and even your repeated claims about observations at birth don't actually mean anything because they didn't take into account biological origins of being transgender.

**Hit and run claim**

&gt; So here's the full story I just leased my first car Monday and was driving home Friday afternoon, I scratched and dented my car on the way into my parking structure. No other cars were damaged. I panicked since it was my first car and didn't have the money to pay for the damages. So I went inside my apartment and filed a hit and run, saying the driver was unknown without knowing the consequences for false claims at the time. It's been a couple of days and I fear that it's too late to do anything. I have no prior criminal records, tickets, and have never been into an accident, but I doubt that matters. Should I call the insurance company and withdraw the claim? ","1433117224"

Some minor characters go on journeys of no real significance to anyone but themselves. They're interesting, they explore the world, but they don't drive the plot forward at all. And then, a bunch of new characters are introduced. Their threads now need to be woven in with the other characters', and concluded.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","You make a lot of good points. Honestly. And it's good that you like it that you pay ""for housing and medicine for the poor"". You also pay for the death and destruction of brown people too don't forget. And for weapons of mass destruction. And for supporting the oppression of various people like Palestinians, Syrians, and various African nations.

You're also paying for the federal support of unprosecuted felons in the banking industry, and for the support of the Patriot act and the TPP. You're paying for the subsidization of carbon emitting fuels. You're paying for zero interest loans to wall street firms like Goldman Sachs. You're paying for the tax deductions for offshoring american jobs. You're also paying to subsidize Wal-mart who offloads the support of their employees onto the low wage programs you are happily supporting.

I don't expect you to understand or agree with a single thing I've just said. It doesn't sound like you would be open to discussing those things anyway. But the message you are receptive to and rebroadcasting is ""it's all for the poor and the children"". 

If you actually tried to understand anything I've said in my comment history, you would see that I'm not against ""socialized medicine"", or caring for poor people. I'm all about paying for local administration and execution of these plans at the county and state levels. I'm about returning taxes back to primarily coming from and going to the communities the people live in. 

Having worked with systems that need to operate under stress, failure, and even attack, I've seen the need for decentralization of operation, but central oversight. This is the model I advocate. States and counties should collect and spend the majority of taxes. The federal government should solely exist to smooth operation between these entities and coordinate when necessary for things like national defense, communications, or weights and standards.

There are many, many people on here who think as you do on this issue - I'm pretty familiar with why you think the way you do, and I know I can't change it. But I hope that I can at least help you see that not everyone against the overreach of the federal government is blindly anti-government, or anti-poor, or anti-society. I'm mostly just against the massive centralization of power that removes any say I have in how those taxes actually do get spent. And yes, I do think 45% combined taxes is way too much, and is hurting my family more than I want to help poor people. I don't think it shoudl be 0% like you seem to imply. But a maximum of 20 - 25% seems more reasonable across state and federal taxes combined. 1 day in five of the work I do to help others instead of my family.

That being said, nationality of commenters I think to an extent plays a part in bias towards riders/teams. I've mentioned this before when it's cropped up, but Anglophone riders are given a pretty good rep mostly, because a decent chunk of the sub was brought up English first language, and may have allegiances to that country. Though this sub due to the history of cycling has a plentiful supply of Europeans as well, so it's not all like that. 

The culture in the country is also brought up as an example sometimes, ala the East German regime that produced Jan Ulrich and others to Tyler Hamilton commenting you could walk around in Spain with a syringe strapped to your forehead and no one would bat an eyelid. Or the way Russia has been battered recently by allegations of systematic doping in athletics.

Nej, helt irrelevant. Inget i ditt agerande gör dig ansvarig för hans njurfunktion. Genomför du hjärt- och lungräddning, och krossar ett par revben, är du ej ansvarig för detta, då du agerat efter vad som är objektivt rätt.

Barn som blivit slagna av sina föräldrar självrapporterar att barnmisshandel är ett effektivt och moraliskt sätt att disciplinera barn. Barn som kommer från incestuösa förhållanden mellan far och dotter, har ofta ingen förståelse för att förhållandet är djupt olämpligt. Att människor som inte kan tänka självrapporterar sina upplevelser som positiva är inte ett argument för att behandla dem illa. Föräldrar har ett ansvar mot sina barn att inte förstöra deras personlighet. Det finns situationer som är objektivt bättre, som att se till att ens barn borstar tänderna, men om det är bäst om tandkrämen smakar mint eller jordgubb är en fråga som beror på subjektet.

&gt;Du kan aldrig bevisa en moralisk princip vetenskapligt.

Det som är vetenskapligt är det som följer den vetenskapliga metoden, som är bevis och resonemang. Där logik är nog för att bevisa principer, men observationer där de är relevanta alltid är överordnade teori. Filosofi är utan tvekan en vetenskaplig disciplin, även om väldigt många människor är väldigt dåliga på den. 

Att människor inte förstår eller gör fel i applikationen av teorin, invaliderar inte att utifrån principerna: om att man ska respektera legitima egendomsanspråk och inte initiera användandet av våld; följer det att man inte kan döda sina egna barn. Människor som dödar barn gör detta i självintresse, slutsats före resonemang. Som etablerat tidigare är den enda situationen där en kvinna blir gravid, och hon ej är ansvarig, är då hon ej givit samtycke.

You didn't bother to refute my claims. I simply drew on the context clues you put down. Your reaction just solidifies my suspicions.  I was once an angry young man as well, upset at the cost and selfishness of infidelity from my parent. I had to learn to forgive and let go.

I never claimed the fix for every relationship is reconciliation. Forgiveness isn't a fix for a relationship either, but necessary for the healing process to begin for each individual. I encourage others to forgive and to think about reconciliation, but I do not judge what men and women do.

Come to think of it, I've had far too much experience in these matters. Friends, family, co-workers. ","1433117232"

2. SEO is bullshit. It used to be links inbound to your website, which was totally spammed and scammed until Google changed their algorithm to a more complex system that uses a larger bias to content of the website vs inbound links to your site from other websites referencing your site in an article, or a link on facebook, etc. Essentially if you use a stupid keyword for your website and program it modernly, it is SEO compliant. Basically SEO is engineering or hacking your website to get more ranking on modern search engines. You can read up on Google's webmaster site for information about how they rank sites. Legal SEO efforts are paying money for ad's, paying companies or networking with them to promote your business in articles or stories; which basically you won't be able to do, since it's a marketing role, which you have no place in. Likewise you aren't going to be writing popular articles for your website and doing social marketing.

friend: I don't have time to explain. I need your help.

/u/Stopher82 What is it?

friend: So this fly landed on my penis and I wanna get rid of it.

/u/Stopher82 Have you tried swatting it away?

friend: No no. I want to kill it.

/u/Stopher82 OK. Have you tried just hitting it with your hand?

friend: On my dick? Are you crazy?

/u/Stopher82 Alright. How might I help?

friend: Don't panic but I was thinking of jamming my penis up your ass.

/u/Stopher82 Say what now?

friend: Yeah, think about it. That way I don't have to hit my cock.

/u/Stopher82 Because *that* would be crazy?

friend: Exactly! Come on, it's not gay if you do it to help a friend.

/u/Stopher82 I... No! Listen man, how about I just use my hand to simulate my anus?

friend: How's that?

/u/Stopher82 I'll just make a fist and you stick your penis in it.

friend: Alright, that might work.

/u/Stopher82 makes a fist and hesitantly asks his friend to put his penis in it.

friend: Nope, it moved to the front. Here let me pull out. Nope, now it's back on the base, let me put it back in. *sigh* It's back on the tip again.

After moving his penis in and out of /u/Stopher82's fist for a few minutes the friend gets frustrated and brings up /u/Stopher82's anus again.

friend: This isn't working. Let me just put my penis up your ass.

/u/Stopher82 How's that going to be any different?

friend: Well, I'll jam it in so quickly that the fly won't have time to fly away.

/u/Stopher82 Ugh, fine, whatever makes me stop touching your penis... Wait, what about lube?

friend: There's no way to put lube on without risking the fly getting away. You're gonna have to take it like a man. A straight man.

/u/Stopher82 *sigh* Alright. Do you want me to bend over or?

friend: No dude, wtf? Don't make this weird. I'll lay down and you just lower yourself on my penis as quickly as possible.

/u/Stopher82 Oh come on man! That's like stabbing yourself with a sword except it's more gay.

friend: Hey! It's not gay!

/u/Stopher82 Alright alright. Let's get it over with.

The friend lays down and /u/Stopher82 lowers himself quickly on his friend's penis.

/u/Stopher82 Well? Did we get it?

friend: I don't know. I didn't see it fly away. Can you feel it inside you?

/u/Stopher82 DUDE, COME ON! I THOUGHT THIS WASN'T GAY!

friend: What? No no. The fly, I was asking if you can feel the fly inside you.

/u/Stopher82 Oh! I feel something moving. I dunno if it's the fly. Maybe you should stop moving so I can see if it's the fly or not.

friend: No, too risky.

/u/Stopher82 OK. So what's the plan now?

friend: I have an idea but I'll need to move faster.

/u/Stopher82 What? Why?

friend: Do you want this to be over?

/u/Stopher82 Yes.

friend: Then trust me. This'll work.

After thrusting his cock inside /u/Stopher82's ass for a few minutes while both try to hold their moans to not make things more weird /u/Stopher82's friend finally speaks up.

A bit of info, he was hit by GI stasis a few months ago which he recovered well from. Today we found him in his house not moving a stomach pressing, his belly was hard and swollen, he had seemed fine before I went to bed.
My SO took him straight to the emergency vet but by the time she got there he had stopped breathing.

He was a cheeky bun, in this picture he is actually waiting for me to look away so he can try to nibble the flowers. We wasn't a particularly cuddly bun but would jump up for pets when his mood took him. It would have been his 2nd birthday next week.

His sister Cat keeps searching round for him, its heartbreaking, it must be just as bad for her as for my SO and I.

Thank you again and make sure you all give your buns a hug for me.","1433117236"

Y si alguien sensible espera un posicionamiento, por mi parte diré que creo en la libertad de expresión, y que soy español, y que deseo a Cataluña dentro de España, y sé, que la mejor forma para que eso sea así, es convenciendo a los catalanes que se quieren ir de España de que no lo hagan, es dejándoles que tengan la posibilidad de decidirlo, porque estoy convencido de que no se irán si se da la opción de que voten.

Typically, vehicles require heavy certing to become competitive. Without AP cannon, Enforcer/Halberd and Vanguard Shield/Fire Supression you have to be much better than opponents to win. It's like fighting against high BR HA as Engineer with low DPS carbine - you have chance to win, but only if you are much better/have lots of luck.


When comparing fully upgraded tanks, Vanguard is significantly more durable than the other two, while also dealing more damage than Magrider (Prowler, especially in Anchor mode has more DPS).

For living aboard it's small for the same reasons, but also things like not having a functioning shower (gotta use the marina facilities), good sized refrigerator, awkward seating.. that type of stuff. It's mostly like camping until you get up around 35' or so. Even 32' is much larger... Also, power boats of the same size generally have much better accommodations. And for a bahama's trip, the fuel cost is not that much. I'd probably go with a cruiser type of power boat above 27' for anything more than pure 'adventure'. Sailing is one of those things you either love or hate. Power boats are much more comfortable and practical for most people.

For just weekending any size boat with a cabin to sleep in will be fine.

As a general rule, simply don't mention it. Perhaps one day, at a school good enough where it's the one deciding factor in a rejection, someone with depression can sue the school for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act if the circumstances and the present evidence favors them enough, but do you think you're that person? Do you want that to be you even if you are?

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","&gt; I would start by saying that many pilots would never be able to retire in an environment with gravity.

Traders and combat pilots should; They both spend a lot of time in stations to reload / signup for duty / trade etc... so they would still get the benefits of artificial gravity. Plus, to be able to withstand those high-G dogfights, combat pilots ought to be in top shape (well if you believe Battlestar Galactica at least :)).

My biggest concern if I were an explorer would be food, those 3d printed cartridge sound ok for a while but you'd have a limited supply.

Also in all those cases, sleep, would be very much a problem as you stated. With a body clock totally out of whack, I can only imagine an artificial ""sleep cycle"" machine that syncs your body to a 24h sleep cycle by releasing the right hormones at the right time (or something like that). Otherwise you'd be dead quickly.

"ttcafterloss","t5_34scd","I've done a ton of research about carriers (I plan on wearing as much as possible). Unfortunately, I still have no idea what I'm doing.

But the baby wearing groups seem great, helpful, and welcoming. I plan on going soon (after all my stupid traveling us over), but before I get too big to try out carriers.

It seems to me that you ""need"" multiple kinds of carriers depending on your goals. There is no one carrier to rule them all. 

A soft stretchy wrap (Moby or k'tan) is great for newborns, but get too stretchy/unsafe once baby gets heavier. 

Ring slings are also great for newborns, and can last much longer, but maybe aren't best for fidgety children, or for long days out. You can find tons of these in different fabrics (lightweight, heavier, depending on weather you anticipate, etc) on Etsy.

Mei Tai carriers are adaptable so anyone of any size can wear it. They are great for newborns through toddlers...depending on how heavy and tall the kid gets. Babyhawk is a popular brand for Mei Tais.

Soft structured carriers (Ergo, Bjorn, lillebaby, Beco, Tula, Boba, Onya, etc) have a variety of different features. Things that are important to me are padded straps, crossover straps, back-carry, infant compatibility, a hood, and a wide waistband. The Tula is popular at cult-like proportions. The Onya gets amazing reviews, but is less well known. The Ergo and Bjorn are widely available, and so popular by default, but I think you can do better. (I decided on the Beco Soleil.) Google ""soft structured baby carrier comparusons"" to get a sense of features, and what might be important to you. 

Wraps are for the more advanced. And not any old piece of fabric will do. The weave is important. I plan to get a wrap or two later on once I feel more comfortable.

I've posted in /r/babywearing, and asked  people there questions, and was strongly encouraged to go to meetings no matter how far along you are. They bring dolls to practice with for those who are still wearing their babies on the inside.

There's a whole culture around baby wearing that I'm excited to get to know. I read about someone recommending a ""Santa tossed back hug carry"" and am bewildered, but excited to learn.","1433117249"

AMOLEDs (DK2 uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Full HD Super AMOLED) use organic electroluminescent materials which do not emit single frequency red, green, and blue colors. Instead they emit a range of light frequencies consisting of a spectral curve for each color primary. AMOLED spectral curves are narrower than produced by IPS LCDs (used in Apple retina displays), but the width of the frequency range for each primary is not a single frequency. The Oculus chromatic aberration correction technique only works perfectly at the exact center frequencies of each (RGB) emission curve. Since the AMOLED emissions spread around these ideal Oculus corrected center frequencies, chromatic fringing can not be totally eliminated by the Oculus technique.

See this spectrum plot for Apple iPhone 4 and 5 vs. Samsung AMOLED (older version than Note 3):

Otherwise, I would start simple and monitor the Task Manager for activity.  See what's going on during these spikes of lag... do you notice activity in the CPU, Memory, Disk, or Ethernet?  If so, try to narrow down an application or activity.
  
If you don't notice anything unusual there, you can go into the Computer Management utility and use Performance &amp;amp;amp;gt; Monitoring Tools &amp;amp;amp;gt; Performance Monitor.  You can add many different types of activity to monitor.  It'll show in real-time and there is a way to record it without monitoring and then reviewing later on.  I'm not too familiar with this to help further, but I've seen it done and it was effective.      
  
**Edit:** Resource Monitor is probably better to use than Task Manager.

I moved around quite a bit during my teenage-hood, as well as in university and jobs, however I've settled in a city which I really like, and I think I managed to hold it down through engaging with locals, and attending social events, and going to organised meetups, making new friends all the time.

I often consider my best friends from university like family now, but I like applying the saying 'Where you've got friends, you've got family' to where I am, because I think the friendships I've made where I am are what makes me feel like I'm part of the city, and settling in.","1433117255"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Think of it this way - let's imagine a company that has a branch office with 100 employees.  It pays each of them a nice round $50,000 per year.  That company spends $5 million per year on salaries for that office.

The company purchases automation software that can do their jobs.  Let's say they pay $1,000,000 for the permanent use of the software.  They then fire the entire office.

The $5,000,000 dollars they were spending on salary each year are *still there.*  The money didn't fly away, it's just no longer going to those employees.  The company still has it, they're just calling it ""profit"" now.  

Let's further imagine that basic income is $30,000/year to everyone regardless of whether they have a job or not.  For 100 people, that's $3 million.  If you tax the company on $3 million of their profits, they still came out ahead by $1 million this year, and they'll save $2 million every year from now on because they don't have to pay those employees.

The employees that got fired get paid $30,000 instead of $50,000, but they have all the time in the world to do things they never could before.  If they get part time work, they can supplement the $30k because it's unconditional - they get it whether they have a job or not.

It's not perfect, but it keeps society functioning even if there are no jobs any more.  That $30k per person will be spent on movies, dinners out, new clothes, hobbies, travel...you name it.  The economy will thrive because of all the money being spent, and the company that laid off all those people will probably see an *increase* in sales compared to the sales they would have had if unemployment were allowed to run rampant without any intervention.

It just relies on taking money from the companies in the form of taxes instead of payroll.","1433117255"

There was an article on here a few days ago by someone who was raised in and works with abuse victims from this very specific type of religious cult, and they pointed out how the specific teachings about the sins of sexual thoughts, women/girls obeying males in their lives,  and complete removal of legitimate sexual outlets, made this very specific type of abuse (committed by children/teens stuck in the cult, *not* by authorities of the church) much more likely to occur and much harder to find/correct.  Yes, many authoritarian systems lead to many different types of abuses, but this *is* a very specific outcome that's probably exacerbated by this very specific cult, and it is very worth pointing this out and very worth destroying it by any non-violent means available.","1433117256"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","There are some people who claim to believe the bible literally. They generally come across as crazy. They believe that the world is about 6000 years old, and any evidence that contradicts that...something, something, the devil, something.

The further away you get from the bible, the less crazy the stuff sounds. The global flood where a 500+-year-old man built a boat and put on kangaroos, polar bears, and penguins? Never happened. It's a metaphor. Or something.

In fact, just ignore the whole Old Testament. We don't need that anymore. It's been replaced with a New one. And ignore the parts of the NT that reference the OT, or where Jesus says that it still applies. Ignore where Jesus says that some of the people listening to him will be there for the second coming. That means something else. Or something.

This book is generally the basis of people's faith: it was taught to them, and they taught it to their kids. That's how faith spreads. When you're a kid, you don't question what your parents say, you just accept it.

So no, the number of believers in the ancient Greek gods weren't evidence that those were real (we think believing in them is kind of silly now), the number of Christians isn't proof that they're right, and the number of Muslims isn't proof that they're right.","1433117258"

But on top of that I would personally blame the lack of good-looking or trendy small cars available.  I would have to call the Honda Civic hatchback the number one seller by default simply due to a lack of options.

If you lived anywhere else in the world there would be two to three times as much options of viable good looking small cars.  Renault.  Afla Romeo.  Peugot.  AutoBianchi.  Citroen.  Diahatsu.  TVR.  Ginetta.  MG.  Opel.  Nissan stopped selling the Micra in Canada for over twenty years and only recently became available again.  Several sport trim versions of the VW Golf and BMW 1 series have never been available in Canada.  

If you want any of these cars and live here you would have to special order them.  But the FIAT 500s are sitting right there on the lot on Gladwin Rd.  That makes a significant difference.  

I just think the selection of small, hatchback and micro cars available in Canada is pretty sad compared to the rest of the world.  I mean comparable to the FIAT 500 there are only two micro cars on sale here I can think of.  The Scion iQ (which people accuse of being a blatant FIAT rip off in looks) and the Mercedes SMART car.

Let him know that bothers you, but you really also should be more mindful to put on things you BOTH like when he's around - and he should watch stuff you both like when he's around you, too.  

If something like him calling the shows you watch dumb and wanting to watch something else with you is a deal breaker then you really need a wake-up call about how to get along with others.

Yes, this is what will happen either way. Bitcoin, in its current incarnation, **scales poorly**. Every transaction does *not* need to be broadcasted to each and every node on planet Earth.

People *will* be transacting off blockchain through settlement companies which then bundle up transactions regularly (weekly, monthly, daily, etc..) and publish them to the blockchain.

...unless bitcoin's core data structure is changed (or we experience a 10,000x increase in bandwidth, processing power, storage, etc..).

Right now, there is no proposal being seriously considered, so the first option is what we should do until people work out the kinks on a new structure of the blockchain. Changing the blocksize threatens bitcoin's core advantage and is at best a kludge.","1433117261"

"HFY","t5_2y95n","The way I would go about making it work is to severely debuff the portals and to a lesser extent the data network. 

Make some thing up about how larger portals require exponential more power and while relatively stable, the portals are not perfectly stable, and also require a significant(but not insane) amount of stabilizing equipment. 

Tiny portals sufficient for data can and are maintained in implants, but larger portals require external power and machinery. 

Significant battle power can be achieved by by man-portable equipment, especially when the power is supplied by portal, but there is a balance between portability, the power that is supplied by portal, and diminishing returns as the power necessary to hold open the power-supply portal outstrip the power it is able to supply(for temporary over-drive, use capacitors to increase apparent output beyond normal). 

Personal teleporters have a recharge time, constant-use person-size teleporters, say, the size of a tank, and for ship-size teleporting, they use generators tied to stars or massive anti-matter generators or some such. 

Teleporting with undersized equipment at one end is possible, but is has a chance of failure and tends to destroy the teleporter at both ends(portal sand works, but you want to send a lot in case the first few tries on your selected planetoid fail.) 

Mundane transport still exists, but is pretty advanced and in much reduced use.

The network people are on doesn't magically make them know everything, it still takes then a bit to process new skills and muscle memory/skill still takes time, but a reduced time.

Deep dive connections, say for VR or data dumps, tend to interrupt the ability to interact with the physical world, so no one is going to be instantly sharing everything they know about the aliens in the middle of battle unless what they know isn't much or they have an AI tied to their brain.

If you think it would help, reduce the number of systems they've colonized, either by reducing the time they have to colonize before meeting xenos, or have them have some sort of internal focus for a while, a civil war or terrorists or something.

"battlecats","t5_2tsiy","Welcome to Battle Cats!

Lizard Cat, Wall Cat and Gross cat are mostly the best cats to level up first. If you have problem with Red, Whale cat too. If you have more problems in the Main Chapters, collecting Superior Treasures is the way to go (You need all Superior treasures if you wish to survive this game). NEVER EVER EXCHANGE A CAT FOR EXP. Once you get stronger, getting 500k exp is totally easy, just finishing a single stage. There's also the User Rank system, a leveling system that depends on the level of your cats (unlocked in Chapter 2? Not really sure). It gives you a reward for a certain rank and also allows your cats to be leveled up further if you have attained a certain User Rank.

Few more tips. Don't spend Cat Food on refills, power-ups or buying Special Cats. Not worth it. You can get Power-ups from weekly stages (You can't handle this yet but they occur every "" Certain day"" like how Monday gives Rich Cat). Treasures Radars are an exception cause they don't drop except as a 1% drop rate and a difficult stage to boot. Don't spend them for farming Superior Treasures! Keep them because some cats drop from a level, and it's only mere 3% (?) drop rate. Special Cats help in the Main Chapters but will get outclassed easily later on. Refills are self explanatory, and there's the energy glitch (search it on the side bar) to refill your energy for free without waiting. Save up Cat Food for Gacha Events (Rare Ticket thing in the screen). 1500 Cat Food for Guaranteed Uber (11 rolls) or  Special one-off deal on rare cat tickets: 30 for one, 750 for ten. Don't try your luck here, getting Cat Food is difficult.

For more info and help about Battle Cats, there's the [Battle Cats Guide and FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KMeL8cIiRMRHq40AH1IkKqGMnChHFDufn4YbjVaJyQ/edit?pli=1) that will help you tremendously to understand how things work and also contains the rating of Cats. (also found in the sidebar, linked it for you.) Sorry I talked a lot and all, but these stuff will help you in the first days of your journey and will prevent you from regretting things like what happened to us. Save yourself before it happens.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","1. The issue with sport is more about pay and prestige. Men's sports gets far more of both. No one can deny are physical differences between the sexes and in a number of sports (especially performance based ones like athletics and swimming) there is no chance of women competing equally with men. But there are other sports this is not an issue but they are still segregated by sex and I think that needs to be changed.

2. Feminism is about equity, not equality. In your example of law firms, equity would be achieved hiring more women than men to correct a preexisting oversupply of male lawyers. Once you have equal numbers of male and female lawyers then you have equality.

3. Yes. 

4. Yes. If you do some more research on this you'll see why people think this way.

5. There are two main issues I see as driving the wage gap for women. First is the difficultly in getting into senior positions unless you devote your entire life to working and avoid children. Second is that many women do lower paid work and while they get paid the same as men while doing those jobs, there are far less men doing them. 

6. The ""unrealistic beauty"" thing is an issue because it gives the perception that only women (and men) who look a certain way are acceptable by society and anyone else has to change the way they look to fit this image. ","1433117263"

When you give in to the anger or agitation from being insulted, it remains with you. It is only when you let it go, that it no longer remains with you. Now if it remains with you, the mind is in dis-ease. When insulted, how often do others insult back (wrong speech). How often do others turn insult into violence? We know some of these consequences, it can lead to injury, death, criminal charges, court, fees and penalties, a bad reputation, blowback, difficulty getting employment, etc. All of this can be simply avoided and cut at it's root if you just let it go (a right view that puts an end to stress and suffering).

"lawncare","t5_2rzrk","Don't weed whack, even if your mower can't follow then 1/3rd rule.

Grass needs to have a clean cut and weed whacking ism decidedly not clean. An unclear cut will make the turf vulnerable to disease.  Especially for bluegrass.

If the lawn is to tall for the highest setting on your mower, mow it anyway.  

Cutting off more than 1/3rd with a sharp lawn mower and getting a clean cut is Bette than cutting off less than 1/3rd with a weed whacker.

Follow this:
Let's say you wanted to get from the highest setting to the third highest setting:

- first day first cut, highest setting (even if the grass is too tall for it)
- 5 days later, highest setting again
- 3 days later, highest setting yet again
- 3 days later, second highest setting
- 5 days later, second highest setting
- 3 days later, third highest setting
- 3 days later, third highest setting

Then I would challenge you to actually write clearly what you mean. Because you explicitly stated that the fact that your co-workers rejected your friendship advances was a behavior which caused you to lump them into the category 'antisocial'. 

You aren't as great a communicator as you think. Save the condescension. 

&gt; Just as you have a skill set that is strong in coding, I have a skill set that seems to be best suited to working with other people

It's a false dichotomy, buddy. People can and do have many different skills, and being able to code doesn't preclude being great with people. 

Now that we've interacted, I kind of agree with the other guy that the problem likely isn't everyone else, it's you. In just two posts, you've managed to:    

* type something which apparently wasn't what you meant, then despite that   
* proceed to give people from whom you want advice lessons in how to communicate and how to view the world
* insinuate that coding and being able to work with other people are mutually exclusive concepts, and    
* knowing literally nothing about me, pidgeonhole me as a ""coder"", attributing to me the set of characteristics which you have invented in your head that you think apply to all coders, indicating that you think in terms of narcissistic projections and archetype.   

Yet you will probably walk away from this exchange thinking *we* are all dicks.

Honorable mention goes to every other ""cinematic"" game that exemplify the worst parts of both movies and games simultaneously. 


Bioshock Infinite: The gameplay was extremely boring even compared to the previous two games and the plot had so many plot holes and terrible terrible use of time travel that I beat it, but felt it was ridiculously overhyped and I wouldn't play it again. Bioshock 2 catches a ton of flak for being a terrible sequel and I woul even go back and play that one again over Infinite any day of the week.


Dark Souls and kin: Not a masochist. If I wanted trial and error gameplay I would go get eaten by a grue. I like a decent difficult curve, not a difficulty wall, if I wanted that I'd go back to Eve.

Ukraine was overthrown in an unelected western backed COUP DE'TAT. Fascists backed by the west seized power and then embarked on a program of ethnic cleansing. Russia stepped in to assist them defend themselves and the west claims that resisting genocide is some sort of Russian military invasion.  

Crimea which has always been Russian, which is 90% Russian ceded without a shot being fired. 

All evidence is pointing towards a Ukrainian BUK system shooting down this flight and they are reaching for the most ridiculous evidence to counter that plain fact - EXIF data - LMFAO.

If,  on the other hand, it bothers you,  that's different and you need to do something about it.  Join your local social club at the pub for a beer (or whatever) or a communal walking/exercise group.  The thing that fills my soul the way good friendships are supposed to is volunteer work.  There'll be a soup kitchen or shelter that could use an extra pair of hands.  
Flying solo isn't a bad thing and doesn't make you defective as a person.  If it gets you down or depresses you, that's when you need to try something different :)

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Sound (like most things) is a wave. The ""volume"" you hear is how powerful the wave is. The notes you hear is the frequency of the wave. Frequency means how many ups and downs the wave has. It makes a lot more sense with pictures, just imagine your speaker pushing air towards your ear, and your ear picks up the little movements in the air. The bass would have lower frequencies, and higher sounds have higher frequencies. A whole orchestra playing from one speaker is a pretty complicated wave, and hard to imagine what it looks like, so check out the links I've included that explain it better than words can.

[This](http://animagraffs.com/loudspeaker/) is the best explanation I've ever seen.

Now that you know sound is a wave, you'll understand how supersonic planes [break the sound barrier](http://imgur.com/r/educationalgifs/bfk0KHR) when you hear a sonic boom

[This is just a cool water and sound experiment](http://imgur.com/r/educationalgifs/sAuns6d). The water just kind of rides the sound wave. 

And now that you get that, it'll be easy to understand the [doppler effect](http://i.imgur.com/HVGsAAa.gif) 
But the .gif I used wasn't the best example. If you want to learn more about the doppler effect look [here](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/doppler/doppler.html)

After January, money has been tight for me and it's now been 4 months since I've last seen him, so we were aiming for me to visit him at the end of June/the beginning of July. We'd talk every day. It's me always visiting him because it'd be awkward for him to come visit me (the city I'm in isn't fun for either of us, I live in a boring area, my living situation would make it awkward). If I had money coming in on a regular basis like I used to, I would be visiting him every month if I could.

Early into the relationship he wanted me to move over there, but I'm from Canada, so it would've been extremely difficult and financially unrealistic to make the move although I would've liked to.

We never got around to discussing any sort of end point. I'm not entirely sure if he ever saw a future with me or if he had one in mind. While I've imagined a future with him once in a while, I'm hesitant to think of those things seriously if I don't know he's on the same page as me. It was extremely hard for me to tell how he feels about me or the relationship at any point because he can be really abrasive and critical, and I'm very sensitive and try to bottle things in so I won't start petty arguments.","1433117273"

Our friendship completely fell apart. Despite setting rules like, don't just borrow shit without asking, she would take my things without asking even though I would have let her borrow whatever she wanted if she only asked first. The one time I asked to borrow her jeans she told me no because my ass would ""stretch them out.""

One night we had an argument and so she left the room throwing a ""fuck you"" over her shoulder, while I was the bad guy for throwing it right back. She then proceeds to whine about me to all of our mutual friends, allows a couple of them to use her key to lock me out of our room while she ""slept outside"" when I went out to a party that night. Then gets mad at me when (because I figured she'd lock me out and so I had taken my key) I get back in the room in the morning and lock the door behind me. How dare I lock her out? She was just an innocent victim in all this.

A few times when her boyfriend was visiting she would lay basically naked in bed with him except for a skimpy thong and a pair of boxers. At the end of the year she wrote me a two and a half page note about what a terrible friend I had been and that if I wanted to repair the relationship I had to work on myself and then reach out to her over the summer. If she deemed me up to her friend standards I could then give her one or two things to work on herself. She left this on my bed right before she left so that I couldn't confront her face to face. As was her way of saying anything to me. I always got fucking notes. And if I wrote one back, because God Forbid I try to talk to her in person about it, she would mark it up with red pen like a teacher grading a paper.

She also tainted my roommate for the next year by talking shit about me to all these people I didn't know. That girl happened to be her friend freshman year and had heard her constantly complain about me, so that girl took it upon herself to constantly try to fuck with me when we were roommates the next year.

And when we were seniors she couldn't understand why I still didn't want to be her friend.","1433117273"

http://phawrongula.wikia.com/wiki/Atheism%2B

""*Matt Dillahunty was a public advocate of Atheism+, although mostly not involved with the group itself. In an attempt to prove critics of Atheism+ wrong, he posted some criticisms of the group under an anonymous account (called 'curious') in order to show that they would take an argument solely on its merits, and not based on who posted it.*

*However, he actually proved them right: his topic was deleted (ostensibly for being off-topic). When he asked what happened, he was treated very dismissively by the Atheism+ moderators until they learned it was him, at which point they began to treat him more respectfully. His anonymous account was banned for going against the 'no sockpuppets' rule, but he was allowed to carry on the discussion under his normal account.*

*Upon learning of this incident, Jason Thibeault (Lousy Canuck) made a blog post suggesting that he owed them an apology. Matt refused, which caused him to be shunned by most of the members, although he remained supportive of the movement in spite of this.*""","1433117274"

At one point in time it was believed the earth was flat and skeptics proved otherwise. If nobody was skeptical about Einstein then his theories wouldn't be challenged and improved.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","The Devils major problem is they have a lot of playmakers and not enough finishers. Zajac and Henrique are both capable (in my mind) of scoring 60+ points a season, but without that 1 really strong offensive player they slip into a 20-30 point season. If we can somehow find a top line forward I think the Devils are in decent shape, but it depends how we will get it. The Devils have some tremendous defensive depth (i would say the best in the league). And as far as 2/3/4th line I would say we have some decent depth as far as forwards are concerned. What we need is a Tarasenko,Pacioretty, or a Parise. These arent players you need to tank for, these are guys who the Devils could realistically get in this years draft ( depending how they manage the draft). 

The Devils have never relied on overly high producing forwards. And despite our offensive woes we have had really solid defensive numbers the past couple years.","1433117276"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","So this might be a tad long, but this is something that I get very angry about.  Not sure why, but I do.

The opposite of Classy is not flashy.  It's declasse.  Often that correlates to flashy, but they are not the same.  It's an important distinction.

A 69 6.3 is Flashy as fuck.  It has a massive chrome grill, sticks out like a sore thumb among today's cars, and is expensive to maintain.  But its also classy.  A Miura is incredibly flashy, it might be painted bright orange or green, and yet, it's classy. 

  Classy doesn't compete, it doesn't need to be the latest or greatest, in fact it pretty much can't be the latest or greatest.  Furthermore, I hate when BMW owners (not you, or maybe you) claim their newish BMW is classy because its understated.  Classy is like fightclub.  The first rule is you don't talk about it if you are classy. The objective is to be quietly better than others so that someone will eventually say (hes/she a classy guy/gal).  If you say it yourself or about something you own, you've already lost.

A BMW M4 on one hand is understated, but it's too new money to be classy. Its embroiled in a conflict with the ATS and the C63, and it tries to be better than them. Classy can't be concerned with being better, it has to be quietly better.  A guy in a Miura doesn't have to be faster than you, he wins either way.

Those are my view on why the M4 isn't classy, here is why I don't think it's art.

The reason I don't think the M4 is art though is very separate from that.  It has nothing to do with the M4 being subtle.  It has everything to do with the designer's intent.  I think in today's day and age we focus to much on the viewer's experience rather than the Artists intent.  

There was an episode of topgear where Clarkson quoted some museum I think saying that art can't have a function.  I think hes totally wrong.  Art is anything that was made by someone with the principle intent of producing an emotional response.  The M4, regardless of how well it drives, or the amount of emotion people feel towards it, was principally designed to be the best luxury compact(ish) performance sedan possible.  In doing so it generates lots of emotion.  You feel it, as many other do, including myself.  But I don't think it was the principle objective in the way it was for the Testarossa or the Cadillac Ciel.

So like I said, it comes down to how you define art.  I define it as anything made by someone with the main objective being the stirring of emotions in another.  With this definition, emphasis is taken away from the person experiencing the piece.  You may disagree with this definition, but that is the definition I use.

None of this is to say that the M4 isn't beautiful, the best car in it's class, or a future classic.  It may even stir more emotion in you than a Miura does.  It just isn't classy or art by my definitions, which as I've said, maybe the worst definitions in the world, but they are how I feel.","1433117277"

Expect to be lost for the first few months and stick out like a sore thumb. If you've not experienced it before there's a whole vocabulary that will be new. Things like calling a cell a peter, heroin is kit, everyone knowing how to play bella(a card game a bit like hearts but with some fairly convoluted rules). The biggest downer is having every aspect of your life controlled and restricted, if you can fall back on your own internal resources you'll do ok. Be aware that there will be a load of wee annoyances that will build your stress levels to the point of blowing. If you feel like that walk away if you can. If you're in your own cell there's always the knowledge that at some point the door will lock and you'll get some peace for a night.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","You're 50% right.  Stock market is one of the best ways to grow your money, but you need to have a long enough time horizon.

Imagine if you were having this conversation in 2007?  You'd have been DECIMATED 2009 and it would be 2012/2013 until you recovered to where you were in 2007!  If you stuck with it, you'd have now increased your holdings by maybe 60%.

So, the lesson?  If you can ride it out, the stock market is a great move.  If there's any chance you'll be counting on that money in a specific timeline, it is a very risky strategy.  

That said, if you could 'take or leave' owning a house, could ride out renting another 2-3 years if the market tanked, it's not as bad of a thought to invest.  But if you're set on 3-5 years purchasing a home, do not put your money into the market.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","The thing I've learned about certain people man, especially females from my personal experience, is that they will do whatever it takes to stay in a secure situation. You obviously seem capable to provide for her in her eyes and that's enough of a reason to stick with someone especially considering she probably she has no idea what she really wants in life and no real handle on herself and she probably knows that on some level. Two choices in her eyes: stay because she's alone again otherwise, or be single and either focus on being single or go right after another man. Clearly she doesn't seem like the type to stay single. Conclusion, if someone better in whatever way comes along in the future I doubt she would hesitate much before taking the better choice, if it came along. 

In other words, don't read too much into why she is staying. It could be and very well is partially because of you, but man if she isn't making any real effort to make changes on her end or putting herself out there, that says a lot to me. She's pushing marriage? Hell no any man who values his future will make sure kinks are worked out before taking that step. Do you think you can do more to help make that happen? To open up communication where she's willing to hear her faults? And will she meet you halfway at all? Just because she can bounce back and be kind doesn't speak for the times she's not kind. That's equally a solidified part of who she is.

I was serious about this one girl. She acted like she was crazy in love with me. Another guy enters her life. I become hesitant about it because she had gone down that road in the past with us. We had a long history, I didnt want to deal with the what ifs with her and I decided it was time for me to move on and focus on myself. She goes suicidal but I make sure she is OK and won't actually do anything. Less than a month later, option 2 is about to leave her life because she lied to him about certain things. Guess what? She goes suicidal on him too. After just being crazy in love with me for a long time? Clearly she's just doing what it takes to survive. And her terms of survival is sticking with a man who will take care of her. I'm very glad I ended things with her even though it was a really tough decision. I fell for her harder than anyone else and opened myself up to her more than anyone.

The insight to be taken from this? People are always looking out for number 1. Themselves. That's not always a bad thing of course, but in more specific context, some people will do whatever it takes to not be alone. This, is the long answer to your question. I hope it helps.","1433117284"

I'll agree that they played a shit game, though. They just weren't in it.

"MAABMakeup","t5_38du9","I did a really basic go over in the videos I posted if you want to maybe start there. Although I'm guessing from your question they may be a little too basic for you.

I take three coulours, either three shades of the same colour, dark, medium, and light versions of. For example lately I favour a dark hot pink, a lighter hot pink and a light pink.

The dark colour I put over my entire upper eye lid from the lashes up to the crevice where your eyeball and skull meet. Put it on nice and thick so the colour is very solid. I then do another line with the medium colour that extends around that, this is usually about five or six millimetres. Then do the same with the lighter colour around the edge of that. The shadow should not be super visible when you're standing front on to a mirror with your eyes open, at the outer side it comes out just a little bit further. Try and use colours that compliment your eyes. Like say I have really bright blue eyes so I avoid blues, I use a purple or hot pink and it really brings out the natural beauty of my eyes. Perhaps consider taking a look at my vid but just watching the part where I do my eyeshadow, combined with these instructions.

Or I take one colour and have a dark and light version of it with another contrasting colour which I just have one shade of. When I use the contrasting colour it quite often is blue but it doesn't wash my eye colour out because the other colour already highlights it. In this instance I would have say blended pink eyeshadow on my lid and maybe extending just past and then instead of the light colour blending back into my foundation, I have a blue highlight that further draws attention to my eyes. the blue is visible at the outer part of my brow just a tiny smidge. This may be a vit over the top for a work look but I totally rock this look if I'm hitting the town or something :-)","1433117286"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Now I would even say 500k if you live in a big city like NYC or any other global city with high cost of living.

My Japanese Wife and I probably are not having children but I would need at least 1 million yen per month salary (WITHOUT children) to relocate to Tokyo to absorb the costs of annual travel back to the U.S., IRS expenditures and to build a safety net in case of job loss etc. This would equate to 100k USD per year which is low because we would be living 1 hour outside of Tokyo and we can live in her parents house which has privacy via a detached unit. When they pass away we will inherit the property because her siblings don't want the house.

Now if we had no property in the Tokyo area then I would say 250k bare minimum to get a condo. If we had children I would need 500k as stated above but that salary is non-existent in Japan unless you are a business owner and especially as a Gaijin (foreigner) even if you have working permit/permanent residency via your spouse.

People often underestimate the costs of children in the mere fact that they open you up to more financial liability in the form of medical costs, legal costs and time costs as well. Always best to over-estimate your risk. It's hard to find a country where I can get good pay and a decent cost of living right now outside of America (aside from China which we do not want to go to).","1433117287"

Serei das poucas pessoas a achar que o Porto não fez uma champions por aí além? Eliminou equipas fáceis como o Basileia e quando teve um desafio a sério levou 6-1.
A estadia na champions do Porto também foi uma grande ajuda na conquista do BIcampeonato pelo Benfica visto que o Porto acabou por sair prejudicado ao ter mais jogos disputados neste caso.

I remember driving along the country roads of Virginia about 20 years ago when I rounded this curve and there was this box turtle ambling across the road.  It was in my lane but clearly wanted to get across to the other side.  I pulled over, got out of the car and went over to the turtle.  I picked him (or her) up off the road and carried it to the other side.  When I put him down he came out of his shell after a while, did a 180 and headed back to the road.  I turned him around and he did the same damn thing.  So I figured I'd better return him back to the side of the road he came from.  When I did, he pulled the same 180 crap on me again.

Now, I'm getting hot and tired of playing turtle crossing guard and I was thinking about putting him in my car and taking him to a vet or an SPCA shelter.  And that's when the little guy decided to do another 180 and headed back towards the woods about 20 feet way.  Thus, the last thing I saw was the little box turtle heading into the woods.

* **Carrie** by Stephen King - King's debut novel; don't have much to say about this one.
* **The Subtle Knife** and **The Amber Spyglass** by Philip Pullman - The second and third book in the His Dark Materials trilogy. I absolutely loved these books; HDM is now one of my favorite YA series/trilogies ever. 
* **Elantris** by Brandon Sanderson - I thought this book was quite good; I found the pacing a bit uneven, with the beginning being slow for me. The plot, once it picked up speed, was really interesting and the ending was satisfying.
* **The Lies of Locke Lamora** by Scott Lynch - I loved this book. I thought the Venetian city was awesome. The witty banter between the characters and the personality of Locke and the Gentleman Bastards had me laughing. There was never a lull in the book; I was hooked the whole time.

"AskPhysics","t5_2sumo","What Bell's Theorem shows is that, assuming that interactions are local (meaning that an action by one body on another has to be mediated by something in the space between them - no spontaneous action at a distance) and there is some part of the actual physical state of the system that determines the outcome of the measurement (a hidden variable), then the probabilities of particular measurements should differ from the predictions of quantum mechanics. Experiments show that the predictions of quantum mechanics hold, which implies that there are no local hidden variables. Within special relativity, the speed of light provides a definition of locality, so these experiments are done with spacelike separated measurements (i.e., distant enough and close enough in time that there's no change of reference frame within special relativity that will get you from one to the other, or equivalently that no information can travel from the spacetime point of one measurement to that of the other). Most physicists would rather give up realism than special relativity, so it's often taken as experimental evidence that the measured quantity doesn't have a well-defined value until it's measured.

I think the apparent appeal of single draws over 11-draws is based on a statistical fallacy because humans are very poor at processing probability. When you do a single draw, you feel like you have a pretty good chance of getting a 4\* or 5\* item. And you feel that way every time. But when you do an 11-pull, you *know* that a fair chunk of them...maybe five, maybe eight, maybe even all eleven...will be 3\* items. You feel cheated on those. You think, ""Had they been single draws, it would've been more likely that they would've been better items!"" But...no. It wouldn't have. Barring any truly abnormal RNG behavior, 11 random draws is always better than 10. ","1433117297"

"HaloStory","t5_2vomh","&gt;Pretty much everybody in this thread is making that assumption and I don't see why it would be illogical to do so. It wouldn't be the first time we've made assumptions and speculated.

So you're saying that it's okay to just assume that FERO is the leader of the SS without any evidence?  The *only* thing that could possibly link her is the possession of the video, and that is much more likely due to her having a contact on Biko.

&gt;It would be a gross miscalculation for any strategist in her position not to factor him into her plans. The MC and the Spartan IIs are an impregnable force that could decimate SS's plans or the plans of any insurrection.

She can factor him into her plans without assuming that he's the enemy.

&gt;I'd be skeptical as to how informed Fero is on the specifics of that.

She doesn't have to be informed on the specifics.  Even if she didn't already know (which is doubtful, considering that she can hack ONI with relative ease), his appearance on Biko is enough to make the connection.

&gt;Yes it would. If he is discredited, the UEG and ONI are more likely to view him as a liability.

How?  How would they be more likely to view him as a liability when they know perfectly well that he didn't do any of that?  She can convince the ignorant public, but she can't convince those who know the truth.

&gt;That's irrelevant. They can't put the truth out there because it would only serve to publicize SS. That's why Biko is on lockdown - Containment.

Biko is on lockdown because the UEG is covering the fact that they ignored requests for backup, that's stated pretty clearly in the episode.","1433117298"

Randall Carlson explained the math on the JRE pod cast, and IIRC correctly, the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs was equivalent to something like 1,000 times the combined nuclear arsenals of the US and USSR at their all time height. 

Essentially, detonating every nuclear bomb ever built would release less energy than single cataclysmic events that occurred on earth before almost any modern life existed. 

These are events that would have destroyed every single human on earth, and were catastrophic in every sense of the word. And this has happened many times over several billion years of Earths history.

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Are you using a starting pin to steady the piece as you first bring it against the bit?

Once your workpiece makes contact with the guide bearing, you want to keep it firmly against that bearing throughout the entire cut.  If you are hesitant and let the part drift away from the bearing you will let the bit catch and tear the wood.

Also, since you mentioned it.  Your template cannot move or slip - as you've maybe discovered.  If it does, your bit will dig too deep, you will not have any control of the cut, and you will get results like in your pictures.

Also, it looks like you are rough cutting pretty far outside your line.  You want to take the least amount off as possible with the router.

Climb cutting is a good way to eliminate tear out, but you really don't want to climb cut unless you are already close to your line.  Climb cutting with 1/8"" or more to take off is inviting sudden catch and grabs.

One way to use climb cutting is to cut your part out in the the standard direction with light to medium pressure against the guide bearing.  Then climb cut the final pass with firmer pressure.  The last pass will take off a very small amount, but the surface finish should be better.","1433117300"

Watch the use of the word 'proprietary' TressFX was developed by AMD and it runs great on their own hardware (shocking that they like to show how well they can perform, right?), but it is NOT proprietary because it does not require a paid license to dig in and optimize for it (as far as I understand) Nvidia's Hairworks on the other hand, does not allow AMD to see how it works, which is necessary for timely optimizations

Nvidia could also adopt FreeSync without paying; Nvidia could also optimize for Mantle, they simply choose not to support it, because then they would have to admit AMD is good at something. AMD chooses not to add the cost of the CUDA license, which the customer would have to pay for.","1433117302"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Oh man.  You are giving me flashbacks.


Eight months into my temple marriage my bride came to me one night and told me what a mistake she made getting married.  She told me she was too young, should have waited until after her schooling was finished, and that I had robbed her of her ""college experience"".  She then told me that she should have married a returned missionary...someone who was more spiritual.  All this from the gal who I had dated for nearly three years and asked ME to marry her.


I should have divorced her RIGHT THEN!!  But I was young, and dumb, and scared.  Stupid thoughts came into my head like, ""Nobody else will ever want to marry me"", or ""This is an eternal marriage...God will make it all work out some way.""  Stupid.  


We went to our Bishop for counseling.  He was a nice old guy but his only advice was, ""All young couples have difficulties at the beginning of their marriages.""  He was useless.  


Things kind of leveled out.  She never apologized to me and the subject was never brought up again.  Clearly though the dynamic of our marriage changed.  I could tell that she was resentful and I became distant.  From that point on our relationship branched off and we grew in different directions never connecting again.


We stayed together, had kids (amazing since sex was rare) but basically led separate lives under the same roof.  I became increasingly miserable and became a shell of my former self.  Little by little I became a dark, non-caring, non-feeling, withdrawn person.  My office at work became my refuge.  I spent more and more time there and dreaded going home.  When I would go to bed at night and see my wife sleeping there I would think, ""Life would be so much better if you were dead.""


I knew I would someday leave her.  I thought I could stick it out ""for the kids"" until they were out of the house.  It turned out I couldn't do it.  Two things helped turn me away for good.  The first was when my daughter told me that after seeing my wife and I interact that she would never get married.  The other was the last argument I had with my wife and she told me, ""No one else will put up with your crap"".  I thought, ""You know what...I think I will take my chances.""  And after 19 years of HELL, I left.


Your story strikes me as similar in as far of the depth of hurt your wife has no problem heaping on you.  Normally I would encourage you to get counseling together, but if you are like me, there is no coming back from that hurt.  Consider not wasting your time and strongly think about getting out now.  Yeah you might be scared about what you will face in the near future, but life is too short to live miserably.  I should have gotten out way back when before I had kids and could have had a fresh start with someone who cared for me over a religion.  I will never get those 19 years back.  Think about it.

"chemistry","t5_2qhf9","This mindset is one that is really easy to fall into. As humans we want to find patterns in everything. This tendency serves us very well for many things. It lets us do things that we consider trivial like recognize familiar faces and things that are a bit more complex like a doctor figuring out a disease diagnosis. However, we humans tend to let this tendency run wild a bit. We like to find causal relationships between occurrences are in fact not related (at least in that way). This phenomenon actually has a name...Apophenia. In your case you took Vit C and didn't get sick for a while. Yay! Now we need to ask the question, is the fact that you didn't get sick due to random chance or the Vit C? Is it signal or noise? Unfortunately we just can't get that information from one case alone. We need the same thing to happen many times to establish correlation and then even more rigorous evidence to establish causality. Might Vit C be an efficacious medicinal for some diseases? Sure, but until there is a systematic evidence base showing it to be so, one should approach with a high index of suspicion.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Story Time.


When I was about 9 or 10 some new neighbors moved in next door.  They were immigrants from Guyana(well U.S. citizens now, and rightfully so, awesome people I'm still friends with today).  Anyway, their grandfather, an old guy about 80 lived with them, and spoke no English, but he spent his time developing a piece of land out behind the houses.  He dug the ground down to a recess about 3 feet and put raised rows in it to grow plants.  They grew some kind of fruit thing that I only now realize was something called breadfruit.  They also grew sugar cane looking stuff.


I guess this cane stuff required a lot of water, hence the recess, and each summer after the torrential FL rains stopped, TONS of that stuff would grow and we would go out there with machetes, cut off pieces and eat it.


This was back when all the kids in the neighborhood were allowed outside, away from helicopter parents, and a regular game we would play was ""manhunt"" (like tag basically).  On one rainy day, with about 30 participants in our neighborhood wide manhunt game, another friend and I decided to hide back near the sugar cane.  But the recessed pit was flooded with water.  Unfortunately, one of the ""it"" guys caught up to us, and the only escape was to ford the water to the across section of woodland.


I quickly kicked my shoes off and swashed through the nipple high water.  Before getting to the other side I turned around so I could witness the ""tag you're it""-ing that was going to happen (the friend with me was a larger, slower kid), but he wasn't there!  He has disappeared UNDER the water to swim quickly across, only to come up covered in ants.


Now, I'm not talking about a few ants.  It's like the ants were a blanket in a swimming pool, and he swam up through it.  This kid looked like a piece of candy that was left on the ground and was in the process of being carried away by the entire ant population of the State.


I mean, you ever seen that video of that one guy ""swirl coating""(google it) a helmet or something with carbon fiber pattern?  (it was popular on youtube).    He surfaced like that, but covered in fucking fire ants.


-----

EDIT:   A lot of posts saying I should finish the story, so I will:

CONTINUED
Well, he was covered in ants and didn't know it I guess because he was brushing them casually away from his face like they were leaves or dirt or something. Then I guess he realized it, and started flailing around swatting himself and ran up to the dry ground. But he was covered from head to waist. Me and the other kid swatted a bunch off but there were just too many. He eventually stopped breathing and we didn't know what to do. So we dragged him down to the water and washed off as many ants as we could, but he died. It was a terrible funeral to attend, and painful for his parents. Can you imagine losing a child to something so common in our every day lives? Sad.


Na not really. We just swatted some ants off him then made a run to a water hose. But he did actually have to go to the hospital because a reaction to all the bites. Dude was covered in chicken-pox looking bites for 2 weeks, but otherwise just fine.","1433117308"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I would sell small scale at nearly pure profit while establishing contacts with the ethanol industry and executives at fast food chains. As my underlings start dominating all the regional farmer's markets, I'd start selling bulk to grocery stores undercutting my competitors. At this point I'd probably be able to arrange a deal with chip manufacturers and Campbell's soup would suspiciously increase its potato percentage.

Word is going around and potato prices plummet across the board, but nobody knows what's going on yet. At this point I would begin colluding with the major fast food chains and ethanol producers. Yum brands would begin focus groups on an entirely potato based production line for Taco Bell and potato based pizza crust for Pizza Hut. Valero Energy begins arranging their ethanol plant for potato-based production.

I invest all my earnings in these efforts and then flood the market with potatoes. Yum Brands and Valero Energy go public with their prepared potato utilization schemes and projected profit margins. Their stocks soar over the next few days at which point I gradually pull out my shares in the companies, making a nice profit.

Now I fund potato-based nutrition and medical research at the top university. New studies herald the life-saving power of a variety of potato mold and nutritionists confirm that a potato based diet supplemented by a multivitamin can lower your risk of certain forms of cancer. I'd work with the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to establish potato distribution systems throughout the developing world. The world's poorest, now well-fed, switch all of their production over to cash crops, lowering prices across the supply chain and global quality of life skyrockets. Large-scale hunger is completely eliminated in  a matter of years. Scholars begin discussing the age of the potato.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Russia suffer economic collapse as ethanol encroaches on the fossil fuel market. International organizations attempt to limit ethanol production to stabilize the market, but America blocks all serious efforts under the banner of free market capitalism and many EU nations are happy to be rid of their dependency on Russian oil. Humanity is powerless to prevent its dependency on potatoes from becoming an existential threat.

I stop potato.

The economy *completely* collapses. All currencies lose all their value. Anarchy spreads in just a few short days. Millions die but what are they compared to the millions of lives I have already saved?

I sell some potato.

Nations are prepared to go to war over a few cargo ships of unadultered potatoes. To maintain their power grids, to fuel their armies, to keep supermarkets open in the few places that haven't devolved into anarchy.

America is rather cooperative, so I tell them about an English shipping yard just below the Cliffs of Dover that is exclusively dedicated to distributing the potatoes I have provided them. America invades and seizes the potatoes. Threat of nuclear war ensues. World War Potato is imminent.

As countries prep their militaries, I sell potato direct as it has become one of the most important war supplies. Then I buy out all potato-based industries by bartering with raw potato, the world's only remaining currency, and once again flood the market with potato. 

Maybe a few places get nuked, but in the process I have gained complete control over a new, global economy centered on the potato industry.","1433117309"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;Because it doesn't take human nature into consideration.

This one claims to make a definitive statement on centuries of philosophy. The enlightenment liberals who formed the basis for how we understand current society believed that man was a tabula rasa (blank slate) shaped by her education and conditions. Marx actually didn't accept this idea, you can read about his view [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch04.htm).

&gt;Because it never has worked before.

Don't even try to argue this one without getting a clear definition of success. Usually it comes down to ""every so-called communist state has either collapsed or embraced capitalism, therefore failed!"" Then they have to directly attribute the ""failure"" to a fundamental flaw in communist ideology, otherwise it's perfectly reasonable to assume that unrelated historical conditions led to the collapse of these states, just like all the failed capitalist states.

&gt;Someone will always take over power.

Which is why you put strong democratic processes in your system. Under capitalism, power becomes centralized through public corruption and the power of bourgeois media. I might be wandering into dangerous territory and directly challenging MLs, so I'll just say that under socialism, efforts to prevent revisionist influence by systemically distrusting the direct voice of the people always runs the risk of centralizing power, which opens the door to a small number of revisionists ending socialism. Perhaps allowing the people to make all decisions directly would make centralization of power even less of an issue than under capitalism.

&gt;People won't work if they aren't properly compensated!

Marx had plenty to say about this, particularly that people are in no way ""properly compensated"" under capitalism! But it's easy to shut down quickly: there's nothing natural about wage labor. Slavery and serfdom were earlier existing ways of obtaining labor power, and are now considered barbaric.","1433117311"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Friday evening, after work, Colleagues leaving do.
I head out at 7:30 to go to a mates apartment to pre-drink, I finally get there and after being let in to the apartment I start making myself a Jack Daniels and Coke, they were medium Jack Daniels probably 75ml of JD to 100ml Coke? I start drinking these very quickly left the apartment at 9:30pm. I have had no food prior to this night only eating at 1:00pm (A McDonalds Big Mac Burger and chips, thinking I would be safe). We head to the first location which is a small café (apartment friend and I weren't to keen on the location, but we still went out and made what we could of it). I get in to the café order a Craft Beer (5.6%? I reckon, maybe more.) drink that quickly and instantly feel light-headed/drunk I head to the toilets where in there standing whilst peeing you know how drunk you are, its the instant indication, plus the staring at yourself in the mirror to judge the drunkenness, I knew I was drunk and still thought I'd carry on drinking, left the bathroom, downed the rest of my pint and ordered a Bottle of House Red Wine for me and the colleague who was leaving.
About 2 1/2 Large glasses of this wine later and then one of the company directors came over with a bottle of champagne and starts handing glasses out, safe to say I knocked back one or two of those, then proceeded to finish off the wine.
The next part is all stories I have been told from colleagues as I do not remember a thing.

Upon leaving this café place we head to a bar, I am being locked by arms from two female colleagues because I previously ran over to a group of 10+ big guys who are on a stag do and had those visor caps on as if they are on a Pub Golf Crawl, I try to convince them to sell their caps to me or at least let me have one, two male colleagues feared I was going to get my head kicked in due to being so annoying and so ushered me back to the group going to the bar.
I am now in this bar (Somehow getting past the bouncers even though I am blackout drunk), I go to order a few drinks (£25 worth) and then decide I am going to refuse to pay the bartender, she then calls for a bouncer and tells them I am not intending to pay for these drinks, the guy then tells me If I don't pay then I have to leave, I explain to the bouncer ""Oh, No, I'm not the one paying, that guy is paying for these"" whilst pointing to one of the male colleagues who came over to try and help me not get kicked out, the bouncer faces him and asks him to pay and he's starting to get annoyed because he doesn't even know who I am and that he's not paying for these drinks that I ordered (I by the way currently pointing and laughing at him winding him up further) he then explains to me (in my face) that he's pissed off and I should go, I then decide to laugh at him more and attempt to square up to him (I am a 5'6"" male, he was about 6' something.) to which seeing this the other male who got me out of previous scenario comes over and tries to assist to which I square up to him and tell him to ""Fuck off!"". Safe to say that was a problem, I then get ushered to a colleagues car to take me home after not paying for the drinks and dropping and smashing a glass on the floor. meanwhile walking down the high street being held up by my Line manager and a colleague i'm screaming ""Help, I'm being kidnapped!"" to every passing person, also exchanging ""Hey, You're cute!"" To females who weren't obviously single. Upon reaching the car park I needed to piss and the multi-storey car park's toilets were locked I had to find other means, now I can't go into detail (as I don't remember) but I was told that a contractor for our company was nearby going towards his car after leaving earlier and my Line manager needed his assistance to help me piss as she couldn't help me. I don't know what they mean when they say helped me go to the toilet, but I never want to really know. (Did he pull my pants down? hold onto 'it' for me? hold me up? ... I dont know). I was later told by my Line Manager that I had pissed on my shoes and decided to flick them at the Contractor bloke and my Line Manager (Contractor bloke's wife was not happy when he explained how he had piss on his new shoes). I am then finally escorted to the full up car to get a lift home. Whilst on the journey home I ask the company's HR Business Partner whether she'd like to ""Spend a night at the Hilton with me, as it'd be better than going to my house."". I finally arrive at my house at 11:30, falling through the door thanks to the help of the driver and apparently laying with my dogs in their bed for at least 30mins, until my Dad told me to go to bed.

All I remember was waking up at 6:30, banging headache, no recollection of what happened after taking a sip of red wine and a feeling of ""Oh fuck, this isn't good!""

TLDR; Colleague leaving do, mixed a lot of drinks, exchanged arguments with two colleagues, In the first location at 9:30pm home at 11:30pm, no recollection, lots of worrying, embarrassing week at work with plenty of apologies being sent via email.","1433117313"

It says right there in the German ""Commissar Order"": 
*""In this battle mercy or considerations of international law is false. They are a danger to our own safety and to the rapid pacification of the conquered territories.""*

On the Eastern Front, Nazis did not intend to conduct a civilized war. They viewed it [merely as extermination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost). 

Now, combine it with the fact that by that time USSR did not sign the Geneva Conventions, and you can see why Soviets behaved with German soldiers the way they did. 

Crimes against German *civilians* by the Soviets are simply inexcusable. But when considering what soldiers did to soldiers in that theater, you need to look at the Nazi troops and their orders first.","1433117314"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I had always imagined this job would be more interesting. All those older genies I talked with always enumerated on all the virtues of being a wish-granter as opposed to other professions available to genies, yet I fail to see how any of them applied here. They always talked about how they travelled all over the world, staying in comfortable lamps and pots, to meet with people of different species to help them through their problems and grant their wishes. It seems this job has been boiled down to a typical computer terminal.    

Still, maybe I can salvage the fun from the alleged olden days of wish-granting. After all, I do hold the power to make or break someone's life, or at least in this case, their self-esteem. ""I wish I could be less fat,"" could be seen on the cheap terminal. Despite wanting to salvage the fun, I couldn't help but remember times have probably changed for the worse. This is a lot less personal than the old genies said wish-granting was. There's no opportunity to get to know the wishers or sit in comfortable lamps. Now, it's just *sit in an uncomfortable stool and press keys,* which is much cheaper than paying for travel fees and waiting for requests to be made by wishers.    

I thought about the wish on screen I hadn't answered over the past few minutes. Keep wasting time and I'll be fired.        
I typed ""N"" into the terminal and hit Enter.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","&gt; In Slughorn's memory, Tom Riddle already had the ring on his hand, which means he had already made a Horcrux while killing his family.

You're right about him having the ring at this point.  I had forgot about that.  It can be used to loosely date events.

&gt; I'm just not sure if he made the diary before or after this memory, there's nothing in canon that tells us if this is the same school year Moaning Myrtle died or not.


Between dialogue from Book 2 and Book 6 and the fact that he had the ring on his hand, I'm inclined to accept the Harry Potter Wiki's interpretation that the Diary is the first Horcrux.

From Book 2:
&gt;“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school.  But I wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my *sixteen-year-old self* in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead an­other in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.

(Chapter 17, establishing when Voldemort created the Diary Horcrux, emphasis added.)

Also from Book 2, we learn that by June 13 (of 1943, I believe), Moaning Myrtle has been killed by the Basilisk.  The [Harry Potter wiki](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Myrtle_Warren) cites this date as the date of her death, but Professor Dippet merely refers to it as ""the recent tragedy"" so there isn't any indication of exactly when it occurred during Tom Riddle Jr.'s fifth year, so sometime after school started in the beginning of September of 1942.

From Book 6: 
&gt;In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the or­phanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives.

(Chapter 17.)

&gt;New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour.

(Chapter 13, establishing birth of Tom Riddle Jr.)

And, again, there's the presence of the ring in the Slughorn's memory.

So the timeline would look like this:

Between September 1, 1942 and June 13, 1943 -- Tom Riddle Jr. unleashes the Basilisk, killing Moaning Myrtle.

June 13, 1943 (assuming the memory from the Diary Harry sees is all on one day; it's presented as one fluid stream of consciousness) -- Tom Riddle Jr. frames Hagrid for opening the Chamber of Secrets.

Between June 13, 1943 and end of term* -- Tom Riddle Jr. realizes that Dumbledore suspected something and creates the Diary.  I will admit that it is entirely possible that the Diary at this point was not yet a Horcrux; however, I think that the only way Tom Riddle Jr. could ensure that the person who reads the diary will be able to unleash the Basilisk is if he puts his a piece of his soul in it.  Dumbledore argues that Tom Riddle Jr. would ascribe significance to the diary as proof he's related to S. Slytherin

Summer of 1943 -- Tom Riddle Jr. kills his father and his paternal grandparents and ostensibly (though, as LuluRex points out, doesn't necesarilly) creates the Ring Horcrux.

Sometime after September 1, 1943 -- Slughorn memory

*We know it was sometime before September 1943 because the Diary tells Harry the Chamber was opened and a student died in Tom Riddle Jr.'s fifth year.

**TL;DR:** By the time Tom Riddle Jr. asks Slughorn about Horcruxes, he has two objects that become Horcruxes, but has already killed at least four people.","1433117320"

It was strange the way she looked at me as if I had just gotten out of the asylum, or someplace society would reject one to. Perhaps it was my clothes? I looked down to see normal attire: jeans and a t-shirt. I was in the street in a busy downtown area with cars rushing by and people walking in all directions, but this woman who was staring at me seemed to have… some connection to me. She was about three feet away and never said a word to me, her eyes steady on mine, and the world going faster than ever all around us.

At last I broke eye contact and looked down at my clothes again. My clothes were not the same as before. I was holding a black briefcase and had a well-tailored suit on. I looked back at the woman to see she was smiling at me, not a mocking smile, but one that a teacher would have after a student finally understands a difficult math problem. As if it was a guided sign, I dropped my briefcase into the street and stuck my right index finger into the palm of my left hand. It went through. All at once the world around the world around me seemed to explode with color and detail, drawing me in to every intricate design in all the buildings surrounding me.

“You did it,” the woman finally spoke, as if she was waiting for this to happen so that this conversation could take place.

“Did what?” I asked, my mouth probably agape with awe of my new found vision and perception. While my eyes were gazing at the tall skyscrapers, the woman grabbed my hand and took me into a car parked across the street, a blue Cadillac. I didn’t get a good look at the badges, but the body was unmistakeable. As I approached, the passenger side door flew open gull-wing style and I stepped in, not sure who the driver would be. But there was no driver. The woman closed the door and walked away into the downtown area, never to be seen again… because she didn’t exist.

As the car drove, I recognized the familiar sight of the half falling apart houses, small creeks, and the smell of industrial pollution as I headed northwards. Without a reason, the Cadillac started slowing down and nearing a sidewalk near a small, unrecognizable building. A woman standing there opened the other gull-wing door of the car and sat in the other seat, not looking at me once. But when she did… it was like the other woman did in the downtown area, with utter disapproval. 

“You don’t exist, I’m lucid dreaming,” I told her to break the silence of the quiet car ride.

“I know,” she said coldly, “You’re the third I’ve seen.” She looked at me in her usual derogatory manner. But her reply left me speechless, almost confused.

“So you mean… you consider this your reality?” I asked her skeptically, wondering if I had just unlocked the next level of dreaming. The possibilities if this was true would be endless. 

She looked quickly at me, “It’s messed up,” she said quickly. She fixed her coiffed hair and pointed to a curbside, “Here’s your stop.”

"themountaingoats","t5_2rr5z","Of course we don't want to speculate too much because then you sort of have this issue of The Quantum Goats where if you measure something it changes, but: what with ""Song for Black Sabbath's Second North American Tour"" and now ""Passaic, 1975,"" it does seem that a collection of Black Sabbath songs that JD has been threatening for some time is coming together. And of course we had ""Master of Reality"" a few years ago, so this isn't a new idea, just one that JD is coming back to now that WIWV and Beat the Champ is out of his system. 

I think it's sort of fun to predict it now and then come back to it in 1.5 years when another album drops. If you agree, please vote in the link!

My personal take: not really sure at the moment, and one of the things I love about TMG is going into unexplored territory. There's bands where you're like ""yeah, really into this one album, not so much the other ones, but that one album is really great,"" and you don't really feel inclined to ""get"" the other ones. With TMG, part of it is going to new places that JD wants to take you. So with more Black Sabbath exploration…I'm sure there's a lot new to say there, but it feels a bit well-worn and I kind of hope for something a bit more surprising.","1433117321"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Dude, you are just one big mess of excuses. I have a non-STEM degree, and I got my first 2 full-time jobs through Craigslist and my current through Indeed.com. I make great money, and I can afford a spacious  apartment in Chicago, which is almost as pricey as NYC. 

Also the ""if I get a job I'll lose my gov't assistance"" thing is the wrong approach. If you rely on gov't assistance instead of a job, you will always be at the income level of gov't assistance. A job is an investment in yourself. If you get a job that helps you develop skills and experience now, then next year you can get a better job that pays a little better. When I was in college, I worked minimum wage jobs (and below). When I graduated, I didn't make enough money to live on my own, so I lived with my family for 2 years. Yeah, i didn't get to have sex during most of that time, but now I have my own place with no roommates, and I can have sex any time I want. I've even dated guys who don't have money because I have plenty of money to pay for a date and can take them back to my apartment for sex.

What I'm trying to say is that you need to start looking to the future and not thinking about your current situation. Yeah your current situation sucks. But the decisions and actions you make now are going to get you where you want to be in a few years. Be patient in the meantime and just try to date casually, without expecting to get laid right away. Sooner or later, you'll find a girl who has enough of a connection to you that she'll want to work with you to find a place to have sex.","1433117322"

Not always, it can backfire in humid climates. Since it takes energy to turn water from a liquid to gas you are trading ambient temperature for humidity in the phase change from liquid to gas. Sometimes its a good deal, sometimes it isn't.

That said, a small window AC unit and a shut up room is pretty cheap.

"korea","t5_2qiog","No they don't. Criminal defamation isn't based on damages in Korea. The police also don't gather evidence for this kind of thing, you do. The evidence in this case is fairly clear cut, a record of where the person defamed you. Either a recording of something they said, or a copy of something they printed, that's it, that's all the evidence you need. 

Here is how criminal defamation works in Korea:

1. You go to the police and report it.  
2. the police call the person in  
3. They give you some time to come to an agreement if you want.  
4. If you can't come to an agreement, or they refuse your terms, you can tell them to send it to the prosecutor  
5. The prosecutor checks it to ensure the evidence provided is enough for a charge of defamation.  
6. They decide if they want to seek jail or a fine.  
7. they also decide if they think it's complicated enough to have a trial or simply to seek a summary judgment from the courts.   
8. The judge either issues a summary judgment or proceeds with a trial.

It doesn't matter if the actual damage is zero, the process and consequence is the same. Civil is where you can go after big damages if there was some major damage to your business or reputation.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Google already has three messaging services: Hangouts, Google Voice, and SMS(whether through Project Fi or some other carrier). In their own ways, they're each somewhat horrible. 

* Hangouts is horrible because the app is ugly, it's not well integrated with SMS, and it still has the Google+ brand associated with it. It also can't be used on Windows Phone or BlackBerry, and isn't open to third-party clients(which could fix most of these problems).

* Google Voice is horrible because Google doesn't care about it anymore, and it's only for the United States. The concept is awesome: one phone number and voicemail inbox for all of your devices, no matter if they're an iPhone, and Android phone, a dumbphone, or even a landline. It's also free for domestic calls, and inexpensive for international calls. The issue is that Google Voice-Hangouts integration is horrible. Hangouts only does some of what the Google Voice app and website do, and it has all of the issues listed above. 

The best way to fix this is to merge all of the messaging services into one. I'll call it ""Google Blabber,"" just for the hell of it. Blabber has three components. All of these components are based on existing Google services.

* The first component is a proprietary messaging service that has all of the cool features like voice messaging, read receipts, last seen times, and unlimited message size. It is an exact copy and paste of Hangouts, because the actual Hangouts messaging protocol isn't all that bad.

* The second component is an SMS client for the phone number assigned by your carrier. It lets you send SMS messages from any Blabber client, as long as your phone has a cellular signal and an internet connection. This is basically a clone of Pushbullet's remote SMS feature. 

* The third and most complicated component is the successor to Google Voice. It's branded as the Blabber Number, although the main Blabber client only does the SMS part of Blabber. Cellular and VoIP calls, voicemail, and call forwarding settings with your Blabber Number are in the Blabber Dialer app. The Blabber Dialer app can make calls from your Blabber Number, from the phone number assigned by your carrier, it can do SIP calls, and it also does video calls to other Blabber users.

The Blabber app does only Blabber messaging by default. You can get a new Blabber Number for free or port in your current number, just like Google Voice. Your phone number is associated with your Blabber account out of the gate, so that other people don't have to know your email address in order to message you on Blabber. Blabber has a web client, native Android and iOS clients, and an API for third-party clients.

"EDH","t5_2scee","EDH Rec bot has a lot of good suggestions. I'd suggest putting in a [[Radiate]], because Melek loves copying spells, and Radiate copies it for everything. It can also turn spot removal into a Boardwipe.

You'll also want more copy spells in the deck, and more spells worth copying. [[Bonfire of the Damned]] copied twice can be a game ender.

More draw, as well [[Blue Sun's Zenith]], [[Stroke of Genius]], [[Invoke the Firemind]] (Best used as either a draw engine, or a game ender!), and [[Mind Spring]]. These can all be used to draw a ridiculous amount of cards, when cast for minimal mana from the top of your deck.

Melek can be a bit slow, as he's not in the best ramping colours. [[Solemn Simulacrum]] is a godsend in any non-green deck. Not only does it get you a land, when it dies, you also get to draw a card. On top of that is [[Dreamscape Artist]]. Nobody cares enough about Dreamscape Artist, until you start ditching lands you have stuck in hand, to get more lands out of your deck. All of a sudden it's turn 5, and you have 10 lands on field.

[[Future Sight]] and [[Magus of the Future]] will also be incredible additions to your deck, as it will allow you to play all the non-instant and sorcery cards from the top of your deck. It essentially reads ""Draw X, where X is the number of cards you play from the top of your deck."" There have been games I've won entirely because I had Future Sight and Melek out. it let me play the land sitting on top, then I cast the Guttersnipe sitting on top, and then I started casting my game ending spells from the top of my deck.

Lastly, I'd suggest [[Mystical Tutor]]. Everytime I cast Mystical Tutor, it's to grab 2 combo pieces, like [[High Tide]] into [[Comet Storm]]. [[Dig Through Time]], and [[Long-Term Plans]] are also incredibly useful.

Here's my current deck list, though I am trying to make it more consistent and fun for everybody: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/melek-izzet-para-gone-yet/","1433117328"

"amateurradio","t5_2qi86","(Assuming US in the band restriction discussion and licensing portion of this comment)

The book [Build Your Own Transistor Radios: A Hobbyist's Guide to High-Performance and Low-Powered Radio Circuits](http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Transistor-Radios-High-Performance/dp/0071799702) looks interesting and useful. It gets good reviews, and from the sample pages visible on Amazon looks well written. It's not specifically ham related--most of the projects seem oriented toward radios for regular broadcast bands, but the principles should apply elsewhere.

I came very close to getting this, but opted for ""Experimental Methods in RF Design"" instead, which /u/molo1134 has already linked to.

As far as operating goes, [The ARRL Operating Manual](http://www.amazon.com/ARRL-Operating-Manual-Inc/dp/087259596X) would be a good choice. If you are going to join the ARRL (which can be useful if you want to build radios--there are a ton of radio construction projects in the decades of QST magazine archives, which membership gets you access to), you can get the operating manual for free with the right coupon code. I believe the correct code is N1. Google for ""ARRL coupon codes"" and you should be able to find the current codes. (There is also a list posted periodically in this subreddit, I believe, so search that, too).

When you are studying for your license, I'd recommend the ARRL license manual. It includes a lot of stuff beyond the minimal needed for the test, including material on operating. You can learn to pass the tests solely with flash card sites and practice exams and streamlined guides that focus narrowly on just what you need to know for the test, but the ARRL license manuals will give a fuller understanding and, I believe, better prepare people for actually doing ham radio instead of just being licensed to do ham radio. So, basically, using the ARRL license manual for your license prep would serve the dual purpose of preparing you for the test and giving you some operating information.

(But don't use just the license manual! I'd do the book, then use hamstudy.org or hamexam.org, or one of the similar mobile apps, to find and fix any weak spots, and keep things in your mind until you actually take the test).

BTW, you might want to consider preparing to take both the Technician and General test at the same session. Homebuilt radios tend toward the HF bands (30 MHz and below), at least for people who are not yet expert builders. The higher the frequency, the harder it is to prevent parts of the circuit from interfering with others, and the harder it is to maintain signal integrity without resorting to black magic and pledges of your firstborn to the Dark Lord. It's also harder to measure and debug at higher frequencies--there's a huge difference in cost between an oscilloscope that works great at 30 MHz and one that works great at 440 MHz, for example.

The only things a Technician licensee can do in the HF bands are CW (Morse code via basically on/off keying of a fixed frequency carrier) on 80m, 40m, 20m, and 15m bands, RTTY and data on 10m, and SSB voice on a small portion of the voice part of 10m (200 KHz out of the 1400 KHz available to General and above for SSB voice on that band).

Get that General license, and you get access to everything that is available on HF.

The OP wasn't asking about BKs, which is why your answer is incorrect.

Additionally, closed CCs may have a SOL of 10 years, but it does NOT stay on your reports for 10 years.

Again, ALL debts, fall off your reports 7.5 yrs from the DOFD per Federal law.

This can only be changed if there is a judgement against the debtor for the debt owed, which starts a new 7yr reporting period, or if the DOFD is reset by the debtor bringing said debt current. The new DOFD is then the date the debt is brought current.","1433117333"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","You're asking a very broad question as there are a *lot* of very different FPS online games with sniper rifles, but generally sniper rifles in games are designed to be high-risk, high-reward weapons that grant very high damage over long distances with the drawbacks being a very slow rate of fire and limited clip size. This puts a lot of emphasis on aiming and game sense, which gives sniping a very high skill ceiling, usually the highest in the game. 

Players with raw aiming skill will be very effective with it, and it's validating to be using proficient with a weapon perceived as ""skillful."" In addition, in most FPSs sniping is more or less the same, making it easily translatable for gamers. ","1433117334"

"colorists","t5_2yis7","Sorry I'm a bit confused, I've tried doing some reading. I'm using AVCHD footage off a Panasonic G6.

As I understand it... the camera is likely recording in rec.709 which keeps everything in 16 - &gt; 235. Premiere, VLC and QT are smart, recognise this and designate 16 as the black point. (looking at my scopes in Premiere everything is sitting just above the black point).

When I send this footage to resolve and use data levels it's setting 0 as the black point and 255 as the white point, but there's no information in this part of the image hence the washed out look? However when I export the Data Levels ProRes, Premiere etc... are setting the black point at 0?

Therefore I should be color correcting using the video levels?

Not normal huh? Guess they do deserve to die...

Seriously, there's a moral bankruptcy at the heart of this sentence. You consider social conformity and ""lawfulness"" to be more important then empathy. I might add that as far as I'm concerned every law in this country is illegitimate by virtue of the corrupt and irrational government that produced it.

That's nice. Brute force isn't working either. We need more creative solutions then this armed-thug crap. I don't see anything good coming out of anything you're defending here. I just see a de facto violence or dehumanization inherent in the whole biz.

Here is another one based on the same dialysis statement, the head of FBI for counter-terrorism says he thinks he didn't make it to 2011 either
http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1819280,00.html

""Quoting a CIA memo that said that based on the drugs he’s taking, he only had six to 18 months to live.""

In March 2000 the Chicago Tribune reports that an Afghan witness and “Western intelligence official” say bin Laden is suffering from severe kidney and liver failure. Link: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-25/news/0003250085_1_laden-bin-religious-militia

This story was also picked up by CBS News in 2000, who outright lead with the title that “Bin Laden Reported to be Dying” from “kidney disease.” Link: http://web.archive.org/web/20010212010328/http://www.cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,172666-412,00.shtml

In July 2001, the South Asia Analysis Group reports: “Bin Laden, who suffers from renal deficiency, has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of the Inter-Services Intelligence, (ISI) if not of Gen.Pervez Musharraf himself.” Link: http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/pap

In September 2001, PBS’ Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations. Link: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/terrorism/interviews/smith.html

In November 2001, The Guardian is reporting that French intelligence officials say bin Laden was flown to Dubai for kidney treatment in July of 2001, where he also met with several CIA agents and the head of Saudi intelligence. This story is also picked up by several French newspapers. Link: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism

In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his “kidneys are all right” and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has “nuclear weapons.” Link: http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2

This is a pattern. Something is reported, then magically it is backed off on when it does not fit the narrative. Like when he died--

And again
In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on “high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.” Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html

In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden’s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: “The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa’eda leader was already dead.” One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis. Link: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html

At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmhXSUIFLZ4

In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden. Link: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman

In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment. Link: http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/

In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden’s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: “I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.” She also notes that bin Laden’s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: “He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.” She also says that bin Laden “always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he “told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.” Link: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm

In March and April of 2002, U.S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been “neutralized.” Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: “We haven’t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time… I don’t know where he is. I really just don’t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.” Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PGmnz5Ow-o

In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears “about the same” (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have “learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,” but do not know when. Link: http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79973&amp;page=1

In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI’s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is ‘”probably dead.” Conveniently, bin Laden’s followers’ claim that bin Laden will “not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.” Link: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm

In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden’s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: “Some high-level U.S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.” Link: http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/

In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that “intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead” but that “they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].” Link: http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html

In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year. Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html

How about when they found his will!!
Also in October 2002 the D.C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are “probably fabrications,” and that bin Laden’s heir has been chosen. Link: http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html

The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: “The more we don’t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.” Link: http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/

In October 2002 CNN reports that U.S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden’s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden’s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001. Link: http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/

Second cushion is the rainy day funds. I allocate like $50 to it every month and I only use it when real troubles happen, like broken fridge or something else that's unlikely to happen.

If you can't uplift her then don't let her drag you down into her pit. People like that will destroy you as a person and shatter your happiness and wellbeing if it means moulding you in their image.

I hope one day she reaches out and finds that Jesus's hand isn't there. I hope she realises then that it's the people here, in this world, who care about *her* that truly hold her hand when she's in need, not a church community who'll spit her out like coughed-up phlegm as soon as her faith cracks. Maybe then she'll remember the person that just wanted her as a sister, not as someone to discard or insidiously bring her over to a different faith at the first sign of weakness.

"Adoption","t5_2qr1s","I am a birth mother in a very open adoption! My son is going on four this year and his parents are great. 

I was lucky to have my son's birth father with me throughout the whole ordeal. My sister's all had children young so by the time I had my son (almost 20), I had eight nieces and nephews, with only 3 years separating me from my oldest nephew. My sister's really struggled raising their kids and my parents took on more roles than just being grandparents. It was really hard, and it was hard for me to basically be forced into a parenting role very young (because my sister's needed help) and I didn't want that for myself. My mom/sisters offered to help me if I had decided to parent but after twenty years of watching them bitch about watching each other's kids behind each other's back, I didn't want that. So me and my son's father always knew that we would likely go down the adoption route if I got pregnant and was unable to terminate. 

I didn't have any special requirements going into choosing my son's parents, I just picked out profiles that we liked and put them aside. There was one couple I really liked and thought I was going to pick them until we came across the last profile in the binder. It was an instant, immediate connection. There was really no rhyme or reason to it. It just felt right. They reminded me a lot of how my son's father and I would parent if we did, and they were goofy. The thing that stood out the most for me was they had this picture of them posing next to this terrible stuffed penguin at a friend's wedding and they just looked so happy. That kind of sealed the deal for me. 

We had an emergency placement so we didn't meet M and A until I had my son at the hospital. They came the day of discharge, and we got to meet for the first time. It was like they were old friends. I got discharged before my son (three day long stay, due to c-section) but me and Z (birth dad) decided to stick it out until they were ready to leave. Up until that point, we hadn't seen the baby, because we wanted the first time we met him to be with his parents. So we hung around for an extra three hours while they got baby ready. They had him nice and tucked away in his carrier when we met but pulled him out for a few pictures. We walked out of the hospital with them, Z's arm around me, and his parent's around each other with baby in the middle. It was very very bitter sweet. But it was worth it for me. 

We now have a very open relationship. We email regularly, and send pictures back and forth. They live about four hours away, or I think we'd be closer. But we are very much a family, and I love my son's parents very very dearly. It has not been an easy road (my family was horribly not supportive), and it's definitely gut wrenching but it changed my life for the better. I was able to move out of a toxic environment, get my shit together and now I have the opportunity to move out of my home state like I always wanted and be out on the West Coast with my son's father like I've always wanted. And although it's very six degrees of separation how that happened, I don't think I would be in a position to do this, had not placed my son. But, every adoption is different. Make sure you look at all your options, and talk to a professional (a social worker at a reputable agency, even a therapist. Placing a child is a very traumatizing thing) 

If you are going through an agency to place a child, they will help you relinquish the father's rights. I don't know a lot about the process since Z was so involved but it would probably help to speak with a social worker.  

If you ever need to talk or have questions, please feel free to ask, or pm me!","1433117343"

"csmapmakers","t5_2yq3c","Alright I did a brief runthrough of your map! I have a few thoughts.

[This desk is difficult to manuever around, especially the area to my left.](http://i.imgur.com/2kJ4uSY.jpg) You should make this office wider in general.

Surprisingly dark [here](http://i.imgur.com/jnxjL3n.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/o2dUcFe.jpg). You need some interior lights for sure. I didn't test it, but I imagine it'd be very difficult to see a player inside these rooms.

[I thought you could close/open this door.](http://i.imgur.com/BPxcAXx.jpg) Consider making it a squeaky door, like those in Nuke and Cache, especially since it gives a nice shortcut to bombsite B.

[This seems like too good a bomb spot to plant for B.](http://i.imgur.com/8oWXeKX.jpg) The fact that you have to jump over the crate in order to defuse it means that both a T could just hide directly on top of the bomb to defend it, and that a CT can't fake a defuse to bait a hiding Terrorist out.

Super-long sightlines [here](http://i.imgur.com/puFj0ME.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/HkVmE8h.jpg). Consider adding more cover to them.

[I suggest adding a decal ""A"" pointing to the right](http://i.imgur.com/twqEDMD.jpg), it feels more consistent.

[This spot is extremely good](http://i.imgur.com/RAR8yGn.jpg), especially since you can get there almost immediately as a CT. Not only can you snipe at Ts approaching A from the beginning, T's can't get on the roof without you seeing them first.

[Bombsites A and B are mislabeled on the minimap,](http://i.imgur.com/SEIubE1.jpg) at least that's what I assume. What is marked B on the map has the decals showing ""A"", and vice versa.

General thoughts:

Not a bad map for the most part. Good amount of cover in the right places. I appreciate how vertical this map is, as well as how much you can platform from roof to roof. However, I'm not sure how useful this will be during gameplay since one can get to the bombsites quickly on ground level.

I wonder how difficult retaking a site may be. Having to check both corners on the ground and possible sniper spots above could be a living nightmare. This is also applicable for T's approaching bombsites to begin with, especially if it's been over a minute into the round.

Aesthetics seem okay, but definitely look like a work in progress. Your lighting feels pure white and could use a bit of color to spice it up. I've been using [this guide](http://www.tophattwaffle.com/lighting-tips-tricks-and-hints/) for my map and I feel it helps a lot.

Something I didn't get a screencap of is that your windows are surrounded by exterior brick. Windows in general are inset into their buildings, [look at this house for example.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/A._S._Bradford_House.JPG) I figured you did this so they can be used as platforms, but you can keep that by having them have a mini-balcony thing.

Overall, I think your map is alright, but will need some polish. Keep at it!

The next tier up would be the 9x compositions, who will stack TPAs or Rows along with orb changers/buffs/enhances to supplement their damage output. Verdandi, Skuld, and Athena are notorious for stacking TPA, and Skuld/Shiva/Urd will typically stack Rows. And I know for sure that even with a 9x multiplier, Verdandi walks all over descends up to Challenge 8 difficulty TPAing her way through.

As for what 36x, 49, and 100 is used for, challenge 9/10 difficulty descends are flat out boss rushes that typically leave no time to stall, as every floor is a final boss. so you can't all in a mini-boss and hope to do the same to the next floor.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","elaborating on what he's mentioned. try to look read into the glycemic index, glycemic load and the satiety index.

The glycemic index measures the impact a food has on you against glucose.
glucose is the standard and its at 100. a food such as raisin brand might have a rating of 70 while table sugar is 75.

different foods have different ratings based on fiber, and the types of sugar.
A food can have a high glycemic index but a lower glycemic load for instance do to it having a high satiety rating meaning it takes less food to make you full.

watermelon for example can have a high glycemic index but its glycemic load is low due to the high water content.

general suggestions is consuming whole grains over choosing refined grains as whole grains contain much more fiber.
Consume fresh fruit over canned and dried fruit.
canned fruit is often packed in syrup with plenty of added sugar.
dried fruit has the water removed reducing the satiety of these foods.

&gt;Here in his shrine, that they have forgotten. Here do we toil, that we might remember. By night we reclaim, what by day was stolen. Far from ourselves, he grows ever near to us. Our eyes once were blinded, now through him do we see. Our hands once were idle, now through them does he speak. And when the world shall listen, and when the world shall see, and when the world remembers, that world will cease to be. - Miraak's Chant

They're both have that same sort of feel, but idk. Miraak's Chant makes me think more about the kalpa resetting do to Alduin than anything else and doesn't much have the ""i am all are me"" feel to it. 

The characters are definitely parallels of each other, but I'm not sure if I'd say they're the same. Yes, they have similar goals, but Mirrak is a dragon who's power-thirst pales in comparison to the Sharmat's need to take over the whole dream.

I was totally shy in school.  I now have two kids and two ex wives and learned eventually that I'm quite the charming fellow when I want to be, and never had a shortage of women interested after I got started.  If you would have told me that at age 19 I would have called you crazy.  

It's easy at your age to think a year is a large period of time.  After all it's 1/19th of your entire life!  I'm 37 now, and honestly just don't care about meeting women anymore.  Or I guess I should say I'm pretty picky.  A pretty face that likes me back just doesn't cut it anymore.  She'd have to be pretty damn interesting in her own right to grab my attention now.

Time changes things.  Let it pass.  You will be looking back at this in a year or two and laughing at yourself.  I promise you. 

Also, I bet that yea, there are some differences to you compared to what you have in your mind as ""everybody else"" but I'm betting that that's an oversimplification since everybody is different from everybody else.  
You are focusing too much on what others have that you don't, and are blanketing it onto everyone.  Everybody has their own idiosyncrasies and doubts and problems.  Remember that.

You are doing just fine.  Cut yourself a little slack, relax, and let life happen on life's terms.  Try to focus on the positive that happens, and the things that make you different should make you proud, not frustrated.

If it was your company, there is an exclusion written in for the diminishing of value of your own vehicle. This makes sense, because you could damage your car to get damages and dim.

If it was the other party's company, you just need to [prove your dim](http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Diminished-Value). I won't lie, depending on the company, this part can take some effort.

If the other party is known but didn't have insurance, you can also pursue this line in small claims court.

**Additional info:**

-If you prove your dim to a degree that a reasonable person would agree you are owed it, but the company doesn't pay up, you may have a justified complaint for the department of insurance for your state. Check your DoI webpage for more info.

I personally wouldn't go for the Sport because for extra $1,500+, the power seat is the only useful feature.  The rest of that cost is buying you mainly aesthetics and a 2mpg combined penalty because of the couple extra hp and bigger wheels/tires.  The latter of which makes for a rougher highway ride. 

If you want some additional features over the LX, the EX makes more sense to me for a commuter because the extras are actually ""features"" you can use like sunroof, side camera, keyless ignition/entry, power seat, and upgraded stereo.

A lot of this has to do with social equality and justice, while other parts are more economic in nature, and revolve around the income/wealth gap.  But I think that there are groups with legitimate criticisms of current progressives, for instance the MRM, which are being silenced using intellectually dishonest means.  What this does is it presents a hypocrisy, where progressives expect the privileged to listen to their issues, and to address their issues, but aren't willing to do this themselves, on the justification that the grievances come from ""the privileged"".  I think intersectionality applies to more than feminism, and that feminism has been doing a lot of lipservice toward it with little real action.  If we want to foster real progressivism, and not just progress for some groups, then we need to start working on how we, as progressives, aren't living up to what we should be doing, instead of just pointing the finger at everyone else and expecting everyone else to change.  We still have the same idea of progress that we had in the late 70's, with the exception of an addition of LGBTQ issues into the mix.  We need to start worrying about addressing some of the more universal causes and problems, because attacking the symptoms is just spinning our wheels, and that can easily dig you deeper.","1433117352"

Im not 100% sure. I cant remember where I read it but I do think it will happen eventually. That said, [Corecraft](https://www.worldofcorecraft.com/) is considered the gospel of TBC servers. Its not released yet, but it is highly anticipated. Theres a long running joke about its release date so dont bother asking! Its out when its out!

&gt;i do not appear to be able to download nostalrius

What you can do is just download the 1.12 client (there are many sources) and just set the realm list to either Nostalrius or Kronos. There are tutorials on how to do this. Check out the stickies in respective forums. ","1433117353"

i improved my aim a lot by changing my crosshair.
sound stupid, maybe im imagining it, but the normal crossair never worked out for me.
there are crosshair editors online.
and dont be nervous. play it cool like the rest of the team, communicate with them,
so you know where enemys are.
i think people will hate me for this but:
if you REALLY cant handle the normal guns and want to run and gun...
use the P90. but its really not a gun for every situation and dont expect to get all the headshots.
the ADAD movement is useful for pistols, combine it with jumping and crouching to avoid being hit by enemys. 
crosshair placement is also VERY important. 
its a pain in the ass to see people walking with theyr crosshair on the ground.
ALWAYS aim for head. you may think that they all can run and gun with headshots, but that wouldnt be possible if they
didnt aim for head","1433117353"
"FantasyLCS","t5_31ago","* Keane looks as the most stable one, but C9 and TL are not easy to play against.
* Betsy was terrible this week, if GMB are still suffering from lack of organistation - no.
* Slooshi's stats are okayish, however wouldn't pick him with CLG next week. They are looking strong with Pob.
* Ninja is an unpredictable one, so wait for a week to see?
* Innox. NME are feeling quite good on NA scene atm. TL match might be really tough one, while TDK can result into anything, depends, on who's starting.
* Pepiinero is a good carry for his team, but GIA are going against EL and SK, the latter one may be a lot weaker than during the spring split, but Froggen's crew is looking strong, so it's a risky pick here. 
* Nukeduck has UOL and FNC as week 2 matchups. Playing with fire.


Overall. Would go for Innox &gt; Keane (see results of today's TDK-GV, I mean cheese picks) &gt; Slooshi &gt; the rest in no particular order (as the matchups are stronger)","1433117353"

- Make sure that their food and water supplies are always well stocked

- How big is the cage? Is it big enough to fit the two? Do they get along?

- Placement. Do try to place them somewhere where they will have adequate temperature and sunlight, and not too much of any. It would be informative to look up the bird information and see what they like. Also, if you do something, and you don't need any noise, I would not recommend putting them in that area.

- Try not to be too touchy with them, and slowly make yourself known over time.

Last several missions are poorly written and feel tacked on at the last minute, Wild Hunt are cardboard evil bad guys, and nothing is explained.

THIS. There is absolutely no reason for the SJW obsession with Cleopatra other than her being the only Egyptian queen they've heard of.

"Multicopter","t5_2u9hy","&gt; I like the sunnysky's for the price. I will most likely be using Sunnysky X3108S 720KV.

Why not V3508 700KV?  From looking at the spec sheets, for .01 more amps, you get 300g more thrust with 12x3.8 props on 4s.  I have seen a number of FY680 craft on 4s using the v3508 with 12""-13"".  The multistars I picked because they get 2008g thrust with 28 amps with 13x5.5 where as the two sunnyskys get 1680g and 1380g.

I always wonder about spec sheets accuracy. I think I start to get what to expect out of motors, and then see something that doesn't appear to make sense, and am back to just being confused and wondering if I can trust spec sheets and ecalc.  If I find a motor that matches a T-motor size/kv/poles, and it doesn't have a spec sheet, like Multistar motors, can I expect the same results?  I know the bearings are not as good and the winding's have less QC, but they should give a similar g/w ratio, right?

&gt; and i just put one or both on my backpack http://imgur.com/UsePkez

Nice looking quads, I do that with my 250, but I think the props would get ripped off on the trails we hike on, and banged around in the truck.

&gt; i saw a couple tri builds

Thanks for the links.  I see the tri^^3 uses  MN3110-26 470KV which are $62 each.  I know tiger is supposed to be really good, but that is just out of the budget, particularly if I need to buy 17"" props.  I see these Quanum MT Series 3110 470KV Brushless Multirotor Motor Built by DYS for only $20 a motor, any opinion on these, as tiger motors are just too much, the sunnysky at $38 is the top of the budget for this.  I like how tri^^3 mounted the VTx, but would there be noise that close to the motors?

Folding props are a must for this. Are there any particulars I would need to know about folding adapters and what motors they work on?

One more thing, with the CC3D atom, can I use a minimOSD?","1433117358"

"JapanTravel","t5_2uylr","What pace of travel do you prefer?  
Do you have a rough idea now of how many days you want in each of the cities?  
Are you limited by a budget at all?  
I think your plan is possible/reasonable depending on some of your answers to the above.  
If you are not limited by budet I would strongly consider flying from Narita to Fukuoka or Kagoshima. Jetstar Japan have a cheap early morning flight to Kagoshima on the 18th which may suit you for example.  
Then you can just work your way back toward Tokyo without any backtracking.  
If you enjoy train travel then I would just split the journey up so that you have relatively small hops between cities. Using your current list as an example I would do:-  
Tokyo - Kyoto - Kobe - Fukuoka - Kagoshima - Nagasaki - Hiroshima - Osaka - Tokyo.  
14-day JR Pass pays off probably no matter which way you tackle it but there might be a few other options if you fly direct to Kagoshima/Fukuoka depending on your exact itinerary. Depends a bit on how long you spend on Kyushu.  
There are lots of good ryokan/onsen in Kyushu so I would probably do that there. Kurokawa, Yufuin, Beppu, etc.  
I would start by listing all dates including day of the week and then place the city you plan on being in next to each date to see if you can make it fit.

There are deterred from writing the occassional bad check by the fees they will be charged by the bank.

Possibly, but there are at least three differences.

Firstly it is much more difficult to prove intent, if you had sufficient funds, but the transaction never confirmed.

Secondly, it is much easier for the police to tie a bad check, rather than a bitcoin transaction, to an individual.

Thirdly, there are no bank charges to deter the occassional bad check.","1433117365"

We all know he's a huge Mario and Zelda fan, and I think for him to hear Sonic mentioned in the same breathe as those two series is kinda messed up to him. Especially since they don't have a live, die, repeat sort of mentality. At least not in the same way as Sonic. It's possible, despite being faster actually, to play Mario in a take your time mentality. The pacing of the game isn't forced on you and you aren't damaged or killed because of how you play it. To me, when you die in Mario it's usually your own fault. You either misjudged a jump or an enemy. When you die or take damage in Mario or Zelda, you feel like you deserved to die most of the time.

But in Sonic, you're expected to memorize the level, but random enemies can just come out of nowhere. It just feels cheap when you get hit sometimes because you're going fast like the game wants you too and you don't have time to react to the enemy. And even then after playing it many times over, you can still be punished by going fast (Just watch Jirard play the game, he knows where all the secrets are, the layout of the levels, and still he runs into that problem). That system just doesn't seem fun to Arin, and as someone who grew up with a Sega in-hand... I sorta have to look back and agree with him. There's no way I think now that Sonic or Sonic 2 deserve to be mentioned in the same way Mario is. And i didn't even grow up on Nintendo.

This is a dish called mirchi ka salan, popular in Hyderabad, India (that's not the part if India I'm from, though). But it's one of my favourite dishes to cook and to eat. It's usually eaten with biryani.

Ingredients:

1. Peanuts - 1/2 cup.
2. Sesame seeds - 1 tablespoon.
3. Coconut flakes - ¼ cup.
4. Crushed Red chili flakes.
5. Ginger Garlic paste.
6. Onion - 1, medium sized.
7. Garlic - 4-6 pearls.
8. Garam Masala powder-2 teaspoons.
9. Red chili Powder-1 teaspoon.
10. Turmeric powder - 1 teaspoon.
11. Tamarind extract - ¼ cup.
12. Plain yogurt- ½ cup.
13. Anaheim peppers or Banana Pepper 6-8 (with stalk).
14. Salt to taste.
15. Oil to sauté.
16. Bay leaf- ½ or 1.
17. Star Anise 1 or 2.
18. Cinnamon stick - ½.
19. Mustard seeds 1 teaspoon.
20. Cumin seeds - 1 teaspoon.
21. Asafoetida powder.
22. Coriander leaves/Cilantro- to garnish.

Preparation:

The paste:

1. Take a pan and roast the peanuts and sesame seeds in medium heat.
2. When they start turning golden brown, add the coconut flakes.
3. Continue to roast this mixture till the ingredients turn light-brown.
4. Keep this mixture aside to cool down and when it does, add some water and blend into a fine 
paste.

The Curry:

1. Take a deep pan and add some oil to it.
2. When the oil is heated, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric powder and asafoetida 
powder.
3. When they are done “bursting”, add the bay leaf, anise, cinnamon sticks and red chili flakes.
4. Next, add the ginger-garlic paste.
5. Add the chopped onion, garlic and sauté.
6. Sauté the onion till it turns golden-brown and then add salt, red chili powder and Garam masala 
powder and Coriander powder.
7. Add the peanut paste, add some water and mix them all to ensure nothing gets stuck to the pan.
8. Cover the pan and let cook the ingredients for 5-10 minutes on medium heat.
9. Keep stirring to ensure nothing gets burned and/or gets stuck to the pan.
10. When you see the curry boiling, add the tamarind extract and yogurt. Cover the pan again and 
let cook for 5 minutes.
11. Slit the green peppers longitudinally; take care to not cut the stalk off.
12. Add the peppers to the curry. Make sure to get some curry into the pepper.
13. Cover the pan and slow cook for 15-20 minutes on low to medium heat. Keep stirring to ensure 
nothing gets burned and/or gets stuck to the pan.
14. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

One final note: Because of how reddit works (and the Markdown that's the name of the system of text formatting, and how HTML itself works, which is what Markdown formatting gets transated into), you can actually number things with any number, for example, in this list below, I'm using ""1."" for everything. It works:

1. first
1. second
1. third - all ""1."" at the beginning

Anyway, I hope this helps, because people will see your unformatted text and not read it, which is a bummer, because not only is this an awesome thread, but I'm particularly fond of food from India, so I want your post to be seen! And this thread was featured in the weekly reddit email. :)

Finally, you might install the Reddit Enhancement Suite. It allows for things such as viewing the source of a post - which is handy to see the text as someone entered it - it's how I could tell that you tried to make a formatted post, but just didn't know that critical detail of hitting ENTER - and you have to separate your lists into their own paragraphs for them to work. :) I hope you find my reply as helpful as I intended it. If I've managed to offend, I apologize in advance. &lt;3","1433117366"

* His current .173 ISO is near his '12 career high of .174, set in Coors. Let's tentatively mark him similarly for a dozen HRs full season then.  
* His career high in SBs was 27 and not 19. He may be getting the green light on the base paths more often but that doesn't make him a *good* base stealer. The break even point is 75% for successful SBs. Fowler's at 73%, so around there. If we extrapolate to his career high in PA's, that puts him at exactly 30 SBs. And that's if he maintains his current, career high pace. BsR (Base Running Runs Above Average) is a metric that includes SBs, CS, and taking extra bases. It's a pretty all-encompassing measure of value on the base paths. Fowler's only on pace for 3 BsR. He's already had four seasons above that.  
* His current BABIP is 57 points lower than his career mark so we should expect a huge increase in his BA, right? Not quite. Last season took a .351 BABIP to put up a .276 BA, both near his career marks. His increase in IFFB% and FB% will also hurt his BABIP. I'm comfortable pegging him at ~.255 BA, tops, rest of season. See my next point about LD% and Hard% for why.  
* That his LD% and Hard% are below his career norms hurts, not helps, your point about BABIP. Shitty contact leads to shitty BABIP. Those percentages are descriptive, not predictive, so it's not like he's due for regression. This is very important. His HR/FB%, on the other hand, is now 3.8% higher than his career mark. That looks fluky, which will hurt his already fluky ISO.  
* His BA/OBP/SLG/wOBA/RC+ are all below his career average. He's always had a good walk rate, so we can expect his BB% to rise by a couple percentage points and his OBP to rise by at least 30 points. It'd be higher if he was making better contact and helping his BA. He has significantly more value in an OBP league than a BA league.

So add that all up and what do we get? The same old Dexter Fowler. Couple more steals. Worse BA and OBP. The usual ""can't predict R/RBI"" caveats apply blah blah blah.","1433117367"

The rent on the house and the interest on the loan are the equivalent figures. That is the cost of borrowing the house or the money.

When you are paying off your mortgage though, you will also be paying off some of the principal, that cost has no equivalent when renting, because you aren't gaining a stake in the house.

It also because of this that it is usually much cheaper to rent a house rather than pay interest on a mortgage to buy that same house.

If you rent the house, and invest the extra amount you would have to pay if you had a mortgage on it, then you will probably find that you are in a similar, if not better, financial position than if you had bought it with a mortgage.

Shadowcleave is actually a great example since it's such an iconic comp (played and enjoyed it a lot myself over years). It used to be super good cause DK used to be a real DoT class that could easily double the dmg of any non-dot class, but since s14 this has gone down hill every patch and with the WoD changes to sustained healing output and mortal strike effects we're now in a situation where spread dmg strategies are weaker than ever - especially if you don't have any healing reductions.

And so the DK and boomkin dot cleaves died - unless UH DKs will magically start doing 100% more dmg than warriors, WLS will be miles ahead of DKLS. I'm not even exaggerating - the DK utility kit is balanced around being able to double everyone's dmg in 3s.","1433117369"

I've got a military career and a small arms weapons qualification, and 10 years as a private military contractor behind me, I am aware that a round will change direction after hitting bone, and that the nato 5.56 round is specifically designed to tumble inside maximising damage, but bounce around, no.

No round will bounce around inside, a .22 may hit the inside of your skull and skid around mashing your brain, but if a small calibre round hit you in the abdominal cavity, it's going out the other side, if it hit you in the thoracic cavity, it may change trajectory if it hits a rib or sternum, but it isn't going to hit another and bounce back and forth turning everything to jelly, if it has enough energy to bounce back on itself, it would just smash through the rib.

type this into google ""small calibre bullet bouncing around inside"" and read the articles it brings up, almost every one debunking the myth of the bouncing .22 round.

The reason a .22 is considered a good assassination calibre is that if you shoot someone in the head, point blank, they'll die. .22's tend to be smaller easily concealable weapons.

Part of accepting the index is not feeling that a topic is too small to include. Also, for topics where you may only have one or two lines of writing, but you want to find all at once, if you find a general word for those types of notes, you can put it at the back of the notebook and work backwards. 

For example, I study, work, write, and am trying to exercise more. I've also developed a love of pens thanks to this subreddit. 

My index therefore includes the months as they occur (e.g. May: p 1-16) and so topics that occur in that month naturally first fall there (Which helps with locations) so:

In the Intercept Interview, he returns to the car after the hole is dug. Adnan transports the body, handles the burial and reappears 45 minutes later. Jay doesn't see the body being buried. 

In his first police interview though,  Jay sits on the log and smokes cigarettes while he watches Adnan cover the body with dirt.

In that way, British Prime Minister Churchill is said to have commented that he felt fortunate to not have actually met Hitler at a diplomatic function where they both attended, as later he was nearly alone in his personal disdain for Hitler and his politics. It's largely because of this, that Churchill was able to recognize Hitler for what he was.","1433117371"

The linked site that 88MilesProwler has will (if you search around) tell you how to do it And if you look on Sideshow's thread, you will find my customs for 360. If you use PS3 or Wii, you will have to download C3 Tools (which is stickied in the forums) and convert the 360 file to one that the PS3 or Wii can use. After you've downloaded/converted the file, you can stick the files in a flash drive and plug it into the console.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand the collectivist concept of the union, but what I don't get is... why do I care about the power of that club? I'm already part of one club (the company)... and I want that club to grow and expand and be successful. I want to rise through the ranks of that club and eventually be one of the principal decision makers and steer it toward my vision of the company and its products and services. Now, I'm supposed to want to be part of this other club that is fundamentally set against that first club... As you said, it's a counterbalance against the ownership of the company. 
 
By lending myself to the union, I'm basically working for the betterment of the workforce as opposed to the betterment of the company. But the rewards are not proportionate. A strong union results in higher wages and benefits... but I'm never going to get to shape the company as I would if I were strictly working for the company. By being part of the union, I'm just a part of the pool of labor they have to draw from. By working independently, I'm an individual with agency and bargaining power on a scale that is small to the company but huge to me. If I do something great, I can use that to better my own position and standing in the company as opposed to diluting that contribution among the entire labor force. It's selfish, but in the end, it's my life, my career, and my well being. If I go into a career seeking to dominate and climb to the top of the ladder, I can achieve a lot more than if I join a union and get raises and promotions according to a seniority matrix. Plus, I'm then sort of required to do things that the mass of labor wants to do (like strike for unrealistic wages or benefits)... a lot of times, big groups of people don't make the best decisions... If everyone else is going on strike, that's a good opportunity to be a company man and increase my value by going to work and getting the shit done that actually pays the bills. ","1433117372"

"television","t5_2qh6e","The argument can be made that this all fits into who he is at the core.  Ryan starts the show as the young kid trying to figure out who he wants to be.  He knows he doesn't want to stay at Dunder-Mifflin, but since he's pursuing a business degree, also knows that this is the type of world he needs to fit into.  So, he sits back and tries to figure out his place.  Once Jim is transferred to Stamford, he sees an opening and tries to become the office prankster and even goes on sales calls with Dwight.

Then Ryan is promoted to corporate.  Once again, he's put into a place where he doesn't really know where he fits.  The difference is, this is isn't a position he can just sit back and wait until he finds an opening.  He needs to be a leader, so despite his efforts to be hip, he turns into a cliche.  His presentations are full of meaningless buzz words.  Suggestions and feedback are met with vague platitudes.  Outside of work, he's basically Gordon Gecko with the sports car, hot women, and yes, even the cocaine.  It's all a facade created to make him appear successful, and that facade extends as far as him falsifying sales data, leading to his arrest.

Thanks to Michael, Ryan lands back at Dunder-Mifflin.  He tries to settle back into his old role, but can't.  Now everyone sees through him.  They know he's not a success.  He's not a business wunderkind.  He's not better than them.  He can't even get Kelly back, the biggest tether to his old life.  Since that identity is no longer possible, he ""goes to Thailand"" with his friends, which just turns out to be him slumming it in a bowling alley with bleached blond hair.  He loses who he is and hits rock bottom.

After being rescued by Michael once again and a short stint at the Michael Scott Paper Company, Ryan lands back at Dunder-Mifflin for the *third* time.  Now knowing he needs Dunder-Mifflin, he has no choice but to settle in the role people see for him.  He basically becomes a caricature of what he was at the beginning, but it's something that works very well for him since he can disguise the fact that he's not any good at his job by just playing it off as him being a lazy bullshitter.  Ultimately, he settles on viewing his job as beneath him rather than realizing he's in the wrong line of work. 

When I was in high school, there were the kids who didn't really fit into any clique.  You'd see them in a button-down shirt one month, goth makeup the next, and then switch to athletic clothes and try out for sports.  We called these kids ""floaters.""  This is exactly what Ryan is.  He's the guy that has no identity and so little self-worth that he's constantly trying to show people he's better than them as a way of avoiding that.  All of his changes are him trying to prove this and all his failures are due to being so focused on fending off his insecurities.  

And it is this very drive that keeps him coming back to Dunder-Mifflin.  It's why he keeps going back to Kelly.  Michael and Kelly are the only people who validate Ryan.  When Michael leaves, Ryan tries to get that same validation from his new bosses, but can't (he idolizes Robert California and is rebuffed as a ""loser"").  And once Kelly leaves, there's nothing left for him in Scranton and he has no choice but to try to follow her in a desperate attempt to not lose his identity once again.","1433117376"

Playing the score matches and such, I've realized how important it is to own one because of the boost that it gives to your score, and being the rhythm freak that I am, I'm OCD about SSing everything. I'm good enough to S-combo up to 9 star songs, but getting no more than a B rank at the same time is saddening. I just started trying to reroll but it just takes sooooo goshdarn long and I'm freaking out because there's only 10 days left for the promo UR Nozomi, and I'd want that on my main account too ;A;

And of course, I'd want a Nozomi UR out of any other because she's the best girl~ ~~I'd want her to washiwashi me all day long nyahaha~~ No but seriously, she resonates with me more than any other of the girls. Being a spiritual person myself and already having an interest in tarot cards and the like, she immediately became my favorite~ I know my account's a tad on the young side but I'd be the happiest person ever if I got the account!

1. Devs say so (The Force section): https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/108101-ffg-developer-answered-questions/

2. When you are using the force to perform a force check on any check, you must use ALL available Force Rating (pg. 278, EotE). This is the downside of Overwhelm Emotions, because unlike Influence where you just pick rolled force points to use, all points go into effect to change the dice results, both negative and positive. So since all your available Force Rating is going to be used towards the activation of one Power/talent, it obviously can't be used on another power.

3. You seem to also be apply that instead of having a Force Rating 2 and using one die for each effect, that you get 2 dice for each effect instead. Which is also a no-go, because again, you're using all your available force rating to do one thing for a check. And that's all you get, no stacking.","1433117382"

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","I post this in all of these type of threads.  More a ""spooky camping story"" than anything though.

3-4 years ago I decided to randomly just go camping that evening, something I used to do fairly frequently. It was late November and I drove out to Shenandoah National Park. Parked the car, took the combat puggle,and hiked a mile or two down the Eastern slope of the Shennies then stealth-camped about 50 yards off the trail. The AT was on the other side of the slope, so the trail was a side trail(anyone who has been to SNP knows that you are very likely to encounter people on the AT, even during the ""off season""). It was cold, wet, wind was howling, and all the leaves were down. I could have been the only person in the park. Because conditions were so bad I basically went into my tent as soon as I was done eating.

The Combat Puggle is small enough that she can sleep down in the foot box of my sleeping bag. It was around 12F out according to my GPS and there was now icy precipitation hitting the tent in addition to random debris from trees. Around 2200 the dog wiggles out of my sleeping bag, and I thought she was wondering she if really needed to go use the bathroom. She wasn't barking/growling at animals outside...and when she does need to make a midnight bathroom call she normally kinda paws at my face. She stays like that for about a minute, and I notice she's just staring at the tent wall, then she abruptly crawls back into the sleeping bag.

Right as she settles a light goes off near my tent, probably not more than 10/20 ft from it. Didn't hear anyone walk up to it. The light stayed pointed at my tent for a what was probably only ten seconds, but seemed like eternity. It didn't move to my backpack(which had my permit out so rangers wouldn't wake me up asking for my papers...I had been advised that if a ranger sees a backpack with a permit on it outside of the tent they'll just keep moving rather than bothering you) and no voice came out to announce themselves; a dangerous thing since it's, you know, Virginia. The light went out, and I strained and strained but could not hear anyone walk off. A few more times during the night the dog re-did her actions, but no light came on those times. As soon as it was light out I packed up and left.

Who would go out wandering the woods in bad weather, and then walk a distance off the trail directly to a tent unannounced, turn on the light, turn it off and walk away? And maybe repeat it a few more times during the night? Very weird. I've since decided that it probably wasn't a ranger for obvious reasons and it probably wasn't some guy hiking. I was reasonably close to the edge of the park, which makes me think it might have been a poacher.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","I made a similar comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/37yils/a_look_back_at_the_ouya_a_tale_of_failure/crraq16

&gt; I have nothing for or against the Ouya, but I think the major thing about it was that tons of backers were touting it as some amazing thing that would revolutionize consoles. Whereas a lot of people saw it for what it was: a cheap Android device.

&gt;I mean there were people that legitimately thought this was going to be huge competition to consoles like the PS3 and 360. I remember anyone that even remotely criticized the device was met with harsh pushback from backers.

&gt;I really never understood the hype it generated. It was completely unwarranted. I also don't understand why it's become such a laughing matter. I really think the device suffered from way too much hype, and incredibly far-fetched and impossible expectations. A lot of people were, for some reason I don't understand, seemingly pissed when they got exactly what the Ouya was: a low powered device.

&gt; Which is a shame since these types of devices actually serve a legit purpose. I just picked up a Nexus Player and it's absolutely perfect for what I wanted.

Ultimately, I just don't understand what people expected or why they expected it to be anything more than what it clearly was.  I'm afraid Ouya's failure tainted the idea of having Android devices in the living room.  Especially with the advent of in-home game streaming.","1433117384"

I probably would've saved a lot of time and grief. I don't know if I can ever truly **trust a girl again**. I'll always feel like **they're doing things with their guy friends behind my back**. It feels bad. It's one thing to feel lonely but it's something else entirely when you know you've been **a chump this whole time for trusting someone.**

I understand you are angry and venting right now but it's not going to do you any good to start feeding this negative and hateful thought process.

"modelmakers","t5_2sf9u","I tried something a little more unconventional for the tracks. I primed them, as you do, then gave a base coat of a dark rusty colour (airbrushed, acrylics). Then I made a lighter coat of rust, and diluted it *heavily* to the point where it was more or less watery. I applied it to the tracks, as you would an oil wash (just a regular paintbrush was used). The upside to that, apart from the different asthetic, is it took minutes to dry, as oppose to days. Mind  you I did all this before the tracks were mounted on the tanks, else I would have gotten that watery paint absolutely everywhere. So after everything dried off I mounted the tracks, and gave my model the standard coat of floor wax. Afterwards, I used the common trick of rubbing a pencil on the tracks for that shiny worn metal look. (use the side of the lead, not the tip). I haven't done the pencil thing before applying the floor wax out of fear that the clear coat would take the shine away slightly, but that may not be true.

I like to think I came up with this method in a fit of genius, but I just hadn't a clue what an oil wash was at the time, so I faffed about with acrylics.","1433117385"

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt; When the core of your existence is ""me against the world"", honestly would you share the money?

&gt; Would you place trust in a stanger? 

There's no trust to be placed here. 

The issue presented here isn't prisoner's dilemma. I would be less inclined to punish someone for acting self-interestedly in a prisoner's dilemma, because a prisoner's dilemma actively punishes charity. 

But here, the party who splits the pot doesn't risk losing the whole pot while someone else profits. All he does is forfeit 50% of an unearned benefit. He still gets to keep $50,000 for himself no matter what. 

And truth is, I wouldn't even hold it against someone who kept *most* of the money. I just want to know that when given the opportunity to substantially help another person at no actual cost to himself, he took it. 

Would I hold it against a guy who divied it 90/10 for himself? Maybe, but I probably wouldn't fire him. 

80/20? I don't think I'd hold it against him, but neither would I be that impressed with his character. 

70/30? Now here's someone I can like. 

50/50 is truly decent. Someone I would be proud to call a friend, partner, or employee.  

And on the flipside, btw, I'd be annoyed at someone who gave away *all* the money. I wouldn't dislike him the way I would someone who kept all the money. But I would wonder why he doesn't think his needs matter as much as someone else's.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I was at a small show, small room, Jim Carroll band at Receiving Studies in Berkeley, California, and the room was crowded, but there was 15 feet of unoccupied floor directly in front of the band, because the speakers were blasting and nobody could endure standing any closer to them. Band was against one of the longer walls, facing the narrower dimension of the room, then 15 feet of unoccupied floorspace, then a shallow depth of audience hugging the far wall. Most of the audience stood to either side of the band.

Why didn't they turn the volume down? Because rock music is supposed to be loud. Even when loud is stupid. Principle over practicality. Mindless tradition: that's just how it's done. Obviously the noise is driving people away, yet nobody sees anything wrong with that.

I was at a small show, The Proclaimers at the Berkeley Square. The music was amplified but the feeling was intimate, because there were only about two dozen people in the audience, most dancing. 

Amplified music can be intimate. But intimacy is not what amplification is usually used for. Amplified music is mainly used for the sake of efficiency: with amplification, a small amount of music can supply a large crowd. 

At street festivals, I prefer ten acoustic bands on the pavement to one amplified band on an elevated stage. Instead of renting a stage and PA, I think the money would be better used to pay more musicians. ","1433117387"

An alternative would be to get the Holy Roman Emperor into the war (hopefully Austria) and then lure France's army onto Venice and trap them there with a navy. That's a bit gamey though.

Another alternative since you are allied to France is to get into a war with them on your side. Try to get their armies attached to your and then put them all in a pile so they take attrition to kill their manpower. At the end of the war turn on them immediately with strong allies.

 The very first citation of Understanding Power references the use of the words ""defensive"" and ""containment"" by top diplomatic officials to justify military action, it does not mention the NYT as propaganda.

"languagelearning","t5_2rjsc","Everything single method that has ever been suggested ever. Not to use them all but so you can disregard them as a waste of time.

Learning a language is personal. You will enjoy certain activities over other. Some will be very annoying and rob your motivation. Don't stick to those. Look at some other things people did that might work better for you.

For example: I ALWAYS hated flash cards and SRS and studying vocab. It's a huge problem for me because it just takes any joy out of studying for me. 

Then I found [Kató Lomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat%C3%B3_Lomb) and her [book](http://www.tesl-ej.org/books/lomb-2nd-Ed.pdf) (legal download, by the way). All of a sudden, all my worries are gone. There are people that learnt languages quite well by never studying vocab. Just reading. Just read the same thing that you enjoy over and over again until it sticks. 

And that's what I'm doing. Instead of doing all the boring shit in Genki, I just read the dialogue. I got much further much quicker than I did with the other methods. I can read the Ganki 1 dialogues fluently already and the first few of Genki 2 as well. Once I've done that, I start with either Harry Potter or light novels. And there are also people that successfully learnt languages by learning how to read first and then went on to speaking. Brilliant.

That does not meant that this is the right way. But it's for me. It's my correct way. Find your correct way as well.","1433117391"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Inuk here (singular for Inuit). While the majority of Inuit today work the 9-5 like everyone else, when I go camping/hunting I generally take off my watch. Outside of the wage-economy, sleep is governed by sunlight and/or the tide schedules.

When I'm camping I sleep when I'm tired or bored (waiting for tide to come in/go out). The daylight in the summer and the darkness can be disorienting when you're not used to it. You learn to sleep during brightness, and get used to waking up and getting your day started in pitch darkness.

In the summer, kids can be seen running around at all hours of the day and night. Newcomers to the north often express shock and horror that you might see children at a playground at 3am - the kids have often adjusted to their parents schedule where they may sleep/rise in accordance with tide schedules or are otherwise unburdened by the regular 9-5 schedule (not in school for the summer, unemployed, on shift work, or on holidays).

As for segmented sleep - you could say that many Inuit still practice it outside of the 9-5 work schedule. I have been on a couple month-long boating trips, and unless you need to buy gas or supplies, you do what you want within guidelines set by the environment and not a clock. This rarely includes an 8 hour uninterrupted stretch of sleep.","1433117395"

"premed","t5_2rlp9","Let me preface this with... You can go to med school with a degree in anything.


With that said, don't be one of those guys that gets a degree in philosophy after taking 6 science courses...

If you know you are trying to pursue med school and you choose an ""easy"" major, I think that's sort of the cheap way out.  A lot of adcoms can see right through that too.

On top of that, you will be thrown in a pool of sharks when you start med school, its best to be at the top of your game.  If you spend time learning the lac operon and basic physiology in undergrad, your medical school life will be so much easier.

I can tell you that I majored in a very difficult subject at a very good state school.  My undergrad time was way harder than anything I've done in med school.  The only difference was that med school just shoots so much info your way, you have a hard time keeping up. Since I had a good education from undergrad, ive had a lot of free time in med school to chill while the English majors freak out and try to absorb difficult material for the first time.

No offense to anybody, but if you know you want to be a doctor, you are simply being lazy by not majoring in something that will help you out (i.e. health, science, etc).

Let me also add that majoring in engineering is also a bad idea.  A lot of engineers dont make it to med school because their GPA gets smoked.  ","1433117397"

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I'm in an 8 year-relationship with an omnivore and we've lived together for 5 of those years.

The topic of meat came up when we moved in together and my policy is that what you put in your body is an incredibly personal choice and I try not to judge or influence those decisions. This includes little things like junk food or big things like smoking. It's not my body, it's not my choice.

That being said, smoking in a non-negotiable for me in a relationship for my own personal reasons and it sounds like meat eating may be that for you.

Moving in together will always involve dealing with squeamish things that you need to cope with for the good of the relationship (him: leaving cut nails on his desk, me: leaving hair in the shower drain). But neither of those things are anything we are morally opposed to or have a strong physical/psychological reaction to, you know?

When we moved in together, I compromised and said I was willing to keep meat and even cook a chicken breast for him every now and then as I don't expect him to take on my food choices. Luckily, he also compromised and said he was happy to eat meat at lunch/dining out and we would keep a lacto-ovo vegetarian home.

Eating and cooking is an intimate and lovely part of living together and it sounds like it could be a major source of conflict for you guys. My advice would be to discuss what lies at the heart of his desire to eat meat three times a day? Does he worry he'll lose his man card if he actually enjoys a tofu dish? Would he be willing to try your vegan cooking for a week to see that it's not all lentils and rice? Is he just generally not a fan of change, like a major change to his diet?

Best of luck and let us know how you go!","1433117398"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Drafting is a different animal to me. StanBo has the help of the real Bowman (Scotty) behind him for that, as well as a HUGE scouting staff that was there before he was put in place.

The trades are what I criticize StanBo for the most, or at least am unimpressed by (besides the Oduya acquisition)

Desjardins has worked very well on that 4th line, but I wouldn't argue he's better than Smith. Cheaper, yes, but we lost talent in that deal in my opinion. Perhaps for a worthwhile economic benefit with such a tight cap crunch, but if we're just comparing players I'd rather still have Smith.","1433117399"

"geek","t5_2qh17","This is why you set strict guidelines on change management and STICK TO THEM. Don't let your developers go to a meeting and say, ""Oh SURE! We can do that,"" you have to be clear with them. They fill out a change request, you tell them how much it will cost and what it will take. Usually that makes them change their minds.

Or you tell them what it will take and they say MAKE IT HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT.

In my experience, having frequent meetings helps this because you get only part way along and realize they didn't know what the fuck they wanted and you can change it before you've written the whole thing. Agile is great for that.","1433117399"

"wec","t5_2tr3a","That's a shortened version of the clip, but I thought it had the important part. Hammond is trying to start off but the car won't let him let the clutch out because he is going to stall. He has no way to feather the clutch, only on/off. Eventually he gets it by giving the car a lot of throttle, and once he is moving the clutch is no longer an issue. That car is an old one, but they have been using the same transmissions since the early 90's.","1433117399"

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","Haha, well anyways to your post; Dragunaties are nowhere near regional-level competitive. They would hardly be able to go to a locals with one Ravine. Thankfully for you however, Konami has been really looking out for the older players, and they've been unbanning and unlimiting tons of cards as of late. With the pattern that they've been going at right now, Ravine should be coming back to two within a month or so, and to three the next list. The Dragon Rulers are banned, so there's no reason to keep it on the list at all. If you're looking for more recommendations I would be happy to help suggest a new deck until Ravine goes to three again.","1433117399"

I don't put a lot of pressure on, I interact with them the way I do anybody I really like, and I leave a number. There are a lot of guys who get weird if they like a girl, and it can manifest anywhere from too confident to too polite. I hope you know what I'm getting at here. 

I'm actually constantly surprised by how many people are actually not able to interact with just anyone, so I wouldn't call it the norm. I go for really attractive women, and they get bird dogged from every angle. I assume most of that attention is creepy, or awkward, or puts them under pressure.","1433117400"

Having people to ride with can keep you motivated and help you learn.

"NSFW_GIF","t5_2rm76","&gt;If burkas weren't about oppression, then why are they made of polyester and forced on women in one of the hottest regions of the world? Also, if it was about modesty and not oppression, why are women killed when they disobey? Sounds like oppression to me! .....it almost sounds like you're defending Sharia Law.. you wouldn't do that, would you?

I didn't say it wasn't oppression. I was explaining the reason why it happened. You seem to be of this idea that Saudis just hate women and want to punish them because Islam, which is juvenile and misinformed. It is a matter of *fact* that Burkas are imposed on women to impose modesty on them. They *are* considered dignified.

You do realize that Burkas exist outside of Saudi Arabia don't you? That women continue the tradition in settings in which they'd be safe to disregard it? It's an awful trend of culture but the very basic fact of the matter is that it is at its origin motivated by misguided concepts of modesty and dignity, no matter how crude and oppressive it becomes.

&gt;That ad[1] [RES ignored duplicate link] is what's called propaganda.

Yeah? What's your point? You think that it's a nonexistent opinion? Please, *please* research this to a basic extent. Look up the reasoning and history behind Burkas. They were not conceived as some bizarre, arbitrary punishment of women. As for defending Shariah Law... Why on earth would you think that? All I did was explain it to you. You sound like one of those people who thinks America had tension with the middle east because they were jealous of our freedom and prosperity. When someone tries to explain otherwise you accuse them of being terrorist sympathizers.

&gt;As for ""african-american,"" that term is a worthless product of political correctness. This discussion should help you understand why, but only if you really are a logical person conscious of related issues in society, and not just a reactive drone...

Again, you're dwelling on irrelevant aspects of the analogy to draw attention away from the real discussion. I don't care at all how you feel about the term african american. The fact is that it's a more appropriate term than ""nigger"". I've already heard the arguments against the term, they're utterly irrelevant in this discussion. Would you have liked me to say [people descended from migrant or enslaved africans of antebellum America] instead? Or are you grateful for the opportunity to waste my time?

&gt;So you think it's absurd that I think women are more respectable when they don't sell sex for money?

Absurd? Technically, no. I understand why. Your mind was molded by a society which wasn't entirely rational. You never managed to rationalize your way out of it. A woman who does that is rejecting social conventions, so I suppose her willingness to make that sacrifice (as would a woman who pursued the right to vote once would have been) can make her less respectable from a certain non-progressive perspective.

&gt;It's about having standards for behavior in society

Sure. We should have standards for behavior in society. I just don't see why having such a severe attitude about sex should be among them. You seem unable to explain it.

&gt;In Victorian times, sex was never considered ""bad."" Promiscuous and/or public sex was been considered ""bad,"" because dignity was considered good.

You're not really informing anyone of anything here. Yes, obviously people of the Victorian era didn't thoroughly condemn sex as a whole, or they wouldn't have continued to reproduce as they did. I'm saying they had an irrationally severe attitude towards sex that has influenced your own.

&gt; Unlike today, where feminism has declared that dignity is irrelevant and ""sexual freedom"" (promiscuity) is preached as something good.

Nice try, but you're trying to misrepresent that for the sake of the argument. The idea is not that ""dignity is irrelevant"" it's that idiotic opinions of what constitutes dignity (like your own) are irrelevant. If someone comes up to me and tells me that eating red meat is undignified, I'm not going to give a shit.

All you do is repeat yourself, ""it's undignified! it's indecent!""

You never actually attempt to explain in logical terms what the problem is. You are utterly reliant on popular opinions of society to make your argument. Racial segregation used to be a popular opinion to you know, so it's not really a valid foundation.

&gt;You claim to be thinking for yourself, but that can't be possible either since all you're doing it regurgitating feminist and racialist arguments that have no basis in reality.

I think you're just associating me with these things. Ironically 

&gt;You're just triggered. I implore you, go back to tumblr.

You're the one who is acting ""triggered"" here. I reminded you of things you don't like, so you throw a fit and act like that means there's something wrong with my argument. Which there isn't.

It's as if I was trying to argue for animal rights, and you tell me that I'm regurgitating the opinions of Adolf Hitler, and everything I say is invalidated as such.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","What sucks now is that Shamans are in for the long haul here. Blizzard doesn't buff old cards anymore. They just release new expansions and hope for the best. For the good classes, this approach to balance is great; they all get better and better gradually, and some classes inevitably pull ahead. For the worst classes, Shaman and Priest, our current options are so low that it would have to be at *least* two awesome expansions of Shaman cards that completely revitalize the class for it to be decent again. 

Of course, my main argument is that Overload is fundamentally a broken and overly damaging mechanic. You can't win with a class that sacrifices tempo to gain tempo and ends up with a net gain of 0. Right now we have no direction, no combos, and nothing that sets us apart from what other classes can do five times better. It's sad that our best archetype, mech, is actually better when played on a Mage. Would buffing old cards even help that much? Unless they fixed Overload, probably not that much.","1433117408"

I picked him over JR because everyone knew JR's potential from his 6th man of the year season.

He and TT are absolutely playing out of their minds right now in the most important games of their careers. For that, I will soon be purchasing their jerseys and will cheer them on for the duration of their careers. 

Disappointing: Dion Waiters

I could have gone with Anderson Varejao because of the achilles tear, but a season ending injury isn't earth shatteringly surprising when it comes to Andy. Whereas Dion pulled a reverse JR.

(Colvin, Blake, Nippletop, Dial can even be done in one day depending on your capabilities) Giant and Rocky Peak Ridge. Sawteeth, Gothics, Armstrong and Upper WolfJaw (and Lower Wolf Jaw if you're capable). Wright, Algonquin, Iroquois. Panther, Santanoni, Couchsachraga. Redfield and Cliff. Skylight, Marcy, Gray. Saddleback, Haystack, Basin. Dix, Hough, Macomb, Grace, South Dix. Seward, Emmonds, Donaldson, Seymour can be done in 2 days if you camp out. (Maybe 1 day, never done it). 

In the end, it all depends on how physically capable you are. Starting with Cascade and Porter is an easy start and should help you discover that on your own. 

Some of these hikes make for long days and can limit your enjoyment of the peaks, so definitely hike your own hike and take your time if you have it and want to. You only get to hike a peak for the first time once!

"TrollYChromosome","t5_2tvh2","Sure! That makes perfect sense, unfortunately when you're a parent and exhausted and ready to loose your shit and throw a tantrum like a 5 year old because your child is at that lovely age where they ask a ton of questions and not because they want to disobey or be annoying, but because they truly want to learn and understand why. 

I remember when we were kid free and thinking the same thing as you, then I had three of my own. My mind changed real quick. We would all love to have patience and be able to treat our children with nothing but love and compassion, but people forget to tell you that parenting fucking sucks. My eldest is autistic and he is always asking why. 

Why is that man a different color? Why does that woman have big breasts? What land to people come from? Why can't I buy this toy? Why can't I have this candy? What does this word mean? How is that made? Can I pick out breakfast? 

It's never ending questions. He literally is asking his next question before I can finish the last. Sometimes while he is in these rapid firing questions I get such bad anxiety and I don't give him the proper cues. He will go to grab something to eat while asking if he can have it. Now with him dyes make him insane. He legit turns into the hulk and is just down right mean. Now he's only 54lbs so I can handle it, my 21 month old can not and he is usually the target. So the scene. Rapid questions, hand going to grab food he can't have and all I have time for is a quick slap on the wrist to tell him ""DONT TOUCH!!!"" and a quick ""no you can't have because I said so"". I would rather have a quick reaction followed by a longer explanation later then him getting something he can't have and my youngest son having to take the brunt because I wasn't quick enough. 

So while my situation is different, I always try to give parents the benefit of doubt, and that they have a kid like mine and they just have that one brief moment between anxiety and ""oh fuck!"". Of course some parents are just straight up assholes. 

But anyways, yes in a perfect world I would agree with you, for sure. ","1433117419"

"wec","t5_2tr3a","The video doesn't explain it brilliantly, but I think the general gist of it is three fold: massive splitter, massive front diffuser, and tunnels that feed the airflow into the wake.

Splitter - As they said the front is less regulated than the back of the car, so putting on a huge front splitter is an easy way to gain a good bit of downforce. I'm no expert but the bigger the splitter, the bigger the difference in air pressure between the stagnant air ontop and the accelerated air flowing underneath, thus generating more downforce. The reason the other teams don't do this to such an extreme is presumably because it would screw up their aero balance, which needs to be more towards the rear on a mid-rear engined RWD car, to maximise traction on the rear driven wheels.

Front Diffuser - I love how open Nissan are, we've seen a lot of pictures under the hood, but one thing we never get to see on any car is the floor! I was wondering for a while where the air that passes through the tunnels comes from. It doesn't come from the front inlets - they cool the radiators and exit just infront of the exhausts. But after studying some of the photos it turns out they just have a gigantic front diffuser, two huge sweeping holes in the floor just under the front axle which allows the high velocity air coming under the car to create a large vacuum effect under the front underbody, sucking the car down onto the road. With less regulations on the front they can make it as big as possible. This is why everything in the engine bay, such as the turbos, are so high and flat: to make as much room for the diffuser as possible. Again other LMP cars have front diffusers, but not of this size, again presumably because of balance. They have to rely mostly on their rear diffuser for downforce over the driven wheels, but the rear diffuser has a max size defined by the regs so the Nissan has the *potential* to create a lot more downforce overall.

Tunnels and Rear Wake - The flow from the front diffuser on normal LMP cars is chucked out the side, hence the Toyota Audi and Porsche having big slits in the body work just behind the front wheels. In the Nissan though, all the engine, intercoolers, and radiators are all at the front, so theres nothing that could potentiall get in the way of the airflow apart from the cockpit and rear axle. Therefore, they've decided to just run the air through the body, resulting in a mid-rear body section which is mostly hollow! This means they can feed all that air into the aire behind the car, filling in the wake thus reducing drag. Lowering drag increases the efficiency, making the downforce versus drag ratio better, hopefully resulting in a high topspeed!

Overall it's a pretty clever (and *bold*) manipulation of the rules, but it's only possible with a front weight bias FWD car. Nissan are open about it all partly because no other team could copy them. For a mid-rear engine car these areo features would ruin their balance and make no sense. This is why the Nismo is so radical and unique!","1433117421"

Realistically, there is so much misinformation out there that the advice on here is far far better than what the impressionable people you're trying to protect will otherwise find and act on. The fact that everything here is sanity checked by other people reading is a big safeguard.

"arduino","t5_2qknj","* 1) Vcc is basically the main power input on the Motor controller, it may be labelled differently on different motor controllers. Ground on the motor controller is basically the negative side of your circuit, so to clarify, Vcc = positive, Ground or Gnd = negative. 

* I've heard the L293D is a good motor controller, however it only supports 1 amp of current, I am not sure how much current your motors will pull. As u/gwhlives mentions below, you can buy just the motor controller chip like [this](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xl293d.TRS0&amp;_nkw=l293d&amp;_sacat=0) or a prebuilt board like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Controller-Module-Bridge-Stepper-Arduino/dp/B00HNHUYSG/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433114497&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=l293d) I personally find the prebuilt boards easier to manage and worth the extra cost.

* ) Regarding steering, I may have been wrong about it 
being a servo, the car could have differential steering, however this would require one motor per drive wheel, which doesn't seem to agree with the pictures given. 

*  I should have asked earlier,  do you plan to keep the car working by remote control and use the original controller?  This will be more difficult because you will have to reverse engineer the circuit boards already in the car, and the signals that the r/c controller outputs, which is technically possible, but I personally wouldn't do it.

* Please post more pictures of the steering mechanism and motor, and I may be able to help you further.

When it's attached to the reservation, the key will cut off when the res is checked out. When it's cut by the master, it's on a timer. At midday of the day you cut it to, the key will stop working.

Recently we've been having an issue where someone on early shift isn't cutting group keys to the right date. So when they come home on the 2nd day, we'll have 50 tired and non-communicative Germans at our desk and have to re-cut *every single damn key*.

Plus, if you've ever played the game (which I'm going to guess you haven't, based on tone, and I'm not judging) you'll know just how complex it is, how fun it is to play, and the pride working with your team brings. On a collegiate level, the skill involved is incredible.

If you're upset that it's mindless entertainment, I can't dissuade you, since that's pretty much what it is. But if you're with some good friends all drinking, hooting and hollering, it's incredible. Plus, sports have been around forever. From gladiators to the Olympics, watching the top of the top of athletes is a blast.

-2- Not enough pipe coming into the facility, find out how much internet you are getting and determine if it is a enough.  One thing to know is most people do not know shit about connectivity. Also there is a huge difference between mega bits and mega bytes. Do some research. Also learn about up and down.

"amiibo","t5_324pu","Hi there, first time posting here, thanks for the heads up OP! I called about 20 minutes after this went up and after a bit of back and forth with the employee they were able to put 2 on hold for myself and a friend, they said they had 4 left at the time. I arrived and when I went to pick them up, I saw a customer buying a Meta Knight in front of me. Then I heard what appeared to be a manager tell the next customer in line, a lady, that they hold on to the Meta Knights until 5pm, the customer was complaining but she left. I was next in line and while ringing me up for the Meta Knight they decided to release the holds. Luckily my friend was behind me and he got his, and another customer behind us got his as well, I guess he had his on hold from calling the store too. There was another customer behind that guy, but he didn't get his. All in all, very happy with this Best Buy after dealing with crap customer service from the Otay Ranch and especially the Chula Vista location. That's already another huge story of crap with them.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Intensified would be effective on it too actually.

&gt; *An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels.*

This effectively doubles the damage this spell could do at later levels. At 20th level each ball would do 10d6 instead of 5d6 and you'd have 4 force spheres - in fact you'd have a 5th if you take greater spell specialisation, spell perfection and have some other bonus to your caster level (mage tattoo perhaps).  

All on one target, that would be 50d6 and a bull rush attempt at 40 (5 spheres) + 25 (caster level) + 9 (a conservative but realistic intelligence at that level), so a Bull Rush at 74 with five d20's rolled, choosing the highest. You could consistently bull rush a CMD 66 Tarrasque at this point, all with a 4th level spell slot; 3rd with magical lineage.    

Average damage would be 175 (3.5*50) and adding the maximised metamagic feat would be 300 damage. Pretty good I think! The Tarrasque mentioned earlier has 525 and regeneration 40 so two spells over two turns (or one if you can cast one intensified, maximised, Battering Blast and one intensified, quickened Battering Blast and roll well (or empower them)). Of course, this is theory craft so I get to pretend for a second that it doesn't have spell resistance - in 'real life' your results may vary.

I like this spell!","1433117436"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Ancient Coin may work a bit better if you need the sustain for spamming shields or heals on your ADC or when attacking minions is too dangerous. Activating the Relic shield execute open yourself up to poke form a skilled ADC and support. Additionally, I would definitely consider it on Alistar, because how he often run low on mana. 

Nomad's Medallion is a viable choice for roamers, as the added movement speed can help you get around or away more easily from a bad gank or deep warding. 

Talisman is good if you need an extra peeling tool against certain champions like Olaf, Poppy, or other champions which ( for what ever reason ) isn't easy to CC. Click it and let your ADC run to saftey AWAY FROM the enemy. Righteous Glory can't do that. 

Last words, you get a helluvalot more gold with that item than relic path, which is a pretty decent argument to getting it. Except for WingsofDeath and SickMotion, no one cares about the support's income after laning phase. They just buzz over that CS like it was nothing. Not realizing Face of the Mountain's shield scale with health. Health which is bought with gold. 

TL;DR For me, Ancient Coin -path is situational in a few cases. 

* Ancient Coin's mana regen allow you to spam abilities and being able to avoid poke in lane is good. 
* Nomad's Medallion's flat movement speed is good when roaming. 
* Talisman's movement speed buff can mean the difference between life and death for your carry. 
* Lastly, it gives you steady income throughout the game. ","1433117437"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Probably a good idea. There is a feverish, widespread delusion in the west that children naturally experience the world in an utterly asexual manner unless they have been contaminated by an immoral society. It's easy to see how this contributes to a culture of suspicion and unease, and not only in the sense of insecure parents obsessed with purity and perversion.

On the other hand I'm sceptical about the power of formal education alone to create cultural change. It often seems like the curriculum is a closer to an idealistic political statement of aims rather than a genuine tool for engineering a better society, particularly as societies tend to be surprisingly resistant to conscious attempts to engineer them.

This difficultly is compounded, because as far as I can see the delusion of sexless children is only a single instance of a broader issue at the foundation of modern liberal society. By this I refer to the contemporary notion of 'personhood' as founded in Cartesian rationality, where each one of us is supposed to have an intelligence which operates in a kind of pure logical space, free of any material conditions that might influence it one way or the other. The relation between a person and the world should then be analogous to the relation between the sculptor and the clay - which is to say, wholly one directional.

But of course this foundational notion is completely wrong. Even more than I am capable of shaping the external world to suit my needs, that world is capable of shaping and reshaping me far beyond my control. Sure, we admit this openly and claim to acknoledge it, but we always hold back for ourselves an ideal notion of pure, untouchable selfhood, ie. viewing depression or dementia as things that only interfere with the expression of an essential, true self, rather than simply being that self. It's an uncomfortable reality that the external world is capable of touching at the most fundamental, most constitutional level the very processes of our 'pure' intelligence, altering not only ourselves but shifting around the very things we desire and are able to desire.

But modern liberal society is founded on the notion that this kind of two-way relation between our deepest selves and the world doesn't exist. Consider how disruptive the acknowledgement of this relation would be on the popular idealised notions of things like elections, shopping, contracts, imprisonment and criminal justice, technology and the pursuit of science, sexuality and sexual consent, advertising, health-care, etc. . . it's right there in the center of everything, but we have to pretend that it's not. 

And the cost of this pretense is a huge amount of anxiety and fear. We are neurotic and suspicious and fearful of the world and each other, determined to keep ourselves and our loved ones pure and unchanging but always failing to do so, always at the mercy of the hidden gears and chipping blocks that grind away ceaselessly at the deepest parts of ourselves whether we let them or not.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I feel as if everyone here supporting Mass Effect 1's combat is looking at it through rose tinted glasses. They seem to forget the time hiding behind cover to avoid blasted by insta-kill rockets or the one-hit-snipers. Or how, especially at late game, combat becomes shooting a target for ages as it bounces around due to weird rag doll physics.

There might have been more customisation in Mass Effect 1, however, the customisation available was overall, a lot less meaningful since you could switch on-the-fly. Additionally, there were a lot of mostly useless gear, weapons and progression was mostly in the form of ""better-everything"". Even if you ignore Spectre gear this is still the case.

In the later games you have shotguns that fire faster, but have less punch or one that's only punch; you have assault-rifles that favour efficiency and accuracy, and those which are for laying down fire. Possibly, most important of all, when you make a choice you're committed for that encounter, no switching mid-combat to the spam rifle because you're shooting shit-tons of husks.

While I also have my gripes regarding the story of Mass Effect 1, that is not really relevant here. What is relevant is that while Mass Effect 1 provided you the illusion of choice, most of those choices were the same and most of those choices sucked.

Theoretically, you could get some 2.91's and a 5 speed and get it, but not in the real world of 70's cars. I've had a 230,235,250,and 292 with various rear end gears in pickups that weighed 200lbs less and never saw north of 15, no matter how much I babied it. 

Even more importantly, the 250 was ORIGINALLY rated at 15 mpg.

"travel","t5_2qh41","Even though we generally love European cities, Venice just didn't do it for us.  I think that there were two main factors.

The first is walking the city.  Yes, with no cars, you would think that it would be a very pedestrian friendly place, but it's really a confusing rat maze of narrow allyways (lots of dead ends) which get very easily crowded and a hassle, plus if you're actually trying to get somewhere, even using the water busses/etc, it's surprisingly frustrating.

The second is that it as a city, probably 90% of all activity is centered on tourism, which rings hollow.  Sure, you can do random wandering, but particularly near the attraction downtown, much of what you'll find are closed off areas (often vacant buildings whose owner can't afford renovations) or just another set of tourist gift shops, usually with tons of gawking tourists (very few real locals doing non-touristic stuff).

Glad we went, but don't see much of a compelling reason to go back.  I'd not turn down a business trip to there, but I'd not add days.

And after that, Luffy got blown away at Sabody but was one hundred percent interested in going straight to the New World, until the events of Impel Down and Marineford. I believe that Luffy took upon the decision to tell everyone to train because the WHOLE crew was defeated and he suffered a personal loss, which told him that he needed to be stronger to protect his loved ones.

I think another time-skip would occur as long as the conditions of both his crew being completely defeated and taking a personal loss (like Sabo or a crewmate) before running forward.

Second option would be to use the skid steer and grade in zones using a heavy gauge wire mesh as a sifter and then redistribute the virgin soil.

I'll post in more detail later, but I was 7 weeks and the actual painful part and aspiration was 3 minutes. Yes, only 3 minutes. I would also like to add that I think surgical MAY be easier for someone who has had a child. My main struggle with it and source of pain was the dilation of my cervix.  I only had local anesthetic.

A Catholic still can't take communion in most Orthodox Churches, and attending an Orthodox liturgy doesn't fulfill the Sunday obligation for him. Basically, their sacraments are considered valid (as opposed to the Protestant sacraments, which are invalid except for baptism), but it's not licit for a Catholic to receive them except in dire need. (so, if a Catholic is dying, he can confess his sins to an Orthodox priest, but not an Anglican)

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I am a fan of the NBA but, when I watched JUST how invested people are in the stands and even at home when YouTube reaction clips come out its, weird. A dark weirdness that I can even really describe in words.

Being ""awake"" to a certain extent and watching just how deep people are in a deep sleep with the ""script"" given to us causes me to  feel like the crazy one at times. Which, I think its the point.

""Am I crazy?""

""Maybe Feminist have a point""

""Maybe I am hateful towards women""

""Maybe I this Red Pill Reditt is bad for me""

And RIGHT THERE is the issue. What I TRULY feel is trying to be taken away. Fuck a ""right"" or ""wrong"", just the DISCUSSION itself is being taken from me I feel like when I get looked at crazy for commenting on what is going on and seeking alternatives in thinking. 

--------------------------

This is how I feel about the ""Superman Dilemma"". I have gather all of this knowledge but, I can only use it when something bad occurs. I am making a difference for me sure but, on a bigger scale I am still restrained in my ""powers"", or better yet I am conditioned to be restrained. 

If I am a comedian and I say a joke about punching a kid, it is labeled as a joke and people (If its funny) start laughing. If I say I am not joking than I am labeled as ""crazy"" and should be put in jail. What if I just wanted to have a discussion about punching a kid. I would never do that but, just the idea and feeling of it is being taken from me, UNLESS it functions with helping society. 

My thing is trying to hold on to just my ""power"" and give it away when I CHOSE to and only to help people find THEIR path. Women and society as a whole want you to get adjusted to this new age slavery and, I just can't fuck with it.  

--------------------------

I went from being inside of the TV to now becoming The Watcher. I am Superman flying above Earth and watching it from the perspective of ""Is this it?"" 

Am I being forced? No but, the ATTEMPT is still there. Like poking a dog with a stick constantly that is just trying to eat and live. The only other option left is to take this knowledge and pass it over to others. 

Hopefully, they come into the understanding that Truth and Knowledge is merely tools to unlocking what is already inside. Pussy and green pieces of paper are merely extra keys.

If you don't and get totally exhausted you can stay in Tok, but you won't want to.  Kluane is pretty, but the construction etc. has taken a toll on the scenic quality of that area. 

If I were you I would hammer that trip at least as far as Glenallen, if not all the way to ANC then regroup there and head to Homer.  There are great lakes on the peninsula, and of course you could do a side trip to Seward if you're set up for sea kayaking.

"JonTron","t5_2ua5i","You've got most of what you need- the effects, the edits, the gameplay, but I think in doing so you forgot the most important part- the writing. You take to long to do things that you should just assume we know- don't assume the viewer is an idiot. For example- ""I have to find my brother."" don't show you looking for your brother, we get it, you established at the start that it took you a long time to find your brother and that it was hard. Let the jokes flow naturally, when you force things you end up sounding like a sweaty kid at open mic night. 

Overall though, you did pretty good. Some things felt forced or just plain out fell flat, but of course with practice you will get better at the delivery. Protip: When you're writing jokes, you need to focus on two things.

1) If it is funny

2) If you can deliver it correctly


you can have a hilarious joke, but if the delivery is no good, it won't matter. Think of the funniest joke you can think of. Now think of the Irate Gamer stuttering his way through the joke and saying ""What?"" a lot. Exactly, the joke won't be funny anymore.

To conclude, just work on the delivery, maybe devote some more time to the script, and practice, practice, practice.

If either team has a hope of competing based on a strong defense and a run-first offense that takes pressure off of otherwise questionable quarterback play, my money is on the Jets pulling it off.","1433117465"

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","IANAExpert, etc. My knowledge here could fit in a thimble... I don't have any experience with landscape rakes. They look pretty lightweight, like a sand rake rather than what you probably need, a backhoe, earth mover, or little bobcat with a big toothy bucket, instead of/in addition to the skid steer. Are these small pieces of scrap? If there are larger pieces (or huge ones) it could do substantial damage to the attachment.

As an interested observer of other friends' and family members' landscaping fiascos, this is what I've learned: it's often a huge and expensive job, or just huge and time-consuming. And easier to remove it all, and replace with clean topsoil, than to sift/clean the existing debris out of the dirt.

One friend removed a giant dump truck of (invasive weed-infested) dirt and trash from his yard, then brought in clean topsoil.

Another ripped up about 11,000 sf of weedcloth/plastic and the noxious weed-infested soil below, and brought in clean topsoil.

Another one got his roll-off dumpster dropped off, blocking the only outside access to his backyard. So he drove the bobcat through the house so he could dig out 30 yrs of household and construction debris used as dirty fill.

A couple of caveats: obviously, call before you dig. You don't want to hit underground utilities.

If you go about the whole first episode, setting them up on the ship or arriving in France or however quickly they're going to progress, in the last 5 minutes they can can do a little screen saying ""Inverness, 1968"". The audience will make the logical assumption that maybe we're going to see Frank still looking for her, or someone else falling through the stones, when BAM! Claire's back in the 1900's and much older. I think it makes the payoff that much better, when the audience is only confused about the HOW or the WHY, rather than the WHAT.

You can already look up any law you want on the computer. It's on the interwebs, I promise.

The problem with law is that it isn't just the letter of the law, it's the spirit of the law. There are also times when laws may contradict each other. There are a few reasons why the legal professions are a requirement at this point.

* 1. Legal speak is hard to understand.

If someone handed you the code of laws for whatever state you live in, it would take you *ages* to find all of the laws that are applicable to you in any given case. Whenever you see someone tried for 10 different charges for one crime, you need to argue/defend every one of those points and have a thorough understanding of each law. Many times these laws will reference other laws, and you end up going down a rabbit hole similar to clicking wikipedia links. I'm not saying Lawyers don't look this stuff up too, but they are trained to do it and are experienced with it.

* 2. Interpreting the word of the law vs. the spirit of the law.

Much like religious texts, what is written down may be interpreted in a way that might not seem apparent at first. If you need any evidence of this, look up debates regarding the interstate commerce clause or second amendment. Legal scholars *still* battle over these things daily. Legal precedent may say that the supreme court 80 years ago interpreted this federal law this way, and 30 years ago they slightly changed their mind etc. It helps to have someone who has studied these things and can argue a case based on previous similar cases, interpreting the spirit of the law in addition to the letter of the law. This requires more than just reading the text. They print overpriced books called case books if you want to look at some of these arguments yourself. This is why corporations or rich individuals will have a team of lawyers. 5 pairs of eyes and 5 minds looking at a problem will come up with more solutions than one, even if the one lawyer is a very good one.

* 3. The impact of law enforcement is too important to leave up to computers.

Similar to the concerns over a fully robotic military, there needs to be a human being behind the trigger. The implementation of law is not arbitrary or simple. To attempt to automate such a complex and important part of our society cheapens it to an extent, and opens loopholes for abuse. There's also the sixth amendment, which reads as follows:

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.

So you are guaranteed a trial by jury and defense counsel in the case of criminal prosecution. This requires humans.

This is also ignoring a fourth point that often gets overlooked.

* 4. Law is often a system of compromise.

I interned with public defendants in my state. Something like 80-85% of cases they tried to get the defendant to take a plea deal. This is because the evidence was so overwhelming that the chance of winning a trial was basically zero. This compromise involves the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the judge working together to ensure the punishment is fair and resources aren't used unnecessarily on a trial. This gets more complicated with big situations like the bailouts during the recession, but the same idea applies. Legal experts and the government worked together to come up with something that worked for everyone and still at least would work within the confines of the law.

This is a process that can't be automated.","1433117471"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I'm not as versed in law as others are here, but I have done practice bill drafting for school, and so while I may be misinterpreting the decision, in 1798 (much before Prohibition) there was a supreme court case (Calder v. Bull) that defined four aspects of ""Ex Post Facto"" law. Among the four was the definition that only laws that increased sentences were ex post facto, and therefore unconstitutional. However, commutation of sentences were not specifically deemed unconstitutional, as they were not considered ex post facto. I'm quite sure I'm misinterpreting, and would be quite glad for someone's prompt correction, but to my knowledge, it was not unconstitutional to release prisoners. Which doesn't answer your question directly, but rather disproves some of the other responses' reasons for why the release couldn't have happened.

What would your wife do if you both got PCSd to a base where the only quarters for miles around were government quarters, forcing you to both lose BAH?

If that's something that would also make her quit then the problem is her actual compensation (base pay + retention/skills bonuses) is too low, not that her housing allowance is too low.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt; liberals are constantly trying to withhold money from organizations that they don't agree with and give money to ones they do agree with.

Yeah? So welcome to politics 101. That's certainly not exclusive to one side, is it? 

There's no such place as 'Palestine'. It's not a country. It probably would be if they didn't keep electing known terrorist groups as their leadership, but that's another story. 

How would a university boycott this fictitious 'Palestine'? They manufacture nothing. They provide nothing. They export nothing. It would be an easy boycott. 'We're not going to buy things from people that don't make anything!' isn't exactly a strong political statement. 

They've been given many, many chances but can't even seem to keep an intact, working infrastructure like a real country would because they spend their annual allowance on weapons, terrorist activities, and (once upon a time) Yasser Arafat's old hookers and coke in fancy Paris hotel rooms habits. 

Boycotting Israel, our closest ally in the ME, is making a political statement against a US ally. 

Most liberals would love to see churches lose their tax-free status, but most of them are also hypocrites about it. They surely wouldn't want the same thing to happen to a mosque! 

The Obama administration has already funded so-called 'green energy' companies to the tune of billions of dollars that are all wasted because those companies went under quickly. That has dick-all to do with boycotting Israel. That's two different issues. 

Crony capitalism says that the ones in charge get to divvy out those dollars, and Obama flushed them down several different toilets.

When a Republican does that, it's 'crony capitalism' - which isn't capitalism at all. When a Democrat does that, it was well-intentioned but poorly thought-out 'investing'.

I know I'm late, but I haven't stopped working in all day.

I started coding a game in Processing a week ago, and I found out just how limited the IDE is when working with even smallish project such as mine.

That's why I decided to start **Terminal Est**, my very own Processing Roguelike Library.

I've only worked on it this past weekend, keeping motivated by posting gifs on my FB account and discussing my hopes and dreams for the library (if you have motivational issues, I recommend this!)

These are some gifs from the game (from before starting working on Terminal Est):

Since I rewrote everything (if you have motivational issues, I DO NOT recommend this!), the following Terminal Est gifs are of the examples and tutorials that will come with the library:

&gt;Some STIs may be spread via skin-to-skin sexual contact. The organisms causing STIs can also be spread through non-sexual means such as blood products and tissue transfer. Many STIs—including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, HIV, HPV, HSV2 and syphilis—can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth.

&gt;A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. Therefore, the term “sexually transmitted infection” is a broader term than “sexually transmitted disease” (STD).""

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","No one i listed there is a main AWP the main AWPs for Fnc, NiP and NaVi aka JW, Allu, and GuardiaN are all great AWPs and imo GuardiaN &gt; Kenny atm. Envy, VP and TSM all have hybrid AWPs that are based on what map and who is feeling the AWP at the time since on those teams Smithzz, shox, happy, pasha, snax, neo, device, cajun, and karrigan all AWP semi regularily and not just as the 2nd AWPer. 

In terms of being able to consistently get entries with rifles I think Olofm, Dupreeh, Friberg, Byali, Flamie, and Shox are all more consistent performers while apEX has only had 1 tournament ever (ESL Cologne) where he was able to truly be a star entry fragger while the rest of the top 6 teams have players that are at least as good if not better than apEX.

RPK has never been a support player he has always been an aggressive rifler and anyways Titan already have support players in Ex6tenz and Maniac.

I think you are very correct in stating that Titan's greatest strength is Ex6tenz's ability to pick up T rounds but where they break down is in head to head fragging on their CT sides.


If I go role by role for Titan's players i could list many players better or close to them in their roles.

AWP Guardian, KennyS, JW

IGL Ex6tenz, Pronax, Zeus

Lurk GTR, Snax, Happy, Flusha, Maniac

Mid Round Rifler KrimZ, Xizt, Shox, CajunB, Edward, Seized, RPK

Entry Olofm, Dupreeh, Flamie, Byali, Friberg, apEX


In summary I think Titan being around 7th in the world is the best they can hope for with how skilled the top 6 in the world currently is since any of the top 6's riflers are miles ahead of Titan.","1433117486"

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is wrong on many, many levels:

(1)  Point me to legislation that 'specifically authorizes' every.single.situation that government agencies are likely to encounter. Never mind, don't...because it doesn't exist. You cannot draft legislation that is will address every possible scenario, and so Congress DID/DOES intend  for agencies, like the EPA to have discretion when interpreting legislation.

I know this because the Supreme Court said so in Chevron (Google The Chevron Doctrine). There would be many, many barriers  to agency action without this judicial doctrine, which would practically halt any agency actions. So no, the EPA's authority is not ""sketchy"";.

(2)  The EPA hasn't 'toed' any lines; it just looks this way because nearly all decisions made about implementation of various laws (such as CWA, CAA, CERCLA , ESA, etc...) are challenged by all sides.

For example,  defining wetlands in the CWA led to pro-eviros saying the new definition wasn't broad enough and the pro-industry saying it was to  too broad already. Again, the EPA is merely interpreting laws created by Congress in a way that makes  enforcement of these laws feasible. 

To call the EPA ""radical"" is fucking laughable, and there are TONS of groups/people who say they aren't protecting the environment enough.

(3) saying the authority of the EPA will fall into question is just wrong...it would mean that all other agencies also will have their discretion undermined (again, because of the Chevron doctrine)

This would be crippling for all levels of government decision making. The EPA's authority  will never ""come into question"".


The fact of the matter is industry and enviro protection are not mutually exclusive or at odds with one another . Views like yours make it seem so, though.

Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi argued a bizarre theory that these murders were done because Manson believed the Beatles were telling him secret messages in their music, and that he was going to set off a race war that would end up with all white people dead except him...

...in reality, the theory later explained by Manson himself (IIRC) and other members of his gang makes a lot more sense.  One of the Family members was already in jail on suspicion of murder, so the gang attempted to do copycat murders so the cops would think someone else was behind the original one.

Also, I should add that the prosecution's case rested largely on an accomplice who claimed she had a role, didn't do any of the actual killing, and was given a sweetheart deal.  Sound familiar?

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","While a photon has no rest mass, it nevertheless still possesses a momentum. This is a direct result of the [energy-momentum relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation), which states that the energy can be expressed as 

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2 )^2, 

where E is the energy, p is the momentum, m is the rest mass and c is the speed of light. Because light has a finite energy and a zero rest mass (which makes the term on the right equal to zero), it immediately follows that it must have a finite momentum. Reflection of light causes this momentum to change direction, which results in a force due to [Newton's second law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_second_law). This force is called radiation pressure, which makes things like [solar sails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail) possible. ","1433117490"

"space","t5_2qh87","You are right up to a point. Relativity tells us that all velocity is relative. That means that if at any point the Earth and the exhaust are travelling at escape velocity relative to one another, they will escape one another. If the Earth is the one accelerating away from the exhaust faster than the exhaust gasses are accelerating towards it (e.g. 9.8m/s^2 at ground level) then the exhaust gasses will continue to accelerate away from the Earth.

It would no longer be a closed system, providing that level of acceleration could be maintained. Obviously if you can expel the gasses outside of the atmosphere, a 3km/s initial speed will take it high enough that the required acceleration would be lower, if not by much.

Is this ever going to happen? Of course not, but then neither was any number of man-made rockets moving any form of major celestial body.","1433117491"

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","&gt; (although the carves don't have anything to say about it) Teostra all use these Sacs.

My theory for Teostra is that he doesn't use a fire sac. As we know Teostra gives off spores or powder which is extremely explosive when ignited. When you fight him he usually flaps his wings a few times to spread the powder and then snaps his jaws, then the powder explodes in a chain reaction. It could be that Teostra has a flint and steel like mechanism in his jaws so that when he bites, all the powder around him ignites and explodes. Teostra also doesn't breathe fire in the same way that Rathian or Gravios do, he releases it in a cyclone in front of him rather than a beam or ball. It could be possible that Teostra only relies on his spores rather than a fire sac. I can't wait for you to cover Thunder and Water next week though :)","1433117493"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;Go solely for the abdomen if you feel so inclined but if I feel I can make the shot I am going to fuck somebodies legs up first.

This is not standard teaching for anyone with a gun. These are situations where fractions of a second matter, and by the time you decide you can't make a leg shot you might already be in a bad situation. This is why they teach center mass, every time. Because it's not just that if you miss you might get hurt or killed, but if you miss you might hit or kill someone else. Once that bullet has left the gun, you are no longer in control of what it does, and if it misses your intended target and hits someone else, that's on you. Which is why you shoot for the bigger target. 

&gt;which is how many I said it would take to stop somebody.

&gt;shooting multiple 5+ rounds in quick succession when the first 1 or 2 already stopped them seems to be common in police departments and is not punished

You said 1-2, and both examples I provided refuted this fact. 


And my point about police safety was that perception is more important than facts to people. This is just the truth. Police *perceive* their job to be more dangerous, and they act accordingly. And we *perceive* police to be dangerous to us, when statistically, they aren't. Police shootings that are unjustified are outliers, and yet here we are having this discussion.

2) Freelancing is possible, but typically only later in your career when you have some serious knowledge. A lot of people underestimate how hard it is to do the work alone without a team working on the same things as you that you can lean on for help whether that be time related or knowledge related. Inventing your own things (or working for a startup and hitting it rich). This depends. You have to work for something that you think actually has a chance at making it big, you have to be dedicated, you usually make less money and work more hours, and you have to do all this knowing that there is still only a small chance that the company explodes and you'll strike it rich. 

3) Later in your career the best way to do this is going to be by freelancing or by working for a contractor. Don't expect this before you have a few years (at least) in the industry. Also expect to make less money if you're working for someone remotely. There is usually less pay to make up for being able to work remotely.

Good question, simple answer! The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP. While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of ""seeing"" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement. Over time, astronauts download the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer. This onboard/zero-gravity data is compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight. The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit. (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days). This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space. For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc. Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.

Other watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).

Oops, just checked my watch... time to stop typing!

With the conflict minerals in my control and no longer being sold on the cheap, those markets either have to choose between crashing, adapting before they crash or agree to my terms and my prices.

Just like that I have most of the leaders in current stock market under my control, my country has an enormous economy with a post scarcity supply of food and with a ruined country now stable a healthy industrial sector for the next few decades as we build up the  infrastructure across the continent.

Clayton C. Anderson, US Astronaut, Retired

1.4k upvotes

Good question, simple answer! The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP. While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of ""seeing"" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement. Over time, astronauts download the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer. This onboard/zero-gravity data is compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight. The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit. (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days). This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space. For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc. Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.

Other watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).

Oops, just checked my watch... time to stop typing!

It is, however, fairly common to actually feel good in late pregnancy and still have baby at a normal and healthy point on your own with zero symptoms before labor starts.

The Ring was entrusted to Frodo and Frodo alone, and Gandalf agreed with this because he had a feeling that this was the only way it would work out (read: he guessed/hoped that God would show up with a bit of divine intervention). The Fellowship was sent along to help Frodo - it was not that men, dwarves and elves were sent to do what an eagle could not. None of them could destroy the Ring; but Gandalf knew that it was Frodo's destiny to undertake this mission, and he arranged for some help.

Pardon me for bringing in yet another reason why it is not a plothole in mentioning the additional detail of eagles being very easy to notice. This hardly detracts from the more important fact that all would be corrupted by the Ring, eagles included.

Face it, there is no plothole here; and if you were being reasonable you would see this. Giving the Ring to an eagle would have failed.","1433117507"

I agree at face value it definitely looks like it isn't. These are really old like before the kickstarter. That's why you see them in such a 1 dimensional light. On the fb page you see little mini comics starring the characters that fleshes them out a bit. It shows off the satirical nature much better. 


&gt;Why did you repeat 'It's Robin'?   Plus why the Wonder Twins...could have used Hawk Girl or Super Girl instead of them.  *Edit*:  I see your other post with Super Natural so ignore that last comment (nice to see a character shot of her too).

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Building executioner with beatstick is really really great, if the enemy takes 1 defense item it'll most likely do more damage than exe+titans (cause of the order of penetration: reduction % &gt; flat reduction &gt; penetration % &gt; flat pen)

Now that build wont work in 1v1 joust really, you need at least 1 defense item to make your build efficient.

Qin's sais is hard to tell, so many different situations. If you have a high attack speed with a low damage output (bellona I.M.O.) qins is probably worth it. Qins on adc's in joust against (as you mentioned) warlock sash+some other hp def item is still not worth it (I think). You will probably miss out a vital part of your normal basic attack dmg (as adc) that qins cannot compensate. (this is not an opinion nor advice, this is an educated guess on dps) Maaaaybe it can replace ichaival in the endgame (60 power effectively (30 more), 30 % att speed (15% more), 10 penetration (10 more). But do note that you will lifesteal less. I honestly dont know what is better, will depend on many factors:

-enemy defense (lower = better for qins)

-your lifesteal (lower = more efficient to go qins)

-enemy hp (higher better for qins)

-your base attack speed and progression (faster = better for qins)

-your base damage (lower = better for qins, might rather invest into crit, penetration or lifesteal if this is very high)

-enemy phoenix is standing (qins is NOT efficient for taking objectives likes camps, towers, phoenix &amp; titan)

Long story short, its too hard to tell I personally do not like qins in joust not even on kali!! (for lifesteal and tower sieging reasons). Perhaps only would go qins on bellona in joust myself.

Clayton C. Anderson, US Astronaut, Retired

Good question, simple answer! The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP. While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of ""seeing"" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement. Over time, astronauts download the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer. This onboard/zero-gravity data is compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight. The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit. (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days). This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space. For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc. Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.

Other watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).

Oops, just checked my watch... time to stop typing!

"ECE","t5_2r2sg","The reason you're confused about that, is because it's not a one-step solution. In order to determine the voltage drop, you have to first understand what the downstream circuit is doing. 

Think of it this way: You know the voltage source is 240V, and the first resistance still allows a current of 200mA. If this was the only resistor in the circuit, the whole 240V would drop over this resistor, and this would imply V=IR that R = 1200 Ohms.

Now, imagine the same circuit, with a unknown black box circuit added downstream. If this black box has Rbb = 100 Ohms, and you KNOW that R1 (and hence the whole circuit) is still passing 200mA, this implies the total resistance that the source sees has not changed, and that R1 must now be 1100 Ohms. Total resistance is still 1200 Ohms, so circuit current remains at 200mA. In this imagined circuit, The voltage drop across R1 is the ratio of it's resistance over the entire circuit resistance, or 1100 / 1200, multiplied by 240V... so 220V would be dissipated over R1, and 20V over R2.

Now imagine the same black box circuit but this time, the black box resistance is 1100 Ohms. By the same logic as above, this would imply R1 is only 100 Ohms. Total circuit resistance still 1200 Ohms, allows a current of 200mA.  This time, the Voltage dropped over R1 is only 20V, and over R2 is 220 V. 

So you see? To understand how much voltage is dissipated by a component, you must determine how much current is going through it, and how much resistance is has. To do that, you have to solve the whole series circuit. ","1433117513"

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","This is pretty tricky, as I am not quite sure what you are intending to present. Are you just presenting the aspect? Or is it more of a reflection piece? 

You could perhaps do a monologue, presenting as the author at a significant juncture in the novel. Or portray another at a more recent atrocity, using the narrative techniques and aspect for that individual. 

Just looking at sparknotes a significant quote:
 
Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.
Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.
Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.

This passage, from Night’s third section, occurs just after Eliezer and his father realize they have survived the first selection at Birkenau. It is perhaps Night’s most famous passage, notable because it is one of the few moments in the memoir where Eliezer breaks out of the continuous narrative stream with which he tells his tale. As he reflects upon his horrendous first night in the concentration camp and its lasting effect on his life, Wiesel introduces the theme of Eliezer’s spiritual crisis and his loss of faith in God.

---

&gt;Sexual objectification involves a woman being viewed primarily as an object of male sexual desire, rather than as a whole person.    Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, some feminists  see objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising and media, women being portrayed as weak or submissive through [pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography), images in more mainstream [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Published_media) such as [advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising) and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), [stripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease) and [prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution), men brazenly evaluating or judging women sexually or aesthetically in public spaces and events, such as beauty contests, and the presumed need for [cosmetic surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery), particularly breast enlargement and [labiaplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labiaplasty).

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","Based on your questions I think you need to think about what FI means...

FI simply means that you do not need to work to have enough income to pay for your expenses.  Some people simply reach that point without actively trying.  I personally have a high savings rate because I never wanted ""stuff"" so I had a large balance in my bank account which was growing over time.  I then learned about investing and so my money went to investments.  AFTER THAT I learned what FI was and I was already on the way...  I am still over a decade away from reaching FI, but I am just trying to show that some people have a starting point of spending less than they make and it is not really a decision to become FI, it is the path they were already on.

As user 'tyir' stated, a better question would be why would you NOT want to be FI?  FI means you can quit your job *if you want* or you can work *if you want*.  Not being FI means you *must* work.  Being FI means you get the choice.  Being FI also means that you can relax much more when you do work because you do not need a promotion or a raise for anything, you are working because you *want to work* rather than you need the money.

For me the biggest lifestyle change was I began to eat out much less.  Again, this actually happened without the goal if FI, it was me looking at my mint.com account with a reaction of ""HOLY SHIT I SPENT HOW MUCH ON FOOD LAST YEAR???""  Not an exaggeration, I spent over a day in disbelief...  The largest choice due to FI was to move out of the apartment I loved beyond rationalization into a still-nice apartment.  The move saved me $200/month in rent and over an hour of driving each day.

I currently am actively pursuing FI, or I will be again shortly.  I left my job as an electrical engineer to pursue a job in software.  I was able to do this **BECAUSE** I had savings built up from my lifestyle.  I hated being an EE doing what I was doing and now I can change my career into something I will enjoy many times more and I could not have done it (without taking on huge amounts of debt) had I not been on this path.

Being on the path to FI is not always about not working.  For me it led to this great chance for me to improve my career to something I want to do rather than what I had a degree to do.  I also expect it to lead to less stress than my family has as everyone else in my family has large amounts of debt (credit card debt for most of them, student loans the rest) and I never need to worry about those things because of the lifestyle I am living.","1433117516"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","&gt;Its just very unnerving being hit by the wind and having the potential crash. 

So, it's the moving around that bothers you, rather than just the feeling of nakedness you get with wind hitting you?

Not being moved by the wind is about technique.   when I first started, the wind would send me all over the place.  a gust would come, I'd steer into it, the gust would go away;  I was all over the lane.   I read that I should keep my arms loose, you know, so I could move without the handlebars moving, and I got handlebar extensions, so I didn't have to lean over so much, which made doing that realistic.   After practicing that for a while, after my first year of having only a motorcycle, crosswinds didn't move me on the motorcycle any more than they moved me in the car.  

So yeah, as far as I can tell (a lot of this is not conscious, and there might be something even more important that I started doing unconsciously around the same time.)   the biggest part of the problem of being moved by the wind is that you need to hold the handlebars in a way that your body can move (or be moved by the wind) without pushing the handlebars around.        Which is harder than it sounds, especially if the geometry of your bike forces you into a lean of any sorts.    But yeah;  the handlebars really are the easiest way to make a motorcycle turn, so if you are moving in an unwanted direction, looking at the forces being applied to the handlebars are the first place to look, I think.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","It's not that black and white, there's quite a lot between ""taking game absurdly seriously"" and ""bragging about winning while high on shrooms"". It all depends on how you want to see the game. If you think that Magic is a place for competing on who can win while giving the least fucks about other people, then fine. If you think they should be a place where people actually compete in a game of skill, then you should behave accordingly.

Choosing the latter doesn't mean that you can't have fun while playing. No one says that tournaments must be like a funeral. We don't drink at my LGS, we don't do drugs or anything like that. We treat our opponents with a certain level of respect. It doesn't take anything away from the fun.

If you want to do shrooms / drugs / whatever at a place designated for that then great, have as much as you want. There are bars where you can play Magic and that's awesome, they don't have those in my city but I am really looking forward to visiting one in a few months.

Clayton C. Anderson, US Astronaut, Retired

Good question, simple answer! The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP. While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of ""seeing"" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement. Over time, astronauts download the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer. This onboard/zero-gravity data is compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight. The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit. (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days). This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space. For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc. Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.

Other watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).

Oops, just checked my watch... time to stop typing!

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","I personally think Gameplay greatly outweighs Story.  
Why? Because fun gameplay keeps people playing. Everybody plays games for fun. People want to have fun, they want entertainment. Sure, Story can be entertaining. But thats basically just what books do. They provide stories, you might like and entertain yourself with. But we're talking about games. You as a player, want to interact with the world you wanna do stuff, you want to make something meaningfull and or you want to make something happen.  
Interesting and fun gameplay is waaaaaaay more important than story.  
League of Legends for example. Sure it has some backstory but most of the players dont even care. The game got popular due to fun, casual gameplay not through story.  
I think story just enhances gameplay. If you have to deal with a tough situation because in the story you learned about the characters etc etc etc now this is improving gameplay because you have to think about it as a player. Games without story are sometimes really successfull. Minecraft or other sandboxes, counterstrike and more are being played for gameplay and not story.","1433117527"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","/u/OldTrux is right. There is no way to prevent this problem other than going slower. The reason he crashed was a matter of physics alone, not lack of driving skill. The car's speed was such that, when it crested the hill, the car's weight unloaded from the tires to the point where there was not enough friction between the tires and the road to hold the car in the turn. Even if you put the best driver in the world behind the wheel, he would not be able to take that exact car through that exact line at that exact speed. That's one reason why rally pace notes include the ""over crest"" callout. The driver needs to know that he will lose some grip, so he can adjust his speed accordingly to prevent a crash.

Although this R8 spun out in the turn, it is possible for others cars to take a similar line at the same speed assuming they have some way to maintain a high enough amount of grip during the turn. This could come from stickier tires, more aero bits to make downforce, or a suspension setup that helps keep the tires pushed into the tarmac better.

As far as correcting once you've spun out in a case like this, there is a certain amount of driver skill/reaction that could come into play, but for the most part you're at the mercy of nature. The slight bit of driver input that could make a difference in this specific crash would have been to crank the wheel to the right. Since he was sliding backwards, cranking the wheel right could have directed the car toward the track and away from the wall. This would be hard to think about though when you're about to crash an Audi R8. The driver was in panic mode and kept the wheel cranked left the whole time after he tried to correct for the oversteer. Even if someone had the presence of mind to think about steering away from the wall though, there are no guarantees. Firstly, you wouldn't be able to save it by cranking the wheel all the way right because that would cause the front of the car to swing out directly into the wall. You'd have to find the perfect steering angle that allowed the back of the car to creep away from the wall. Finding that angle would be hard, but even then it's still unlikely you'd be able to save it. There simply isn't enough grip available on grass to alter the direction of the car very much.","1433117527"

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","If you're taking both to the theoretical extreme then both numbers are so incredibly large it doesn't even matter, the upper bound for chess is 10^46.7 board-states. For comparisons sake if you had a billion people making one boardstate per second since the universe began, you'd still be out by a factor of 10^19. So even if you had a billion universes each with a billion people doing 1 boardstate per second you STILL wouldn't have completed all the possible boardstates in chess!

Because i'm procrastinating from an exam I might aswell have a go for hearthstone. Ignoring class card restrictions because I'm a physics student and this is a perfectly spherical cow in a vaccum there are about 10^56 (30 choose (no.cards * 2)) possible decks to make. Now it's just a handshake problem so there is an upper bound of about 10^112 games of hearthstone. Note that this is a massive overestimation because the original overestimation due to the class cards gets squares.

If anyone wants to do this properly you can probably get a better estimate from doing 9 * number of decks possible for one class to make.","1433117529"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","You just have to make your offer and hope they will work with you. Not everyone is reasonable though, some people are just deluded. Time for a story, I hope your experience is better: 

In AZ we had a sitting governor get impeached and go to jail for real estate fraud. 10 years later I'm appraising and get an order for a property in his wife's name, loan offer confirms, yep, that's the wife of former governor. The order info says it's a house on 2 acres. MLS says house on 2 acres. I pull up the tax records, looks like 1 acre to me. GIS maps show 1 acre. And there was no mistaking it because it was a triangular shaped lot where the two angular sides were major arterial roads, and the short side bounded up against another single family home (that had been there many years, it wasn't a recent split or anything). 

The order was a purchase, the renter wanted to buy it. So I show up and am doing my thing and he's following me around telling me about the place and he mentions it being two acres. I tell him, I don't think so, here see the tax records. See the plat map. See the GIS map. Do you have a survey showing the boundaries are wrong? Nope, no survey has been done. OK then it's an acre. He argues with me no it's two acres, the seller says two acres. I'm like, where is the second acre then? He's still arguing with me. OK I say, let's measure it and do the calculations of the square footage. We literally measured it with my 100 foot tape measure, and I sat there with damn graph paper and calculated it in front of him, it comes out to 1 acre. He is very angry at this point and still swears it's two acres because that's what the sellers told him. I wanted to say YOU MEAN THE SELLER'S HUSBAND WHO WENT TO JAIL FOR REAL ESTATE FRAUD??? But I did not. 

I actually ended up not finishing the report because the house did not meet minimum property requirements so there was no way a loan would be made on it. I collected my trip fee (which was hardly worth the time I had spent with that guy) but I suspect they would not have been pleased with the value if I had finished it. ","1433117530"

I don't agree with his view on how gear should be earned, but I do agree that AI can be simple and predictable. PvP is harder then PvE a lot of the time. Because human opponents present a whole different level of challenge. I can see wanting the rewards to be equal across PVE and PVP game modes. But getting them...can we just acknowledge that getting PvP rewards is harder for the average person?

You can be average and beat Crota HM or PoE 35. Once you get a strategy, because you're playing against a ""simple AI"", that strategy will work almost every time. Crota doesn't suddenly realize ""hey when the rockets hit me, that little guy with the sword is gonna come whack down my health"" and then suddenly change his strategy. The Boomer Knights don't ever realize the bubble is a decoy and stop shooting at it. Humans would. Humans adjust. Humans have different skill levels. A dreg is a dreg. There all programmed the same. Not so with a human. 

Different skill levels need to be acknowledged, and given a way to earn their rewards in a more level playing field. And yes, this is coming from a salty, K.D 1.2 primarily PVE player who wants a shot at the Trials loot without having to beat the leet MLG PVP pros :/","1433117533"

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","A lot of you are sharing this advice. What I have shared with the class has usually been when students asked me questions and when it related to a discussion we were having. I certainly don't bring up personal stuff that often. I think you're right that I should maybe only share things with small groups of students who care to ask. 

What prompted me sharing this year was a reading convocation that our principal asked a few of us to give to the entire school. The teachers on that committee discussed how we should share how we got into reading as kids and what it has done for us. I told the teachers that I started reading because it was an escape from the life I wasn't happy with and that I read stories about young people who weren't happy with their situations and found a better way. I explained that in inspired me to keep reading as a way to get by. They told me it might be nice to share that with the school because so many of our students may not be happy with their situations. I did, and I had a few students ask me more about it when they saw me the next day in class. They asked what kind of situation it was and I told them. Several students said they were so surprised because they never would have guessed that I came from a broken home, and they seemed to appreciate me sharing. They even made comments about how they thought I should talk about stuff like that more. 

So every once in a while, when our discussions moved in certain directions, kids would ask me more questions and I would answer them honestly, without sharing too much or breaking down or anything. I should just be more wary of who is interested and who doesn't care, and limit how many students I share with. Maybe tell them they could ask me more when we weren't in class.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","If this was a friendship that I valued I probably wouldn't get in deep with any discussions on religion or evolution. However, as for the points that this person made:    
&gt;  What you need to realise is that you can neither reject nor deny the existence of God    
    
I don't exactly know how to respond to this. When I first glossed this over, I read it as ""reject nor affirm"" and thought it was going for a Dawkins scale 4/all things equal agnostic. But then I reread it and would respond by asking what the evidence that makes the existence of a deity self-evident (as the existence of the computer that I'm using to make this post is).    
    
&gt;  ""Please, if evolution was a FACT, then don't you think that everyone would believe it? Thats the exact same shitty logic you used for your own belief. at the end of the day if you put your faith in a system where you magically evolve over billions of years from bloody fish to apes to human beings with intellect, then I believe I have the same right to call you close minded and ignorant.""    
    
I would respond by asking if this person truly sees the work of scientists working based on observation of evidence in the natural world (with the literature generally available for viewing by anyone) as equivalent to a holy book and teachings that are disseminated by faith leaders without any natural basis or justification as equivalent. If the person did see them as equivalent, there's not much I could do in the context of this argument. The representation of evolution as ""magical"" is also distressing.    
Also, as I read it, it sounds as if this person is responding to (perhaps you invoked it) Schellenberg's argument from divine hiddenness, which is one of my personal favorite arguments (if I'm reading too much into it and you didn't mention this, it goes something like this: P) Believers and nonbelievers can be either resistant (define a position and then do not make an effort to expose themselves to evidence for the other one) or nonresistant (try to and succeed in exposing themselves to a wide range of evidence from both sides and then come to one or the other conclusion). P) If God exists, he is omnipotent, loving, and just. P) If God is omnipotent, loving, and just, he would always be open to a relationship with nonresistant person. P) If this God is open to all relationships with nonresistant people, there would be no nonresistant nonbelievers. P) nonresistant nonbelievers exist. C) There is no God.    
    
&gt; So what if I believe in a God? So what if I believe there is a life after death? So what if I believe that my dad has not completely died and left us. Fuck you for bringing that up.    
    
Clearly, the conversation in which you're involved is not capable of morphing into a completely logical one due to the other interlocutor's emotional investment. I'm sure that most people here are familiar with the reasons that simply believing in God can be dangerous (can lead to bad behavior with belief as justification, can lead us to be credulous, etc) in spite of the potential immediate (and some long-term, although I think that there are far better reality-based coping methods) psychological benefits. It seems as though you laid these out already and the person's emotional investment prevents them from even approaching an unbiased perspective on this subject.    
    
&gt;  All you fucking atheists do is be hypocritical and complain about religious preachers where you have a religion of your own in essence    
    
This is that false equivalency again.    
    
&gt;  yeah I don't want to believe that my dad has gone and I haven't even accepted it yet. How dare you even use that as an excuse or a reason to pick and argument with someone?    
    
Once again, this person is too emotional to view this issue without bias. I will say that the second half of this is stupid since you were talking with someone else when you mentioned this person's father. However, like I said, this person is too emotional to be very logical.    
    
&gt;  Regardless of my way of coping with his death, I DO believe there is a God and I will ALWAYS believe there is a God. I will always believe there is heaven and hell.    
    
This is the most distressing part of this to me and also, if I was engaging this person in an argument, the juiciest part to engageIMO. This demonstrates the biggest difference between myself (and I would hope you as well, although I can't be sure) and this other person - we leave room for updating our beliefs. If we saw something that could truly inspire confidence that a deity existed, our beliefs would change. However, this person is extremely stubborn in his/her belief (and in Schellenberg's argument that I laid out before could be classified as a resistant believer, although they are not really a part of the argument). This demonstrates that the person is incapable of arguing without bias on the issue.    
    
&gt;  I believe that this world is full of too much shit and that people must be held accountable for their actions by a JUST RULER AND CREATOR.    
    
Something like an is/ought fallacy. Just because it would be good for people to be judged based on their actions (although would heaven and hell really be a good system though?), it is not necessarily true.    
    
&gt;  In fact, I pity people like you who lack any kind of hope and therefore take it out on people who do have hope.    
    
Very typical religious strawman of atheists as lacking hope or meaning. The assertion that atheists lack hope is patently absurd (thank you Matt Dillahunty for showing me that ""patently absurd"" is my favorite phrase ever).    
    
&gt;  Anyway, my faith isnt based on just that. I look around and I see the world for its beauty and I truly believe that it has been blessed. That it is a creation.    
    
This person may believe that it has been blessed and that it is a creation, but s/he provides no justification. Hitchens' Razor (and a simple understanding of the burden of proof) dictates that assertions without any evidence can be dismissed without any evidence. This assertion is not sufficient justification for any sort of belief about creation (as no assertion can be sufficient justification for anything, as assertions require evidence to demonstrate their truth).    
    
&gt;  I feel pity for you who looks around and sees nothing.    
    
Another typical religious strawman of atheists, similar to the one about lacking hope. Just because we don't see intelligent design in the natural world does not mean that we can't be deeply moved because of its aesthetic features or by any natural occurrences (since I'm a naturalist, by this I pretty much mean anything that occurs ever haha).    
    
&gt;  Argue all you want about it being ""what it is"" but at the end of the day, our beliefs are relative, and YOU are the close minded and ignorant one if you cannot see that.    
    
This is a very silly statement. It can be argued that morality is relative, but beliefs are not. The culture in which one is raised does not make cosmological assertions true for some and false for others. One's being raised in a Muslim household while others in an atheist household does not make God exist for the former and not exist for the latter. Either one of the two assertions is true or neither of them is true. This can be argued, and I (and most people here) would believe that the evidence much more strongly supports the conclusion that **no** god/s exist than the one that god/s exist. However, we've already seen that this person is not in a state conducive to logical discussions.    
    
&gt;  Once again, don't ever bring up my father in that context again. Him dying is not support or argument for your shitty and ridiculous theory that God does not exist"".    
    
Emotion triumphs once again. Also, I doubt that you used his death as any sort of ""support"" or ""evidence"" for the lack of god'/s' existence, but rather that you used it as an illustrative example in a wholly different discussion with a different person.    
    
&gt;  Funny, again I pity you. You simply can't accept that people have a faith system that is just as ""ridiculous"" as yours. You can't prove that evolution happened. You simply cannot go back into time and provide evidence for IG.    
    
False equivalency. I don't know what IG stands for, assuming it has to do with evolution. No, we can't go back in time, but going back to any singular point in time isn't really the way that we would prove evolution anyway. The crux of evolution is development over all time (all time since abiogenesis, which is also not within the scope of evolution, first occurred, anyway). Obtaining a wide range of past fossil and skeletal evidence is really the only way of evaluating evolution. So far it has held up quite nicely, and as we discover more and more evidence, it continues to do so.    
    
However, overall, if you value this person's friendship, I would suggest  that you not say anything that I just said and try to repair the friendship. That is not my forte so I will leave advice on that front to others.","1433117536"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I don't think you're over reacting. I think you're right to sever your friendship with her, for good. This most likely means you can't hang with her husband anymore, and he certainly cannot, since you can't expect contact with the husband to never also include contact with the wife. (On that note: how is friend's hubby taking it?)

Your husband is definitely hiding gory details from you, and you probably don't know if you want to know them all or not, or if you'd even believe him if he *did* tell you everything, and that's the primary problem you have to tackle: you can no longer trust your husband.

I get that you don't want to end the marriage, but it takes two to make a marriage work, and you need to be sure he doesn't want a divorce, too. You should do couples' therapy. You've lost that foundation of trust and if the marriage is going to last, you need to get it back. Don't think you need to fix this on your own: he needs to be just as committed if you're ever going to trust him again, and a couple usually isn't equipped to handle a breach of trust like this without outside support.

Tho, I do recommend being picky in choosing a therapist for ya'll. Therepists come in different styles / flavors, and wasting time with one whose style doesn't suit ya'll can be just as demoralizing as trying to fix it on your own and failing six months later.

I'm sorry this happened, and I wish you happiness in the future. I hope things work out well for you from here on out.","1433117543"

Let me tell you something: BoA dropped coal mining for ONE reason and ONE reason only: It wasn't profitable anymore. It's that simple. Yes, whenever this all started (5 or so years ago) coal was still a huge profit creator. Fast forward five years, republicans **demanded** that we ""drill, baby, drill.""

We did just that. EVERYWHERE. We drilled the living *fuck* out of every inch of America where there was oil to be had. We fracked the living shit out of America. 

The result? TONS of oil….much lower prices than coal, easier to get, easier to transport, easier to prepare. Much, much cheaper.

Also the result: Why would ANYONE buy coal when it's harder to transport, requires more treatment to turn into energy and COSTS much, much more than oil? 

Again, BoA bends to absolutely **no one** other than profits and shareholders. Period. We all win but it wasn't the result of ""efforts,"" which were really just wasted time and money and, I'm guessing,  reason for these people to get together and play dress up and hold signs. 

So it's nice that this is a reality but it has only to do with profits and if you ever, EVER meet a bank that will bend to anything other tha profits, please let me know. I will be sure to tell you how high you are.","1433117544"

"chile","t5_2rer8","Pa los de Santiago: No se quejen, el clima de santiago es la zorra.

1. El verano no es caluroso. Los record de 38 son en Lampa entremedio de los cerros donde el calor rq se encierra, pero en Santiago siempre corre una brisa. Además es calor seco que es lo mejor (hasta los 40). En un verano regular tienes 4 dias que el calor pasa de los 35 y eso es casi siempre en diciembre-enero Febrero se nubla, se van todos de vacaciones y Santiago es bakan.

2. Durante el verano la temperatura baja en la noche. Creo que fue este año que un par de días la temperatura en la noche no bajo de los 20 y estaban todos que se morían. Eso es muy la raja del clima, una ventanita abierta en la noche y estas listo. La raja.

3. En el invierno la temperatura no baja de los 0 grados y eso es en la noche. Despues de las 9AM la temperatura es completamente soportable.

4. NO NIEVA. La nieve es de lo peor. Es bonito en las peliculas, pero apalear nieve es una mierda. Te andai resbalando por todos lados. Aparte la nieve hace mierda las calles y los autos. Cuando se derrite, las mas minima pifia en el pavimento se llena de agua, que en la noche se convierte en hielo y se expande. Asi, en una temporada las calles terminan hechas mierda. Además echan sal para que no pase eso, lo que hace cagar los autos.

5. No llueve tanto. Si, hay veces que llueve por 2 días seguidos. Pero no es terrible. Y sabes que va a hacer frio por un par de dias despues de que llueve. De nuevo, el clima es super predecible.

Acá con otros lugares que puedo comprar, que he pasado tiempo suficiente como para hacerme una opinión:

- Suecia: Nieve y frio. Mas encima el copete es caro y no se puede comprar en cualquier lado (me hubiese vuelto alcoholico depresivo si no). Aparte la ubicación geografica hace que haya menos luz. El sol se pone como a las 4-5 en invierno. Las suecas son lo bueno, y esperar que la temperatura suba de los -10 porque ahi salen con mini. El verano es humedo pero no tan caluroso. De nuevo las suecas son lo mejor.

- Alemania: Nieve y frio, pero no tanto como en Suecia. Por lo menos copete podis comprar en todos lados. El verano es caluroso y medio humedo. Necesitas aire acondicionado o si no lo pasas malisimo. O un castillo de roca tambien salva pal verano. 

- Beijing: Frio, viento y smog. El viento te baja la sensacion termica a cagar, aparte es sequisimo, se te parten los labios y las manos se te hacen cagar. Ahí aprendí a usar cremita. Y máscara pal smog. El verano caluroso y humedo. Lo bueno si, es la comida.

- Miami: Clima tropical = calor+humedad. Pa ir de vacaciones por una semana, ok. Pa mamarte esa mierda siempre ni cagando. Sobre todo las temporadas de lluvia, que llueve con un calor y cuando para de llover ves el vapor en la calle, un sauna.

- Norte de EEUU: Frio y nieve. NY es pasable, al menos el clima es predecible. Chicago es lo peor. Viento siempre y no sabes que va a pasar. Hace un par de meses un dia que haba sol. Me voy a un muelle por unas chelas. 20 minutos, empieza a correr viento. 25 minutos, empieza a correr mas viento que la cresta. 30 minutos, bajo la temperatura de unos 15 a 6 grados. Se le veia el vaho a la gente. Nop. Paso con Chicago. ""You know what they say about Chicago. If you don't like the weather, wait fifteen minutes"" Es mas impredecible que la mierda.

- California: De NOCAL, nada que decir. Es como Chilito, quiza un poco mas extremo (poco mas de frio en invierno, poco mas de calor en verano). Excepto por San Francisco, que siempre hace frío y hay neblina.

- Ahora estoy e Dallas. No he pasado el verano pero me dicen que llega facil a los 40 y en la noche baja re poco. El invierno no es malo, no hace tanto frio.

TL;DR: El clima de Santiago es la zorra.

A pedophile joke involving Catholics would not upset me as much, and I think that's totally appropriate and consistent with me thinking that the joke about Muslims is shitty. I'm not saying you can't joke about groups of people, but you also can't divorce a joke from social context. Just face it: you could joke a million times about Catholic priests molesting kids but when you see a Catholic priest, you're still not going to change the way you treat and generally respect them. You can tell me you do but that would just be dishonest. But where the American sentiment re Muslim populations is so a) in flux and b) headed in such a shitty direction, these types of jokes actually have the propensity to shape the way observers see and treat Muslims in America.

In the context of video games, SJW's in gaming are already a challenge for GG. Hijacking GG and turning it into a broader culture war would defeat any chance at disempower SJW's and their unethical behavior in gaming (or any other single issue) since GG doesn't have enough support to sustain such. Further, the shitposting about SJW's in general is like bashing liberals at a gun rights rally because it accomplishes nothing, and often draws people who make us look like complete twats to the average gamer. Another way the example is analogous is because there are many feminists who dislike the SJW take on gaming (I happen to know a few), so by making GG just about how much you hate feminism really just hurts the cause of GG. However, by reading a lot of the posts here, I've come to the conclusion that a lot of the people don't really care about GG so much as they care about derailing it to be about their own pet issues.","1433117547"

Having a baby, the prenatal care and the hospital time and everything, costs A LOT of money. Paying off hospital bills at the same time as student loans is tough-trust me, I've done it. When will you have enough to go back to school? It sounds like it would be a few years. That's a tough break on a career path.

Then there's child care. You say now that the families you work for are willing to let you bring the baby, but is that guaranteed? What if they change their minds? As you well know, child care is ridiculously expensive.

I'm not criticizing you for wanting to keep your baby. I just think you need to step back and realize your parents are not entirely wrong for wanting you to look at this. Big picture is that it will cost more than the rent you calculated, and take more time than you might want to believe before you can get back on track. ","1433117547"

I hope I live long enough for mankind to discover the purpose to life or describe the Truth as empirically as possible but am very confident I will likely die before either happen.

What I'm trying to explore is what happens to our species' strategic decision making if everyone admits they do not know the Truth (e.g. belief in a God) and focuses their efforts on supporting our species ability to gain empirical evidence about the Truth.

Edit: Part of that Truth is what lies beyond the edge of the current observable universe.","1433117548"

A 13S pack is going to be around 55v charged, which is what a ""48v"" lithium pack is.  It's annoying, but they're rated at the typical 3.7v/cell discharge voltage, which is 48.1v.

You're not going to get 1000W out of it, though.  At 48v, 20A is 960W.  You're likely to hit high amperage cutoff if you hang a 1000W motor and controller from it, and you have literally no spare capacity for lighting.  It gets worse as the pack discharges - at a 3.3v level, you only have 850W available at 20A.

I'd look at limiting to about an 800W motor or less with that BMS, or going with something that will give you 30 or 40A of capacity (and then making sure the pack can source that).","1433117548"

"offmychest","t5_2ranw",":hugs:  it is an interesting thing, our perception of the world.  We rarely think about or notice our actual impact, mostly, I think, because we are too close to it.  It is difficult to get the necessary distance to see it for what it actually is and has been.  There is every chance that you have had an impact, and far greater than one would think, on someone's life.  Every interaction you ever had, has altered the person you interacted with, impossible for it not to have.  The genuine thank you to a waiter that made them happy which led them to smile for a brief moment and in that moment a woman glanced up from her plate and took notice of that smile and decided she wanted someone in her life that would make her smile like that and after her meal she went home and created a profile on a dating site and met a wonderful man, and while it didn't last in the end, it gave her several years of joy which she spread with every interaction.  Ripples.  We all have an impact on those around us, often in unforseen ways and sadly we rarely ever get to know about it.  You may be someone's favorite person, and they've just never mentioned it, or have shown it in ways you didn't notice.  You may be some stranger's favorite memory because you were kind when others had been cruel, even though you didn't realize you were being kind, just going about your day.

The only reason I can think of is that people who are already involved with the formats dumping their collections and leaving due to the value going down due to the abundance of fakes...

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The sun is in a sort of equilibrium--the fusion reaction that 'runs' it comes from the heat generated by the gravity in the core. This puts outward force on the surrounding matter. The more energy that gets produced, the more the matter pushes outward, and the sun swells. But as it swells, it cools, and gravity is able to pull it back together.

Remove one side of that equilibrium, and what's going to happen is the matter drifts away. Not quite so violent as an explosion, though ultimately the same effect in the long run.","1433117552"

&gt; it's almost unheard of for an ISP's database to be compromised, 

... No it isn't

&gt;For instance PPP or RADIUS authentication might use CHAP, which secures the authentication data in transit, but requires a plain text password to be stored by the ISP

it requires a text string stored somewhere due to the requirement for access this should not be used for other systems. 

Alternatively encrypted ppp is old enough to vote  
EAP-TLS for ppp auth is old enough to drive.  
MSCHAPv2 doesn't need the server to know the password in the clear  

&gt; Similarly with the APOP extension to POP3.

Pop with tls. this problem was solved many years ago. (but hey most ISPs do everything they can to avoid being secure.)

Sometimes spirits and/or supernatural beings will attach themselves to a person, though it's not as common as objects or places.

Spirits tend to manifest (I use the term spirits as a loose definition for anything supernatural, as ghosts are definitely not the only thing out there.) more frequently when people are feeling strong emotions. I can see where the ball and the comic might have produced slightly stronger emotions than normal (for some reason being sad/angry/upset/scared seems to be more potent than being happy or excited.) were you feeling any emotions particularly strongly at the museum?","1433117553"

At the beginning? Lovely, flowing football. The fact that we hit Sheffield Wednesday for 4 at home, who are a really well trained defensive team, shows how good it was when Symons came in. But it just slowly and slowly reverted to long-ball to the point where I couldn't watch the games because of how appalling they were. Part of the reason for this may be because of Christensen's injury and that Scott Parker is now a corpse and Ryan Tunnicliffe is dogshit. Defensively, a complete fucking nightmare. Never have I seen worse defending in my life. Michael Turner solved a bunch of problems for us by actually managing to organise the damn defence and Symons refusal to play Burn was borderline idiotic, another vocal leader.

A 3/10 for me. Glad to see that the club is opting for stability by showing faith in him and keeping him rather than firing him but I really wish it was with another manager. Really am not looking forward to next season one bit.","1433117558"

When God led Moses and the Israelites out of of Egypt and led them to the promise land it took 40 years to reach the promise land. Not everyone that started the journey made it, a lot complained and would rather be back in slavery under Pharaoh because they were used to being slaves. It took them 40 years to reach Gods promise for them because they had flesh issues to take care of they weren't ready to be in Gods promise. Every Christian has an Exodus Moment in there lifes. When you choose to not be under the world and choose to follow God, you end up in the Desert, in your desert in your hard times dont let God down. Persevere and be happy in it because tomorrow we live! 

As soon as Jesus was baptized in the bible, the very next thing it says is that he was led in the wilderness (desert) for 30 days to be tempted in every way just as we are. Love is proven through action. Its easy to say ""God I Love You"" but true love manifests in our actions when we choose to resist sin. Prove your love to God by showing him in your desert, in your hard times... 

My friend once told me once in one of my dark seasons, ""There are perks when you behave"", There are so many blessings that come with honoring and following Christ. Be a Righteous Person that the Lord created you to be!

I speak from experience that the journey is rough at times, but it is well worth it. There is beauty in the struggle. God has a promise for you... Stop wondering in the desert, give it all to God. Cry out to him in prayer in detail. The bible says ""Taste and see that the lord is good"" Prayer is simply talking to God, tell him everything and anything. He is your father, your daddy and longs to speak to you.

The only way that has helped me get over my desires, is reciting scripture when im getting tempted. Its what Jesus did when he was in the wilderness. The devil and temptation will flee.

I know its long but Ill be praying for you man.

"Bacon","t5_2qhpa","After a quick google search of why have bacon prices increased I found this article at the top of the list:

http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/08/05/bacon-prices-rise-to-new-all-time-high/

Seems to indicate the pork epidemic, drought, and demand as the three main contributing factors. None of which points to the fad of bacon related merchandise. It really is a market trying to make money off the fact that there is an increase in the popularity of the meat itself, not the other way round. Supply and demand will always be the determining factors in pricing, and when they are not you'll find a failed product, of which bacon is not.

---
&gt;Izayoi is the true form of the Sealed Weapon Izayoi that Tsubaki undertakes to don the power of Immortal Breaker. This form was awakened twice, once during the battle with [Jin Kisaragi](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Jin_Kisaragi) before [Amaterasu](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Amaterasu)'s phenomena intervention, and once after, when Noel materialized it with her power of the Eye. She is still under the influence of [Imperator](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Hades_Izanami)'s [Mind Eater](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Mind_Eater) in both occasions, but manages to break free the second time thanks to her friends. Tsubaki regains herself once more, but feels lost as she knows the Imperator's justice is a lie. However, with the support of [Hakumen](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Hakumen) and Noel in her [true form](https://blazblue.wikia.com/wiki/Mu_-No.12-), she decided to fight for the justice she believes in and for the friends she cherishes. Turning away from the darkness of the past, she takes up her sword to punish all crimes and seek out the *true light*.

7) Fission Bomb because build is centered about Living Bomb

13)  Chain Bomb. Even now it's still a very good talent but I see why some people taake Flamethrower instead nowadays. I tried it...I'll just say it didn't go pretty well for me.
16) Ignite. Works well with Fission and Chain Bombs

Episode 50 features Brandon coming back in full form along side Aaron.  They are also joined by recent Newark ROC winner Ray Sola.  Older sets, Organized Play events, and why Precision Strike may be the best power ever also come up.  They also review recent figures with a slightly change in their methodology.  Ray discusses his road through the Newark ROC and what he encountered on his road to first place.  Also, everyone makes their pick on their favorite figure from wave one of Age of Ultron Organized Play.","1433117567"

"freedomearth","t5_2t2fu","The trouble is that none of it is physics, or any kind of science at all. It's stories using some sciencey-sounding words designed to impress normal people, people who don't need to understand how science works. 

It's always a good idea to ask the people who work with physics every day what they think. The physics community can't afford to let exciting new ideas go unnoticed for years if it might have valuable new scientific insights, but they also can't afford to waste their time on people who they can see have no clue about physics.

Is there even a small band of maverick physicists taking seriously a single thing that Nassim has said, even as a kind of side-project? There is not. Anyone who's met a selection of physicists and got to know us as human beings will know that we are not a uniform blob of foolish or sheep-like people. There are some exceptionally adventurous, controversial, brilliant and creative thinkers in the physics community, and a wide variety of spiritual beliefs too.

Yet we all ignore this man. There's a very simple reason - he is a fake, and it is essential for our work that we know how to spot one.

I did once manage to get some physicists to talk about him - you might be interested:

However,

&gt;unless you've spent years in a Spanish speaking environment or you're one of the few who learned it from a young age.

As it happens, I've been in Spanish immersion since Kindergarten into my 3rd year of High School, alongside tens of thousands of other students in my state. I've been to a spanish speaking country (Costa Rica), can carry on conversations (albeit with an accent, but that's to be expected) in Spanish and transition between the two languages pretty seamlessly.

Maybe it's a form of confirmation bias that I think so many people are fluent in Spanish. I concede that I hang out with a disproportionate amount of bilingual people because of the classes I've taken. However, there were still plenty of non-immersion people in my AP Spanish class who, although they had to try a lot harder, I would consider fluent.","1433117570"

I really felt that line, OP. My most recent long term relationship was with a N-ex who, on the face of it, could not have been more unlike my N-mom: educated where my N-mom was ignorant, fun-loving where my N-mom was a killjoy, etc.

What didn't change, though, was me. I had a super codependent relationship with my N-mom, where I was constantly saving her from crises of her own making. That robbed me of a lot of my youth, up to and including my college years. 

When my N-ex ran into problems, I took the same approach of trying to save her from herself. I sacrificed more than I should have to try to fix her problems. And I really let her take us down a pretty dangerous path. 

Thankfully, I let go before I got burned but had to admit to myself: this codependency thing is *my* problem, not others'. I have to work toward fixing it. 

So the time since the breakup has been spent trying to incrementally get a healthier sense of self --boundaries, self-esteem, etc. Lots of exercise, clean living, working to just build up discipline. And most importantly, I learned that there's a balance between the heart and the head; I can show empathy but maintain boundaries.

OP, you've gotten to the point of self-disclosure that your father was a bad influence upon you. That's a big step, but it's getting you out of negative territory. You want to go into positive territory. 

So maybe think about your expectations of men: what do you think are the baseline requirements the men in your life have to abide by? What are the deal breakers? And most important of all, how do you defend your sense of self-respect? ","1433117574"

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","Modding will come once it goes to the beta stage - that means early 2016.

Mods need at least a somewhat stable foundation to build on. SA is nowhere near that point - rather than a solid foundation, we have a bouncy house. 

Sure, you could probably build a mod right now for it, but there's no guarantee you'll have to redo an enormous amount of work almost every time there is an update. It's not so much about maps and models, or even animations - it's about in changes in the ways all the pieces go together and behave inside the servers, the hives, and the clients that will wreck just about any mod in a few weeks time.

I'm glad, and even proud, that the SA dev crew aren't bowing to all the complaining and change priorities just to make a portion of the players happy right now. As I understand it, such a thing happened last year when they rushed the V3S in when someone higher up got freaked out by all the online bitching, and doing that threw a monkey wrench into the design schedule and slowed actual progress for weeks, if not months for stuff that was far more important. About that time or soon after, there was a change in project management, and the current devs aren't going to let something like that happen again. 

I miss Namalsk too, EVRs, Bloodsuckers and all. When the mods come it will be great, but doing it anytime soon will not only cause more problems and delays in overall development, all the existing problems will still be there as well, and then two weeks later none of the mods will work. 

It'll be ready when it's ready, no sooner.  ","1433117575"

"books","t5_2qh4i","I think that Simmons' explanation here can coexist with the theory that Hyperion stands alone - or at least I hope it can. 

As far as references I can provide, though, for my own interpretation: historically, Hyperion was the name of the poem that Keats was writing when he died (as we read in the SF novel); it is an unfinished work. Similarly, the book itself is structured like and is in so, so many ways an homage to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (a number of pilgrims are are on journey, each from different walks of life and each with different reasons for going, and they decide to tell stories to one another to help pass the time) - another poem not completed in the author's lifetime. No more Tales.

Then there are the characters themselves. Every single one of them tells a story without a proper ending, because each story's end is yet to come. Each pilgrim sees the true end of the story as being their meeting with the Shrike, however that plays out. Some of the stories themselves have stories withim them that are yearning to be completed - the Cantos, or Rachel's life being cut short, or the KeatsBot trying to write a poem, or the Colonel not being able to ""finish,""...

So: you've got a book that is mirrored on a famously unfinished story, that is named after and heavily features another famously unfinished story. You have stories within the book that are told and left unfinished. In my opinion, at this point, a good author has a responsibility to give the theme of 'unfinished'ness its due, and Simmons did that pretty damn well. The author himself is a pilgrim, telling his story.

**If** you want a different ""reason"" for the book ending so abruptly, you don't need to have read anything other than the book itself - the clues are all there. It's the speed with which the pilgrims are approaching the Shrike - first at light-speed, then as they enter the Hyperion system they are travelling at sub-light, and once they are on Hyperion they slow down again, then they're on a land-boat, then a cable-car and, finally, at the end of the book, they friggin' link arms and *SKIP* down to meet the Shrike. 

They are off to meet a creature who moves through time differently than anything else in the universe. They are going to a place that is going backwards in time. They know that the closer you get to the Time Tombs, the stranger time itself becomes. The pilgrims' progress towards the Time Tombs mirrors the path of, let's say, a photon towards the Time Tombs, or maybe think of it as a bell curve representing speed - starting off super-fast, but getting slower, and slower, and slooowwwer, and finally... end of novel. 'Cus you're at the Time Tombs now, and Time stops here.","1433117581"

The fact that you make comments like this shows how you seem to think you're mentally superior to people

&gt;Belief in metaphysical deities does not require the same mental capacity as belief in things observable in nature.

You believe that your value judgement about something that could exist just as it could not exists (i.e metaphysical deities) rule it as stupid and then use that to basically build your entire position on. 

You seem happy with that, and that's cool man, that's your choice. Just trying to point out the somewhat unstable logical base your intellectual superiority complex is built on.

You're thinking of empiricism.

Something that is objectively true, is true even if there aren't any people around. For example, ""It is true that the Earth goes round the Sun"" is *objectively* true in the sense that it was true 100 million years ago before people were here, and it will be true (barring an early supernova or massive planetary collision) 100 million years from now after we're extinct or evolved to be unreconizeable as humans.

I would not disagree.

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","There are a lot of problems with this act as many others ITT have pointed out:

""There are a lot of problems with the bill imo, and passing it after section 215 of the Patriot Act expires is a step backward. Something will still have to be passed eventually because a broadly defined investigation with no time limit could allow for the continuation of bulk collection for that investigation that is already in progress. Here are a few of the problems though.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined in ACLU v. Clapper that the NSA's telephone records program was illegal, so the Second Circuit's limitations of section 215 of the Patriot Act and the definitions things like ""relevance"" should be explicitly included in the legislation. Also, the court emphasized that typical subpoenas should only seek records of ""suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses who have contact with such subjects,"" so the USA Freedom Act ought to be changed to disallow the collection of records for a second hop without additional authorization, which it currently allows.
The 2013 version of USA Freedom had stronger FISA Court reforms that were gutted and there needs to be a true advocate for privacy and civil liberties along with the publication of significant interpretations of the law. Under the current bill I believe that information can just be blocked from the public advocate so there isn't really a point.
The bill does not address section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. Section 702 allows for the bulk collection of traffic off of the physical infrastructure and includes the content of the digital communications, some of which has been shared with other agencies and has led to prosecutions for drug related crimes.
Also, the bill could be a bit of a Trojan horse in that it will outsource the spying to communications providers and the USA Freedom Act will give these communications providers expansive legal immunity for possibly violating your privacy and providing broadly defined ""session-identifying information"" with only a reasonable suspicion and not probable cause. This makes it seem as though the bill is just extending the sunset provisions of the Patriot Act to 2019 while actually expanding the types of information that can be collected to be more in line with modern modes of digital communication on smart phones--which would be even more invasive than what is currently going on.
It gives emergency powers to spy on non US individuals who are residing in the U.S. for 72 hours without any court order whatsoever.
A lot of the terms like ""person"" and ""address"" among others are very broadly defined to the point of allowing for loopholes.
Here is a Salon article and an op-ed in Ars Technica that deals with some of these issues.
I think it would be really disappointing to pass this bill when it won't really do much in terms of reform and comes with a whole bunch of bullshit with a lot of potential to outweigh any benefits.
This is the bill that needs to get passed.
Edit: Linked to reddit for the salon article because I'm having trouble linking to salon on mobile.""

Round 2: 10/10

Round 3: 8/10, I doubt light armor will do anything but maybe if one gets close it can deal a quick finishing blow.

Round 4: 10/10, larger targets and that armor probably still isn't doing anything.

Round 5: I think this is where I probably lose. It depends if I get any time at all to get to a good position, or if they spawn in a circle around me. Otherwise they'll all bumrush and I can probably take down 3 or 4 but the others will get me before I can reload. Assuming I can get to a good position the chances are better considerably, maybe even as high as 8/10.

Round 6: Hm. Given that they're FTE this is 5/10 at best. I could guarantee we both get taken out if I just use the grenade as a last ditch kamikaze, but not sure if that counts as a victory or not.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","People who've pointed out that this kind of shy behavior isn't wildly unusual regardless of orientation are right to say that, and I think you'll know whether this is the case or not. 

But if it is, here are some observations from my personal experience... 

Even if he realizes everyone knows he's gay, that kind of joking can still be uncomfortable for a number of reasons.

* Even though you say you aren't making fun of gay people, he might still read it that way. The basis behind homoerotic teasing is typically ""Oh thats so gross,"" or ""Isn't the idea that I'd be gay totally ridiculous,"" even if that isn't entirely your intention. I've seen it done in a way that I didn't find homophobic, but almost every other time even among open minded dudes that is kind of how it comes off.  
* He can't participate. This was implied by another person, but it is different if you are actually gay. Someone might read it as interest or you might cross the line. 
* He may be silent because he doesn't want to be a token gay. I often feel that way in a group of friends. I worry that I harp on gay stuff too much, or that other people fall on the gay jokes too often. 

Furthermore, I always move into friendships with my straight buddies fairly cautiously. I'm always hyper aware of their comfort levels, and what might be misunderstood. There's always going to be a bit of a boundary. 

He also has a boyfriend, and his boyfriend may not be wild about the idea of him hanging out with a bunch drunk of dudes that do a lot of homoerotic teasing all the time. 

It's a little uncomfortable to be any kind of minority in a room. He may know that you're cool to an extent, but he doesn't know how everyone else feels. Have you ever gone to a gay bar, or another venue where gay men dominated the place? There's a whole different set of social codes and expectations, and that can be weird to navigate. 

Any one of those things may be causing him to be a bit uncomfortable. Here are some of my suggestions: 

* Cut back on the gay jokes. Don't suddenly stop or he'll notice, and that's likely to make him feel uncomfortable too. Just lessen them since he clearly doesn't know how to react. 
* If you have a girlfriend, propose a double date with his partner to get to know him a bit better. 
* Try flipping things around and why don't you go with him to a gay bar or something similar. That might really help you to see what things are like from his end. If you propose it I think it'll be a great way to show just how comfortable you are. (But, if you suspect there's any hint of attraction, you might want to rethink this. It may send the wrong message. Maybe have your girlfriend tag along too). 
* I'm not sure of the number of dudes you have over, but maybe just invite a few a couple of times. Allow him enough time with just a handful to feel comfortable in the larger social setting. If he's feeling uncomfortable about being out, he can gauge these guys first and know he's in a safe environment. 


Hope that helps!","1433117595"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","It was always explained that even things that can't normally step can still travel between the worlds if there's enough stuff pulling it with them. The iron in your blood is able to travel because it's bound up inside lots of intricate chemical bonds, that kind of ""drag"" it along even though it would normally be left behind (likely due to its extreme atomic stability). So, just like non-sapient creatures can't normally travel across the universes unless they're dragged, iron has to be chemically ""dragged"" across the gap because it can't make it on its own. 

However, an alloy isn't a chemical compound of two substances, but a mixture of them. There's nothing that's actually binding the iron to the other materials except the physical entangling of the two materials; if you heated them up, then one would melt out whilst the other was still solid, because they have different melting points. The result of this is that if you stepped between worlds carrying, say, a lump of iron and nickel alloyed together to make ferronickel would result in the nickel travelling, and not the iron. 

This is why elves and trolls don't like iron in human mythology: it prevented them stepping because it meant they would leave stuff behind when it got caught (like stapling). ","1433117595"

He didn't want to be with me unless we could be together forever (ironic, right?--he can't even handle being with me now), and he wanted me to be able to testify about Mormon stuff to our kids without equivocation.

Have you called out your wife for her hypocrisy? I find that writing a letter can be a good way to communicate your feelings without having the other person interrupt you. Please have someone read the letter before you give it to her, though--someone with fresh eyes can help you make the letter free of anger or meanness. I would also tell her how much you love her. It's likely that she's saying things based on a state of shock. But if it ends up that she really is shallow, well...you have other advice here about divorce.

Give marriage counseling a shot. Not at LDS Family Services. That was the only place my ex would go to, and even he agreed that we could have gotten the same advice from a bishop for free.

I understand how hurtful it can be to have your spouse tell you that their love is conditional. I still loved my husband when he left me, and he told me he still loved me. I hope you can figure things out, but I hope you know that if divorce becomes the best option, you're not a bad person. You'll be able to find peace and stable ground again.","1433117599"

There it is"" - rather, it will be a process so gradual you won't even know it happened until afterwards - one day you'll be doing your thing and suddenly realize ""holy crap, I really have changed.""

&gt;Going from a general argument (there are loopholes) to a specific argument (contributions to Hillary Clinton are sketchy and make no sense) without any additional evidence is highly problematic.

The additional argument that I stated was that the finance industry in recent memory has a really horrible track record for above-board financial transactions and business practices. Yeah there's absolutely a chance that all these donations are legit and this is making mountains out of mole hills. But after the schemes the financial industry has pulled and shit they've gotten away with they've lost the right to go about their business without scrutiny.

So the logical progression is:

1. Campaign finance is broken and has a lot of loopholes.
2. Clinton's campaign has an oddly high number and amount of donations from one industry.
3. That industry has a horrible track record for moral/legal business practices.
4. Clinton's campaign finances need closer study.

That seems relatively logical to me. Sure, it's not enough to convict in a court of law but goddamnit the stakes are too high to say, ""Ah I'm sure it's all wholesome behind the scenes.""","1433117604"

As a result only a fraction of Iraq's vehicle forces can actually be activated. On top of this corruption at the upper levels cause them to lie and report these inoperable vehicles as being functional so that the commanders can claim the fuel, ammo, maintenance funds for those vehicles which they in turn pocket.

Oh and I'd just like to point out that Reach's forest level looked like this: http://www.4news.it/images/stories/games/ms/HaloReach/20100809/HaloReach_Nightfall2.jpg + http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100309170740/halo/images/c/cb/ReachCampaign_m10_Env04.jpg and that nobody gives a shit about 3D mountains when they look like something from an N64 game.

I see the concept of pushing next-generation graphics on a last generation system requires compromise completely went over your head.

Oh and Halo 4 used soooooo many Bullshots, amirite? It's not like the E3 demo looked exactly like the final version in the game.

But sure, I'm sure that Microsoft spent a billion dollars making sure that the H4 engine was downgraded from the Reach engine it was built upon. Or the fact that Reach had frame rate drops while rendering at 640p + incredibly poor FXAA compared to native 720/30.

But okay, I used a third person view of the scene instead of the identical version seen in game. Because this is a Ubisoft title and Bungie *never* downgraded the graphics since the Reach ""in-game"" announcement trailer. Like reduced lighting effects, like the completely missing reflective metal effects and Iridescent specular effects on the Spartan Armor and Kat's arm even though the final version of Winter Contingency played at 24fps. Even the Warthog reflection in the visor was removed from the final version.

E3 pre-rendered ""in-game"": https://youtu.be/lbymUxaQeBU

Final Cut scene: https://youtu.be/kfkstC0jTQ4

But it's okay that Reach made massive compromises in graphics (like E3 2006 Halo 3 vs E3 2007) but *God forbid* I use a pre-release screenshot of H4 that was completely identical to the final version.

I'd just like to remind you that Reach graphics were already considered dated at launch, with the only saving grace being the impressive skyboxes.

Edit: And that H4 is still considered the best looking 360 game.

But apparently nobody could even tell that large portions of the H4 skyboxes were 3D models in front of the actual sky-box but thanks for confirming that you really *don't* know what you're talking about.","1433117609"

Dec 31st 1999 working a 12 hour night shift was brutal: wasted people actually projectile vomiting over the reception desk into the printer, one man punching his girlfriend in the face, finding a guy shagging a girl on the hotel roof when I did my fire safety rounds etc...

Back then it was mostly students I worked with, but as a regular guest at hotels myself these days there are a lot more Eastern European staff employed. Not just in hotels but in pubs/bars too.

In London it's actually quite rare to find someone behind the bar who isn't foreign.

"architecture","t5_2qhae","I had this discussion with my girlfriend. We were walking in midtown and I was trying to convince her that the square windows are actually a pretty interesting and unique choice. We were walking around for a while and I challenged her to find another building with square windows. There were none. All the old buildings have smaller rectangular ones and the modern/50's building have long rows of very narrow windows. 

A square is a subtly powerful and risky design choice. And to have them so prominently featured is extra interesting. There are many kinds of nonsquare rectangles, and they conform to the shape of the building. They're weak. But those square windows do not give a fuck about the shape of the building, they sit where they want to sit. They also take up as much space as they possibly can, out of all the rectangles with a given perimeter, a square takes up the largest volume. This gives the square a powerful appearance, which compared with other rectangles.

The square windows also give a certain regularity that shows off the impressiveness and the structure of the building. The grid is pushed to it's limits by the windows, but the concrete non-glass facade gives it a certain strength so that you don't forget it's there. It's a battle and balance between these competing, strong shapes and materials that help contrast and showcase the magnitude and impressiveness of the building.

The square windows are the most risky, interesting and rewarding choice. My favorite part of the building!","1433117611"

Quest focus was fine in early WoW, when it was new, but after completing thousands of mindless quests in a game, you don't really feel like doing any more, as it simply feels like a chore getting in the way of how you really want to play. Same goes for story progression with an abundance of cutscenes. Unless the story is really good (which it never is in MMOs).

TL;DR: Just give us a world, let us explore and play however we want. Sprinkle said world with a few hidden and meaningful quests. Who cares if the first few hours aren't newbie friendly. MMOs are for the long haul, even the worst player will eventually figure it out. I'd rather having to communicate with other players to get help than being spoofed directions and tutorials.

"cactus","t5_2qpr6","You should be careful about watering it. Generally, you should give cacti about a week after repotting before watering them, to give the root system time to heal so it can actually absorb the water. Also, your mix looks less than ideal. It looks like there is a very large percentage of peat in it, which will retain water way too long. Don't be fooled by what they sell as ""cactus mix"" in stores, it's complete garbage.

Also, your pot looks a little too large, especially in combination with your soil mix. Over-potting your cactus is bad, because the soil holds too much moisture and it takes too long to dry out, increasing the chance of root rot. 

I suggest that you repot your plant again, this time ideally using a well drained pumice based mix (you could mix 60-70% pumice into regular potting soil). I would choose a smaller pot, but that's not that important if you have the proper mix.
For reference, take a look at the soil mix of this cactus:

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","&gt;2) Is there a general rule of thumb with command structures as it pertains to Navy &amp; Air Force? Right now I've just been linking them to theater HQs, should I be doing otherwise.

Your commanders' bonuses filter down. The Army Group one is the last 'useful' level, as the bonus for Theatres is 1/16 of what they get at the fleet/divisional level. It halves at each level IIRC.

&gt;7) Do planes set to 'intercept' follow the planes they are hunting? I only ask because I had interceptors in Sicily set to intercept in regions around the Mediterranean but for some reason they always seem to end up fighting over Roma (not selected ) and getting shot to pieces.

Interception is good in combo with RADAR. If you don't have radar with which to detect incoming attacking units, it becomes much less useful. When talking about attacking planes bombing your ground units, I generally still use interception via forward bases, as it saves fuel. You want small combat areas though and keep a close eye so you can reinforce.

The air war is, like the land war, about appropriate deployment of reserves.

&gt;6) What about air units groups? I just usually group them in pairs (2 interceptors, 2 bombers) but I have also read somethings that suggest just fielding them alone.

In non-modded game, groups of 4 of the same type of aircraft is generally optimal. The AI tends to send in groups of three, which means that a group of four will generally beat them, barring reinforcements. This also means that including escorts in your bomber or CAS groups is basically pointless, since they will always be outgunned by intercepting fighters. Your best bet is to eliminate enemy aircraft. One way to do this is to run air superiority missions over enemy airfields while using tactical bombers to bomb said airfields. This first action should draw enemy fighters out to battle, and the second will prevent them from reinforcing.

&gt;9) I've seen guides that say you should build special forces units (marines, mountain) as pure brigades, but in my first game I added a brigade of engineers to marines.... am I weakening my special forces by adding engineers to them?

The reason for this is that every other unit causes the division to lose their bonus on terrain. 

...except engineers.

&gt;10) Ok, what the hell is ""good terrain"" I only ask because the guides I read while playing my first game said that a good strategy is to pin down all enemy units along your front then break through with armor units and swing round to cut off the pinned down troops.... from my understanding this needs to be done on good terrain which as far as I can tell the only good terrain is plains... I was playing as France and when examining the fortified german line (sigfried?) there were WAYYYYY too many hills/Forrest.... am I incorrect in assuming that plains are the only truly ideal grounds for breakthroughs and flanking armor? In the end my France game just bogged down and I ended up just waiting for Germany to attack Russia before pushing and even then it just ended up being me moving my whole line very slowly... WW1 style is seemed.

Strategy depends on the nation. Watch some LPs and you'll get the idea.

Armour does suffer disadvantages in certain terrain, but their toughness can often overcome these disadvantages. Their biggest disadvantage is actually that they lose their speed.","1433117614"

Seriously, though, the moment my adult brother solicits me for sex is the moment he loses my loyalty as a sibling.  Look, I'm not part of the torch and pitchfork brigade on this.  I don't know why OP feels unsafe, but she has the right to feel that way.  Not saying she has to look into buying a taser or mace him in the hallway if he looks at her weird.  But I think it's completely ok to involve an authority figure when you feel unsafe confronting the issue otherwise.  

His request was inappropriate.  I think at 22 he is old enough to know and act on social boundaries and to face consequences when he doesn't.  We don't need to get the noose ready, but I also don't think she owes him this great debt of secrecy for this issue simply because they are siblings.  If he doesn't get that asking your sister for sex isn't really ok, then maybe he does need some stronger reinforcement of what is and is not appropriate.","1433117614"

&gt;The problem with the mana ramp like the Eldrazi spawn is that for one, most decks will want your spawn (especially the green ones which are just value creatures). Especially the GB sacrifice deck.

If you have someone drafting the exact some colors as you (and basically the same archetype with a slightly different focus), you're going to have trouble no matter what. The 2/2 is a solid pick up for most green decks. I'm not convinced that the average green deck will want the 3/3 as anything beyond a 23rd card, given it's lower stats and late casting cost. This seems like a format where a 3/3 for 4 is pretty low, even if it brings in some value when you play it.","1433117619"

These maneuvers, in addition to the thruster, are not only acrobatic and arobic, but they utilize muscle groups in ways one wouldn't normally use. That allows for a unique and rounded workout.

And it fucking looks cool, who are you to criticize professional athletes? ","1433117619"

by the end of the year we should have base building, advanced barricading, animal companions and the release of the beta version

and what do we have today ? Basic-glitchy vehicles, our good old renderer running on the best hardware as if the game was Crysis 5, horrible d-sync and ping problems (fixed in the last patch, by removing these numbers from the playerlist ..........), broken zeds that need to be redone because 5 of them in each town puts the server on its knees (we're far from the zombie hordes that were promised to us), bugs, bugs and more bugs, cheaters, hats, lodsa hats, a few guns, broken loot spawn and respawn, BUT a wide variety of different vehicles, i've got to give them that (nah, just kidding)

The state of the game right now would be pretty much acceptable for the game if we were in march 2014, 3 month after the release of EA, we're more than a year later, and the game keeps getting worse after each update, so what do you think ?

those saying that the game will be done by late 2016 or 2017 are dreaming tbh, just look at what has been done in a year and a half now

I heard an interview with a specialist (child psychology I believe) a few months ago. She recommended this approach, with a reserve: the basic needs of the child (ie clothes, school supplies, etc.) should be assumed by the parents, while the pocket money is for extras, thus teaching the child to save, prioritize and choose where to spend.

I'm not sure if the best approach is the piggy bank or a regular bank account. I remember as a child going to the credit union with my mom to update my bankbook and each time being stunned when realizing they were giving me money to reward me for saving!

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Welcome to the end.""

The large man before me grinned beneath his crimson hood. The hood was connected to a large, thick cloak that hid his entire body from view. All I could really see was that grin, the flawless white teeth. He was a good seven feet tall, the tallest man I had ever seen. 

I was surprised when he had appeared. I was on patrol around a base far in the mountains. We were not told to expect any visitors today, so I had raised my rifle and prepared to call for backup when he had spoken. I hesitated then, and the figure waved a gloved hand. My radio suddenly shorted out, and all I heard from it was static.

""Don't bother calling for help,"" he said in a dark, raspy voice. ""We will have a chat, you and I, and listen to the masses as they scream.""

""Who the hell are you?"" I demanded, raising my rifle again. Another wave, and suddenly the gun became a mass of maggots, wiggling in my hands. I shouted and dropped the things, backing away and trying not to shake. 

""Don't go anywhere,"" the other said, and I froze up. No, he didn't turn me to ice; rather, he had forced my muscles to lock up, so now I was stuck in mid-step, only a few feet from the wretched, smelly pile that started crawling apart. The large man walked forward, calmly stepping *through* the maggots and stopping only a few inches from my face. 

""What are you?"" I breathed, thankful that my mouth could still work, though it was an effort. It was like my tongue had been swollen just enough, I realized, that I couldn't shout for help.

""I have been called many things,"" the other answered calmly. This close, I could smell the stench of decay on him, like a field long after a battle. ""I've found I prefer to be called 'the Reaper.'""

""The Reaper? Like the Grim Reaper?"" I stared at him, confounded. 

The other laughed, a sound like nails scratching down a chalkboard. ""Perhaps. But where the Grim Reaper is a legend...I am very, very real.""

Commotion from inside the base. An alarm. Maybe the others have seen me and our guest?

""Don't worry; they can't see us. No, they are responding to something else."" He waved both his hands then, and suddenly I found myself standing on top of a plateau, desert stretching in all different directions. The Reaper was there, beside me, gazing at me. 

""We won't be disturbed here. Good.""

""Why have you brought me here?"" I demanded, realizing that I was no longer frozen. ""What do you want from me?""

""What *I* want? No, my dear mortal. I am merely the messenger, sent by those more powerful than you or I.""

""Who?""

""Their names are not for you to know, though They may reveal themselves properly to you, if They so choose."" He paused, looking toward the setting sun. ""Your world is coming to an end."" 

I looked at him, not comprehending. He went on, ""Your world's powers have argued too long, and now have taken matters into their own hands. Twenty minutes ago, commands were sent out all over the world. In five minutes, your world will burn. In ten, there will be nothing but ash. And there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.""

I gazed at him, eyes wide. ""Why weren't we told?"" I asked. 

""Oh, your base commander knows. In fact, that alarm was to rouse everyone so that she could let them make peace before the end. I didn't want you distracted.""

I grew angry. ""You took me away from my friends, to, what, die alone on some rock in the middle of fucking no where?""

""You will not die. They do not want you to. I am here to make sure of that."" He looked back at me, and though I could not see his eyes, I felt like my insides were freezing again from the look he was giving me.

""What do They want with me?"" I finally asked.

""You will not die. In a few minutes, They will send one of Their emissaries to collect you. You will be taken to a holding facility, along with a dozen others, where you will be frozen for the next few thousand years. When it is time, you will be sent back to the surface, to rebuild your society.""

""Why send you, then, if they have emissaries?"" 

""They cannot come to this world. The atmosphere is harmful to Them. They need me -- and others like me -- to do Their dirty work here on this world."" He grinned again. ""Of course, sometimes I listen, sometimes I don't. It's not like they can hurt me.""

""And what are you, exactly?""

Another horrible laugh. ""Death incarnate. That's all you need to know.""

A pause, as Reaper's words sank in. They -- whoever They were -- wanted to tear me away from everything I had known to take care of the future. But why? Part of the reason I had joined the military is because I dropped out of college. I barely passed high school, and I had a poor relationship with my parents. I asked him.

Reaper shrugged. ""I can't say. It's Their decision, not mine. They're the ones who chose you, not I."" He tilted his head to the side, looking over my shoulder. ""Time's up.""

I turned around, and my mouth fell open. Out in the distance, I saw a large mushroom cloud forming. 

""The bombs have fallen,"" Reaper sneered, and I heard a bit of a laugh in his voice. ""Your hubris has finally caught up with you. So much death...it's beautiful.""

I whipped around and stalked right up to him. ""Damn you!"" I snarled, and lashed out with a fist. 

I doubt he was even looking at me, more entranced with the cloud far out in the distance. He simply waved his hand, and suddenly I was skidding on my back across the plateau. I picked myself up and charged him again. A gesture, and suddenly I found myself trapped inside a steel cage. 

""That should hold you until They get here,"" he told me. He looked at me one last time, and grinned. ""We'll meet again."" I blinked, and he was gone, yet I was still trapped inside the cage. Snarling, I turned back to the cloud, far out in the distance. I wonder where it had landed, and if there were any people near the blast zone. Despite myself, I found myself picturing their final moments. A family driving down the road, maybe going to visit a friend. One of them looks up, sees a missile coming down on them. 

""Hey,"" they ask. ""What's that?""

They stop the car, look out the window, see the harbinger of their demise barreling toward them. Maybe one of them got the bright idea to run away. They turn around and try to escape, but it was too late. The bomb hits, and each and every one of them were incinerated. Maybe slowly. Maybe...

""Don't worry,"" a voice suddenly said, interrupting my thoughts. ""Their deaths were swift."" 

Startled, I turned to see a figure standing in a beam of light beside my cage, gazing sadly at the distant explosion. He was tall, about as tall as Reaper, clad in angular, blue and white armor, a pair of large, eagle-like wings sprouting from his back. His eyes were glowed a bright blue from behind a steel mask, and in his hand he carried a long, golden spear. He looked at me, sadness in his eyes. ""I'm...sorry about all this. The Reaper is not gentle when it comes to preforming the tasks we send him out to do.""

""Are you the emissary he told me about?"" I asked.

He nodded. ""I am called Arch. I am the lord of Their Holy Guardians. A pleasure to meet you."" 

He touched the cage with his spear, and instantly it disintegrated. ""Come. I cannot leave this beam without exposing myself to harm.""

I walked up to him, slowly, finally stopping at the edge of the beam. ""Where are you taking me?"" 

""To our home. Reaper told you everything you need to know.""

I looked at him. ""Why me?""

He looked back at the cloud. ""My Masters have foreseen great things for you. You will become a great leader, a hero to the people of the future. You will triumph over those who will seek to destroy all humanity as rebuilt."" He looked back at me. ""Of course, only if you come along. We will not force you to.""

I looked at the mushroom cloud, watched as it began to shrink. ""What will be left?"" I asked. 

""Ashes, as he told you,"" Arch answered. ""But there will be others, doing their best to scrape by until they finally expire. Your life, I'm afraid, will not be a long or great one.""

I took a deep breath, looked up toward the source of the beam, high above the clouds. I couldn't see anything beyond some great black shape. 

""Well?"" Arch asked. ""What will you do?""

Another deep breath, and I stepped into the beam. I got the sense that Arch, whatever he was, was smiling behind his mask. As we began to ascend, he spoke again.

""Welcome to *The End.*""

Cells in our body make chemokines, which are basically homing signals for other cells/substances. Thats one of the reasons why you see the rapid increase in pace of response after a few cells recognize the worm. Few cells see the worm, release signals, cause more cells to come, the cells that came over release more signals, and even more cells come, and so on. There are also inhibitory cytokines/chemokines that are supposed to stop the reaction as well.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","No, that was already answered by another user. No sense in answering it again.

Most ant colonies are a foot or more below the ground. From what I remember while I was a grounds keeper at a golf course. It take roughly 1 inch of even rain fall to saturate 1 cubic foot of dirt. If it were to rain 1 inch in a perfect acre lot, that is roughly 27.7k gallons of water. This is barely enough to fully saturate the ground down to the 1 foot mark. 

That said take into consideration the type of ground you live on. Here in Florida we have very Sandy ground. We have tropical storms roll through and less than a few hours after its gone you wouldn't be able to tell it had rained.

Sandy soil would saturate deeper faster so it would pass right through the colony pretty quick. 

In clay soil it would not be absorbed by the ground as quick and thus take a long time to even reach the 1 foot mark.

Also as the user said above me it doesn't just flood through the dirt into the tunnels. It would wick around the tunnels as its being absorbed like a sponge.

Also let not forget outside influences such as evaporation and how compact the soil is.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I'm not religious but you don't go to Hell because you don't love God.

Every religion with a Hell concept handles it differently, and within those over-arching concepts comes even more diffusion as sects try to decide how they think Hell functions.

With that in mind, there is a general rule that you have to have sinned to go to Hell. Which is vaguely defined as ""acting against God's Will"". It is true that the Christian god demands love but in the form of action. It isn't just emotional blackmail.

&gt;&gt;The parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) describes love as an act of kindness and generosity, and Jesus says of love, ""Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13). To love others, one must love them through actions

&gt;&gt;But how are we to love God? Mark 12:30 reads, ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength."" That is, we are to love God emotionally and mentally/intellectually, with all that we are and to the greatest extent that we can. Loving God means believing in him, trusting him, and obeying him (1 John 5:3).

Do not get me wrong I think this is bollocks but it really isn't as crude as a parent not loving their child because it isn't mutual. There is a lot of theological muck in the way.","1433117637"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I don't think any movies existing today can accurately portray the future of mankind because that would be predicting the future. 

What a movie can do is create stories and scenarios that can happen if we are too narrow-minded in how we chose to use certain technologies. I believe many movies do provide the adjacent possibilities for an Utopian use of a technology.

For your example, the issue with iRobot as you have mentioned, AI/robots taking over the world. This is a very valuable lesson if we get too narrow-minded in the programming of the laws/rules the AI follows. AI that only have logic programmed into the system lack common sense and reasoning.

A movie that comes to mind is [Transcendence] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/)

If you can stomach the fact that a human mind can be uploaded to the Internet and have the balls to do so then keep reading.

Technology: Nanotechnology

Utopian uses are endless, but fear ultimately holding back the full flourishing of this technology. Fear is a human emotion, but if a human mind is uploaded to the cloud... couldn't said mind turn off key emotions that will lead the world away from dystopian uses of the technology?","1433117637"

Not really.  We enacted this change (I'm the one who thought of the self-post rule) to curb the amount of people who post to off-topic threads with: ""This is off-topic, why is it here"".   The content still gets to stay and if it's important or interesting, it will be read just as much. 

&gt;s we've recently also found out you don't even keep to the rules you've made up, you base if you delete or leave something be on ""Mod butthurt"":

You spamming off-topic links in response to this post is not posting in good-faith.  I'd have deleted them the same. 


Also to be fair, I wanted Dan and Goatsac back, and honestly, they'd probably be on board with this change.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","I went back to school at 27 to get my BScN, and there was a woman in her 50s in my program, so don't worry about your age! Here are some things to consider if RN or RPN is the way for you to go:

Education: RN requires a 4 year bachelor of science in nursing at a university, RPN requires a 2 year college program. The RPN to RN bridging program takes 3 years and you'll probably be also trying to work part time while going to school.

Clients you'll be working with: RPNs tend to have more stable patients, RNs are able to have sicker patients. That means that you will find more RPNs in areas like rehab or long term care and more RNs in places like ER or ICU. Being an RN gives you flexibility in this aspect because an RN can work with stable chronic patients (ie in LTC) but healthcare facilities often do not hire RPNs to work in the ICU or other critical areas.

Income: RNs have higher income than RPNs. I don't know by how much. Currently the starting wage for RNs in Ontario is $31.02/hr for ONA members.

I would generally recommend RN if you're sure you want to be a nurse and you have 4 years to go to school. This is because RNs have higher income and more career options. However, if you would like to enter the workforce quickly then RPN may be a better choice. If you are not certain that nursing is the career for you, it may be smarter to become an RPN because it's a smaller investment of time and money to lose if it turns out nursing is not for you.

edit: fixed a spot where I mixed up RN and RPN","1433117641"

If you approach this show more lightheartedly than a drama anime, it becomes much more enjoyable.

My strategy for dealing with final round snipers is rushing the middle. Stay on the inside of the pillars when going through the sniper lanes and they can't hit you. Then camp out of sight around corners and make them come to you. Equip a shotty for easy corner kills. Once you control the middle they can wait alllllll they want on the outside, you are camped on the control point if time runs out. Resist the urge to peek around corners and see where they are. This will get you sniped. Use your radar wisely. I'm not very good at trials, but this solid strategy netted me my first 8 win card and I got some sweet exile armor.","1433117642"

You could even take the coffee deliver device farther and have it teleport the coffee into the driver's stomach.  Or identify the chemical components which reach the blood and teleport those directly into the driver's blood.  You could also teleport any urine in the bladder directly to some bushes nearby, or perhaps an empty alley.

I'm tempted to make this almost a racial bonus (for lack of a better term) rather than a ship-type thing, as I'd think Ironborn navigators and sailors would be able to take advantage of weather conditions in a way that made even galleys and dromonds they were captaining move more quickly (this also would resolve the problem of mixed fleets- i.e. if the Shadow Kracken flagship was sailing with a bunch of longships in our current mechancis, the entire fleet would slow to the Shadow Kracken's pace... which really takes away the benefit of having a flagship at all!)

I'll probably break this down into a few suggested chart forms tonight. But overall, basic point being that all ships, universally should be a _lot_ faster than they are in our current mechanics- because ships are, indeed, fast.","1433117643"

EDIT: more info. If you freeze with a skill rimeheart wont proc with it. It procs with the next cast assuming you get the 10% RNG. Sicne you are channeling, the skill can still be ray of frost thereby making this build viable with 1skill.","1433117645"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Right... the NFL has many more players involved in a game, so individual Texans in the NFL tend to be less noticeable when watching than individual Hoosiers in the NBA.

For example if a starting NFL DE is from Texas, there are probably several other players in the game from Texas and if that DE isn't sacking the QB/forcing a fumble/etc(aka a star player) he doesn't garner attention anyway. But in the NBA a backup PG might be the only player on either team with Indiana ties and compared to the NFL he has a spotlight on him for his ~15 minutes of backup time.","1433117645"
