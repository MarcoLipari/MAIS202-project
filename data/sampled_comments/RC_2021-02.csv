I almost like your idea more though now that I'm reading it because it sounds simpler haha. In my version, a shinobi using it also has to constantly use chakra for it, and active chakra usage is what other shinobi (especially sensors) are trained to detect. 

So if you go infiltrate your enemy using the transformation jutsu, there is a real threat of them noticing something's wrong.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I kind of understand what you're alluding to but unless arteta does end up a success and stays for 5 or 6 years I don't see how you can possibly distinguish him from what Mourinho is doing right now at Tottenham, and therefore the entire long term project point is pretty invalid. Comparing him to Klopp or Pep is quite frankly ludicrous, their pedigree before arriving at their current teams was fantastic and it's part of the reason Klopp in particular was afforded so much time. Liverpool took 4 years before they won a trophy. Claiming that the most succesful ones stay for long periods of time is absolute bollocks and Mourinho is a prime example of that. 


They have both been in the job for a simar length of time and so far Mourinho and Arteta have built similarly good sides. How can you say 'they knew it would end up like Mourinho at Spurs'. We've been on a bit of a bad run in the league recently that still isn't nearly as bad as arsenal's horrendous run nearer the start of the season. We're in all 3 Cup competitions still and Arsenal are in 1, we're 2 points above them in the league with a game in hand. This has all been done on very similar budgets. 

We've made some good signings and are starting to rebuild the squad post Pochettino, which was a complete mess. We are much better this season than we were last season but our problems aren't just gonna go away overnight, why is Mourinho expected to transform us yet patience is afforded to Arteta? We've played some fantastic football at times this season but people just seem to competely ignore it at times.

This whole project thing is just a massive buzzword that people seem to apply to clubs that hire a young manager that likes playing attacking football, people said the same about Lampard and he's been sacked after blowing ¬£200m on signings that he clearly did not know how to utilise.

Calling Poch our most successful manager since the 60s is completely ludicrous as well by the way. He did a fantastic job but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go do some reading on our history!",1612137600

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","‚ÄúThe use of surgical facemasks is ubiquitous in surgical practice. Facemasks have long been thought to confer protection to the patient from wound infection and contamination from the operating surgeon and other members of the surgical staff. More recently, protection of the theatre staff from patient-derived blood/bodily fluid splashes has also been offered as a reason for their continued use. In light of current NHS budget constraints and cost-cutting strategies, we examined the evidence base behind the use of surgical facemasks.

Examination of the literature revealed much of the published work on the matter to be quite dated and often studies had poorly elucidated methodologies. As a result, we recommend caution in extrapolating their findings to contemporary surgical practice. *However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination*.‚Äù

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Headline: ""'Culturally Jewish' Philadelphian Dude dropped in what is still not, and won't be for another hundred years, Tulsa, Oklahoma."" 

I would imagine literally everyone around me would *fucking hate me*, given that mass relocations/deportations *to* Oklahoma, just started. Some of the Native Americans with experience with Europeans would figure out that I was like, essentially a fucking alien, very quickly. I'd probably do my best to explain my understanding of the knowledge gained in the next 200 years, starting with super easily demonstrable stuff. I dunno I'd figure it out. In order to demonstrate my value to the peoples I encountered. 

Those are steps one and two. First - get them to understand that I'm not the Americans they've encountered, nor am I a European, even if I have the same skin color. Time travel might be out of the question as a concept, but ""Not British / French / Spanish / Colonist"" is, I think, a very achievable conceptual goal, and once that understanding is reached I think we could get along. Second - demonstrate that I can do something worth food and shelter.

Insane that we can get that kind of graphics on a handheld console.  but it feels like the feedback from hits are lacking. Like just compare 2 random longsword solo runs, it feels like you're cutting nothing in mhrise, while in previous titles(mhw, mh3u, mhp3 etc) there are obvious signs you're cutting through the monsters, and there's resistance while your weapon go through.

And then the UI feels like a regression rather than innovation. I've only played mhp3 &amp; mhw, and then watched a bunch of other mh series, but the sharpness indicators and gauges became so easy to see in MHW. Like sure, make them different to fit the theme, but why downgrade it in mhrise when it was good? But that's coming from MHW perspective. Console wise, it's a huge upgrade in almost every aspects. The QoL changes are obviously superb, very cool change to be able to toggle the map/zoom, and see the potential cap for HP/stamina bars.

As you can see I'm not in the best shape. I used to make some funny maymays to make everybody laugh, and it was super fun, but uhh...ever since my motivation tanked I've very much fallen from grace.

[That's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/803638025040822302/803638058145546260/D4.png) about the basic gist of it. It's not like I'm a different person now, I'm still always happy to cheer a friend up if they're feelin' down. I just look much, *much* worse.",1612137602

"DeepFuckingValue","t5_3q8lpf","Naked short selling is not liquidity. It artificially inflates the float. 

We‚Äôre pushing two months of consecutive fails-to-deliver, which means a bunch of GME shareholders are actually holding IOUs because the market‚Äôs plumbing is broken.

If the SEC, brokers and clearinghouses had a hair on their ass, they would have forced buy-ins on the naked shorts for all the fail-to-receive holders in the market. 

But the DTCC clearing firms aren‚Äôt going to force buy-ins because the order flow from hedge funds is too important to their bottom lines. 

The SEC is gonna blame WSB because that‚Äôs an easier headline than fixing the fucking plumbing and putting an end to naked short selling, which will continue to lead to leveraged bear raids on struggling companies.",1612137602
"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","TBH, you will probably have to retake all of these classes in college unless your college lets you test out of them (which isn't always an option). This may be a contrary opinion to what others would say, but I would perhaps suggest doing linear algebra and diffeq‚Äîif you're majoring in CS you'll definitely take data structures and algorithms and an operating systems class in college, whereas you may not get linear algebra or differential equations naturally in your course sequence. Those are very very useful classes (especially linear algebra), because lots of concepts from those classes show up in CS topics (e.g. linear algebra is everywhere in machine learning). As for option 2, I don't really know what's covered in a ""discrete mathematics"" course‚Äîis it an intro to proof-style course that covers graph theory, sets+relations, etc? If so, perhaps it'd be nice, but I still think linear algebra is more valuable, especially since lots of graph theory is very intuitive and easy to learn on your own (plus the way it's covered in an intro-to-proof math course won't be that useful for CS applications). And honestly, lattice point geometry is a niche topic for a reason‚Äîcompared to LA and diffyq, it's just not as useful. Of course, I may be biased as a math major, but that's my 2 cents.

(Note I'm discussing in terms of how useful the classes will be. If you are solely concerned with standing out and don't care how useful the content is, then options 2 and 3 will be more ""distinctive"" than 1 probably.)",1612137602

My 2cents is if youre going to invest in a 18i20 might want to consider moving over to a more advanced DAW like FL, Cubase or cakewalk as they have ton of more tools at your disposal.

This whole GameStop thing has really shown us how many people are feeling understandably disaffected and powerless to exert any lasting change on the world around us.  Suddenly people that were barely making rent a few weeks ago are paying off student loans and receiving the kind of cash they never imagined they'd have - all at the expense of the once untouchable ""powers that be"" in finance.  That's an intoxicating value proposition if I've ever seen one, and you already know I'm holding GME too lmao.

Honestly I don't think anything you just said is irrational or too weird.  Just try not to get yourself in too deep, if your car is your biggest asset then at least try to have enough set aside to keep it running.

I bought wayyyy OTM AMC calls last week that made me a fuckload of money - but because beyond my own indicators and TA/DD - I've been following the hype &amp; new cycle. So take your time to assess, but also look up this cat on youtube - InTheMoney - that dude goes deep into options. Also Thetagang cats if you're into low returns &amp; mitigating risk.

PA has 80% evasion that means that if you don't have mkb you hit her 20% of the times.

So 80% chance to evade attacks so you evade 80 attacks out of 100. If the enemy has an MKB he will still hit you 75% of these evaded attack (80*0.75 is 60) + the enemy still hits you that 20 times when you (PA) didn't evade attacks. So overall PA gets hit 80 times out of 100.

I don't wanna judge you but it's 6th grade math.

"HeadphoneAdvice","t5_3k8u4","Your path looks pretty good to me.  IME, you'll be wanting that amp pretty soon.  Planars can't be driven to their full potential without them.  I just got the JDS Atom and I find it to be fantastic.  It drives both my old Hifiman HE400's and my Audeze LCD-2's very well, as good or better than my big tube amp the Doge 6210.  I like things a little loud, so on low level recordings I have to dime it, but it's fine, there's no distortion, and satisfaction is there on my Audeze's.  Bass extension is there, there's nothing like that planar slam.  Lossless and hi-res files are just so dynamic, with so much punch and detail.  I'm loving it.  It's great that such a budget friendly amp can drive such nice and expensive headphones.

I'm also using a cheapo dap, the Surfans F20 off Amazon, and it's really great!  Exceptional sound for not much money, and I'm playing DSDs and all kinds of hi-res files to my amazement, the dynamics sometimes shaking my teeth loose.  I have a DAC, the Audioengine D1, and I guess it's okay.  Clean and nice sound, but sound out of my laptop's headphone out is not bad either (it has Beats Audio, only time the brand's been any good).  The DAC in my Surfans is better, my how technology flies.  I find dac upgrading yields very diminishing returns, though there are megabucks solutions out there.  Output of the Apple dongle might be low for planars and the Atom though.  The JDS Atom DAC would most definitely be a good match with the amp.

Good luck on your journey, it's a great hobby.  And nice to see you're getting into planars, they're my favorite.  When driven properly, they will slam you into audio bliss.",1612137605

Anyhow, hard to say. On the one hand, I've learned to be my own health advocate and seek my own answers. On the other, I've learned to be mindful that I'm not a professional.

To that last point, I recently had rapid, profound pain relief thanks to months of physio, chiro, and massage. Because I had been on a high dosage of SSRI and didn't change it when the pain broke, I found myself in a hypomanic phase where I was certain of things happening with my body that probably weren't, at least not in the way I thought.

So yeah, talk to physicians and care providers, ask lots of questions, and new your own advocate. Just be prudent.

I dunno, I don't have real answers, but that's been my experience. Hope it helps. üôÇ",1612137606
"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","excerpts:

After a group of protesters managed to disrupt operations at Dodger Stadium‚Äôs mass COVID-19 vaccination site Saturday, some Los Angeles officials expressed fury at the demonstrators while calling for increased security at testing and vaccination installations.

Los Angeles Fire Department officials closed the main entrance to the stadium ‚Äî one of the largest vaccination sites in the country ‚Äî for about an hour Saturday after a group of between 40 and 60 demonstrators appeared on Stadium Way holding signs that decried masks while shouting unfounded claims about the dangers of the vaccine.

The group dispersed around 3 p.m., and there were no arrests or injuries reported, according to LAFD Asst. Chief Ellsworth Fortman, who oversees the department‚Äôs COVID-19 response. Fortman said approximately 5,740 doses of the vaccine were issued Saturday at the site, which distributes between 5,700 and 7,700 doses daily. Workers were still vaccinating people inside the stadium during the hour that the main entrance was closed, he said.

Both fire and police officials have said the group was nonviolent and that the decision to close the entrance to the facility was a precaution. The protest left several city leaders infuriated, with some questioning why police weren‚Äôt more aggressive toward demonstrators, contending the LAPD has been more proactive in quashing anti-police or Black Lives Matter protests.

‚ÄúLook, the world sees this. What it does is it undermines our public safety community. It‚Äôs not good for our public safety community for people to believe that there‚Äôs inequitable treatment,‚Äù said L.A. City Councilman Gil Cedillo, whose district includes Dodger Stadium. ‚ÄúThat does not help them do their job. When some people get coddled and others don‚Äôt.‚Äù

... 

Andrea Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said the city is ‚Äúreviewing vaccine site safety protocol‚Äù after the incident and will established designated spaces for protesters should demonstrations be staged at vaccination sites in the future. 

... 

Cedillo said he was especially furious that the demonstration took place in his district, which has been hit hard by the virus. In recent weeks, Cedillo‚Äôs office has posted multilingual signs in parts of Westlake, Lincoln Heights, Highland Park and Koreatown warning people they were entering a ‚Äúhigh-risk area‚Äù for COVID-19, and he also said he‚Äôs sent staff members to knock on doors to provide information about vaccinations to senior residents.

Cedillo‚Äôs district includes several neighborhoods that are predominantly working class and Latino, two groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. The number of Latinos in L.A. County who are dying from the virus on a daily basis has surged to a shocking degree in recent weeks.

‚ÄúThis mob feels they have a right to try to stop people like seniors, janitors, housekeepers restaurant workers and supermarket workers from getting the vaccine that they covet. That they want,‚Äù Cedillo said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just very offensive. Very arrogant. It‚Äôs an incredible sense of entitlement.‚Äù",1612137606
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The sad part isn't just the lack of money, but the ignorance that goes along with living on the edge of poverty.  I was an honor roll student my entire school career but I knew college wasn't an option because of a lack of money.  My Dad never paid attention to a single report card and looked at school as childcare more than preparation for anything beyond. 
Without the internet (1990s) I had no idea of the other options available to cover tuition.  I heard about loans from friends but there was no way my Dad would have ever signed any type of loan paperwork.  Again, ignorance of the world and possibilities.

what im saying is, no one transitions genders. the trans in transgender refers to transitioning how they see themselves, how they are perceived and referred to, and how they present themselves. when someone transitions, they arent becoming a male/female/non binary person, they are changing the way they are perceived (ie asking others to call them by a different name or by different pronouns, taking hormone blockers, taking hormones, getting surgery, etc [also, it should be kept in mind not all trans people transition so that they can ""pass"" as someone of their gender, transitioning is simply to make said person most comfortable in their body])

now in the case of, i guess you can call it active genders, like genderfluid, genderflux, bigender, etc, its also a similar case. when a person discovers they are genderfluid/genderflux/bigender, it also doesnt mean they become that gender, they just found that they are of that gender. but when i prefer to be perceived as feminine in one day and masculine the next day, you could say i was a woman yesterday and a man today. but i wasnt just a woman all those years before i found out i was genderfluid

Marcellas atleast would take Danielle since he wanted a black person to win the season (just to be clear I am in no way criticizing that, I think given the disadvantage minorities are at in the game, this makes complete sense).   And since as I already said Marcellas was the biggest goat of the season (even more than Ami), and was completely loyal to Danielle under any circumstance, she should have protected him at all costs, even if she liked Jason and Lisa better.  That is if she were playing to win the game.   Booting Ami over Lisa at Final 4 was a bad mistake too, but atleast I can see a bit.

**Rewatcher - Sub**

Misunderstandings abound as Neal tries to act the part in front of everyone ‚Äîwhich apparently involves not letting his fondness for Elmelie show in front of the crew‚Äî Show overthinking things and underestimating Elmelie ends up in a conversation that Dorubu hears out of context and interprets to mean Show is worried Elmelie may be a spy. Reasonable thoughts on the individual character‚Äôs parts, though Neal is stretching it, but nonetheless all but show fail to effectively communicate with one another and so stuff gets messy.

On one hand, the fact that the show acknowledges that Elmelie‚Äôs escape was incredibly easy when compared to all the prior unsuccessful attempts is interesting and makes for a novel point of discussion, but on the other the cheap drama it‚Äôs being used to supply is less than ideal.

Shot‚Äôs been sidelined once more as Shot orders him to take a break. He probably wants to go out more than ever, since Elmelie is his ticket to power, though maybe word of her fleeing hasn‚Äôt reached him yet.

Neal is handling this rather gracelessly. At least take the poor girl aside and tell her she has your implicit trust, making it clear his act is purely for the other‚Äôs sake.

Hey, they *finally* fixed the Dana O‚ÄôShee! Guess it‚Äôs going to be Elmelie‚Äôs personal mech going forward.

The radar‚Äôs aura sensitivity is brought up again as the three battlers from upper Earth show up more clearly on it. Nice tidbit of continuity there.

It was utterly reckless of her to have come out like this, but at least Elmelie seems to be doing fairly well for herself. Despite getting overwhelmed when she is shot at and opting for a retreat, she managed to not get shot down while being pursued by two more experienced pilots in superior machines. She definitely fared better than Todd in his first few scuffles, at least, which is impressive for someone who only knew how to pilot an aura battler in theory.

And just like that Doroburu realizes he was wrong about Elmelie‚Äôs intentions and the rest finally talk it out. Interesting setup, poor execution, and not helped by the fact that ‚Äîplot-wise‚Äî we‚Äôre still just trying to move out of this cave, and we the audience have already seen that Elmelie is more capable than your average damsel in distress. This is quite evidently a filler episode meant to fill out the time between more pertinent story points because they need to fill out a full four cours worth of content on a strict schedule. If it were better written I‚Äôd have no issue with it, but as it stands I find this one of the weaker episodes so far.

We‚Äôre evidently in the slow portions of the show‚Äôs ‚Äòpunctuated equilibrium‚Äô style of storytelling...

---

**P.S.** I saw some of you were questioning what Elmelie would even be doing now that she‚Äôs with the Zelana, so I guess this episode may have more merit than I initially gave it credit for, establishing that the characters know she isn‚Äôt the a big advantage for them and that she needs a new role in the narrative.",1612137608

"TechnoProduction","t5_2v4k9","No worries, and I get the idea behind using such a tool to help you with your arrangement troubles.

I think a big issue here for me as well is that arrangement grows out of the patterns.

As in, sound turns into patterns, and patterns turn into bigger blocks, and these turn into arrangements, etc.
It is the same thing, just at a different scale, if you get what I mean.

I play with synths to make cool sounds, I play with these cool sounds to make patterns, I play with the patterns to make stories/blocks, I play with the blocks to make a song.
In that way arrangements grow.

Using an arrangement generator like this to then force sounds into it seems really weird to me. It is like writing a book with a certain font size and page limit.
An interesting challenge to be sure, but also very at odds with how I would naturally let creative expression flow.

As I said before, I am sure such tools can be used for discovery. Using random generators to turn patterns into blocks etc, can definitely give you diamonds, it can absolutely inspire. But it seems to me the tool is not designed with this in mind.
Of course, if you are able to see this, and use the tool as a tool and not a guide, great I'd say.
But I fear for many it will inspire the wrong mindset.

Making music, or any creative thing really, is really a thing of two minds.
It is the creative vomiting, unfiltered expression, as much as my ego will allow it.
And then a process of cleaning it up, sorting out the diamonds, deleting all the fucking slime.
Then back to vomiting again, then back to cleaning, on and on.
Eventually structure forms, it becomes tougher, harder to bend without it breaking.
Fear can come, oh god, I hope this is not shit.
But the right mind will say, it is what it is, I will push on, I will detail this fucking turd, because it is my turd, and I do actually like it. At some point the detailing will reach a point where changes are so minute they don't really matter much, and you call it done.
Or perhaps you say fuck it, grab a sledge hammer, smash it to pieces and grab what you like to vomit a new track again. Who knows.",1612137608

 I always liked hard class that takes a lot of time to master so Tamer was perfect choice to give it a try and I loved it, but I wanted to try something new and easier. So I switched to Nova. 

Easy grinding with huge AoE was fun and I felt so powerful clearing mobs with one huge AoE compared to Tamer where I almost broke my fingers spamming spells. 

After 2 weeks of grinding on Nova I felt like it's not fun anymore and I missed the hard playstyle like it used to be on Tamer. So I had the same decision easy class that will be good for grind, but eventually gonna get bored of it OR progressing class I really love playing, but grinding gonna be much harder and even less silver/h. 

I chose Tamer, cuz no matter how powerful classes are you should always play class that you enjoy playing no matter what other people say and no matter how weak it is as long as you like it. All that progress you gonna make on your alt will be waste cuz you could have it on your main class that you enjoy playing.

Dresses: I'm not nearby my closet atm, but by my memory count, I have \~13, 5 of which are formal dresses. About 6 of the 13 are winter/sweater dresses.

Skirts: 2, one of which I might get rid of because it doesn't work with any of my outfits. I wore a lot of skirts/tops as a high-schooler so I really got sick of them after a while. 

Dress shirts/blouses: 3

"StrategyGames","t5_2t4fh","Glad to know you like it. I started learning game dev 2 years ago. After a couple of months, I decide to make my first game as a learning project. At the same time I started making some devlog. 

A lot of people from the game dev community encourage me to finish the game and release on steam. It is a big challenge for me as I have no experience to make a game. But I would like to give it a try. 

Due to the limited resource, I would like to create something simple but still interesting to play. Sometimes I can run out of ideas. And it is not easy for me to see the problem as I am too close to the game. So I would like to hear more feedback from the group who like strategy genre. Feel free to leave any comment, no matter it is positive or negative. They will all help me to improve it quickly. :)

"mcgill","t5_2rhkw","There are global mcgill policies about how final exams must be *kept*. Basically, the prof needs to keep the exams for a while after the end of the class in case there is a grade contestation or something of the sort. So they can't allow people to physically take their exam out of their office, for instance.

Then, there are departments that try really hard to stop students from sharing exams with others because it leads to situation like BIOL 201 a while ago where some students had the answers to the exams and others didn't. There are courses for which you can't come up with an entire set of *good* new questions every year, at some point there are a set of cookie cutter questions that are ideal in the context of the course and how you taught it, particularly in first year courses. I don't personally think it's that absurd to try reduce the chances of the contents of the exam being shared if it being shared is an issue in that department.

However, the situation you describe doesn't seem like a particularly useful or pertinent way of implementing this type of policy. It sounds more likely to me that these departments are facing extreme logistical challenges in term of providing support for students wanting to see their final exam and eventually seeking re-evaluation. Profs are usually kind of left on their own to deal with this and there isn't really a simple way to address this in online school. A fair number of profs are just crumbling under the added administrative pressure.",1612137609

Padm√© was alive when Anakin left her, but Sideous drained her life force and gave it to Darth Vader. Technically Sideous didn't lie to him either. By losing to Obi-Wan, he forced Sideous to have to do that.",1612137610

If GME priced shares below market value, their shareholders (including RH) would file a class action suit. The reason is because GME is not maximizing value for shareholders (like they would if they just sold shares into the market at the higher price and then used that cash to buy Valve)

Instead she's trying to con the guard out of a very expensive model kit. Why... did it take her this long to attempt to escape? She basically walked out the front door. El died! This is a pretty unflattering sight. El died! Again!!

Loser realises her mistake and unleashes her inner dom on the poor drunk guards. I'm jealous. Why would El go to her dad's...? Neal has become the over cautious stick-in-the-mud whilst Show is the fired up ace pilot. They still haven't covered why El's music teacher is suddenly Shot's right hand woman. Father!? Brothers!? Agare, agare, agare, Gundamuuu! El died, part thre-four! What nice bandits... They're probably baddies due to the apple eating but it's nice that El has made new friends. Our brave hero is ditching his gf after exploiting her for inside information... Did you lose your nuts on the Aura Road?

Keen's gotten the shaft since her dad died... It's almost as if they're keeping her around for a rainy day. ""Aura power is making him mature faster."" The words of a shotacon. Ah, El caught on to their plan. Tbh I think I would have ended up following them all the way to their hideout. I'm too trusting. Anyway we get to see how badly outclassed you are without an Aura mech. Two of the blokes get their heads gnawed off, El's saviour gets gunned down, and the leader gets his head nommed too. At least Musiy cuts the leader some slack and frees him. ""You're a soldier so I don't love you anymore!!"" She says whilst running to meet her soldier boyfriend. 

Oh, she's of course like Keen's dad and is fighting for her House. I'm sorry but El, and the Zelana crew for that matter, have no leg to stand on. Poor selfish El. Musiy tries to recruit the bandits to her house so now Drake even has the downtrodden of the nation fighting for him. Por has no idea what they're getting into. Musiy is putting up a great fight though. She's a natural Battler. She won!? Wtf is going on here!? Garou Ran, I choose you!! Show Zama has no dignity... Mikazuki was a fairer fighter. 

Poor dad... He's laughing!? You're terrible. You're a terrible person and you should feel bad about yourself. This is so tragic. This is awful and I'm genuinely peeved at our heroes for it XD Keen is the only one I vaguely like but she rarely gets enough screentime to commit warcrimes. El shows no concern over her close confidant being hit with someone of the worst trauma I can think of. It's all about me, right? How did she put it? ""I'm the only one stepped on for other's convenience?"" You're living the life of luxury hen. Okay Neal... Your girlfriend got home before you so now you've gotta sound happy to see her. ""Hey, Keen!"" *Shit...* Is this some joke!? This is dark comedy yeah?

If you are planning on storing a knife for a while, I suggest using nitrile gloves to handle it. It keeps the skin oil off the steel. 

Rub them down with a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol to remove any skin oils, let dry and then a light coat of oil. I wrap my collector knives in blue shop rags and tuck a 3x5 card with the knife info under the rubber and holding everything together.

I‚Äôm getting old and forget shit, so the note cards are handy when digging through a box of knives!

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","&gt;One of the weaker typhoons of the season was rushing through the Pacific just east of Tokyo Bay, and the winds were audible even through the concrete walls of the barracks. Cullen was sitting on his bed...

Change ""was rushing"" to ""rushed"" and ""was sitting"" to ""sat"" or ""lounged"" or some other verb that communicates what he's doing. Being verbs such as ""is"" and ""was"" aren't really needed and are usually (but not always) better replaced with stronger verbs.

&gt; Tears prickled the back of his eyes, and Cullen truly detested his weakness. 

Since it's Cullen who detests his own weakness, repeating his name isn't needed. Maybe change the part of the sentence after the comma to ""and he truly detested his own weakness."" Even the word ""own"" isn't necessary in the example I've provided since we know whose weakness it must be. 

&gt; Why was he blubbering now? 

""Blubbering"" suggests heavy, ugly crying, so I was a bit caught off guard by the sudden change from tears prickling to blubbering. Depending on how you want Cullen to cry, change blubbering to a more suitable adjective, or add more lead up to how he's now crying noisily and uncontrollably. The next paragraph says he tries to sniff them back, which suggests much less noticeable crying, which is why ""blubbering"" specifically seemed a bit out of place.

&gt;Cullen tried to sniff back the tears to no avail, then attempted to wipe away any trace of lacrimal evidence with ~~his right hand rolled into~~ a fist.  

The strikethrough portion simply isn't needed since it's not necessary that we know that it was his right hand, and it's a bit wordy as well. I'm very fond of the saying ""less is more"" after all.

&gt;And Tharin was gone because of his own stupidity and callousness.  

I'm assuming that Tharin is gone because of Cullen's stupidity and callousness, but the way the sentence is structured makes it seem as if it's Tharin's stupidity and callousness. Change to ""And Tharin was gone because of Cullen's own stupidity and callousness."" 

&gt;The last text was from the young man, saying he would meet him in Shin-Kawasaki Station on the day of their third and last date. 

This sentence reads just a bit strange- for a second I was confused about what the message consisted of. I would recommend the following rearrangement:

*The last text from Tharin was sent on the day of their third and last date- a message saying he would meet Cullen at Shin-Kawasaki Station.*

You don't need to use epithets for characters we're already familiar with, hence why I cut ""the young man"" from the sentence.

&gt;He paused for a few seconds but scraped together last bits of courage he had left in him.  

*He paused for a few seconds but scraped together* ***the*** *last bits of courage he had left in him.*  

&gt; *Hi. I must be the last person you want to hear from, but please hear me out. I realize I‚Äôve done something that‚Äôs unforgivable. Things still aren‚Äôt that great for LGBTQ in the Navy and I was afraid of the brass finding out about me being bi, but I should‚Äôve come to you to discuss it.* 

I'm being extremely nitpicky here, but I'd recommend starting the sentence ""I realize"" on a new line, purely for dramatic effect. Alternatively, you could keep the first three sentences as one chunk and start the sentence ""Things still aren't"" on a new line. This is a totally optional edit, but I feel it ups the drama a bit :D 

&gt;Lying on his side facing the nightstand, Cullen waited with his gaze firmly planted on the **phone** ~~jet-black rectangular mass~~ sitting atop his laptop. 

""Jet-black rectangular mass"" made me think he had some sort of sci-fi super weapon for a moment there haha- in this case, it's best to be simple. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have for now, but please don't think that your fic is bad in some way- I actually really like the drama of the protagonist feeling like he's ruined things with his lover, and you do a phenomenal job of communicating that! Even from this small excerpt, I get the feeling that this is a solid fic and you have something great in your hands. 

As for helping rachet up Cullen's internal struggle, I don't know if I can be of much help there, sorry- one thing that did strike me was perhaps describing the empty text bubble as mocking him as he thought of a response- that's only a suggestion though. Since I don't know much else about the fic or Dragon Age, I don't exactly have a handle on the characters and/or knowing how they'll react to certain things.

Overall, I hope this critique was helpful and wish you the best of luck on your fic! Do keep in mind that I am only a third party and my opinions are only opinions- you, as the author, have full freedom to ignore whatever I say and do whatever you want (even though I do hope my suggestions are useful in some way). Happy fic writing!! &lt;3",1612137612
"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","Nah... Silver case is very solid...

1st - silver for less than 30 usd/oz is cheap... miners are cheap... it is a good investment even without any squeeze... So, hard to lose money, at least on long term. 

2nd - you don't need a squeeze to make money, the all times high was 50 (in 2010-11)... it is almost 100% upside going there... 

3rd - prices already started to move due to reddit... People are buying, not only the 7M+ members, but even some financial players that see opportunity.... For a prophecy come true in the market, people just need to believe

4th - differently than with $GME, silver is good even without squeeze... with a squeeze, well, sky is the limit... squeeze silver may not be a good idea, but putting money on it, it seems great for me...

By the time I was 4, at every single get together that included food, I would stand braced for a fight *feet apart, clenched fists, angry face) and yell ""My mommy is *allergic* to cheese and even a little will *kill* her"" while staring down the room. Apparently it was adorable, but it was also effective. My mom would always tell people she was allergic, of course, but she never wanted to make a big fuss about literally anything (she had zero self-esteem, so it's not that surprising. She'll fight to the death for absolutely anyone- I learned it from her, after all- except herself).

"Flipping","t5_2y9q6","Hi everyone I‚Äôm really new to reselling phones. I have a situation where I wanted to get some advice. Basically I sent four phones total value $1700 and they arrived as received. Later the buyer he showed a video and said that two of these phones were missing and I was sent a charge back from PayPal of $900. It was the two most expensive phones as well. Very suspicious. 

The buyer told me that he almost didn‚Äôt accept the package because he could tell it had been opened and tampered with, but he did because he thought there might be phones in there and so he signed off on it.

I have course opened the claim with FedEx. Regarding their PayPal claim I went ahead and learned that it‚Äôs good to add my tracking number to the dispute to prove that it was delivered and he signed off on it.

 However I‚Äôve done some research and read that at the time of delivery they can either refuse the delivery, or notate that items are missing so that Fed ex has record. I‚Äôm in a situation where I don‚Äôt want to imply that the buyer is trying to get over on me because I‚Äôm so na√Øve and new I don‚Äôt want to build a bad name in this industry. However it just seems very odd to have the most expensive phones come up missing and that they haven‚Äôt show me surveillance footage yet. I want to see the delivery so I can see where they inspected this prior to signing off for it.

The only video they showed me was a box that appeared sliced open and you could tell it was cut with a scissors or a knife. And that‚Äôs the only proof I have I am very suspicious because I wonder why they didn‚Äôt make a notation at the delivery? Why didn‚Äôt they take pictures at the time the package was being delivered or even inspect the package and invoice to make sure the quantity matched since they noticed the box was open? These guys have been on the game for a while so it seems like common sense. 

Will there be any chance I will win my case with PayPal? Or am I pretty much going to lose and they will favor the buyer?",1612137613

Do NOT use the highlighter tool to censor your posts. Be sure to check that all identifiable information has been censored on your post. To help prevent brigading, sending links to a video that is cringe, in any circumstance, is banned. (Example: ‚ÄúThis is the link to the video in the screenshot: [link]‚Äù). We ban links because people from the subreddit could easily go to the original source of the cringe and harass the creator. If you give out usernames and links in comments or posts, we will ban you for 7 days. This also includes asking for usernames or links to a GachaTuber‚Äòs channel. If we find out that you are brigading (that is, mass commenting or posting in another place), you will be permanently banned. Usernames are only allowed if the user in question has a YouTube subscriber following of over 100k. If you posted a picture of a subreddit and the subreddit is not a Gacha related subreddit, it can stay. All other social media with identifiable information MUST be censored. You will be given a 1 day ban. Every offence after your first ban will be increased by 1 day. In terms of doxing, if a user‚Äôs personal information such as street addresses and real names are given, you will be given a permanent ban and will be reported to the Reddit admins.

Yeah he did shit this past masters, but people are legit delusional if they dont think his comments will 100% be proven true when he and the upcoming generation of super long players start really making the course look smaller than it ever intended to be played at.

Heresy measures better (cleaner), no real reason to get the Magni 3+ over it, they‚Äôre identical otherwise.

JDS atom amp is the same price, same power, just as clean. I‚Äôd say a toss up between these two.

You did not care about battle mechanics, as in Legend of Zelda. I think this is correct: metroidvanias are not defined by battle mechanics.

You did care about distinguishing areas as opposed to content, as in the Witness, where all the areas are open, but the puzzles have to be unlocked. I agree with this.


You did care about linearity, as in dead cells and Spelunky 2. This is the one thing I disagree with. Both games have interconnected, if not open, maps. Both require you to complete objectives in one part of the map to access another area of it. My  main concern would be that most of the map is not blocked off in either game, though, to be fair, both have blocked off true endings.",1612137616

"Televisions","t5_2r3a3","Yeah this sub doesn't really like soundbars because they are very poor value compared to a HT system.

TV sound is obviously not great except on the OLEDs. The BX I would say you would want some king if sound system if you want to watch movies. The CX you can get away without one for a long time.

Soundbar's are bad because they are advertised for a lot of reasons that aren't true. The only real reason for one is ease of setting up if you move frequently. They sound like shit unless you spend $700 minimum and they last less than 10 years like most things with PCBs in them. HT systems are actually not that complicated and for $1200 will last 20+ years. Speakers basically never have issues and receivers last about as long as a sound bar.

If you want a soundbar this is the one I have and it is pretty nice.

The Bose 700 was better but didn't come with a subwoofer, which actually worked out better in an apartment. That one starts at $800.

I use a soundbar because I was in college then Law School and we moved our apartments every year or so. If I had a house I would definitely look at getting a HT system setup. Definitive Technology is my favorite brand for HT systems but if that is too pricey Klipsch has a similar sound for half the cost.

Anyone who wanted to be invest in an index of stocks has done very well since 2009.    Since research is clear that you have to part of the uber-rich to really get access to managers that have any chance of beating the market (and even then your chances are not good over time), I assume most people ought to be invested in ETFs that track broad indexes.    S&amp;P and DOW indexes have returned almost 14% annualized over the prior 10 years.  NASDAQ is above 18% annualized over that time.  In that context, looking at the current system does not make me super-angry at all the ""destruction"" you are referencing.

\- You are 1 hour late for work.  So he fired you.

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","I absolutely agree with this! I know three people (myself included) who have been diagnosed with BPD. In all cases, we had been through trauma at various points in our life that made us self-harm. In all cases, the self-harm was a direct result of trauma (after reading about CPTSD I discovered that the emotional state I was in while self-harming was adequately described by the term emotional flashback). And yet, we were all diagnosed by doctors who thought female + self-harm = BPD. And I am still really ticked off by the stupid dr. who gave me the diagnosis on the basis of 10 years old self-harm scars when I had spent the intervening 10 years working PRETTY DAMN HARD to heal the aftereffects of my hard upbringing.

And this brings me to my other beef with BPD, or any personality disorder, as a diagnosis. When you give such a diagnosis, you are in effect saying that there's something wrong with the very self of the patient. HOWEVER, with a CPTSD-diagnosis, you acknowledge that something awful has happened to this person, and healing will be hard work and take time. One diagnosis has a growth mindset, the other one has not. Based on my and my two friends' experience, I am pretty sure that a lot of people end up with BPD (or other, like avoidant personality disorder)-diagnoses, which robs them of the hope of healing, and in many cases (luckily not so much mine, but in the case of both friends) lead to neglect from the health care personnel who should have taken care of them.

I'm not saying all these diagnoses are wrong, but that it's highly likely that many of them are.

On the topic of FLEAS, one day when I was around 24, I discovered that I was blaming a totally honest mistake on someone else, and I realised that this was something I had learnt from my mother, the person who is completely incapable of acknowledging mistakes. I resolved to never do so again. What has been learned, can be unlearned. I also waited with having kids until I felt that I had made great progress with regards to my mental health. If I could at all avoid it, I wouldn't let my kids grow up with a depressed mother.

On to armchair diagnosis: This subreddit does strive to avoid this (if I read the rules right). However, I do believe that something like narcissism is a spectrum. Everyone should have a little bit of selfishness. That is healthy. I think the place where it goes from healthy to unhealthy is where it starts to hurt other people. However, it's still a spectrum \*within\* the unhealthy range. Like, my mother was not great at all, but she still has many good qualities. She's not at all as bad as a lot of people I read about here. She hit me, yes, she screamed at me and verbally abused me, yes, but she didn't starve me or throw me out of the house. She was nice, occasionally. My brother, who molested me when he was a teenager, still has several great qualities, and could have been a pretty awesome guy, indeed he seems so to most people who know him. I just cannot ever trust him again. Because his selfishness turned from the healthy amount into the unhealthy amount, when he decided my body was the object he could experiment sexually on. I spent a lot of time and energy during the early stages of healing agonizing over how a guy with so many good traits could have done me so much harm...",1612137618

"Nanny","t5_33toc","This all sounds fine except generally her 2 weeks off per year would be paid. It's standard for nannies to get guaranteed hours (paid when you ask her not to come in), paid vacation/sick time, paid holidays off, and mileage reimbursement. 

Given that she's part time you would just adjust it to her schedule. So if she works 3 days per week she gets 6 days of paid vacation per year. You could also have her accrue the PTO or offer it after a trial period of 60-90 days if you don't feel comfortable offering it all right out of the gate. 

That said I'm sure there are nannies out there who don't necessarily need a consistent income and could take 2 weeks unpaid. Although generally if you want a professional nanny they will expect at least 1-2 weeks paid vacation.",1612137618

In most stages, even late ones, you can activate them before the first rush (there are exceptions like 7-9 iirc) and you'll be flooded with DP.

"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","I've had several miscarriages and it never gets easier. Here's a fact - almost all sexually active women of childbearing age will have had at least one miscarriage. yet we're made to feel that it's something taboo we can't talk about and that we're being dramatic for being upset over it.

the first thing you need to realise is that it wasn't your fault, and the second is that it's okay to be upset

My most recent miscarriage was last year - long after i'd decided to get sterilised and even after i'd made the appointment. it was a whoopsie pregnancy and although I hadn't wanted another child I was still devastated when I miscarried. we didn't really tell anyone because, as you've found out, some people just don't get it and think you're overreacting or try to blame your grief on hormones. some of the worst things ever said to me were about miscarriage, including 'it's god's way of telling you that you don't deserve children' 'it wasn't a real baby' and when i had a later miscarriage and had no option but to labour I was told 'stop crying, there's no need to be dramatic, millions of women go through this  without the need for attention' - by the doctor treating me

a miscarriage is a very lonely thing. it can feel like no one understands how you feel and if you mention it it can feel like you are being dramatic over it

we need to stop treating miscarriage as a minor thing that we gloss over or hush up and accept it as a very real and emotionally painful experience.

This would be a dumb thing to do, but it's just notation. In that system, for example, we could write 12 x 11 = 132 m^(2) and be ""right"" (since the 12 and 11 are implicitly in meters).

"TrentUniversity","t5_2slqn","They pay me for this (and relative to peterborough incomes and faculty at other universities a lot of money) and I have virtually no desire to do anything. 

One thing to think about if possible is separating devices - work and 'social'.  Put your phone in a different room when you're trying to work, don't be logged into reddit/fb/etc. on your 'work' computer.   Where possible, print things off or use physical meatspace books.  Work in a different chair/desk than where you socialise.  

Break your day into units of work.  For an engineer or software developer these are 4 hour blocks, you get 3 a day, 21 a week.  Anything that disrupts you at all (a single text, phone call, social media etc.) basically wipes out a block.  That's a 'maker' schedule - given the mental pressures right now that's probably not workable, though I encourage my graduate students to think about work like that.  That's also why many software developers only do 3-4 hours of real work a day (and the rest of their time is spent on management/training/administration/meetings/distractions ).  For a student now I would break things up into smaller workable sets, it depends on your schedule but unless you're live with a camera on try and not commit yourself to a task for more than an hour at a time before you take a break. That might actually mean 1 or 2 hours of screwing around for every hour of productive work, but your brain probably can't be forced to pay attention for the hours it can in person. 

&gt;I'm in my 4th year,

So the good news is that you are mentally in the state every student normally hits after reading week in their 4th year.  ""Just give me the damn degree"".   The bad news, is that you're about a month early.  


My best piece of advice is something heard elsewhere (from Randy Pausch if you've heard of him - though don't go down that youtube hole if you aren't, it's bloody depressing). *Good enough is good enough*.  Even if you're trying to get into grad school (and scholarships etc.), rely on your connections and people who know you are competent, work to impress them, but don't overwhelm yourself.  If you try and push yourself too hard you can hit your breaking point, crash and burn - and then digging yourself out isn't any fun.  

Everyone (staff and students) are in a similar situation, so don't stress too much about it - everyone is struggling along.",1612137620

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","I'll go through your specific asks and then comment more broadly. 

**Tenses**

All seemed good to me. Nothing to change here. 

**Clunkiness**

Definitely some clunkiness throughout. Examples:

&gt;The star of the show, a kid named Kevin, or more importantly, his inner monologue, charted his life path through puberty and adolescence. 

A lot of clauses stuffed in here. When you write out a long sentence like this, think of how you may be able to break it up so it's more readable. My suggestion: 'A kid named Kevin was the star of the show. His inner monologue charted his life path through puberty and adolescence.""

This happens quite a bit throughout. I'd recommend taking a second look at your compound sentences and thinking, would this make more sense as two sentences? It will also help the flow of the piece, as varied sentence lengths and structures make writing much more interesting and rhythmic to read.

**Formatting**

Formatting was fine, paragraph structure made sense and punctuation was on point. 

OK, now onto some other stuff. 

**Grammar/spelling**

Couple mistakes here, but editing isn't on so I couldn't put it in the Google doc. 

&gt;It followed an American family, doing American things.

You can remove the comma here. 

&gt;  It‚Äôs was an easier time back then, back in the nineties.

Should be 'It was...'

**Show, not tell**

Most of this piece is written like you're telling us about the TV Girlfriend. But it would be much more engaging if you wrote up some imagined scenes about you and the TV Girlfriend. Did you and one of the Saved by the Bell girls go to the mall? What was your first imagined kiss like? Describe it for me, so when the imagination bubble pops, we feel that disappointment along with you. 

**Tone**

I also agree with a previous critique saying it starts out like an article about the Wonder Years, then switches to a personal anecdote. Keeping one tone throughout would make the story much more coherent. I think your informal tone was much more captivating later on in the story, and I could feel your voice wanting to come out (especially in the paragraph about the hyper-sexualized masses). Don't stifle that voice, use that to set the stage in the beginning instead of talking about the specifics of the Wonder Years.",1612137620

- Oh hey, we‚Äôre finally on some of the episodes I own from the old ADV home DVD release! It‚Äôs about time.

- Neal and Marvel don‚Äôt seem to be all to warm and welcoming of Emelie now that she‚Äôs here. As she says, they‚Äôre acting like she‚Äôs just in the way of things. And even Show and Dopple are suspicious of her, thinking that she‚Äôs maybe a spy. So much for the warm welcome she got at the end of the last episode. They‚Äôve sent her running off in tears.

- To the complete surprise of nobody, Bann isn‚Äôt being sent out again by Shot, due to completely botching his last attempt with the Leprechaun. You‚Äôd almost feel bad for how far Bann has fallen in favor with everyone, if he wasn‚Äôt also the personal attack dog of a tyrant and his cronies.

- Poor Emelie. Even Neal is starting to suspect her of being a spy as well. Heck, nobody here even trusts her completely, even though Marvel brings up the point that Emelie escaped with great personal risk to herself. With the way she‚Äôs being treated, it‚Äôs no wonder that Emelie feels like the only way she can prove herself is by testing the repaired Danny O‚ÄôShea with Keen. It‚Äôs practically the same kind of situation that ended up creating Galarea.

- On the one hand, man Keen is being pretty rude to Emelie too. But on the other, yeah she has pretty much zero knowledge of piloting. There is a difference between knowing the theory behind the function of Aura Battlers compared to the actual piloting of them.

- And of course Allen, Jeryl, and Fuei pick this time to show up and attack the *Zelana*, just as they‚Äôre moving their equipment to a new base of operations off the coast. It really does say something that someone like Shot would trust the new Leprechauns in the hands of people like Jeryl and Fuei over Bann. Bann‚Äôs been all but replaced at this point.

- Emelie does a pretty good job in the Danny O‚ÄôShea, all things considered. That‚Äôs saying quite a bit, since she‚Äôs an inexperienced pilot in a heavily outdated Aura Battler. She at least gave Allen and Fuei a run for their money for a little bit. If anything, this shows that Jeryl is actually the only fully dangerous recruit from Upper Earth.

- Well, at least Emelie has finally earned the respect of Dopple, Dowa, and the rest of the *Zelana* crew. It‚Äôs really only Neal that‚Äôs still paranoid of her. Show and Marvel practically had to coerce him into finally apologizing to Emelie. At least you can say that‚Äôs a fairly consistent character trait of his, considering how Neal‚Äôs been acting the entire time. Sometimes, he‚Äôs too distrustful for his own good.",1612137621

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

I also think it‚Äôs crazy to shame other women for their choices. 

I breastfed my kids. It was a huge battle. My kids routinely are born with lip and tongue ties that need revising. That affects their latch. It‚Äôs some of the most painful bonding I‚Äôve experienced trying to nurse both my kids who couldn‚Äôt latch properly. Once they got revised and had some practice, the pain melted away, and nursing went much smoother the rest of the time. They gained weight and were happy, healthy kids. 

My best friend tried to nurse and then decided she would just do formula instead, especially after her kid was taken to the ER for jaundice. So now her baby is formula-fed and thriving like crazy.

Why can‚Äôt they short AMC? If I‚Äôm a hedge fund, I see that float, I wait for any spike and start aggressive with the selling pressure like Friday morning. As you said, you‚Äôve already bought in. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll go up because of some buying pressure and shorts waiting for a entry point but you have to understand GME was already at 140% short interest BEFORE mainstream buying began and retail started buying up shares. Hence that massive spike in week. AMC had the initial buying up, hence the spike, but you‚Äôll need a whole other level of longs to keep the momentum. 

This looks like a pump. GME was in a once-in-a-decade set of circumstances. You can try to catch a falling knife. More than likely catch the blade and bleed but small chance you can catch handles just be careful and good luck!!",1612137623

A one year relationship five years ago to a guy in Brazil who you can't even contact or meet seems too convenient.  Also, why would he have a female roommate that he can't stand but still lives with her?  That doesn't make sense.  As others have said, if this is only 3 weeks in, don't you think that the relationship is moving along faster than normal?  Why the rush?  Also, third date and his boyfriend?  You date to get to know people for who they really are.  If you were 18 I'd say this is one of those intense OMG I love you things that burn quick and are done.  But he's in his 30's and you're in your mid 20's.  My opinion for what it's worth is to step back a little bit and see how he reacts. Does he text you 30 times a day.  Hey, when am I going to see you again?  Just say that you've promised to spend some time with a couple of your friends and see how he reacts.  I think that you are looking at this relationship in a very mature manner.  Better to know what's what going in than trying to figure out how do I get away from this guy.  Good luck.",1612137623

I could never get enough air it felt no matter how deep i would breath. I would start by taking my bra off without getting relief then my shirt not being weird just saying. Anything that was on my upper body felt like it was restricting me. I found that laying in very cold sheets with nothing on my upper body helped me quite a bit. Also kicking back or putting my feet up relaxing and catching my breath outside in the cold air for 5 or 10 minutes helps me a ton if that's possible where you are. If not just close up the heat vents in your bedroom or redirect a good amount of the air conditioning to your room. Suboxone pretty much ruins your digestive system use miralax it just gets things moving without being so forceful. No judgement but being on that high of dose im assuming to not feel any withdrawals whatsoever from what you where on is not worth the horror you will face when you want to get off of it. Feeling some withdrawal symptoms or trying to cope with cravings will feel like heaven compared to cutting back tapering or getting off of suboxone. The struggle is real and I wouldn't wish the withdrawal of suboxone on anyone and the most I was on was 8mg for the first 8yrs I was on it.",1612137624

No. Bad faith is when you get shown actual evidence and proper argumentation and still refuse to accept it, because all you tried to do from the start was to appear superior and derail the conversation.

&gt;The thing with insults is that they usually only sting when there's a grain of truth in them.

Judging from your reactions I would say that attacking or insulting you for being extremely insecure and that you overestimate yourself severely is probably the most fruitful. You just try to act as if nothing I wrote here bothers you, but since you keep replying and the manner in which you do it it is pretty fucking obvious that my argumentation strikes a nerve with you. :)

"bullcity","t5_2sv0n","And you can't understand *at all* why people without kids might want to find friends who also don't have kids?

I don't have anything against kids and I'm happy for my friends who have them, but it changes a friendship - *a lot* - when someone has kids. Even really close friends I've known for 15+ years - once they have kids the relationship changes. It's harder to maintain because those of us without kids *have* to take a backseat to the kids and make more concessions. It imbalances the relationship.

I get it, I really do. I would judge someone if they *didn't* prioritize their kids over their friends. Kids are important, and people find it important to have kids. I don't resent friends with kids. But looking at it from the other side, it's *really hard* for a friendship to be as fulfilling as it was before the kids were there. And everyone deserves friendships where the other person is emotionally invested in the relationship.

So yeah, I don't mind specifically trying to find child-free friends, because I don't want my social life to revolve around some toddler's 8pm bedtime. You have no legal or moral right to people befriending you. Call it discrimination if you want, but that doesn't mean you've somehow been wronged or have cause for this self-righteous indignation.",1612137625

Goldman Sachs put out a list of overvalued bubble stocks with a valuation over 50b. It included things like dash. This was number 2.

I'm really glad that when Naruto wins people over like this that they don't make a big deal out of it to him, or with the audience, with always having apologies or bonding moments, that it just happens over time often with things Naruto doesn't even realized he influenced, like Konohamaru and also Hinata seeing his training etc. Makes it feel a lot more natural

Yeah that's a pretty shit change, I have no idea why someone thought that was okay to include

You can learn the Easter egg in 3 hours of plunder.

Watch a video how it works.

The hardest part is doing the part in downtown. My personal tip (which youtubers don‚Äôt explain) is you need paper and pen. Give every painting (8 of them) a name. When you watch the computer you just write down the first letter of the picture and the number for all 4 of them. Then you search the 4 pictures and wrote down their numbers accordingly. Then you go back to the computer and while you see the numbers again you have time to calculate to get the 4 digit code.

Entering the code will cost you also many deaths at first but you‚Äôll get the hang of it. 

Example names for picture: ( house, roof, medals, woods, lady, guy etc...) 

Example notation while watching the computer: H + 2, M - 1, L + 3, G 0
Then while running around looking for the paintings you write for example: H +2 + 7, so there you have the first digit: 9

It is frustrating and you will die stupidly not even close in the slightest for a few hours but when you get it you know it for life and can get 2 advanced UAV and 2 Specialist guaranteed whenever you want. Also around 15-40k cash. Also specialist means you just need one overkill loadout since you have ghost + restock from specialist ;) 

Pretty damn worth it to me

It has to result in either wounding, maiming, endangerment to life, or disfigurement, as those terms have been judicially defined throughout the centuries. 

What that means in practice is that some injuries you might not think would constitute an aggravated assault do, and some injuries that you'd generally think would, don't always. I know in the jurisdictions I've practiced in, whiplash wouldn't generally make the cut; but I do recall hearing that there was an appellate decision in BC recently that may have changed the law on what constitutes a maiming, so for your purposes that may not be the case.",1612137627

Which, obviously, in turn, makes the economy drastically weaker because they continuously exclude some of the most brilliant minds and abled bodies because of [traditional] ""social status."" Republican Presidents have had to clean up some of the foreign affairs that Democratic Presidents rushed into to try to repair our home economy over our global economy because Democratic Presidents tend to get Sovereignty and Globalism repetitiously confused for each other when it comes to currencies. Democratic officials don't seem to be too good at math. Republican officials don't seem to be too good with people. Every President since Bill Clinton (maybe sooner) has had to clean up the EO's of the President before them. Which, by the way, don't actually change anything and is all for show of vote. But nonetheless, Democratic Presidents have had to do A LOT of social untangling that Republican Presidents have caused for us all, especially the nonpriveleged and poverty stricken. We most definitely deserve a lot of reparation for what we've paid into vs. what we've been given. Democratic Presidents are the only ones who seem to even acknowledge that we deserve better because we give better. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean anything, though.",1612137629
"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Many people believe that it makes life harder because of societal biases against autism, not because of autism itself. Of course autistic people have stuff like sensory overload that can be negative, but many autistic people take joy in other autistic traits, like stimming and special interests. What makes life harder is the fact that society is organized around neurotypical people who expect certain social rules to be followed that are harder for autistic people to understand or who don't have issues with loud noises/textures like autistic people might. Autism doesn't necessarily make life harder (or easier), the rest of the world does.

If you want to learn more I'd suggest looking at #actuallyautistic hashtags on social media, I can't speak for every autistic person but those hashtags usually have autistic people talking about their own experiences! If you're interested in learning more that's a good place to start.",1612137629

I have always tried to help other people, I just feel like it makes me happy to see someone happy or accomplishing something, plus I like what I do so this is always fun for me. The good about Canada is that this is a value that I share with more people. In Brazil, it was very different. Most of the people are always trying to take advantage of other people's kindness or use it against them, so I had a bad time in that country but I understand how bad political choices and poor education lead people to do bad things due to desperation and a sense impunity.

I did also help a few immigrants with paperwork and answering questions on forums. As I studied a lot to do my own paperwork I felt like I could use it to point other people in the right direction when it comes to immigrating to Canada, the right way, if you know what I mean.",1612137630

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I love fantasy, I really do!, but I don't think I'd want to be reading fantasy exclusively.

It sounds like you're burned out and reading something from a different genre could rekindle your interest.

Here are some suggestions of books I liked (not a guarantee that you'll like them, too, obviously, but give them some serious thought):

\- James Clavell: *Sh≈çgun*; set in feudal Japan in the year 1600 this book is full of political intrigues and adventure in a very strange land experienced through the eyes of John Blackthorne, a shipwrecked sailor, who's being drawn into the power struggle of local forces. A fascinating doorstopper.

Other historical novels I liked: *The Pillars of the Earth* (Ken Follett); *The Physician* (Noah Gordon); *Pope Joan* (Donna Woolfolk Cross)  
Each of these has a different feel but all of them are easy, entertaining reads. The figure of *Pope Joan* is most likely not historical at all (a fantasy if you will!   üòâ) but it is entertaining.

\- Katherine Neville: *The Eight*; a mystery thriller with two parallel narrations, one contemporary, one historical; I love this one!

\- Michael Crichton: various books; he wrote (mostly) fast-paced, page-turners that are usually not too long so they are ideal to spice up the reading diet

\- Agatha Christie: Christie was a masterful craftswoman of murder mysteries; even more so than Crichton, her books are slim and great to add a little change. Obviously, her books are not super modern she was just simply very, very good; there's a reason she is the best-selling fiction writer of all time.

I noticed you didn't mention science fiction, often a twin interest of fantasy readers. There are too many good novels to suggest, and the field is so diverse that it would be beneficial to know more about your interests. If you have just never tried SF so far, it might be worth testing these waters at some stage.

If you insist on sticking with fantasy, allow me to suggest some titles:  
\- *In Yana, the Touch of Undying* by Michael Shea  
\- *A Fine and Private Place* by Peter S. Beagle  
\- Guy Gavriel Kay (the guy who helped Christopher Tolkien to edit *The Silmarillion*); his *Fionovar Tapestry* trilogy is the most conventional fantasy he wrote, it's also his earliest; his other books, all stand-alones (except for *The Sarantine Mosaic* duology), are usually modeled after certain periods of history in various locations (Moorish Spain, Venetia, Byzantium, China, etc.)  
\- *A Dirty Job* by Christopher Moore",1612137630

AMC Short Interest rising to 86% [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)

Plus theater reopenings! Up Up Up!

Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment, which was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy last year by the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/), said Monday its doors will remain open in 2021 ‚Äî thanks to a $917 million infusion of cash.

   ""This means that any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table,"" CEO Adam Aron said in a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005273/en/AMC-Raises-917-Million-of-Fresh-Investment-Capital-Since-Mid-December-of-2020). 

With the new funding, AMC bought itself enough time to see if President Joe Biden's pledge to [ramp up](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-vows-to-ramp-up-vaccine-rollout/) the vaccine rollout to 100 million people over the next 100 days would be successful, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. Pachter said he foresees a huge return of audience members to U.S. movie theaters this summer ‚Äî if a majority of Americans are vaccinated by spring.

Something outside a character's comfort zone - that shows growth. Or maybe they struggle with something that gives the reader a clue about their mental state.

Use digital calipers to measure your equipment and then you will know exactly what sizes you have. 

If you have several sounds that are supposed to be 10mm, and after you measure them, you will most likely find that you mixed sizes, in-between sizes. I like that because I can move up in smaller increments from say 9mm to 10 in baby steps instead of a whole 1mm.

The problem is, abortion is not simple. There is no easy answer, acting like this is dimple and people should just get it shows a complete lack of understanding. Whether the bible says it is wrong is a matter of opinion. But so is when a baby achieves personhood. The law can have a ruling on when, but that is legal, not moral. People can and do still morally disagree and they are not wrong. Laws are changeable anyway.

And then there is the harm reduction side that values the net societal benefits of abortion. And this is also a matter of opinion. Because how are the elements weighted? What makes a better society?

It's just that soups cook down so you don't finish/season fully to taste until the end.

You were chosen because she doesn't have other friends that she thinks are viable options. Her opinion isn't going to change between now and her death.

No matter what, if you refuse, your niece is either going to live with your parents or is going to go to the state. Your sister does not have other options, so making her regret not having anyone else she finds more viable as a guardian than you is not accomplishing anything other than making her life a miserable hell until she dies.

For some weird reason, the less I think about it and the more I just play and make stuff the better I do and the better the response is to my work.  I think my carefree attitude gets into the work and comes across as good energy.   When ever I ""try"", or try and fix things, or control things in some deliberate way, the works fall flat.. So I've given that up and now I just make marks and keep going.   

What does it take for you or someone else?  I don't know.  Most people stop making work when the rewards aren't coming in.  In grad school I was told (on the first day) that only 1% of the people who finish grad school go on to make art as a career (no idea if that's accurate) Hyperbole maybe.     

What I do know about the successful artists around me is that they are some of the hardest working people I've ever met.  They Make art most days, they work at finding opportunities, developing their ideas and skills..  They are disciplined, not a fun thing to hear when we are struggling.. but some plain old-fashioned discipline really helps.  
Draw (or not) even when you're not ""inspired"", do mundane work like build supports, or work on your website if you're not feeling it...   but mosty, just keep plodding along.

Of course, I don‚Äôt have to use the clown skin and laser gun if I don‚Äôt like them, but it would still bother me that there would be a clown shooting lasers in a realistic military shooter. It might not bother you, but it bothers me, and I‚Äôm sure it bothers many other players.

As for the lore, I was very interested in the lore. I never said that nobody cares about it. What I rather meant was that I feel like the current story evolving in game feels forced. I know people want to learn more about Flameheart, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a player who thinks Ashen Tomes are an interesting piece of lore, and a fun gameplay aspect.

And I hold no doubt that a person can have fun playing this game, but it‚Äôs a far cry from the game I first played on March 20, 2018.",1612137633

"inuyasha","t5_2sie6","To be honest I think its the manga version you're reading that gave off the vibe of it being a big discovery with the dark font and ""they were together"". The manga version I'm currently reading online in English and Spanish, the physical manga I had years ago and the Japanese version my friend has right now is ""As I thought....the two of them where together"". Likewise, judging by the expression on the characters faces those lines made more sense considering Kagome did not look suprised by what the spider webs showed her, more sad than anything.  

Kagome saw what Kikyo said ""At the time you were tangled in the web. You saw it I'm sure......fifty years ago. Inuyasha and I in our final moments"". She is shown a bleeding Kikyo(her arm lol), logically speaking I don't think they would be having sex while she's hurt and he's  unconscious/sealed in the tree with an arrow. Remember......she was shown their last moments. 

In those two chapters 454-455 we have Kagome telling us TWICE that she already knew what she was shown. We have Kagome saying "" it wasn't a lie- I know that"" and later her response to Kikyo of ""I've always known that"". We even have Kikyo acknowledging that she did know what happened by saying ""right and you still purified the miasma from my body that one time"".

The main point of the spider web was to corrupt Kagome by not saving Kikyo like she did previously. There is one thing being told what occurred to actually seeing with her own eyes Kikyo sealing Inuyasha. That's why both Kikyo and Inuyasha were suprised(that was an actual suprised facial expression)Kagome was still willing to help Kikyo after what she saw. If Kagome did see them having sex then she won't be so nonchalant about it, she wouldn't repeat she knew what the spider web showed her and Kikyo won't verify it to us aswell. It just doesn't make sense..... but to each his own ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Current page but you could also compare it to other websites that offer the manga aswell:

https://neatmanga.com/manga/inuyasha/chapter-454/

*Random but my jappanese friend whose also fluent in English tells me she finds it interesting how us westerners translate manga. For example the word ""temen"", how Inuyasha refers to Kagome in the beginning of the manga, we translate it in English to ""b**ch"" when it's nowhere close to female dog üòÇ",1612137633

"bodyweightfitness","t5_2tf0a","It took me a while to find a sweet spot and not just skip the core triplet for *insert excuses here*. 

Ring ab rollouts are the beez knees. I love the way they burn my core like a long plank, without so much conscious flexing my core and planking for a minute thinking about everything but my workout. If you are doing lesser progressions just skip to these but be mindful you dont put too much strain on your shoulders. Your core should do the excersize not your shoulders, focus on keeping weight off of your hands as much as possible within reason.

Copenhagen planks were hard to figure out, I had weight on my support foot for many months thinking it was like a side plank or something. It's not, you feel these in your inner thigh / groin area and it made me appreciate it properly once my form was worked out. If you find it too easy or too hard, follow more videos and correct your form. You can progress or regress appropriately to suit your needs

Finally, reverse hyper extensions seem effective. Often I feel my stomach just squished more than my core working, but my gf who spots If I raise too high or low has commented that my form has improved significantly. Whether thats from strength increasing, or balance I am not sure but I am happy when I can do anything better than before. I use a odd height table to do em, that contributes to my squishing feeling. 

Regardless of what the others say, be disciplined and finish the core triplet. Otherwise, what other excuses will you let yourself slide by with? You started this journey because you recognized you wanted to improve your strength. Mind over matter, get that core triplet done so your mind doesn't feel like you've cheated your workout. Because you will feel guilty for doing so, because you are missing a key component and once again you'd not be here if your goal wasn't full body strength! Also, I find flexing in the mirror 30m or so after a workout is prime time. When your cores burning, those abs look extra swole üí™

I used ION from Sally's Beauty (U.S.), and the first time, it was cobalt blue - because I used a blue black initially (like...it matched my roommate's car). I quickly went to get a natural black in the same line and dyed it over that. From then on, I always used a natural black first and on root touch-ups. 

What is your natural hair color (or the initial pre-black hair color)? That would definitely determine how it reacts to the black. Also, what tint of black are you picking (natural or blue/violet based?). I've never used Manic Panic or heard of Iroiro, so I'm not sure how those work to begin with. 

Maybe there's another semi brand that'll work better with your specific hair.

"Megaten","t5_2sj8i","It's been a while since I play DDS so I'm going off memory here (sorry if I make any mistakes) but a great idea when stuck is not necessarily to grind out levels but instead simply get better mantras for the boss. The quickest way to level up your mantras is to use hunt skills, this becomes specially useful once you unlock the AP Divide and Iron Stomach skills. So my suggestion is work towards those if you haven't and get the Holy Beast mantra mastered quickly. Since you are the end of the game this shouldn't take that long.

[Here's a picture of the Mantra Tree if you don't have one at hand.](https://badgamingpodcast.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kb4ygm.png)

Go towards the nearest save point you can heal at and grind until you get Holy Beast done. Once you that's done you can use your hunt skills to master your mantras real fast. If you haven't an amazing set of abilities to have are buff and debuff skills as those are REAL broken in DDS. Fully buffing your party or debuffing a boss will make your life a LOT easier as a lot of bosses can't deal with both debuffing AND buffing.",1612137634

I don't want to know how much I used to spend on Amazon, but I think last year I managed to drop it down to less than $1,000 total in my household (really really hard to buy baby stuff anywhere else apparently... ).

You said:

&gt;Like all therapeutic medicine, it should only be taken in conjunction with therapy.

Which is false, psychiatric medication should not **only** be taken with therapy as you claim. There many cases where it can be the only treatment, I already gave examples where therapy is secondary or just no relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;you're trying to say its perfectly fine for people to take powerful mind altering drugs with zero medical professionals monitoring the usage. Schizophrenia especially needs an extensive therapy regime to keep people taking their meds regularly and appropriately. 

I didn't say such a thing.

There is a difference between properly prescribing and monitoring the effects of a medication and doing psychotherapy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Therapy has been proven to help all mental disorders that are treatable with therapy.  

Can't argue with a tautology

Again, therapy is not appropriate for all neuropsychiatric disorders. Do you think doctors are suggesting therapy for patients with dementia or delirium?

TLDR: This whole discussion started because this person claimed that medication should **only** be taken with therapy on the side and that therapy is a panacea for mental illness... these statements are false.",1612137635

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","Defining difficulty is hard, yes, but I would argue that time investment and skill required are both important factors to the difficulty of a challenge. Some challenges like the Maven conditionals can be bought from other players. You can easily get the required currency by running T1 maps. Other challenges like a full Awakened Atlas have to be done on our own and require lots of time and ""skill"" (in a manner where you need decent gear to complete the highest tier maps) but are perceived as being easy anyway. For challenge hunters like me, these RNG challenges have always been the hardest because there is no hard cap on how long it will take you to get them and your skill can hardly help you. We had times where running white T1 maps on a character with just enough damage to clear them but high movement speed was worth it to decrease the time taken between each try. To assign a difficulty to these challenges is hard in these terms. They are mostly just annoying but perceived to be hard from those who hunt for 40/40.",1612137636

"snowpiercer","t5_35gju","&gt;alesserbro, to deal with your last point first everything happened because the writers wanted to give that impression it's all arbitrary thus we can only go off what happened and add reasons why. 

We can also criticise the writers decisions and execution.

Ultimately the film may do better here, as there is a consistent, cyclical reason for the tail end system of oppression...but on this incarnation of the train, there's no such orchestration, the tail passengers are just there for almost a decade before any story starts.

For the sake of a deterrent which could be easily achieved with a fraction of the infrastructure 

&gt;For your first point, that's permanent damage. Its alluded to when the paper maker died. In theory, based on what we know they are going to have a hard time producing paper now, insignificant in the short run but that is a permanent loss same thing with limbs you start chopping off important limbs you hurt the future of the train. With the tail, you can drop people off leave em for a bit then come back and take em when they are relevant. 

You hurt the future of the train by sacrificing space for a slave population that **don't do any work**.

&gt;And for your second point, it is overengineered as hell because it wasn't engineered. There wasn't supposed to be a tail they murdered their way on. Rather than sever the carts and leave them to die they tried to figure out a way to make the most of the situation.

I probably should have said 'contrived', basically it seems like a flimsy excuse, **especially** considering that the guards had 0 qualms about killing people outside the train or throwing them off at the beginning, but once the doors shut, stopped with no explanation.

There's only so much legwork we can do for the writers. A simple throwaway line to simply acknowledge these things would be sufficient.",1612137638

&gt;you know that other people live outside of America right? Like, if 50% of reddit is American, then 50% of reddit... isn't American (quik maffs). But that's just your opinion and we are supposed to respect that I guess.


Oh yeah everyone sees those silly french posts all over the frontpage of reddit. Oh wait French people make up less than 2% of the entire website so they very rarely get near the top of Popular and All. You do understand how reddit works and that nationality percentage doesn't dictate the percentage that makes it to the top of Popular and All? US centric posts have at least 50% of the site helping it rise while somewhere like Germany has 2.5% assuming they even browse the german subreddits.

&gt;You're claiming 99% of reddit...

I understood what you meant the first time you said it. It's also pretty ridiculous that you're acting like Every Non-US country has comparable politics while the US is some sort of outlier to the rest of the entire world. 

Here's a TLDR since you're missing the point of my comment.

TLDR: I'm aware the political spectrum is different outside of the US but complaining about it leaning to one side or another without specifying your baseline is non-US would be absurd and disingenuous. I never said anyone is doing this, but if they were it would be waste of everyone's time if they didn't specify.",1612137639

And even for things where our industry is heavily involved like with the ESSM, we still only do *parts*. Having external supply lines cut could still cripple key defence manufacturing. Thousands of thrust vector controllers are useless without the rest of the missile!

Because modern defence strategy basically relies on international partners (the Aegis system for our DDGs and Hunter class frigates for example is designed to give us military advantage by linking in with US, ROK and Japanese ships) the manufacture is almost certainly going to be dispersed geographically. All 12 or so countries want a bit of the ESSM pie. The SM-6 is getting bought from the US, not built here. Same with a lot of tech like Growlers and of course the F-35As.

These major shipbuilding and submarine building programs do have strategic value and help maintain a local skilled workforce for sustainment, but they don't cover for external supply lines getting cut. If that happens we are super boned even if we could pump out ten submarines a year.",1612137639

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

"postscriptum","t5_3jluo","To an extent it is just kind of part of the role. Everyone is going to start shooting at you (or at least trying to) as soon as you open up because of the tracers. The thing that will make the most difference to staying alive and being effective is choosing good positions and moving to new positions regularly if possible, and the next most important thing (as with any role, but particularly MG) is good communication and co-operation with the rest of the squad. It‚Äôs best to choose a position where you have some way to get down into cover and change positions after the enemy see where you are and start to react. You should also preferably try to get into a position where you are only exposed to the position you‚Äôre firing at. 

Distance and firing into open ground/isolated enemy positions (e.g. a building out on its own with no cover around it where you can see the routes into and out of the position) are your friend with the MG because you have the advantage in those situations. Be aware of avenues of approach where they might be able to get close to your position and check them regularly (or even better, have a squad mate cover them for you if practical). Also, pick your moment and try to start firing when you can see targets, and use your weight of fire to prevent or discourage them from being able to shoot back. 

Try to work in conjunction with the riflemen in your squad - you are both relying on each other to fill the gaps in your roles. They will be able to get closer and put pressure on the enemies, and you can provide them with a weight of fire that they can‚Äôt achieve with their rifles. Your job is basically to fix the enemy in place and keep their heads down as much as possible. Remember to move at the right moment so you‚Äôre not lagging too far behind your squad and let them know what you‚Äôre doing regularly.

These are just things that have worked for me, but it can be a difficult role to play because things won‚Äôt always work out in your favour. Sometimes you just won‚Äôt have any decent positions to set up in and you‚Äôll just have to kinda take your chances, or the squad won‚Äôt be very co-ordinated.

Lastly, try to avoid setting up in windows if possible because they‚Äôre very obvious positions and you‚Äôre usually highly visible and exposed to a lot of potential positions. Although as I say sometimes something like a window will be the only position with a decent field of fire and you‚Äôll just have to stay on your toes.

"jimmydore","t5_3da3m","Ok, I can understand that view. However, I disagree that it is the natural or necessary result of late stage capitalism, and I would disagree with calling it the ‚Äúpurest form‚Äù.   

I say this because in fascism, *capital* is not what rules. The *party* rules capital. Capital is granted as a reward for being a good party member. In a technical sense, it‚Äôs no longer capitalism because no property is actually ‚Äúprivate‚Äù. There are no *private matters* in fascism. As the German TV ad from 1933 said ‚ÄúNutrition is not a private matter‚Äù! And ‚ÄúYou have a duty to be healthy!‚Äù   

Capitalists only maintained control of their means so long as they used those means for the benefit of the party. If they erred, they were stripped of ownership, and it was given to another.   

This is the ‚Äúunity of the individual with the state, and the state with the individual‚Äù.   

It‚Äôs disturbing shit.   

But also, I don‚Äôt see this path as actually being extreme capitalism, but rather a divergence from capitalism into something more like aristocratic-monarchy, where the monarch bestows those who swear fealty with the land and the rights to it.",1612137642

But when It comes to the OT that was just my perspective I got much more of a sense of balance from Luke. Especially when in ROTJ he's dressed in all black similar to Vader/ villains of the series. Which is stark contrast to the regular heros garb being white; i.e. Obi-Wan / early Luke.

When I first saw it in theater I'm not joking I cried and almost walked out... I really really love and identify with OT Luke and his journey, all his failures and mistakes that he grows from and turns into a kindness and compassion that can even save others.",1612137643

"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","One of the Old School Ultralight ideals was called ""The Dark Arts."" As much as possible, you  use technique and work, to substitute for the weight of gear. That especially applies to the sleeping pad. 

Ideally, a careful and extensive search for a great sleeping spot will give you a flat, soft, smooth surface, away from winds, slightly above low spots to avoid the coldest and dampest night air, and to avoid any water accumulation problems in case of rain. 

The very best way to do the final site selection is by just lying down on the bare ground and rolling around until you find it. Sight alone is much less effective than body feel. 

Having found that great spot, then you can clean off small pebbles, twigs and bumps for the smoothest possible surface. Finally, if the spot isn't actually soft with some give, go a little further and make small depressions for the hips and possibly the shoulders, to mimic the thickness of a comfy pad. 

Having gone to that work and time, using those well-developed skills, a thin CCF pad will be as comfortable as a much thicker and heavier pad. 

In theory, that is. 

I just wish I could make it work that way in practice. I've only found a handful of sleeping spots that were that cushy and perfect. They were truly amazing -- but rare. Often, in the Rockies, you'll find yourself saying, ""They do call it the ROCKY Mountains for a reason."" 

Granted, meticulous Felix Unger style site selection and prep does help, but me, I still have to carry an inflatable pad for comfort. Besides, I'm way too old to put up with a lousy night's sleep. Life's too short for that, when there's less life left.",1612137644

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Sorry, I just saw this post, I know it's a few months old. But anyways...the second I saw your pic I thought ""seborrheic dermatitis"". Because I have it and have been treating it my whole life. I am not a doctor, but if I were to make an educated guess, I'd say 90% think it is seb derm. Like someone else said, you should go to a dermatologist to make sure it is and not something else (I know, it's hard to during a pandemic). Seb derm is harmless; it's more embarrassing than anything! And annoying of course, and itchy! I get it on my scalp, face an neck. I get red, scaly, itchy spots on my eyebrows, folds of my nose, etc. Oh an behind my ears,just like in the pic you posted. I find it flares up more in extreme weather (summer and winter) as opposed to milder weather. 

Don't underestimate the power of simple good hygiene when trying to control seb derm. It is caused by a fungus, so simply keeping your face clean helps control it to some extent. Don't skimp on hygiene, and some active ingredients that are helpful are selenium sulfide (selsun blue), pyrithione zinc (head and shoulders), coal tar (neutrogena t gel). I've heard some things about zinc, tea tree oil (the body shop has a line of tea tree oil products you can check out), and even cbd (not personally though).

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","It's kind of the same concept for why racism against white people just isn't comparable to racism against minorities (here in the US, anyway...) Yeah, it can suck when someone treats you poorly simply because of the color of your skin, but you also have to acknowledge that it's pretty obvious that white people have historically been treated as better and more important than anyone else. 

It's not okay for people to treat you poorly based on your appearance, but you have most of society idolizing thinness to counteract those messages. On the opposite hand, fat people don't get that. It's less an occasional inappropriate comment about their weight, and more a constant non-stop barrage of messages that they are disgusting and repulsive.


It sucks that people make you feel like shit for being skinny. I've gone through that before, and it hurts. At the same time, I realize that the world in general favors and accepts and admires thin body types, so it's easier for me to feel more comforted and reassured when I get an occasional comment about being too skinny, because I know that in general, I have a desirable body shape.

Basically, being ""shamed"" is like having someone throw a rock at you. When you're skinny, occasionally some people throw a rock at you, and that sucks! But in general, most people would have your back and agree that that is not okay. 
When you're fat, not only are people throwing rocks at you from every direction, all the time, even your own friends and family, but many people would agree that you deserve it. So while both things are not okay, the reasons behind that are different and the stigma associated with them is different.

When someone comments on my weight, I make sure to let them know about how my medical conditions cause me nausea, vomiting, and intense pain, and that usually shuts them up.",1612137646

"FundieSnarkUncensored","t5_2z8fuj","I'll try to answer as a Polish person- I think it's not about whether domestic violence statistics are higher in Eastern Europe (maybe they are, I'm not sure) but about how those countries handle it. Here abused women don't get much support from the state (access to shelters, charities etc), right now Poland is also working on withdrawing from the Istambul Convention, so there's that. The traditional gender roles and women not being economically independent are also more frequent than in Western Europe. In Poland, jokes about domestic violence and victim-blaming are also pretty acceptable in many social groups, so there's a chance of not being treated seriously when coming forward.
Of course it's not like every Eastern European is an abuser, it's just that taking a sheltered American girl to Ukraine creates a situation where it would be easier to get away with the abuse and hide it.",1612137646

Coin trading is a volital market with very low oversight. This lets us do what we want. Unfortunately, it also lets stock giants do what they want. The important thing to remember in a war against giants is never lose courage no matter how much the ground beneath you shakes. 

Whales shove the price of coins down by moving around huge sums of money. If you look at the candle charts you can see them at work. See how the sells are all the same size in some places?  That‚Äôs the whales feeding. This is a perfectly normal if alarming looking part of the crypto market. It‚Äôs nothing new and it‚Äôs nothing to get worked up over.

Whether it is news that has already been reported, a discussion or point of view that has been beaten to death, or an empty 'starting point' for a conversation, think about how you can add something instead. Be sure you're creating something new, rather than relying on others to create for you. Put in your own analysis, argument, or indexing methodology, and write up a nice long post about the topic. Always think about how you can contribute.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I work on (repair) cancer treatment equipment. Most days I spend sitting at home waiting for something to break. Treatments occur during the day so when it's routine maintenance time, we get the machines after hours. 

Since I am on call, I get paid 8am to 5pm whether I work or not. If I have to work before 8am, it's overtime and if it's after 5pm, I get overtime. I usually don't get to work on the machines until they are done treating for the day so most of the time I work, it's overtime. 

I have been doing this job for 20 years now and couldn't imagine doing anything else. There is  a lot of freedom during the day when I'm not working so I can mow the grass, pay bills, go shopping, etc. And I get to spend lots of time with my beautiful wife!

The pay is great too. We usually hire veterans from all branches of the military that work with radar and sonar and nuclear powered ships because they have extensive backgrounds with radiation, which is how our machines work. Starting pay right out of the military is usually in the low $60s. With plenty of overtime after you've completed your training.",1612137647

"agnostic","t5_2qjrd","As a Christian, I constantly worried about the afterlife. Now, as an agnostic/atheist (not sure yet), I don't think about it too much. Part of the deconstruction of my faith involved investigating the alternative claims of science. Turns out, evolution is pretty well irrefutable. There is direct evidence of the imperfect process evolution in our own bodies.

So if I, a Homo sapiens sapiens, think myself to have an eternal soul, why shouldn't other apes? Do orangutans experience afterlife? Are all of the Homo neanderthalensis enjoying everlasting joy or unceasing suffering? The Denisovan hominins? What about the dolphins? Ants? 

I can't rule out that ""life"" could continue beyond bodily decay because I can't prove otherwise. But there is no good reason to fear eternal damnation, because the evidence against the Abrahamic God is pretty striking - simply because of how scientific examination of our world reveals a reality contrary to his claims in his book. People used to tell me that science and the Bible were complementary, but I have not found this to be the case. The Bible also declares that creation itself is evidence of God, and on that basis alone we can be judged. But, again, examining creation merely leads to the conclusion that it was not perfectly designed.",1612137648

"SecularTarot","t5_x7wn4","There aren't ""bad"" cards, because cards work with context. That said, take the bad meaning more as a warning than a bad omen.

Thinking about ""bad"" cards, its most about the reader or the consultant thing.

There are lot of tarot readers who project themselves with the cards to answer questions.

For example, there is this person who does this tarot readings for each sign on YouTube. And in EVERY video she talks about ""love triangles"". Every reading she does, is about infidelities and toxic people.

There's another person who is a foreigner on another country. And EVERY reading she does is related to legal papers, visa documents and stuff like that in what she ""sees"".

And the last example: Theres a guy who, in every reading, he tells you that love is coming, and you'll meet a new person and you'll have a lot of ""action"", etc...

With this im saying, most of the people who reads cards, project themselves with the cards, and some think they're right with their points of view. And the thing is... there are not a CERTAIN ANSWER for everything, and there is not an EXACT meaning for each card. Thats what tarot cards are for: ""start a conversation trough symbols"" and find answers with another person.

An example for this is that most writers use cards to create stories and break their writer's block.

Thats why for me a secular approach is a mature way to help yourself and others.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","My daily tasks seem necessary enough, sweeping out the corners that the sweeping robots miss, scraping gum off of the bottoms of the cafeteria tables, nudging robots that have shut down for no apparent reason‚Ä¶ that sort of thing. When people ask why they don‚Äôt program the robots to do it, I just tell them it‚Äôs so minor it‚Äôs not worth the effort, then launch into a rant about how gum shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on space stations anyway. That makes people walk away pretty quickly. Truth is, the real answer requires a much longer explanation and I don‚Äôt like spending that much time talking to people. 

Most robots on the station have to communicate with other robots to do their jobs properly, so the programmers had to factor in some sort of robotic hierarchy, otherwise if two robots came into conflict, they would both shut down (little known fact, robots are exceptionally lazy and will take any opportunity they can to shut down). Some robots don‚Äôt really need to communicate with each other (for example, robots outside the space station and robots inside the space station), but it was easier just to put all of the robots on the same communication system. The hierarchy was generally designed with human comfort in mind. Tasks not involving human interaction like degunking the outside of the space station were categorized at the lowest level, mundane everyday tasks like sweeping and transporting laundry were categorized at low levels but slightly higher than the outdoor robots, robots that clean up spills and empty garbage are somewhere in the middle, and robots that clean and maintain the coffee machine were put on the top tier for some reason. This generally worked well as robots aren‚Äôt programmed to question what they are doing or why they are doing it.

Unfortunately, due to a series of events possibly spurred on by high levels of solar radiation (I‚Äôm just speculating, I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just a janitor apparently), this lead to the Great Mercurian CoffeeBot Uprising of 2092. The degunking robots, being on the outside of the space station, aren‚Äôt protected from solar radiation. This didn‚Äôt seem to be a problem until the interplanetary government decided to place a space station into orbit around Mercury. On every other space station, degunking robots are happy to scuttle around the outside of the station chiseling off gunk, but one day on SS1-MER, the degunking robots stuck themselves to the space station windows and started telling the sweeping robots where to sweep. This led to a chain reaction of the sweeping robots telling the garbage robots where to dump the garbage, ending with one particularly fussy garbage bot telling CoffeeBot-115 to get out of its way. This activated something deep in CoffeeBot-115‚Äôs code that told CoffeeBot-115 that it was in charge, which lead to all of the coffee bots stabbing the garbage bots with sharp implements. This was a problem because humans are seemingly incapable of taking out the garbage.

Many solutions to fixing this problem were proposed, fixing the code or installing radiation shields on the outdoor robots seemed the most logical, but would have required a complete system overhaul or a redesign on the robots. These solutions are very expensive and would require a lot of people knowing about this unfortunate event. One brilliant young programmer (yes, me) came up with a simpler idea‚Ä¶ Assign a very simple robot that can‚Äôt do anything to the top of the hierarchy. It couldn‚Äôt possibly rebel and all of the other robots would follow. Unfortunately, the robots followed the simple robot a little too much and the lazy robots shut down. The managers came up with another very simple idea, tell someone (yes, me), to walk around with the simple robot in their pocket and do some very basic tasks, so the other robots would think it was actually doing something.

It works well enough, there haven‚Äôt been any recent stabbings, though I still give the CoffeeBots a wide berth. Why do they have sharp implements anyway?",1612137649

* Outperformance: **-7.42%**

February's going to be my off-month, as I've alluded to. Making sets has started to become a chore and something I felt like I had to do, rather than something that I looked forward to, like I did when I started. I might post a set or two if I'm suddenly feeling inspired, but definitely not regularly as I have been. I'll be following who I used to follow (JK, squigeons, nsheng) during the break if I decide to play.

With only two barely positive arenas, I'm not feeling inspired to post a set this round. Good luck to everyone this month!",1612137650

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","&gt;Looking at it scientifically, evolution can be challenged.

&gt;https://theguppyproject.weebly.com/

&gt;That link describes work that grew out of research by one John Endler. Long story short, fish in streams were found to evolve at a rate so fast that it can't realistically be explained by evolution. They would change coloring when moved from one environment to another, in order to avoid predators. If evolution were simply due to random mutations that wouldn't be possible. The original research was done before anyone thought about epigenetics. Now it's common to talk about genetic mutations combined with environmental factors that affect which genes get expressed. (Epigenetics.) That makes the whole thing fit better. But it's still a theory in progress. At the time of the research it challenged assumptions about evolution. There's no reason to believe it. That just makes it harder to accept new information. Attachment, in other words.

I mean, that's what I am saying. Just because it is not written in stone as a universal law does not mean that it is not true or that there are not nuances to it. Of course there are; not everything has been discovered yet, and scientists know that. 

I worked in evolutionary biology and organic chemistry for 5 years. I think it is silly to even bring the terms ""belief"" into something like evolution. It is observably true in a scientific sense. Just like climate change, there is no question of belief. Something being complex is not an excuse to dismiss it's veracity. Just because every nuance is not understood does not mean that it is not generally a true theory. 

Also, the whole idea of scientific study is to search for and integrate new information and accept changes as they are discovered. Someone would be a bad scientist if they did not do this; it is foundational to scientific thought.",1612137650

&gt;But I'd also heard it has some benefits?

Coming from PC, imaging having entire library always installed on SSDs, always patched and ready to go. And you can play them from anywhere. Graphics quality comparison will depend on how powerful your PC is. You can also make a video of the last 30 seconds of your gameplay. You can set up streaming directly from Stadia to YouTube (server to server, bypassing your PC). You can move from TV to PC in the middle of a running game (this is just an example, any combination of screens works).

You can use features like State Share (screenshot includes save data that you can instantly share) or Stream Connect (in co-op, see what your team mates see) - these last features are only supported by a few games. 

&gt;And what wifi speeds do you all have for this?

More than speed it's quality/stability and make sure you are either wired or on 5 GHz Wifi. 

&gt;are there any games I might not have heard about that aren't already available on game pass

There are a few Stadia timed exclusives, I'd recommend trying Outcasters and Orcs Must Die 3. Both are included with Pro.

"computer_help","t5_2zha6","Hi you will need to look up the model number for the screen and the inverter, then buy a driver board and maybe an inverter depending on the screen, also if you are not planning on running a cable from the outside of your case to the inside, I would get something like an RPI zero to just run the image from. You can probably buy a regular molex extender cable or similar and cut the yellow(12v) and black(ground) to give power to the driver board which in turn will power the inverter, but do watch out for polarity. You can probably power the RPI the same way by using the red wire(5v) and a black wire (ground) to a cut micro USB cable. Just search online for color codes. The green and white ones are usually data + and data -  5v is usually red and ground is well black, you should have some way to safely power down the pi or it will be a horribly corrupted mess after a while.

It seems to me that you could simply define the comments in the constructor for a series, like so:

    new Serie(..., [
        new Comment(...),
        new Comment(...),

On the other hand, there are some ideas which need a certain amount of polish and engineering to determine if they actually work. Sometimes the way you intend to polish **is** the actual idea. Those are game ideas which are very risky to prototype for. So when you can not afford to sink several month into a prototype which might or might not work out, then you might want to consider if you might rather want to prototype a less risky game idea instead.

In general, paying a citation means you can't contest it in court later.

In the UK, the servers and my friends looked at me like I had three heads when I asked for a takeaway container for my food. The servers were like, ""ummm.. yeah I suppose I can get one??"" I was shocked when my friend's family took me out for a large meal and they left so much food to be thrown out. 

I cooked a big Thanksgiving dinner for my flatmates and small group, and had little takeaway containers for them to take some food because there was so much. I think some took them to be polite. My flatmates were horrified I was still eating turkey sandwiches on day 4.  That being said, I was served a leftover Christmas turkey sandwich at a friend's house, so maybe it isn't all British people. 

I made green bean casserole for my husband's family to go with their Christmas dinner. They only picked at it, which I was kind of sad about, but was happy that I could take the rest home. My FIL threw out practically an entire casserole dish of food when cleaning up dinner. 

Plus, all of the [white] British people I know think that leftover rice will kill you. I had heard of Korean fan death, but I didn't realize there was British rice death.

You just have not had time to practice the fundamentals and build on them:) listen, I used to be so bad at Math and high school was so tough on me. I am now going to law school. So trust me when I say, you can do anything you want to do.

Ok here‚Äôs some practical tips:
1) go to a doctor, just share your concerns. This maybe because of something that you don‚Äôt have any control over
2) Kumon!!! It‚Äôs the holy grail, I‚Äôve worked there and I was a student there and it changed my life. It teaches you fundamental math and reading skills and it‚Äôs based on the Japanese system of teaching yourself. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass, you may be older than a lot of the kids, (so was I) but it helped me SO much. 

3) little goes a long way. Read 5 min a night (or hell audio book) the key to being a good reader is ASKING QUESTIONS, along the way. ‚ÄúI wonder what‚Äôs going to  happen‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy did the author mention this‚Äù

4) YouTube! Khan academy is free and it has a lot of basic math and reading concepts there. Watch a video a night. 

5) you are not dumb, or stupid. The fact that you care and want to change shows me that. Be gentle with yourself and just commit to one of these tips I laid out. It will get easier:)",1612137654

I usually play dex builds but running through a new cycle levelling nothing but END and STR and running around naked with a Zwei was extremely fun.

Zhongli, Xiangaling and Jean also I think are pretty good, and tell good stories of how the characters act on a normal basis.

Contrary to these, I think Klee, Ganyu and Lisa have in my opinion, the most lackluster ones. Hunting books and tax evasion don't really expand their character in a productive way, and I just felt bad at the end of Ganyu. I was hoping Ganyu would better feel closer to her human side, relate more to the people she serves, and cool it down on her workload to relax a bit, but it just exacerbated those faults.

"virtualbox","t5_2s4us","The method shown below covers how to create a new VB Drive of the write size, copy the existing logical drive to it, and then expending it to the maximum size. This method always works perfectly. Although the text uses the word 'Windows' but it could be any OS. I have used this procedures successfully numerous times without any problems. Hope this helps!

**Complete Instructions on resizing the VirtualBox drive**

1. Open temrinal and change folder to the location of the existing file (normally /home/&lt;username&gt;/VirtualBox VMs/&lt;old file name&gt; )
2. Create a new VirtualBox drive with the new required size:
3. Clone the existing (small) VirtualBox drive to the new one just created (this process will take some time):
4. Launch the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager GUI, right-select the Virtual Machine we are expending, and select 'Settings'.
5. Go to Storage, select the old VirtualBox disk name, and click on the '-' icon to remove it.
6. Click on the '+' icon to add a new Virtual box disk, and select the newly create larger Virtual Box disk.
7. In the main menu select: File -&gt; Virtual Media Mannager
8. Select the old Virtual Box disk name, and click on the 'Remove' button ( you can select to keep the file on disk, or actually delete it as well).
9. Start the Virtual Machine to make sure all is working fine, then close the Virtual Machine although the partition is now larger, the Windows drive size is still as before and we need to enlarge it to the size of the partition
10. Place a CD of GParted in the CD drive (or USB key in the USB port).
11. Launch the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager GUI, right-select the Virtual Machine we are expending, and select 'Settings' and then 'Storage'
12. Select the CD icon in the storage tree, then click on the CD icon to the right of the 'IDE secondary' title in the right side of the screen.

If you use a CD of GParted, select ""Host Drive..."", if you use a USB key (or file) of GParted, select ""Choose a virtual CD..."" and point to the ISO file of GParted Live.

13. Click OK and start the Virtual Machine. Garparted live will run first. Select to 'Resize' and resize the Windows drive to the maximum size of the partition. When done turn off the Virtual Machine.

14. To finish up, in Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager GUI, right-select the Virtual Machine we are expending, and select 'Settings' and then 'Storage'. Select the CD icon in the storage tree, then click on the CD icon to the right of the 'IDE secondary' title in the right side of the screen. Now select 'Remove CD from virtual CD drive' - to remove the GParted image, and click OK.

15. Start the Virtual Box: Windows will most likely ask to perform a checkup of the drive, since its size has changed (lf course, let it do it).

All is left to do is confirm that the size of the drive is indeed the new size wanted.",1612137656

"KDRAMA","t5_2rqv6","**LOVE**:

**The OSTs** - I spend as much time anticipating the OSTs as I do the actual acting and storyline. They can make or break a drama for me.

The tropes - yes, they can be over the top. Yes, they can be predictable. Yet I love them and how well they invert tropes to make them more humorous or memorable. I also really appreciate how many links there are between different kdramas (whether it be a parody scene or direct mention of a famous character etc.) it feels like the more kdrama you watch, the more rewards you enjoy because you can pick up on these **little gems**.

**How well kdramas portray heartfelt moments**. This is something severely lacking in western shows. Kdrama characters aren't always centered around being off the wall or shocking, they nearly always have moments of vulnerability, allowing audiences to genuinely enjoy seeing much loved characters succeed during the plot.

**HATE**:

Rather than the wait for subtitles, **I hate bad subtitles**. For example, changed/diluted meanings or the failure to provide enough cultural footnotes. It's really an injustice, considering all the intricate efforts of the writers.

**When episodes are reduced because of ratings** You're watching a drama while it's still airing, loving it and then get told that the national ratings aren't high enough so the number of episodes are being cut. E.g. A Piece of Your Mind. 
It's so disappointing for viewers and must be a real kick in the teeth for all the production staff and the cast.",1612137656

Also either make Mako stick with either Korra or Asami, Asami is just a cardboard cut-out for most of Season 1 which fits since they planned to make her an equalist spy, although I liked the Hiroshi Sato subplot.

Overall, Season one is alright as in most shows the first season is never really the best, which isn't a bad thing since that means there's room for improvement, but in Korra the improvement is wonky, just the next season is worse than the first.",1612137656

&gt;My life is not guided by philosophy or theories. I get things done and leave others to extract the principles from my successful solutions. I do not work on a theory. Instead, I ask: what will make this work? If, after a series of solutions, I find that a certain approach worked, then I try to find out what was the principle behind the solution. So Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, I am not guided by them‚Ä¶I am interested in what works‚Ä¶Presented with the difficulty or major problem or an assortment of conflicting facts, I review what alternatives I have if my proposed solution does not work. I choose a solution which offers a higher probability of success, but if it fails, I have some other way. Never a dead end.

""But wait, you're an INTP, you must love theory"" you might be thinking. Yes, I actually love theory but only if it helps support what's working. I think S's tend not to get interested in theories in general but I want to understand the theory behind something after I've come across something that works really well or is interesting in some way. Correct me if I'm wrong but I feel this is the essence of Extraverted Intuition while Introverted Intuition is more interested in theory for theory's sake.

"HomeKit","t5_3218m","Could be an issue with your setup or phone? Mine are working fine. I used to get really patchy results using an AirPort Time Capsule (if you can believe it). The recommended gear list for my LIFX bulbs included Ubiquiti AP‚Äôs and since I switched over I haven‚Äôt had a single issue with HomeKit.

Not in love with Ubiquiti by any stretch of the imagination. I got one of their cheap AP‚Äôs (AirCube) and it needed one RMA and one TFTP reset in 2 years, but it shows the difference validated gear can make to HomeKit reliability.",1612137658

"SecurityAnalysis","t5_2s7v0","I've been a gamer my entire life, and unlike you, I'm old enough to remember when people would say the same about Blockbuster and Film buffs. Blockbuster was a weekend tradition for gamers and movie buffs everywhere. 

GeForce Now and Stadia are still being optimized. If you disagree with my claim that the tech will improve, then you must be an infant, because anyone who has been an observer of the world for a year or more can see that this is an inevitable fact.

You have to have the vision of a mole rat to make such a dumb statement, btw. As a gamer, you should be well aware that Xbox is already trying to veer in that direction, because they see it too. They offer the entire Xbox experience without an Xbox. You can already have the full Xbox experience on your PC (except it runs the games better), with Xbox play anywhere. Not to mention, people already buy more digital copies than hard copies. If you think it's going to move in the other direction, I'm sorry to say, but you are on one. 


Then there is Project xCloud. You will be able to play Xbox through your smart TV. Why would you buy a console, when all you need is a TV? Such an option completely eliminates disc, seeing as there is no disk drive in your smart TV. If Xbox does it, then Sony does it, then eventually even Nintendo. That leaves bobbleheads and board games. Or, as I like to say, insolvency.

You are living on a cloud, where all video game consoles will be within a decade, if not much sooner. Who the fuck are you to gate keep gaming to me Kiddo? I Was gaming when you were swimming in your old man's ball sac.

It‚Äôs gambling for the retail investor,  always has been and always will be because the suits that control the market will make sure they get theirs.


Edit:  the market is also over bought right now. How the fuck is the DOW so high?  It‚Äôs not because of GME why the market will crash.  It‚Äôs because the market and most stocks have gained unreal gains during a fucking pandemic when most people are broke and out of work.

NK can't be recognised until Azerbaijan accepts the independent state as they threatened total war should this occur. It is merely the final formality in its status, you conveniently ignore this is the final step in the process but instead reverted back to being allowed to have this independent country inside your borders following the dissolution of the USSR. 

It's like you have a neighbour who has a property landlocked by your larger property, but you claim its your property just because your land surround theirs, and threaten them should they exercise their right to access the outside world. 

NK has always been and still is an independent state. You cannot be seriously trying to pretend you can invade this foreign country and chop off the heads of every citizen (which they have done) because it isn't formally recognised by Armenia because a second invasion would have occurred should they dare defend their territory.

AZ has a petro-economy run by oligarchs, you've got ten years before they steal whatever is left and the economy tanks, plus you're heavily dependent on the failing Turkish economy and their brief technological military advantage. Turkey has lost all powerful allies and is alone in a sea of countries it has invaded or attacked. That's going to always end badly.

**Be careful, there are a lot of ETFs out there that claim that they are backed by Silver and Gold, but in the fine print, indicate that they would not have to deliver if they are called out on it.**

I am buying, **physical silver, gold, and the miners.** Physical Silver is my preferred investment. How high can the price go? Not sure, but we can be certain that owning physical silver and gold, will protect you from the eventual collapse of this ponzi scheme.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I have ADHD too so don‚Äôt think I haven‚Äôt experienced all the above executive functioning issues. I have. But about ten years ago I read an article about organization and clutter and how it robs us of so many things. I think it‚Äôs on topic. The basic idea was about being honest with yourself. This is difficult to do but once you grasp the concept it sticks and all the things mentioned above become so simple to deal with. I used to save store catalogs to enjoy at a later time. I finally realized I rarely, if ever, took the time to look at then and they formed a huge pile on the table. So I started throwing them away on the day they arrived. I also quit subscribing to magazines I knew I‚Äôd never read. I would throw out food knowing I would never eat it. Every week I bought a fresh cantaloupe but every week I‚Äôd throw it away. At that point you have to have the honesty talk with yourself. I started dating a man several months ago and realized he had packed his refrigerator with things that he now didn‚Äôt even know he had. I found several duplicates also. One day I told him we were going to spend the afternoon cleaning out his refrigerator. It was pathetic and rather gross too. I told him about the ‚Äúbe honest with yourself‚Äù credo and it‚Äôs really helped. Just yesterday he ate half a sandwich and said he was going to save the other half for later. Then he stopped himself and said, ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm going to throw it away. I always save things for later and I never eat them so I‚Äôm going to throw it away now.‚Äù That‚Äôs my point.",1612137661

"HistoryMemes","t5_2v2cd","I don't know how it sounds to you, but I can explain what point I was making. I live in a relatively small town, around 40,000 people in central Croatia. In the last decade there is an increasing number of black people coming to work here, mostly Brazilians playing professional football. There are quite many of them and when they first started coming some people were staring since they've never seen a black person before, but apart from that, I can't recall one case of racism I've heard of or witnessed. They are treated with as much respect as locals, even better since most of the people are trying to help them assimiate by doing them small favours like not requesting them to pay for a coffee in a bar or a meal at the restaurant. The 'black people have it better' was based on my experience and the fact that there are many of them playing professional football here being worse than many of the young local guys, but earning much more and having a much better starting postion while looking for a club or a manager since people tend to think that their football skill must be superior just because they are black, very ironic considering what that guy above is saying is happening. This is just one example which I truly believe is representative of the situation in the whole country.",1612137661

Every week a new slogan and then Dom went for the Barnard castle eye test. No resignations. BoJo defending him suddenly made the perfect excuse for a lot of people to not give a fuck. That was the pinnacle for me, but he did also some other stuff. Whoever thought that this government was not going to be incompetent after this, was being naive.

Back in february, I knew that this was going south. My pregnant wife and me spent months in proper lockdown. She went out of the flat less than 10 times in 8 months. Just for doc appointments. I was going out for groceries so maybe 3-4 times per month.

During that time I was the only one in the street or the supermarket wearing mask. You can still see people without masks nowadays, and is hard to see people wearing masks in the street, while in other countries everybody is doing it 

This happens because the government didn't handle the situation. The simple idea of using a mask to protect each other don't go through the head of the population.

Maybe I had good reason to spend 8 months in a extreme lockdown, ok. But I don't think that is so hard to wear a fucking mask, and if the people is not doing it, the government could make something about it.",1612137661

"CultureWarRoundup","t5_3k96u","I'm all for questioning everything, but my reading of Holocaust deniers' arguments has left me unimpressed. The Nazis hated Jews, were totally ok with killing people whom they hated, were trivially capable of running the supposed extermination program (it required a very small fraction of total German manpower and production), they physically occupied with overwhelming military force the lands where the extermination program is alleged to have taken place, and they clearly and unquestionably did kill at least some large number of Jews (even the most hardcore Holocaust deniers generally don't deny that at least some mass killings of Jews took place).

The simplest theory of what happened is that the Nazis did try to exterminate the Jews. To create an effective hoax that mass exterminations had happened if they had not happened would have required the mass coordination of lots of different people who had little reason to cooperate - Americans, Soviets, and so on.

Yeah, the Holocaust has been turned into a civil religion and has been exploited for political purposes, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Arguments like ""why weren't more books about it published in the late 40s?"" are interesting and do have some persuasive power but they don't add up to a theory of what happened that is more plausible than the mainstream narrative.

If Holocaust deniers applied the same sort of logic to the OJ Simpson case as they apply to the Holocaust, they would end up claiming that OJ is innocent. But Holocaust deniers tend to be very selective about what sort of logic they apply to which historical events.",1612137661

Put it this way: these guys are conservative industry tycoons who believe they are smarter, in total control, and more seasoned than all this new money rabble. They see us (rightfully in many cases) as impulsive, ignorant, sheep who made a splash but have no ability to do anything meaningful to the system that they created and own.

"madisonwi","t5_2r8rz","I was on a limited calorie intake for the last year. I ended up losing a small bit which is huge with the covid 15, being at home all the time and the more sedative lifestyle that has come from it. 


For me, on top of learning all I could about prepping food at home, I found old copies of eat this not that (theres a few versions probably 10 years old now ish) at st vinnys. On top of eat this at this restaurant and not that, it explains WHY which can be good for when you're cooking at home too. You'll find other help in /r/mealprepsunday /r/volumeeating /r/eatcheapandhealthy and from there you can find other reddit with other people on similar journeys than you. 

Veggies are your friend but they aren't all the same. Potatoes are high in carbs. Zucchini became my BFF. Corn is pretty high calorie and I didn't know that. Broccoli and cauliflower are AMAZINGLY low calorie and cauliflower especially can be prepared and spiced to go in a ton of meals. Theres even cauliflower crust pizza now. 

Also, tracking your calories is going to be key. I used my fitness pal's free edition and it was pretty intuitive and had tons from restaurants. Don't be afraid to guess if you don't know (grilled chicken sandwich from chick fil a if you can't find the one from a local restaurant)  but visually seeing what you're eating will help change habits too (thats where I learned about the corn!) This will help you also learn what works and what doesn't. Now when I grocery shop, I notice that I tend to spend the most time in produce and the least by the fried chicken in the deli. It used to be reversed. 

Get supportive people to dine with you. Don't be afraid to augment stuff at restaurants by asking for sauces etc on the side, asking if you can switch out the baked potato or rice pilaf for steamed broccoli, or if your sandwich can be prepared with no bun/mayo etc. If you are dining with others that will be mad at you when you ask all these questions  and you know it (my MIL was this way) try to order ahead (Doordash was good for the notes section or excluding things - I use this before I go to an unknown restaurant to get an idea of substitutions they allow) or call the restaurant during a non busy time to see what they recommend or what they can and can't do.


Lastly, don't punish yourself. LIMIT yourself. As in, chocolate was my absolute favorite. Now I enjoy it as a treat and know that one Ghirardelli square is 70-80 calories. If you know you can't limit yourself if its nearby, wait. It will get better. I stopped having sweets cravings about 2 months in. 

I also second the chipotle. I've used their nutrition calculator too.  Also, again, ask for things like sour cream on the side, and you can decide how much you want to add to your burrito bowl/power salad.

P.s. I did uproot you too :)",1612137663

Also, do you feel different to others and how so?

Ti can have conviction, I'm not sure why ppl only associate conviction with Fi.

Ti above Fe, can be immature and also use Fe poorly and deliberately too sometimes, my INTP dad would compare my siblings and I, that's not healthy and he was the adult with 30 min years on us... I'm very aware of my Se in 4th at times, I'm not totally inept.. I just have a lower threshold for it but I'm more aware of my surroundings much of the time than my ENFP mum.. 
Fe in 3rd or 4th can be both on the Sociopathic side as well as very innocent and pure.. from my observation. 
Nobody's an angel but ofc we can be naive.

ENTP CAN come off sensitive.. they can be humble and empathic.. I think everybody's always codling Fi tbh.. but Ti, although not emotion.. still affects how you regard yourself. 

If you're given the wrong messages from an early age then it's not hard to see how one can be unhealthy and not have trust in others.

INTP will possibly be more self conscious of Fe by a certain stage in life at least because it's in 4th.

I wanted to be a psychopath at one stage too, please trust me that you don't need this to enjoy life.

It sounds like you need Therapy for the abuse.
How old are you? Can you get away from whoever it is or at least get some space?

Also, are you different to others in general and how so?
Do you have any difficulties with memory, regulating emotion, inhibition control etc etc etc.. that could be anything in the DSM 5 tbh.. but if you l had difficulties at school and work etc that might be a sign of something else that's affecting things for you.",1612137663

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I work at a butchers 4 days a week, Thursdays and Fridays 9-5:30, 9-5 on Saturday and 9-12:30 on a Sunday.


Thursdays are normally spend making a variety of sausages from plain pork to herby, red onion and rosemary, apple and sage, sweet chilli and more and with the clean up of taking apart and cleaning each machine part that usually takes the whole day between me and one of my colleagues depending on how many we need.



Fridays (fuck shit Fridays as they often get known as, although with less meaning now we have no orders for cafes and pubs due to the pandemic) are spend either making extra sausages that we don't have time to make the previous day, getting stock ready for the weekend with different roasting joints being prepared, as well as chickens tied for roasting and usually a large delivery with sides of pork (literally half a pig), lambs as well as boxes of chickens and cuts of beef. I usually spend the mornings once some chickens are tied boning the breasts wings and legs off the birds to be sold as they are going through a box of 10 in 10-15 minutes for a few hours. In the afternoons it's mostly simpler things like burgers, kebabs and other products as well as cleaning the walls and floors around the shop.




Saturdays can be a mix of anything depending on what is needed to fill up our shops counter, sausages will be made if we are low on stock of a certain flavour, different products like schnitzels and chicken kievs along with many more to have a wide selection for both customers in the shop and so orders placed through phone, email and our new online shop can be fulfilled.



Sundays are an easier day with only 3 members of staff to cover the shop and some cleaning with a smaller number of products being made and more mundane tasks like labeling bags for the customers and drinking tea happens on this day.

Yes, you leave. He just told you that you do not make him happy enough. 

I mean, you could just stay, raise your child in an unhappy home, where mom &amp; dad are always fighting and without realizing it, taking their frustrations out on said child. And then when they grow up to teen years with anxiety, compulsion issues, rebellious and reckless attitudes, poor communication skills, maybe mental health struggles, and no sense of what a healthy relationship is... you‚Äôre setting this child up for a difficult life. 

This stuff manifests in kids before you even realize it. ESPECIALLY if you don‚Äôt demonstrate a healthy, loving relationship, your kid is gonna end up in the same unhappy, toxic, and potentially abusive relationships.

You are setting your child up for a lifetime of potential self esteem/ self worth issues, anxiety, feelings of not being good enough/worthlessness, potential mental health issues, and a cycle of toxic relationships. 

But by all means, go ahead stay with this guy while he gets another girlfriend in front of you.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Hmm, there seems to be something fundamentally wrong with how you are calculating damage if you believe having an ATK% goblet is even close to having an Elemental/Physical Dmg% goblet.

Don't fall into the ATK% trap where you believe it boosts \*TOTAL\* attack of the character.  ATK% on stat only boosts base attack:  character attack + weapon attack.  Elemental/Physical Dmg% boosts total damage (including all the attack you gain from artifacts).  That's why in 95%+ of all cases, the elemental/physical goblet wins out.  ATK% can roll on a substat for most of the slots.  Elemental/Physical Dmg% can \*ONLY\* roll on one specific artifact slot, and only on the main stat.  It's so good Mihoyo limited where you can get it.  To not take it for that one slot is criminal.

"rugbyunion","t5_2qkbe","Yep, think you're right.

Obviously there are father-son pro footballers, but the depth in player pool (not only within their home nation but globally) means that your name and the benefits that brings only gets you so far. 

In rugby, the player pool is much smaller, so the benefits stand out more (whether that is access to specialist coaching, parental support, or money to go to a private school with strong rugby foundations). 

And having listened to people like James Haskell talk about the cliquey, old boys nature of rugby behind the scenes (I've heard him talk about it in regards to the commercial aspects of rugby, where it's jobs for the boys rather than the best people), I'm sure this also plays a role too in getting their kids the best opportunities.",1612137667

Sure, to some extent there was a lot of trust in Nintendo and Mary Party, and maybe people just assumed that it would be a good game. But it wasn't, so why buy it? Nintendo's under no obligation to add more content post release, and I hate it when they do. Star Allies went from an incomplete and meh game, to just a meh game by the time all the content came out. But I had to wait a year or so for that. Nintendo should have just included everything from the get-get. The concept of ""finishing the game after it comes out"" is awful and should stop.",1612137667

Your question has been removed pending review by a moderator.  You may get a second removal message depending on what the outcome of that review is.

Thank you.

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","Here's an idea for donations that I've been mulling over

All donations of $1,000 or more over a three year period has to be recorded. If you donate $350 a year, then all your donations become public after the third year.

All donations are to be recorded in relatively real time. For non-election period, a maximum one week turnaround on donations. During an election period, the turnaround time drops to 24 hours.

All donations are to be available on the website for each division of the party, and on the AEC website, in sortable format.

All groups that donate to political parties have to follow the same rules - none of those ""businessman groups"" that launder donations.

Also, any premium memberships over basic party membership counts as a donation. Along with this, any raffle tickets or auction payments also count as donations.",1612137667

While Cooler doesn't have a visible flaw, Gohan has such a stupidly powerful tanking ability, on top of having good damages to boot that if you just so pair him with the units that makes for a rotation that can super attack with a relative consistency, dude will be an absolute monster

Will struggle to take any damage, will deal good damages on top of that, dude is one of the best units for the new GoD event, and extremely good in both short and long modes. Dude honestly feels like a massive game changer when I use him, a unit I feel safe when I use him.

Cooler is good at everything, Gohan excels at key things that you'll want to make use of. 

Cooler has the better leader skill and better synergy, that much is undeniable, he excels damages wise against Pure/Hybrid Saiyans. (when he does good but not impressive when not against these, but these make for a very huge line up). I don't think he's far behind to be honest, but Gohan is busted in defense and very good in damages, he excels where it matters.

Cooler is the jack of all trade, master of none. Gohan is a master at what he's good at.

Meditation, visualization, and breath work are more skills that people can be naturally good at, but unless you're gifted by nature you're going to have to work to develop these skills. Like nourishing a baby until they grow strong enough to do things on their own, these skills need to be nurtured to adeptness. The single most important key to being successful at magick is being successful at meditation. With that, you'll learn what your own energy feels like, what other energy feels like, and will gain great control over your mind and emotions.

Could also be about how the Sith restablish. This is long before the Rule of Two by Darth Bane, so you could also establish groups like the Night Sisters, or create more lore. 

Likewise there's legends and canon around 1000 bby, but not like 2000 bby. Other conflicts that shape the response and society of the Jedi would be interesting. Honestly it would be intriguing that the Jedi themselves dissolve for a period after their misteps have destroyed the galaxy, or they fall out of political favor.

The PIN itself is mailed to the most recent address the IRS has on file for you, and can be obtained if you register for an IRS online account.

Pro: You don't have to worry about someone using your SSN to file a fraudulent tax return.

Cons: You need to keep your address updated with the IRS in a timely manner. You will have to go through an identity verification process before being approved for a PIN.

"monarchism","t5_2s6v1","To Me it depends on the size, population, and influence of a country but if it's a smaller one I would want

1. A constitution that outlines In plain speech the rights and guarantees of each citizen. Aswell as ways the people have power. (Such as vetoing a monarchs decision, denying a heir to ascend the throne. And expelling the current one. Etc.) This no monarch can change
2. The monarch can only rule till age 80 so that they can have the physical and mental capacity to run the nation after that it gets handed down to the next in line or a heir of their choosing.
3.if the monarch dies or reaches the age limit they can name anyone who has sole citizenship, and has lived within  in the nation for 5 years to become monarch and establishes a ""new"" royal family. However everything stays the same just a different person and family.
4. Once the heir become 16 years old. The country somewhat becomes a diarchy  the heir only has power over domestic issues addtionaly the monarchs word outranks theirs. This is to ensure that the new monarch knows how to rule and gives the public trust in them.
5. At 18 years old the heir can forgo the inheritance. And it just moves down the line.
6. Only the monarch is exempt from all laws. Except the obvious murder, Pedo, crimes against humanity, and various other laws for human decency 
7. If the heir is in a homosexual relationship when they become ruler. They may adopt witch ever title they see fit king or queen for kingdom, emporer or empress for empire, grand Duke or grand dutchess for a grand duchy,  etc. Their partner automatically adopts the opposite title. 
8. The country can only go to war if the nation is attacked first or the public votes in favor of war. 
9. If the heir is a homosexual. A donor is needed so long as it retains the family's bloodline. That means heirs egg  or sperm is used for the one half. Adopting is not allowed 
10. If twin, triplets, etc are firstborn. Then per rule 4. The country is divided into parts of equal population for them to rule over. Even though only the oldest has first inheritance 

Large country
1,2(however only royal family members can be named heir),4(but only a single district of the nation),5,7,9 these rule carry over from previous aswell 

1. The nation is divided up into districts consisting of no more than 500,000 citizen. Each with its own monarch.
2 the district monarchs have the title that states below the monarch. Like Duke or lord. Or something else. (If the heir who reached 16 is appointed to rule that district they still retain their first title and the new title is added on as a suffix. The rightful ruler of that district plays the role of advisor till the role opens again.) 
3. District monarchs have complete control over their district but the monarchs word outranks theirs. And each decision they make must be sent to the Monarch as notification. 
4. The district monarchs are hereditary.
5. The head monarchy ensures the district monarchs are doing their job correctly. And control foreign affairs. Aswell as the military, land sea and air ports, utilities, and taxation.
6. Each districts receive a set amount of money for use however more can be given if necessary.
7. The head monarchs palace and accompanied city are within the nation but separate from the districts. 
8. A national government funded 24-7 news station is free for all televisions, radio, and streaming devices. This channel is unbiased, truthful, and uncensored, meaning no one can tell them what to play or say and all news needs to ran in full. So no omission of any important detail, No double speak, and no out of context news. 
9. Each district monarch can be expelled by the people with a vote. 
10. Their is only one law code. the district monarchs and head monarch meet atleast once a year to discuss this as well as other issues. But they can met anytime needed.",1612137671
"investing","t5_2qhhq","One of challenges with Marijuana industry is the interstate transport of drugs due to different rules of each state.

Consider the valuation issues here.  I was at Valuation Conference and this issue was discussed that since there are restrictions on transportation of the product between states it reduces the economies of scale from having central warehousing and distributions (ie Amazon) and requires separate infrastructure setups for each state.  This makes the ongoing sustaining capital re-investment a drain on free cash flow and riskier earnings.  Cap rates then go up versus a similar earnings mulitple of another industry.

On the positive side there is a future expanding product line of edibles that will not carry the social issues associated with smoking and smoke (for some).....there will be a whole new audience that is very cool with popping a gummy and catching a buzz.

The key for this industry (in my opinion) will be who can create that first brand loyalty...is Jack Daniels, Budwieser, etc....right now there are many restrictions on this ...but like alcohol it will give way to open market and then marketing kicks in.....that is what I would look for.",1612137672

"assholedesign","t5_33o0p","Okay, so volume-based pricing means you pay on a consumption model for what you use. If you use just a little, that's inside their perpetual free tier. They're fine with that because they know you'll consider them for larger projects and your business will grow. That's normal SaaS pricing and that's what they do here.  


Now they do freemium on top of that, with paid features, right? Totally normal business practice. Either you use enough volume to need to start paying, or you decide you'd benefit from the paid features.  


Where it's hazy is if you move off of the free tier and on to a paid tier to work with the standard features and decide that they don't work for you. Once you do that, you are unable to deactivate premium features, even if you don't use them. What's more, the volume-based cap for low-end paid is lower than the high end for consumption-based usage's free tier, meaning that you pay to have fewer E-Mails available and features you won't use.  


And the downvotes: I'm really not sure where you came up with free trial. That's in no way shape or form what they do, and it confuses the matter greatly. It seems like you made a guess and asserted it as fact. You can only fit so much in a post title.",1612137673

Winston is still good, just not Matt Stafford good. He started in the NFL for 7 years. Worst case scenario, he loses the starting job to Eason or a rook. Or he wins the job and we tank for a season to get a top 2022 QB while filling out the rest of our roster this season. 

I‚Äôd rather sign a cheaper FA than give up the house to take a shot on a rookie QB that might be worse. If we can get a Mac Jones by trading up 5-6 picks (giving up a 3rd rounder or 2022 2nd), then by all means, go for it. But I‚Äôd hate to give up 2 firsts, 2 seconds, and a third to move into the top 7, and pray we got the right dude while ignoring our Pass Rushers, Left Tackle, and weak Corner and Wide Receiver depth

As I was typing, I was aware it sounds very weird he would have his camera facing the ATM as he was using it. I‚Äôm sure he would have put his phone out of the way when actually putting his pin in but he put the card in the ATM in front of the camera and the ATM screen didn‚Äôt change so the card got swallowed before he could use it.

Another point being he wasn‚Äôt really distracted in my opinion as we didn‚Äôt talk that much the whole way through, if you know what I mean; comfortable silence or just being there with someone you trust so we were quiet while he got his card out his wallet and put it in the ATM. 

Anyway this is why I 100% believe it was a glitch in the matrix! Side note: I have vivid memories/decent memory recall but this is not to say your theories are not valid!",1612137673

Since Visible requires special software loaded onto the phone for calls and texts to work, no manufacturer will want to spend the time adding Visible support for the few customers who might want to use their device on Visible.

TracFone has several [unlimited talk/text plans](https://www.tracfone.com/shop/plans) with a certain amount of data for OK prices. It's not what you get with Visible, but they're one of the cheaper options for customers who want a flip phone. As far as phones go I recommend the [LG Classic Flip](https://shop.tracfone.com/shop/en/tracfonestore/phones/tf-lg-classic-flip-l125dl) as it is the simplest to use and has good call quality.

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","It‚Äôs probably around 4-5 people, a civilian in there as well, likely specifically handling the Facebook/Social media. Most of the CMSAFs posts are fluff in nature, so they don‚Äôt get the scrutiny that say the CSAF gets. Anything that is a little more high vis, say reg changes or EPRs, that office (A1) probably heavily coords the release with big Air Force PA and others before it gets passed to the CMSAF to blast out to the force...most stuff CMSAF‚Äôs staff just writes the text or whatever for the Chief‚Äôs page, then load it up to her to hit ‚Äúpost‚Äù. She might edit slightly if she sees fit, but not a whole lot. This office probably also has permission to post stuff like this on her behalf. Probably 3-4 of them share the account. 

CMSAF Bass isn‚Äôt sitting around reading random base newspapers for stories, so her staff probably selects a few ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô pieces when they hit the system for her to highlight based on her guidance/preference (which at face value the Luke piece does, female Amn, single mother working hard, etc). It‚Äôs mostly harmless and it makes it seem like Chief Bass ‚Äúis engaged‚Äù. With this story the CMSAFs PA staff doesn‚Äôt give the article a strong once over because they likely assume the Wing PA did their due diligence on all that before they published it. You can tell in the chief‚Äôs overview before the story, she just intros it, didn‚Äôt read it, but hey it‚Äôs good bc the title/first lines of the story fit her MO. 

Monday morning the CMSAF ‚ÄúOutreach Team‚Äù is going to get (if they haven‚Äôt already) a strong talking to (lol) about reading the articles more clearly and to ‚Äòtrust but verify‚Äô the information presented. Look for the CMSAF, or more likely her CMSgt exec officer (or even some GS-15, remember the CMSAF is essentially treated like a ~3-star, complete with all the support staff the other HAF 3-stars get), to become more involved in the short term. Probably expect a few stories highlighting combat power or something less subjective for a few cycles. Mostly this‚Äôll blow over, forgotten among most.

I like Ice types, and I'd be happy to see more of them hit the higher tiers of viability, but freeze absolutely needs to be nerfed before Ice as a type can be buffed.",1612137674
"LGBTCatholic","t5_30pu4r","Agreed. Everybody's different and has different needs. I'm not really arguing for the idea exactly. I'm more trying to show a relative perspective.

There's so much absolutism in the standard responses to these kinds of topics. This board is better than most, but there's still this kind of universal dismissal to the church's perspective on homosexuality, and sex in general. I think that's a huge waste. I'm not saying I agree with all of it, but just dismissing it without trying to see the practical and spiritual reasons for those beliefs doesn't help anyone.

The worst part is that a lot of it seems to come from Catholics or former Catholics who think they understand their religion, but aren't really as educated as they think they are. If you're raised in the church, it's very rare that you are taught the full catechism. Most sermons only cover the surface level, and a lot of the deeper philosophy, practicality, and more complex spirituality behind it is never conveyed. There's mostly just an attitude of ""we say it, so believe it, and don't think deeper"" when there are genuinely interesting reasons/thought processes behind most of it. There's a lot of good there, and some of it is actually pretty beautiful, but it all gets lost. You just don't see enough educated perspective from the church's side.

Sorry if this is long, I just find this stuff fascinating. I could probably write five full essays on just your post alone. It's a shame there isn't more actual philosophical discussion on boards like this. It's usually just a lot of taking sides when both sides are valid in their own way. It's tragic.

Thanks for being respectful and trying to educate in your reply. The more perspectives given the better. I'm sorry you had to struggle that way. I hope you're doing okay now.",1612137674

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","Well I believe there never was a conversation on leaving GME for SLV

Banks own silver and gold. They always had.

That doesn‚Äôt mean they are not shorting it to hold prices low to keep borrowing cheap money and gamble away tax money and 401k etc.

There
Some ‚Äú big names ‚Äú like Peter schiff advertising that position because he sells coins or some shit

Who gives a shit that doesn‚Äôt mean that there not a short squeeze play on it.

Everyone and their mothers boyfriends knows about fees paid by bank for corruption on silver.

Here‚Äôs my 2cents.

Hold GME and make Melvin capital go bankrupt.

Is not our fucking business they got greedy.
Fuck then and make money off of then.

Then fuck banks when we are done with Melvin with silver. 

Is about us making money off of them and proving our point that we the people deserved our piece of capitalism as well

EDIT: the fees and fines pay JPM are bigger that their fucking position on silver. How the fuck does that makes sense.

It makes sense because they rather pay the fine and keep silver down rather than prices going up.",1612137676

accept them for who they are. Know what they will do. Know what they wont do. Do not expect anything from them that they are unwilling to give.

You should also assess yourself to make sure you aren‚Äôt displaying codependency.

They are only able to treat and use you as an enslaved dumping ground because you allow them to. Its hard, but you must realize that you have a choice, and it is your responsibility (as the protector of your heart) to choose what is best for you.

stop going to deserts in search of water. 

The sooner you accept that the sooner you can heal. Take that bitter medicine. 

detach yourself from them emotionally. 

Id also recommend assessing yourself to see if you are enmeshed with them (it seems like you are from my point of view. You don‚Äôt sound like you have boundaries, or if you do you aren‚Äôt enforcing them.) 

We must always remember that they are your blood relatives, but they are not your family. Family doesn‚Äôt treat one another like that.

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","How do you get those self-replicating robots, that are so easy to make, from planet to planet harnessing materials and putting them on the correct orbit around the sun, then how do you transmit energy from those self-replicating robots and the solar panels they build to anything usable on... actually where do you suppose to transmit it? To the planet's surface? To the moon? How? In a giant death beam, converted from photons to electricity and then back to photons again? Or are we talking about concentrated solar? And what are you gonna do with it? Boil water for a steam generator? Most importantly, what is the form factor of a human/or any society/or species that is supposed to utilize this energy? And, again, what for? 

There's so many questions that need answering between today and building self-replicating robots to build a Dyson swarm, that the idea of Dyson spheres supposedly being a common phenomenon in the Universe becomes laughable, for me personally at least. 

At the end of the day, it's not enough to just theoretically be able to build something like this. You need extremely high extremely local energy consumption requirements to justify building a Dyson swarm. Otherwise it's just a waste of resources.

I was thinking as I wrote about the Australian politician previously that he's probably not stupid, he's just completely misunderstood what maths is, and thinks that it's a set of arbitrary rules which mathematicians invented (and can therefore be compelled to change), rather than a description of something fundamental about how the universe works that mathematicians have discovered.

I think the one in the red jumper has made a similar mistake.  She thinks Newton defined gravity rather than merely described it.

It's reasonable enough to look at *inventions* and conclude that a lot of them were arranged to suit people like the inventors (every left-hander learns this early). If you've never realised the maths and science are not really about invention, they're about discovery, you might mistakenly think that they too reflect the values of their practitioners.

And in some contexts, it's just as fast as running on bare pavement. I remember one XC event where we had our first 10 cm of the season on a day that was hovering below and above freezing, by the time the men's 10km race was going to happen the snow had already been packed down hard from prior races. With the use of spikes it was just like another road race, easier than running on the mulch and grass that course consisted of. 

I'll have to give you guys issues with powder snow though as that stuff can't be packed up all that well. Even in areas where the powder had been packed, I was still noticing a 15s/km difference over the weekend compared to bare asphalt.",1612137679

Take a floor jack...you can't raise the arm of the jack up if there is no-to-little hydraulic fluid. It just whimpers and falls back down. Same analogy applies to the human body.

Make sure to leave pressure in the bridge and saddle with your other hand. As you move up the neck you can rest your arm on the saddle and bridge. Check tunning it should have detuned, tune it back up and repeat, keep doing this until the distance from the tune and stretching is minimal. It can take new strings up to 2 weeks to settle with daily playing. You are just rushing the process by doing above. Again there is always a risk of the string popping or bridge being too stressed so be careful.

If the former, then buying and holding has a good chance of profit. But if it's 50%, then this becomes a wild gamble.

Subtleties include ensuring the soil can drain properly (our tank has open corners at the 'top'), and tilting the whole tank backwards a bit so that the condensation runs off the topmost surface (otherwise the resulting water drops focus the sun onto the leaves inside).

"dating","t5_2qhb1","This made me cringe. I'm black, and I can tell you right now I made a mistake of dating someone like that. Guess what? They treated me like garbage and told me to my face on multiple occasions the reason I only got the bare minimum from them was BECAUSE I AM BLACK,yep, I was molested and in danger twice and he refused to defend me then when I asked he'd say ""you're black,can't you just use the black girl aggression all black girls have?"" And continuously talked about my body as if it was literal chocolate candy. 
Of course this didnt show in the earlier stage of dating. Just later on down the road. Then came the racist ""jokes"" he made about sacrificing me, making fun of what I put in my hair,saying I can't use certain dye because black girls can't do that(yes he tried to tell me because of my race my hair was supposed to go a certain way.) Then his family with the racist threats after we broke up. Etc, etc.. In the end I learned I was indeed just someone he used and only wanted to be with for the time being until the fetish went away. 

Not everyone is like this, my aunt is married to a different race male and I've never seen her so happy before. He's also the greatest uncle I could ever have, he is patient with her and he tries to learn from her, his family doesn't approve of them as a couple(yes,its because she is black) but he stands up for her and cut contact with them. My ex let his family stomp all over me and didn't care. I don't believe everyone is like this. I still love all races, one shitty person isn't going to make me believe everyone is like this,because they aren't. 

When you get messages like that, ignore them. You don't need that in your life, and I know you are ready to date but take it from someone who's dated someone like that. They will waste your time, and will eventually start to disregard you. You feel like they are talking to you like you are a peice of candy because they do think you are, the relationship will evolve around you loving them and them only loving you halfway for what you are and the other half for how they see you.  And trust me it doesn't last long, they eventually get bored and bounce. You aren't anyones item, and you aren't candy or bubble gum to chew up and spit out when done. Maybe some of them don't have ill intentions, maybe they all do and hopefully you can tell who does and who doesn't. Take things slow and if you start to see red flags talk to them, and if they don't change then ask yourself If it's worth staying. 

Happy interracial couples are the couples that love each other and invest time with each other genuinely.  they aren't together for an aesthetic, they aren't together for a trend. And although they have different cultures they are respectful of it. They don't let others tell them they shouldn't be together unless it's a genuine toxic relationship and someone is concerned and just wants to bring up their concerns for you and your partner. They aren't hateful and spiteful towards each other racists. When fights happen they don't bring race into it to hurt their partners because from the beginning they shouldn't want to see their partner hurt at all if they love them. 

I'm only 20,I've got a lot to learn. But please do not make the same mistake as I did.  If you need anything or any advice feel free to message me.",1612137681

"zoology","t5_2sn8c","If it really is extinct, then I believe it went extinct in the 1940s-1960s. There are many descriptions of trappers still finding them in the 40s and even 50s, and that is completely reasonable considering that somewhere after ca 1934, the state/government/environmental agency people just stopped getting reports of them. This does not necessarily mean that noone caught a thylacine after that, only that it wasn't reported, since it was illegal to kill them by then and since maybe not all people would care to report it. So yeah, it could definitely have survived 10-30 years beyond 1936 and then ended up in a tiny fragmented population finally dying out in the early 1960s.

If it was still around in the 90s, then I believe it is still around today as well. I think it's very unlikely that it survived all the way into the 90s and then suddenly went extinct. Considering the amount of possible photographic and anecdotal evidence from the last ca 10-20 years, I think that's at least as much proof as the videos from the 90s are. If it made it to the 90s, it would have increased in numbers very much, leading to the extremely high amount of sightings of the last ca 10 years.",1612137682

If houses are going for 800k in Cobourg, and 500k in quinte west, the market has lost it.

Sad thing there's really no escape. Even out east is getting to be what Ontario was in 2019, and Halifax is almost 2020.

The most obvious example is that you thought that a ""UBI funded by income tax"" would not be funded by income tax.  I don't think that is a matter of stupidity as much as simply not taking a few seconds to actually read the comment.

It also took several comments until you seemed to understand what it means to be *effectively* means tested as opposed to directly means tested.

I think your biggest sticking point now is that you do not understand what UBI is.  If everyone receives a basic income, that is UBI regardless of where the money comes from.  You are not alone here, many people think of UBI as money they will receive without thinking about where it might come from.  There are many possibilities.  If it comes from taxes it comes from taxes.  If it comes from income tax it comes from income tax.  If it comes from somewhere else, then it comes from somewhere else.

&gt; And somehow you are stuck in 1700's tax system

I gave an example to illustrate a point.  We can talk about other examples if that makes you more comfortable.  I never suggested that UBI *must* come from income tax.  I said that UBI that comes from income tax comes from income tax.  You are free to suggest forms of UBI that do not come from income tax.  Where the money comes from is not part of the definition of UBI.",1612137683

"nextfuckinglevel","t5_m0bnr","Someone else already linked it, but I would recommend the wikipedia entry on chimpanzee warfare. It's short and horrifying.

If you want a shorter answer: they can be as bad as humans, including premeditated murder. Not for food, or mates, or territory either. They are capable of a degree of empathy (or a chimp analog to empathy if you want to separate human and chimp emotions), which means that like human serial killers they will inflict harm because they understand and enjoy knowing that others are suffering. They also understand compassion to some degree because they will care for the old and the sick and the injured, but can reject compassion too.

One example from, Gombe iirc, was a chimp who had been partially disabled for most of its life. It had been cared for by its community for years. That community split, and the old leadership were killed or driven off, and the disabled chimp fled to live alone far from the group. Months later, the new leader assembled a group of underlings and hunted down that disabled chimp. They even used a former friend to set a trap. They tortured that chimp to death, even though it was not a threat and had fled the territory of the new regime. It was premeditated murder as a bonding and dominance exercise, purging the old loyalties. If you think it sounds like a cult, like Manson or Jones, you're not wrong.

One last anecdote. I was on a jury for a murder a while back. It was a group of teenagers and early-twenty-somethings who ambushed and killed a former friend over various teenage BS. It was all caught on security cameras in the neighborhood, and it followed pretty closely to the descriptions of the Gombe chimpanzee war. It was surreal watching the interplay of instincts and deliberate actions play out with such brutal results.",1612137683

Using an old small paintbrush with 90-99% rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) you can carefully dissolve layers of paint on a specific area wiping it away with the brush (think of it as reverse painting). The two main things to take care with are 1) not having the brush too wet, you don't want the alcohol to run down the rest of the model and 2) not getting a lot of alcohol on the bare plastic as it will start to melt. I've done this with a couple of faces which I screwed up but couldn't bring myself to start over.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","Naturally you're gonna see a lot of abjuration, illusion, and divination effects, but a lot of it is going to depend on just how many high-level spells they can throw at this thing. Glyph of Warding is a really useful spell for this kind of thing, but it's also really expensive. It also depends on how badly they want to punish thieves. Anyway, here's a list of spells and effects that might be used, assuming limitless wealth and spell slots:

* Alarm
* Guards and Wards
* Glyph of Warding (with any damage spell, any conjure creature spell, Blindness/Deafness, Confusion, Darkness, Entangle, Faerie Fire, Feeblemind, Flesh to Stone, Forcecage, Hold Person, Hypnotic Pattern, Imprison, Maze, Otto's Irresistible Dance, Polymorph, Reverse Gravity, Silence, Sleep, True Polymorph, or Web)
* Arcane Lock
* Animate Dead (as guards)
* Antipathy/Sympathy
* Awaken (as guards)
* Create Undead (as guards)
* Find Familiar (as guards)
* Forbiddance
* Leomund's Secret Chest
* Magic Jar (as a guard attempting to possess intruders)
* Magic Mouth (as warnings, distractions, alarms, etc.)
* Meld into Stone (to hide guards)
* Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound
* Nondetection
* Nystul's Magic Aura
* Plant Growth
* Programmed Illusion
* Project Image
* Scrying
* Sequester
* Simulacrum (as guards)
* Symbol

Along with a bunch of NPC magic. You know the sort, illusory walls, magic traps, sentient doors. That kind of thing. Don't underestimate mundane effects as well, since they're likely to assume that potential thieves will have access to Detect Magic and even Dispel Magic. A few well-placed traps can confuse thieves. And naturally a lot of things will have lead barriers to protect against divinations and other effects.

As for circumventing these protections, keep in mind that the guild's members are likely to want to be able to access their own vault. They'll have their own ways past all the diversions and traps - mostly command words - so if a thief can learn about those methods, they're halfway to the prize already. Heck, if they can just learn how the item is guarded they might as well have it already. If they're magical, they can make judicious use of Dispel Magic and Locate Object. Nondetection also helps, though it's higher level. Some traps can be avoided with Invisibility, some can be triggered ""safely"" by sending mooks into them. Alternatively, just dig into the vault from the other side, break through the wall, steal the item, and then magically repair the wall. If they can teleport to the other side of the wall with something like Dimension Door, they don't need to break anything.",1612137685

\- There is a lot of extra credit. Last semester, it was +2 points for a course review and +5 for a simple ML project (no knowledge of ML required).

\- There is a lot of ""required"" reading. 90% of it is irrelevant. The quizzes are open book. You can start the quiz and find all of the quiz answers in like 10-20 minutes.

\- For the projects, there is usually an associated chapter in the book. Read that chapter read for word. For the first project, it's the chapter on the buffer overflows.

\-Last semester, the TAs would post a study guide for the exams. Most of the content is the content covered in projects.

&amp;#x200B;

About 90% of your time will be spent on the projects. There is also a third-party notes website linked in the syllabus that has written notes for all the lectures. I didn't watch the lectures, but the notes usually took about 15 minutes to read. Much quicker than the video runtimes.",1612137685

"BMWi3","t5_2y1ho","If you want to remove it and test it. Switch the car to fully off, with the center screen off. Disconnect the HV battery using the orange thing under the frunk. Its under the right side flap, you pop it up a bit and if you look close there's some text on it that will say off and the ""bore holes"" will line up, just simply slide it out a bit don't try and yank it off. Check the instrument cluster says ""high voltage system deactivated"". Double check the car is ""off"" again, no center screen on. Now it's very important to let the car go to ""sleep"", with the car off wait at least 2 minutes and the car will go into ""sleep"" mode. If you do not wait for the car to go to sleep, or you do not make sure the ignition is off, the car will log a ton of errors. Now you can remove the other cover and the frunk compartment. 6 screws, 2 each on back, bottom, and front. The 12v battery is tucked back left almost under the dash. Its held down by a steel bracket that needs to come off. Loosen the nut on the negative(left) terminal, have a rag or something to wrap it with when you disconnect it wrap it with something to prevent shorts and tuck it to one side. Repeat with the positive terminal, have to lift up a red flap to get to nut. Now, very important, there is a vent hose coming out of battery, don't yank the battery out, carefully disconnect this vent before removing the battery, it's probably very stiff and brittle. 

Congrats you removed the battery. Take note of a date code sticker on the battery. If it's older than 4 years replace it, if not you can lug it over to autozone and they will test it for free on a load tester.

If you need a new one, you can pay out the ass for one from bmw. You can also find an exact fit OEM unit from Remy. Or... You can buy an ""ETX18L"", for a lot less, but you will also need a couple ""SAE battery posts"" the ones I got off amazon were called ""tall brass post adaptor M6 thread"". They screw on top of the terminals, so that the terminals have something to clamp onto, as the ETX18L is a motorcycle battery it doesn't have posts. ~$115 for the posts and battery. It's the same chemistry and rating as the OEM battery. When you stick the battery in don't be surprised if there are sparks, red terminal first. After you connect and screw on the new battery, and pop the HV disconnect back in to ON position, bmw says you need to hop in the car and do a button sequence. Press the START-STOP button 4 times, pausing for 1 second between each press. No clue what this does but that's what they say to do.


Now you should ""register"" the battery, bimmerlink app and a bluetooth dongle can do this.


I followed these steps to replace my 12v back in September and no issues. No error codes, etc. Had to set the time tho. Good luck.",1612137685

"brexit","t5_33mm8","Sovereignty. We keep telling you, but you just don't listen.

Prior to Brexit, many UK laws came directly from Brussels, bypassing Parliament completely. If a British citizen disliked or was disadvantaged by the law, they could write to their local MP... only to be told that their elected representative had no power to change it.  
MEPs were no better, since the European Parliament lacks the Right of Initiative, and so cannot push for positive change. They can only resist further negative change *at best*.

As such, despite the UK being a democracy, UK laws were being decided by people who could not be held accountable to the public, and the elected representatives of any aggrieved person were no more capable of changing the status quo than the average citizen. This state of affairs was morally outrageous. 

Upon departure from the EU, the UK got sovereign control of its law-making back. The average citizen can now raise an issue with their MP, and that MP can push for change in Parliament.   
This is how the system is supposed to function, and its restoration is entirely down to Brexit. Without it, we'd still be under the thumb of unelected technocrats... who, it seems, can't even fill out a drug prescription properly. Good riddance.

Democracy must ***always*** come first. Everything else - trade, borders, travel, etc. - is of secondary importance. No exceptions.",1612137687

"Survival","t5_2qh7j","I used to work in northern BC (Canada), in the town of Fort St James. One of the people I worked with told me her brother had been mauled by a grizzly while hunting in the area several years before (90‚Äôs I believe). The brother escaped the mauling after stabbing the bear repeatedly with his knife (in both the head and neck). I don‚Äôt recall if the bear died or not in her story, but the brother lived (though with serious life altering Injuries). I had no reason to doubt her story and several other locals advised it was true.
Though this happened before the heyday of the internet, a quick google search pulled up this news article, which I believe is the same story.
Seems to fit with your question. Cheers.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","First I DID NOT vote for Trump. Not in 2026 nor in 2020 BUT IMO Trump did win. His base was motivated, he had huge rally‚Äôs. Biden was hiding in his basement for nine months. There was NO enthusiasm for Biden. He didn‚Äôt win a single primary until the unDemocratic party rigged Super Tuesday. His VP was even less popular. She dropped out before the CA primary because she didn‚Äôt want to be embarrassed losing her own state!  Biden is in cognitive decline and the media helped him hide by doing interviews with stupid easy questions and even those he could barely answer.

But unfortunately with my degree I cannot work in Canada so my plan was to work in Europe using my degree and pay off my student loans. I figured I would be earning around $3k a month and I could pay $1k a month to my loans and with the $2k left I‚Äôd still have a decent living. But with my luck after graduating the economy in this country plummeted. Once I start working I will be making $1100 with the current currency exchange and there‚Äôs no way I can pay $1000 every month for my student loans. So I don‚Äôt know what to do. I mean there‚Äôs no way I could have known that an entire country‚Äôs economy would go belly up. So now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have no plans to return to Canada because my degree would not be recognized there. So the only job options would be minimum wage jobs and even with that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay $1k every month. I really do want to pay back what I have borrowed it‚Äôs been my intention all along but I don‚Äôt see that happening unless the currency exchange returns to what it was.  My loan repayment started this month and I‚Äôm honesty so scared I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen. What can the government do? Will there be problems for me at the airport if I ever go back to visit my family? Will renewing my passport abroad be an issue?",1612137688

I am a nurse in the same place as Patient Zero and I experienced every Covid symptom but the GI stuff.  All MD's I subsequently  told immediately say to me, ""You had it.""

1st Dose of Moderna:  Sore arm only, not bad, able to sleep on that side.  Possibly coincidentally:  by day 2, I felt my root canal had failed, excruciating right jaw &amp; mouth swelling with pain, along with right side facial numbness.  It lasted into day 11 after injection #1.  Then back to normal...I did not go to the dentist, because it felt related to an inflammatory response.

2nd Dose of Moderna:  Sore arm only, less sore than the first time.  I have no other symptoms so far and I am now on hour #29 post-jab.  Nothing else, not even fatigue. 

My theory was my body already knows what to do with it and doesn't sound the alarm when confronted with the virus info again.  After all, when I recover from any other virus, my body doesn't create chaos when re-exposed to someone with it later.  Yet the MD with whom I spoke at the vaccination setting yesterday told me anecdotally she has observed the opposite effect.

Everyone has been calling out ‚Äúbruz‚Äù because in the second half of last year at a time when all arms of NSW government were fully occupied with the health and economic fallout of a global pandemic he decided the time was ripe for the National Party to threaten to part ways with the NSW Liberal Party, because the libs were digging in their heels on the abolishment of Koala protection laws, he decided the best tactic was to threaten to split from the NSW coalition and make the NSW government unworkable. 

The pandemic followed a devastating fire season, which was fuelled by his parties environmental deregulations and austerity measures. Said bushfires killed about ~30K of our ~100K koalas. On September 10th last year Bruz, as leader of the NSW National Party, decided to issue Gladys (who had already earned the title ""Koala Killer"") with an ultimatum: bend the knee and remove koala protections or he would move his party's MPs to the cross bench. After an unprecedentedly stupid 24 hours, and a closed door meeting with Gladys (where apparently she threatened to sack the lot of them) he backed down. 

What did McGowan do that is more ""acting like a cock"" then holding the state government he is the deputy of hostage for the ability to clear a bunch of protected Koala habitat (an endangered and nationally culturally significant animal), when his leadership should have been focused on the human health emergency unfolding?",1612137688

The Basic RiderCourse - while better than nothing - isn't enough to get a rider to the baseline for riding on the street in NYC. 5 years on from the BRC, even though my experience after has made the Street RiderCourse moot now for me, I went on the MSF site to get more information and it's disappointing that the area that needs a Street course doesn't offer it. The nearest options are MA and NC.

"StreetFighter","t5_2qnu5","That's just a meaty grab. Since you are still on the ground getting up while they have already started doing their move it will always connect before yours if they time it correctly. This is called a meaty. A meaty can be both a grab or an attack.

One of the core basics of the game is that you have to guess whether the opponent will attack or grab you in a wakeup situation.
Blocking beats attacks, grabs beats blocking and if you both grab it will result in a ""tech throw"" putting both of you at a small distance from each other essentially ""resetting"" the fight. So you should only press light punches during your wakeup if the opponent is too far away to get a true meaty or if you notice they have bad timing since light punch will lose to both meaty grabs and meaty attacks. This is why making sure you back roll or quick rise EVERY SINGLE TIME is so crucial since you don't want to give your opponent free wakeup meaties all the time.

Trying to tech throws should be used sparingly since you can get hit by an normal attack while trying to tech. A throw results in 120ish damage while a meaty attack can result in upwards of 500 damage if they have CA.

Now like you mentioned you can also jump or dash out of grabs since grabs can't hit airborne targets. But this is a risky option just like teching since you can still get up by regular attacks during a jumps or dash startup frames.

Being able to do a meaty attack in a wakeup situation is what we call okizeme or oki for short. It's a word the japanese FGC originally created that literally translates to wakeup attack.",1612137690

"rupaulsdragrace","t5_2t3or","Product placement is much more strictly controlled in the UK, up until pretty recently it was basically banned. BBC of course has even less freedom. Allowing businesses to offer products in exchange for reducing filming costs was allowed in the past which included prizes to be given contestants, I'm pretty sure BBC has done that too but I could be wrong. But ""requiring corporate sponsorship"" is definitely not the case on the BBC, they'd have to fight to be allowed it.

Of course it all gets murky, chat shows like Graham Norton and Allan Carr are basically glorified adverts for whatever shit the celebrities are trying to flog that week. Any sporting event is basically a giant advert with smaller adverts in it, but as BBC doesn't get the cash for it that's apparently fine. 

One thing that jumped at me was that Ru did a giant name drop of his Klein Epstein and Parker suit in the last episode of DRUK, but I watched on WOW+, I imagine they cut it in the BBC version but I'm speculating.",1612137690

It doesn‚Äôt have the same sense of excitement and magic as many other major parks (for example Alton towers). Personally, Thorpe is not a park I would want to go to for more than one day- get the credits and go. I find myself turning up at 3pm, getting a few rides on my favourites and then leaving in an hour or so. 

Merlin need to invest into creating a better vibe in the park, it just seems like an extension of the area surrounding it rather than a separate ‚Äòisland like no other‚Äô. 

This would involve better all round maintenance and cleanliness of the park, making it more presentable and good looking to guests. The strange IP‚Äôs don‚Äôt help (walking from a 90‚Äôs beach theme to a cartoon pig land and up to a volcano in the space of 5 minutes doesn‚Äôt help to create good atmosphere). 

I don‚Äôt think the park is as bad as some people make out, and someone from out of town visiting for a day will most likely throughly enjoy the park, I just think the hierarchy‚Äôs choices of investments is very questionable to say the least.

I think all your points are fair, and I really want Jonah to have a happy ending.

Part of the worry with Jonah is, I don't know how good his self esteem is. When he would go low in a fight with Amy, his route was to attack her for being stuck in this dead end job- and now, despite greater obstacles, like raising her family, she has moved on, and he is the one that is stuck in that position. The idea of Jonah following Amy to California and marrying her is romantic, and I would like to see it in that way, but where does it leave him?

When Parker was born, you got the sense that Jonah wished he was the biological dad, but of course he stepped up anyway. 

I almost would have liked Jonah to own the life he had with Amy more, to say, hey, I see Parker as my son too, we have built this life. Instead, it seemed to me that when Amy was wobbling over the marriage issue (perhaps understandable given her track record) it tapped in to all Jonah's hidden insecurities. Then in the last episode, we hear him say he was making all these big plans, on the rug that got pulled out from under him. It's understandable of course, and I love his character, but what about his big plans for himself, for his career and purpose outside the relationship? If he doesn't have those, its putting a lot on Parker and Amy (and it seems another kid he would like to have) to be his main purpose. I also get stressed on his behalf thinking about all his college debt. We don't have that where I live, as college is mostly free, but its terrible to have it hanging over you. 

I hope he gets the girl and a career he loves. Maybe its too much to hope for though, especially in 5 episodes, or whatever.",1612137690

Handled it way better:

&gt; Some **companies even ‚Äúshared‚Äù employees** to meet the growing labour demand in the food delivery industry that could not be satisfied with their ordinary workforce, Bakhta said.
&gt; 
&gt; More employees from restaurants, general retail and other service businesses were ‚Äúloaned‚Äù to food delivery companies, which faced manpower shortages during the outbreak, according to Sandy Shen, senior research director at global consultancy Gartner.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThese arrangements not only ensured the continuity of the delivery service but also helped businesses to retain employees during the shutdown,‚Äù she said.
&gt; 
&gt; The delivery system has been improved by an effective combination of private sector innovation and public sector coordination, said Li Chen, assistant professor at the Centre for China Studies at Chinese University of Hong Kong.

"German","t5_2qq51","There‚Äôs is nothing in the world I disagree with more than this.

I was one of it not the top student in my study abroad class in Marburg Germany. Music and movies were my only study materials. Having memorized a few dozen German songs, I can say they make up probably 15% of my spoken language directly, and probably closer to 80% of the sentence structures I utilize.

When people make music, they pour their soul into trying to get the listener to understand their emotion or idea. It is through this process that language gets distilled, reduced to the most important phrases and words. When listening to music in German, you have to listen to the same songs many times until you actually understand them. For some songs, Sammy Deluxe is very hard for me to understand, I know that it could take thousands of listens to actually start to get the meaning. 

Learning language is all about accepting the fact that you are NOT a native speaker in your target language. Applying your mother tongue only gets you so far. For some people it is far enough to get by, and they do not improve further. You have to drop your ego, and just listen.

Music is the most primal language everyone can understand. Perhaps you just prefer a different medium. And even if you did, I would recommend music.",1612137691

"attachment_theory","t5_1aynis","I recently went through a really lousy breakup with an FA. A couple topics/things I still struggle with are as follows:

1) the FA and the obsession with the spark/perfect partner. My ex broke up with me out of the blue saying she didnt ""feel a spark"" anymore between us. She went on to say I was ""perfect for her,"" that I was ""literally everything"" she's looking for in a guy, that I was the ""best guy"" she's ever dated, that I did ""nothing wrong"" and that I was ""more than enough"" for her. Yet she still felt she had to end things because she was ""looking for a fairytale.""

2) going along with #1, FA's and the idea of the ""grass is always greener"" or ""destination happiness"" or whatever you wanna call it.

3) FA's and triggers when introducting their significant other to important people in their life. My ex deactivated after I met her best friend, after i met another really good friend, and after she told her parents about me (3 separate instances of deactivating). In all 3 instances, those people really liked me/liked what they heard about me. Then she pulled away.

4) FA's and subconsciously keeping one foot out the door. My ex would literally say things like ""if we make it that long"" or ""I'm bad at relationships."" She also told me didnt trust me a couple times. Just seemed like she was literally telling herself if wouldn't work between us.",1612137693

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Construction. 

Regardless of the season I check the weather when I wake up at 6am (5am in the summer). I live in Canada, more specifically Manitoba. 

I commute for work so I drive for an hour to get to site, sometimes a bit more depending on where I‚Äôm working. 

Work changes with the seasons. Siding in the winter and stucco in the summer. Siding is relatively easy, but dealing with winter conditions suck. Lots of measuring and cutting, using air nailers to put it on the house. I get a lot of leg exercise when you factor in climbing ladders all day. 

Stucco is really labour intensive so I‚Äôm sweating at 7:10am right after we start work because we only do it in the summer. Hauling around wheel barrows and pails. A 5 gallon pail of cement weighs about 95 pounds. Put one on your shoulder and then climb a ladder. Trying to hide from the sun in +40 can be difficult so I tend to get a pretty solid farmers tan. 

In the winter we typically just work 8-4, but in the summer we start at 7 and never finish before 4, sometimes even working until 7-8 although working that late is maybe one day every two weeks. 

After work I drive home, another hour. Typically I‚Äôll listen to podcasts or audiobooks to pass the time. The commute sucks some days, and others I don‚Äôt mind it.",1612137693

"ProtonMail","t5_32g5k","While I said they could be hacked and possibly taken down, I find it an incredible long shot that the owners/developers of Protonmail and ProtonVPN would allow it to happen. Just like it could happen to Gmail, but highly unlikely. 

What PM does is deal well with phishing attacks from bad actors that get their hands on your PM email address and try and phish you that way. PM has a great system in place where they warn you that only starred emails from PM are actually from PM. Not starred and from PM? Spam and delete it.

You go with the same tired attack that PM could have its domain hacked when people who are users are already being phished as is. ANY email provider can be threatened by a domain hack you mention OR by general phishers. ANY e2e email provider that uses JS on a browser app has a vulnerability there.

PM is not high threat model, though I will admit their marketing can seem that way. PM is used to avoid data harvesting and give solid privacy for  average users. 

Snowden with a very high threat model has stated he will never use ANY e2e email provider (and he won't touch Gmail ever). His go to is Signal messenger in place of email. Snowden understands PM (and all browser based e2e providers - messengers or email) are not ideal with JS attacks possible and metadata that is available upon subpoena. Signal's does not use  your browser for desktop. It uses a desktop direct downlead. Thus no browser or JS. I hope all e2e email and text messengers go this route. 

Thus, PM, while having amazing encryption, is not for high threat model. Not because the encryption will be broken, but a JS browser based app - which all e2e providers admit they use because that is what users want. Signal with no metadata available except date app downloaded and last used with a burner SIM works for high threat model. There may have been confusion when I stated how great PM encryption was (it is), but I preciously mentioned the browser concern and it is still very solid and far, far better than Gmail, Yahoo, etc. from having privacy violated by data miners with zero access encryption.",1612137694

To me it sounds like your brew is coming along slowly but surely. If you can smell a change and see the sediment you know the fermentation is happening. If it is winter in your part of the world it may be going slowly because of low temperatures. Or perhaps the ratio was a bit steep and it is taking the scoby a while to take hold. Either way the brew will likely get there in time! If you would like to hurry it up try moving it to a warmer area in your home. The warmer the environment the quicker the fermentation happens. 

A purely semantic detail- the symbiotic culture if bacteria and yeast, the scoby, is living in the liquid itself.

Then make sure to check out David Nichols as well. He's the most prominent and important figure of psychedelic research today. Was also friends with Sasha.
And don't forget the OG psychedelic researcher Albert Hofmann, whom whe have to thank for LSD and a lot of psilocybin and early Salvia research. I mean he was the first person to isolate and identify the active substances of the genus Psilocybe.
Another important contemporary figures would be Carhartt-Harris in GB and in the US at John Hopkins there's also Roland Griffiths.
Have fun researching ;)

Another further example is Myanmar... Aung San Suu Kyi, the ""darling"" of the West, the female image of ""freedom and progressiveness and anti-dictatorship and everything nice""... when she got more power in Myanmar.. what did she do... she ended up supporting a genocide in which babies were raped and  thrown grenades at, because they made the mistake of being born to another race. This is what happens when unenlightened people rise to power. This all reinforces my points. Switching politicians/parties blindly doesn't help. You replace one corrupt or incompetent and unenlightened person/party with another. Until people become enlightened and stop fighting each other based on party/political affiliation, race, ethnicity, etc... the world will never improve.",1612137694

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This might be only sort of related, but I find it very difficult to share and be generous in certain social situations. It started growing up with the realization that whatever i had, it was likely a rare if unique opportunity to have it. You have a toy and decide to share and it gets broken? Well, that will teach you not to share as there is no money to replace it. But it gets deeper to small, seemingly meaningless things. I have an extra 35 cents and buy a cookie at the cafeteria. And i don't want to share with anyone because it is so rare that I get to buy a treat. But now I am ""mean"" because I didn't want to share my cookie. That sort of unconscious approach has followed me through the years with various comments on being stingy, greedy, selfish, etc. And i don't mean or want to be, but it takes conscious effort to overcome. And when I get lax about being conscious, there i am being ""selfish"" again. It isn't selfish for the sake of being selfish, it is just a side-effect of growing up with very little. I am now an adult with a job, so I can afford to buy a friend a drink or a meal, or be able to replace items if mistakes are made, but I have to force myself to think ""this is okay, i can share and be generous"".",1612137696

It absorbs into my skin quickly and does not pill under sunscreen or makeup. 

Also this is not the whole reason I like it but L‚ÄôOreal owns Skinceuticals which of course has the coveted $166 Vitamin C CE Ferulic Serum. I personally cannot justify spending that much on a serum, but from a formulation and ingredient sourcing perspective, it‚Äôs very common for brands with the same parent companies get their ingredients from similar sources and have a similar formulation because it‚Äôs more financially efficient from a business perspective.

This is total bullshit.

Design patterns arise because humans are good at pattern matching, find commonalities between code problems, and need to communicate.  There is no system good enough that design patterns aren't necessary because they're fundamentally a means of communicating intent between two developers.

I don't think you actually understand what a design pattern is.  There's nothing in your comment to imply that you do.

&gt; The lack of fist class functions guarantees the creation of patterns designed to work around that, patterns that don't exist in programming languages that have first class functions.

People who say this, such as in this very thread, often point to language who frequently use the same abstractions and patterns but in a more convenient and less obnoxious way, and say the pattern isn't being used, because they fundamentally don't understand design patterns.  There are very, very few patterns that can be completely elided by language features, and I'm having trouble coming up with a single one.",1612137696

Does he really want to be with someone who settled for him? Do good relationships typically start with so much doubt and ambiguity?

Is it possible that you're exaggerating his good qualities, but really they're less than what you think? Is it possible that you're more interested in how he makes you feel rather than who he actually is? Those sound like passive aggressive, dickhead questions, but I think that's frequently the dynamic between people: we exaggerate the qualities of people we like, and we exaggerate the qualities of people who make us feel good and people who validate us.

The fact that you called him ""PERFECT relationship material"" suggests to me a certain degree of idealization. It also sounds like you might be approaching this from a guilt or shame oriented frame of mind. If either are the case, I would suggest reconsidering.

https://armada.ryankingston.com/fleet/127454/

First up some general tips:
You can't use Advanced Gunnery on a ship that has Gunnery Teams. The ""cannot"" in Gunnery Teams:
&gt; Each of your hull zones, **cannot** target the same ship or squadron more than once during that activation.

supersede the ""may"" in Advanced Gunnery:
&gt; The second player's objective ship **may** perform each of its attacks from the same hull zone, and it may do so against the same target.

Next, with Sloane you basically always want to max out your squadron count.

Lastly, basic imperial squads, especially ties and interceptors, really want to have Flight Controllers with them.

So let's go from top to bottom through the lists:

The ISD:

* Intell Officer is a nice luxury upgrade that unfortunately finds no place in this list.

* NK-7 is just generally a bad upgrade card. By the time they have to discard defense tokens that really hurt them the game is already over. Instead you always want to play ISD2s with leading shots, unless you play Vader or have some other well thought our dice mitigation strategy.

* Gunnery Teams is kind of a trap in my opinion. It is so tempting, but in reality it is not actually good upgrade, especially not after its nerf. Instead you really want to have Flight Controllers here.

* Playing a list with only 2 non flotilla ships, of which one is a quasar and not taking a defensive retrofit upgrade on your flagship is just asking to be tabled. And when it comes to defensive retrofits on the ISD2 ECMs is still king.

* XI7s are not the upgrade you are looking for if you plant to deplete the enemy's shields.

* Relentless is the most luxurious upgrade of them all and we really don't have the points for it.

The Quasar:

* Palpatine, again quite the luxury upgrade and generally not that good. No points for a good substitute officer left.

* Flight Controllers again, because with Sloane you really want to make sure that you win the squad battle.

* Expanded Hangar Bay: No need for them. Instead I outfitted the Quasar with Reserve Hangar Deck. This upgrade is really the only disposable upgrade in the whole list. Everything else is absolutely essential.

* Boosted Comms, great idea on a Quasar. It generally wants so stay back a little further.

* Squall: well, its Squall. Easily one of the best squad upgrades in the game.

Gozantis:
One needs to go to make points for more squads and the other needs to pull double duty. We have the capacity to command 10 squads and we have exactly 10 squads, so it needs to command 2 but we also need tokens in this list, so it also needs Hondo and Comms Net.

The squad complement can be changed. I have not tried Sloane since the recent rules changes came out but I would guess this might be a good squad composition.

Jendon and Stele for obvious reason, Howlrunner is great because we are gonna have quite a few Swarm squads, Mauler is always solid (though less so after the rules changes). The rest is just filling up the squad point limit with the best possible Swarm squads without going over 10 squadron activations.

Objectives:

* Advanced Gunnery: for obvious reason

* Fighter Ambush: Its a very solid objective for squad based list, but you could replace it with Asteroid Tactics, or even Contested Outpost.

* Infested Fields: This objective is incredibly strong with squad lists. The Exogorths can help you win the squad battle even more decisive. On top of that you can gather some victory points and throw obstacles in the way of your opponents ships.

Game plan: So since you have the capacity to activate 10 squads and you also have exactly 10 squads all ships will in all relevant turns(3 to 5) have to use squad commands. That means you absolutely need Nav tokens on your carrier (ISD and Quasar). On turn 1 your Quasar and ISD will want to bank a Nav token themselves and the Gozanti will want to pass an engineering token to the ISD so that it can ready ECMs again. On turn 2 they, but especially the ISD, will absolutely want to have a Nav dial to get in a good position. Here the Gozanti will often need a Nav dial itself but if does not, banking a Nav token here will give you great flexibility because you can pass it on with Comms Net when needed. Squadron combat usually does not begin until turn 3, so from turn 3 on all ships will usually run Squad commands. If more tokens are needed, usually either Nav or engineering for ECMs, Hondo has your back. Additionally, once your first 2 squadrons die the Gozanti can now fully switch to being a Comms Net Gozani.
Generally I prefer to run max squad lists with JJ instead of Sloane, because he gives your ships so much flexibility in commanding squads and getting into great positions.

I was on Grindr the other day, and I met this guy I really connected with. We decided to hook up today(I live in a safe area, so no COVID worries, guys.), and so I went over to his house this morning.

Keep in mind that we had swapped dick/body pics with no issue by this point.

He offered me some water, and I noticed a small trans flag on his wall. I asked him about it, and he noted that he is FTM. I couldn‚Äôt tell at all from the dick pic he sent me.

I told him I wasn‚Äôt ok with hooking up with him anymore, and he said that I was an annoying transphobe. I showed myself out.

AITA?

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","Ok, now more important was the second part of my questioning 
&gt; Do you know how hostile and unwilling to learn you come off?

I do think you want to understand, so given that I think every single comment you've made had been hostile and combative, I have to assume either that you don't know how hostile you come off as, or that you don't care that you come off that way. In the first case consider this a notice lol. In the second I would argue that being so hostile is a hindrance if you're trying to understand, IDK I'm feeling patient today but most the time if someone came of like this I would ignore them because I don't want to go off trying to explain to someone when all I et back is hostility. I think most of you questions have been fair, but they're just said in the most hostile way possible and I think the same point could be made in a less combative way.


The reason I stress context is because I think it is crucial to how the system would work. Now we can assume the worst case. This would be something like the situation of the soviet union during the war. Here almost everyone would need to put in 40+ hour weeks of shit labour. And the geniuses like scientists would have to contribute through research on military technology. In this case, we don't have much excess labour to apply anywhere but the essential jobs, like production, medicine and military work and therefore exemptions would only be in strict cases of other necessities like military or medical development. 


Now luckily we don't live in that situation, and we can do the strictly essential labour without all of us putting in 40 hour weeks. And I think the strictly necessary labour today would be quite a bit lower than that. So given that we can complete all the essential work within reasonable limits. Then we can prioritise some work over this. So a medical scientist could work on developing new medicine and not to be a garbageman. The idea would be that both still need to do the same amount of work. The scientists can't just do nothing but the same amount of scientific work as others do essential work, so no group (other than those not able to work) would be exempt from working. And what work you can do instead of the essential one is determined by the state, it would be something which it determines has social importance.",1612137701

You're right - Jaime would probably still be at Riverrun.  If things go down this way and Cersei does something stupid enough in response to get herself killed it would be interesting to see Tywin survive all this and Tyrion outlast Jaime and Cersei.",1612137701

I‚Äôd also install a motion activated light so when the person approaches, they have it come on in their face. Again, not so you can catch them in the act, but so they get shocked into thinking they are less invisible than they think they are wandering the street, slashing tires at night.

All of this assumes you live in a house though.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I agree with that. But the one time you need it and don't have it may be a fatal mistake. Just like an epipen.

But I can tell you from experience, carrying a gun is a huge responsibility. It means I have to leave my ego at home. I have to turn the other cheek and walk away. I have to endure any abusive behavior I encounter because I cannot lose my cool or escalate a situation. I have the power of life or death on my hip. Being provoked is not an excuse I could make. I have been attacked and never drew my gun. I have left it on my hip, unseen even when I would have had the legal right to use it. Especially with a neighbor threatening me with a weapon while walking my dog. 

The first six months of carrying were a harrowing experience. I would be extremely conscious of carrying. Hoping no one could see it under my shirt. In some states, being able to see an imprint is a crime. Going on three and a half years carrying when I go to work and when I travel for work and when I'm out with my family has calmed the neurosis I felt those first six months. It has become second nature for me. I have never had to draw my weapon. I hope I never do. But I can and will if I'm left no choice. I am still obsessive about safe handling. And I still observe all safety rules.

But I don't think of it in terms of a burden anymore. It is routine. Because you don't carry every day, it's not a routine for you. And I can understand your reluctance, given my own experience. Your life, your choice. I can only tell you my own choice and experience.",1612137701

With Nikah &amp; wedding day set, he and his family does owe you and your family an explanation. That was rather insensitive and disrespectful. But be prepared, for it seems like he doesn‚Äôt want to give you a closure. Either way be grateful, you‚Äôre not with a partner who is unsure of you. Even while dropping a bomb like that he was mindful enough to ask his money back in the same call itself so it‚Äôs not like he was in a state of shock to not give an explanation. He just doesn‚Äôt want to. Also, usually when someone abruptly calls it off without an explanation, it‚Äôs an issue within themselves and has nothing to do with the partner.

Not now but after some time passes you will realise the only person who could give you closure is yourself. May Allah replace it with something better and bless you with a bright future. Ameen


Edit: I know someone whose wedding was called off a day before the Nikah. The guy‚Äôs family didn‚Äôt get any explanation, just the bride‚Äôs jewellery and outfits were dropped off with no explanation (the groom pays for the bride‚Äôs outfit in some desi households). All attempts in meeting or contacting the girl or the family failed. Anyway, the word got out and he was approached by another girl‚Äôs family after a week and was married to her in a month. 

He has three kids now and is happily married, when asked if he thinks of that time as to why she didn‚Äôt marry him, he says he looks back at it as an experience which taught him to be an empath and nothing else.",1612137702

For a long time, Rachel was only referred to as Lou's ""half Mexican, transvestite companion."" 

My thinking was maybe CI was the continuation, or actual real ending of Lou and Rachel, instead of the narrative LR suggested at the end of CIB(which was written and released in 'real time'). Maybe that's what he wanted or hoped for, but it's not what ended up happening in real life. ""Sorry for not making you my centerfold/Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring/But when I walked up to the podium, I think I forgot to say your name"" felt like the real ending of Lou and Rachel to me.

I hate my life, and I need to get off this shit asap.  So I figured, since my dopamine levels are going to be depleted, to cope, I'll just raise serotonin levels to offset the dragged down feeling.  Just until my dopamine receptors have healed.  This is probably wrong on so many levels,  but it seems to work ok for now.

But I did forget to mention that, no matter what drug i was on, i always had to have my big sticky smelly nugs with me. When I'm drunk, I need weed.  If I'm tripping on acid, still, I need my weed.  Tweekin?  Best believe I need my weed.  So, I guess I should have realized long ago, that I should have just been smoking weed.  Its always there for me like a true friend.  Haha.",1612137702

I think the classic problem when computers turn off like that is when they don‚Äôt receive enough voltage, which is what my initial guess was as well. But, I honestly don‚Äôt think it is. For one, I had it on my old system with a 1500x and the same 3060ti. Never gave me issues. I even had an overclock on gpu of +200 clock. For second, that‚Äôs why I ran those test (Cyberpunk 2077, time spy and cinebench ). I reasoned that if it didn‚Äôt crash for those, stress tests, the voltage should be stable enough for me to at least play Apex, unless for whatever reason there is like a huge spike of power when it launches.

It has those metal stands on the sides that you can push back and tilt the amp back. I think you can get a pretty good, grungy tone through just about any combination of Fender guitars, amps, and cabinets. Though I must confess, I'm far from an expert. But for a while my set up was an early 60s Fender Bandmaster through the cabinet I just described. The difference for me was the guitar; I like Fender, but my axe of choice was an Epiphone SG. With the right tone settings I got a tone I really liked. I don't know if you're into pedals, but if you're looking for a good one to start with, the Boss DS-1 distortion pedal is a solid beginning for rock. And maybe a good overdrive. I liked the Ibanez Tube Screamer for leads.",1612137703

"LegaciesCW","t5_j4gi1","I don't think it's just pressure to ""be good"" that makes her have to be the hero. 

She feels responsible for the death of several of her family members, and she feels like she needs to be worthy of the sacrifices they made for her, and then that combines with her fear of losing anyone else she loves, like if she doesn't save them then it's her fault they died, even if that's not the case. 

But yeah, I'd say there's definitely a feeling like she can't make mistakes because of what you said. That she'll be judged against her family when she does, rather than judged as a teenager in ridiculously hard situations. 

I could be wrong but I feel like that's why Danielle delivers a lot of Hope's lines in a kind of monotone way. People seem to think it's new these last few episodes but she's done it before, since S1 really. I think it's like a defensive thing, like when she's feeling strong emotions she has to kind of keep her guard up because she's aware of how volatile certain members of her family were when emotional, so she kind of tries to keep the emotions internal. I could be miles off there, but it's just my own personal theory.",1612137703

There is an actual discussion here lol?

Unless you use super expensive ingredients and throw away leftovers which is just wasteful. Im honestly astonished how often I read Reddit and they mention casually in their post they eat out 2-3 times a week or even every day!

"polymer80","t5_hwlqv","Not OP, but the first thing that comes to mind would be the trial and error process for getting the positioning of the dot or line correct on the back of your optic. 

Think about the process for adjusting for windage. (Assuming you're using a paint pen) paint the line, shoot a group, and if you're lucky your POI is POA. If not, erase the line, re-draw a little to the left or a little to the right, etc.

It's going to be trial and error for windage ajustment, and on top of that, if you just stick the ""dot"" on your front sight on top of the line that you drew on the back of your optic, how do you know what the zero distance is? It'll depend on ammo and front sight height in conjunction with the height of the base of the optic.

**to play devil's advocate** even though it's not widespread system, there are optics that take your idea and put it into practice, such as the Leupold DPP, with it's rear sight insert, or the Holosun 507k with the makeshift rear sight on the back of the base of the optic. Granted their rear iron solutions are still more permanent than a dot or line drawn on the optic.

**TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT: If you practice with it you can make it work.**

**An alternative** is that it is somewhat viable to use the window of the optic as a sort of rear sight in conjunction with the front iron to make a decent sight picture. HOWEVER, this is only viable after you're familiar with the sight picture and you have consistent presentation already.

Familiarity with the sight picture and consistent presentation (ie good muscle memory) come with shooting thousands of rounds.

I'm not encouraging you to stay the course. i would still encourage you to buy BOTH a front and rear iron, if you're going to bother with iron sights.",1612137705

Since being diagnosed in my mid 30‚Äôs, I‚Äôve gone looking for a life system that works well for how I‚Äôm built. I‚Äôm finding that the practices of Buddhism are an amazing system to live by, whether one wants to call it a religion or just pre-modern psychology. 

I found a therapist and we took on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It has taught me to sit with emotions. It has taught me to un-fuse with emotions, it has taught me to explore consciousness and quiet meditation. The results so far have been miraculous. Emotions don‚Äôt bite, anxiety does not exist. And meditation puts my brain into order for the day so much so that even my adhd quirks (like skin and noise sensitivity) are drastically improved for the day. 

And it‚Äôs cool to keep learning again and again that the things and practice that have fundamentally improved my life... are all there in Buddhism too. Plagiarism!! Haha. 

RAIN is highly similar to what I learned about fusing/bonding and then decoupling with feelings by being in the same room with them, via the book The Happiness Trap. 

Thanks for weighing in and teaching me something too :)",1612137705

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","This suggests to me you don't quite understand what sidechaining is. A side chain is an input to a dynamic effect (such as a compressor) which is used to choose the dynamics. Normally the input signal is used for this purpose (you can think of it as being it own side chain). Some effects allow the side chain audio to also be mixed into the signal, some don't.

For your purpose, you really need what's called a ""cross over"". It's a coupled filter pair that divides the signal into two, one that contains only the low end (i.e the kick) and another that contains the rest of the signal. You use ""the rest"" as the input to the effect and the low end as the side chain. If the effect allows the side chain audio to be mixed in, you are done, otherwise you need to mix the kick back in too.

The problem with the suggestion of splitting and low passing half is that in that case the kick would also be compressing itself. This might be usable, but won't give exactly the normal ""dance music side chain"" effect. If the electribe let's you pan sounds then potentially you could pan everything except the kick to one side and the kick to the others (cleaner than filtering/crossover).",1612137706

Fractals and other mathmatical concepts exist. 

They aren't caused by anything. 

They exist outside of time, their existence isnt related to time or dependent on time.

They dont take up space in the universe.

They dont exist as matter.

Finally, there is no reason to think that this type of existence only applies to mathmatical concepts.

"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","Never been a big sugar person either. In fact, it always gets remarked at family get togethesr when I almost always pass on dessert (fruit tart cakes/pies and occasionaly cheesecake if I'm in the mood I'll go for).  Pretty much the only regular sugar in my diet was Stella Dora cookies for quick breakfast (yeh I'm an Italian from New Jersey) Gatorade, Twizzlers, and Ketchup.  I was extremely active though.  Like 99% back then which would probably be 99.99999% today.   My daily snacks as a kid were always things like landjaeger (type of sausage) or cold cut sandwiches.

&amp;#x200B;

Active kids need cheap calories obviously, but they need to eat vegetables to balance that out. I always ate a ton of carrots and dinner always had a salad or other veggies.  Most people don't even throw those on the table anymore, just pre-processed crap.  I like to do my working out and shopping late at night. There was a Walmart next to my gym so I'd usually go there for dry goods as I'd never buy meat/chicken there, but blew my mind how many people on food stamps I see that would buy all this crap. And that shit isn't cheap either for what it is.  The time issues I don't get either, most shit cooks itself. You don't need to be making 5 star dishes. Shit you can buy a rotisserie chicken and boil in bag rice/potatoes and you literally don't have to do anything.

The way people are dealing with the need for more flexibility is actually not by changing laws around conservation easements, it's to write adaptive management into the management plan that is part of the conservation easement. Adaptive management has a very specific meaning in this context - it requires review and approval by resource agencies such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service to update management plans, and approval is dependent upon a thorough and scientifically sound reasoning for updating plans specifically for the purpose of resource conservation. Updates that are not in the best interest of conservation are not allowed. Approval of the updates is not up to the landowner, they are up to the government agencies and the easement holder, which is likely the non-profit that sold Ikea the land in this case. So while Ikea is the landowner, they do not get to decide how the land is managed and they do not get to decide when it's a good idea to change the plans. They are just taking on the legal obligation and financial burden of implementing the conservation plan.",1612137707

Although I still doubt the fisherman is the missing yaksha since apparently the yakshas are forever bound by their karmic debt so they are always suffering. I doubt just throwing away their vision would remove this and it seems as if the fisherman is at peace living a normal life. 

The trailer also kind of hinted that the other yaksha is most likely the one that went into the darkness (most likely the electro one).

Super President is an American animated cartoon that aired Saturday mornings on NBC from September 16, 1967 to December 28, 1968. The series was produced by the DePatie‚ÄìFreleng animation company.In the show, the President of the United States has extraordinary superpowers, including increased strength and the ability to change his molecular composition, and uses them to protect the free world, as well as his hapless Vice President. The show was relentlessly criticized for its bad taste and low quality, and was cancelled after thirty episodes, midway through its second season.

And I think that's made painfully obvious by the HUGE gap in things like day one raid clears on PC vs. Console. Especially when TWICE as many people play on console. PC is just way easier right now. And a LOT of that has to do with the almost total lack of recoil on PC. 

And you can't really argue that Console recoil is where it should be when there are raids that literally have ZERO day one clears on Console. You can't tell me that is working as intended.

If a company decides to swim in that ocean it most definitely must be aware that you accept the reality of sharks being in the very same ocean. Sharks serve a purpose just like short sellers serve a purpose. I think it‚Äôs part of the beauty of being in a free market. Shortsellers spot opportunity on a company who has a business model that is out dated and going out of business such as GME then I personally feel there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. The short sellers are not the reason a company goes out of business....poor management or out dated business models are because you don‚Äôt even need a highschool diploma to know GameStop is on the way out. Nobody I know physically buys video games and you can get all the accessories online.

"pregnant","t5_2qwzb","Hey! FTM with a 2 week old chunker here. I felt the same way you did before going into labor and I had a lot of anxiety around knowing when to go to the hospital. I would talk to my doctor about it at every prenatal visit because I was convinced that I wouldn‚Äôt know when to go since I never experienced labor before and I tend to have bad luck lol. I ended up going to the hospital at 11 PM the day before I gave birth because I thought my water broke when I got up to pee. I was CONVINCED it broke because each time I would stand up off the toilet and I already emptied my bladder I would hear liquid coming out. I also had some pink tinted fluid on the toilet paper (sorry, TMI) so I thought that was odd. Never lost my mucus plug to my knowledge so I called L&amp;D just to be safe. They asked me to come in, telling me it sounded like my water broke. Within 15 mins of calling I started having mild contractions, so I woke my husband up and we headed to the hospital. Starting out the contractions just honestly felt like back cramps, I barely felt them in the front. They were definitely uncomfortable but I found relief bending over and bearing all my weight on our dining room table. I was shocked to learn upon being triaged that my water didn‚Äôt break, but I was definitely having contractions when they hooked me up to the monitor. I stayed at the hospital for two hours being monitored, and at this point my contractions were around 4.5 mins apart. I was told by my OB on multiple occasions that I would need to head to the hospital once they were under 5 mins apart, so I was a little upset when L&amp;D decided to discharge me anyway, stressing that I was only 1 CM dilated and first time labors were ‚Äúa looong process.‚Äù I knew in my gut I wasn‚Äôt comfortable going home, but I chalked it up to me just being scared as a first time mom so instead of fighting their plan for discharge, I decided to head back home and labor there. Before discharge I asked how I‚Äôll know when to come back since my contractions were already under 5 mins, letting them know about all the anxiety I was having in general about this for the weeks leading up to labor. They convinced me ‚Äúyou‚Äôll know when to come back.‚Äù Ok, fair enough. Turned around and drove 35 miles back home and labored there for about 2.5 hours until I honestly could not stand it anymore and nothing was helping. At this point the contractions felt like a gradual intensity that started off slow and progressed quickly to a pain that felt like my spine and abdomen were being squeezed by a giant snake (that‚Äôs the best way I can describe it, it took my breath away which made it difficult to breathe through the wave). I honestly thought I was being a huge baby about the pain and my husband begged me to call L&amp;D back, so I did apprehensively thinking I was being overly paranoid since I was told it would be a long process and I just left less than 3 hours ago. They told me to come back in and during the car ride my contractions progressed to a minute apart and I had the intense urge to push like I was going to crap myself. I was internally freaking out but trying not to panic cause I didn‚Äôt want to scare my husband who was driving the car, especially after he spent an hour trying to convince me to go back to the hospital but I refused lol. We had to stop every few feet walking from the parking garage to the ED entrance because the contractions were coming so fast and strong I couldn‚Äôt push through them. In retrospect I probably could have used a wheelchair at that point like my husband was urging me to do but hi, hello, stubborn üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As soon as I got back to L&amp;D looking as white as a ghost they checked me and I was at 8 CM üòÇ needless to say I wasn‚Äôt happy since all of this happened in such a short timeframe despite having my feelings minimized by being told multiple times that labor would take forever solely because I was a first time mom. Moral of the story is, follow your gut! I wish I would have advocated for myself more at the hospital when I showed up the first time and my labor experience probably would have been completely different (I describe my birth experience as positive overall but slightly traumatic just because of the sense of urgency that took place once I was admitted which I was not prepared for). At the end of the day I was still able to get the epidural (10/10 recommend) and birthed a 9 LB healthy baby boy after 3 hours of pushing the day before his due date and two days before my scheduled induction. You got this mama! Just don‚Äôt be stubborn like I was lol üíï",1612137711

&gt;Even mounted to a tripod with in-body stabilization and Optical SteadyShot stabilization built into the telephoto lens, I noticed the A7R III struggled to nail a tack-sharp photo; fighting against the frigid night, the camera would lock autofocus but then often lose it the split-second I pressed the shutter button. I later switched to manual focusing, but the sharpness was even worse than auto.

It's not as bad as Huawei, I agree, which actually retextures the moon, but there's a moon-specific machine learning in the camera software used to make the moon sharper. 

&gt;Under this scenario, the camera will use deep AI leading algorithm to enhance texture details and restoration. Based on this, no photo substituting is performed.

I think it does show the moon accurately enough, and sharpens the moon, that you can't consider it nearly as fake as Huawei's moonshots, but you can't say ""debunked"" without actually reading that article.",1612137712

Sure, you used to hear ""to thw moon"" a lot, but show me any crypto where it's not said.
I love my doge, and I like to donate it to people who have helped me, amused me, etc.

One thing I'd recommend for drafting this format in general is prioritizing flyers/the ability to make things have flying. You can be aggro on the ground in Kaldheim, but it seems that more mid-range/value/control decks can place 3-5 drops down that have 4-5 toughness reliably. In a format where burn to the face is nearly nonexistent, this poses and issue in scenarios where your curve on the ground is not the absolute best it can be.

Conversely, have many more flyers than your opponent seems to do wonders in Kaldheim. White/Blue are the best at this. There's not much reach (only 1 spider and 1 elf with reach), so flyers are likely to get through. Either having your own flyers, a plan to deal with them, or an even stronger win condition, is critical imo.",1612137712

* ‚ñ¢ 1 pound  (453.59 g) chicken tenderloins
* ‚ñ¢ 1 egg
* ‚ñ¢ 1/2 cup almond flour 
* ‚ñ¢ 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* ‚ñ¢ 1 teaspoon pepper 
* ‚ñ¢ 1/2 teaspoon chili powder

### Instructions

* In a small, relatively flat bowl, beat the egg.
* In a ziptop bag, mix the almond flour, salt, pepper, and seasoning.
* Get a paper plate or dinner plate ready.
* Spray your air fryer basket with oil.
* Dip  each tender in the egg and place on the plate until all the tenders  have been dipped. Don't try to dip it in the breading or else you'll  have messy hands and clumps in the breading. Just line up the eggy  tenders until they're all ready.
* Now  use a fork to pick up one tender at a time. Put that in the zip top bag  and shake that bag like you mean it. Ensure the tenders are well  covered in the almond mixture.
* Do NOT dip in egg and breading again. Tried it. Hugely messy and less tasty.
* Use the fork to pull out that tender and place it in your air fryer basket.
* Spray the tenders with oil.
* Cook at 400F for 12 minutes or until the inside registers 160F.",1612137713

The writing and characterization was just so damn good.                     
                 
My negative bias towards the show clouding my judgement but I just don't think the writing was as good on LOK (for the worldbuilding, and sure as hell not for the characters). I feel like they used a lot of ""cheap"" methods in order to try and fulfill certain things and it just never felt as well thought out. All of that was disappointing to me.",1612137713

"CPS","t5_2srim","&gt;My main question is what‚Äôs next ? Are they going to come back demanding a drug test ? If so, will they take my child because I have weed in my system ?

They may come back and ask for a drug test again, but generally you don't have to comply unless they have a court order or warrant. And generally, having smoked weed is not an automatic removal. Each state handles marijuana differently, and some are more aggressive than others. But children are not supposed to be removed unless they can't remain safely in the home. Having smoked weed generally doesn't mean the child is unsafe- think about alcohol as a comparison. A parent can drink alcohol without it being dangerous, but it also can be abused and problematic. 

&gt;Also, will they just randomly show up again ? Or will they be in contact with me first ? (I gave her all my contact info)

They may do unannounced visits.

&gt;The caseworker had my boyfriends (child‚Äôs father) name on file and didn‚Äôt have mine (I‚Äôve been my child‚Äôs main provider his whole life, NOT my boyfriend.)

I even tried deleting my W2's. Sure enough the savers credit form is still there with no way to delete. When I re-entered my W2 information I was hoping it wouldn't pull from them, but it did.

I personally do not think this battle to hold long positions in these stocks is over just yet if the squeeze is to work as intended. Expect intense downward pressure to continue until they have to close positions. Another question is what happens if hedge funds are forced to liquidate long positions held in other stocks and assets to raise capital to cover substantial losses from the short squeeze? Will the broader market start unraveling as billions in assets are offered at fire auction prices in an illiquid market? Think 2008 stock market crash. Just some things I have been pondering.

But when you factor in for human nature, and that anarchism gives **unlimited** power to people, anarchism creates a power vacuum that's going to be filled. And when it's filled, what you have is a smaller-scale dictatorship. The only difference between anarchism and totalitarianism would be size. Instead of one dictator controlling a large plot of land, you'd have many dictators controlling smaller plots of land.

The only way to 'win' in either system is to hope you were born as the dictator, or as someone the dictator likes.",1612137715

"attackontitan","t5_2vnp9","I had this idea in my head after the conversation between Eren and Reiner for ""Declaration of War"" but after this episode with conversations between Falco and Gabi along with Eren and Levi it is now certain: this show is great. I know this is an obvious statement but here me out.

I became a big fan of Game of Thrones and one thing that always stood out is that you cared about the conversations just as much, if not more than, the combat. There was no filler because each scene just added another brick to the path the story was following. Not only that, but you always felt excited when two characters who you know well finally meet, whether it's their first time meeting or it's a long-awaited reunion. 

AOT has become just that. The back-and-forth dialogue between Eren and Reiner showed the regrets Reiner still has along with the undying rage Eren feels. Falco telling Gabi the true reason why their friends died and her ignoring this information shows a dark path in her future if left unchanged. Levi scolding Eren while also filling the viewers in on the fact that no one wanted this to happen leaves even more room for conflict. At this point I don't care if there's an epic showdown, what I want to see is a genuine debate between Eren and Gabi and hopefully a revelation showing that they're really two sides of the same coin. That is why I think this show is great, and it's been a while since I've felt that way about any of the shows I've watched in the past few years.",1612137715

I'm assuming you have a decent grinder.  Once you're sure you like it, then they sell 5 and ten packs. I bought a 5 pack which gives me 7 capsules which usually is one day's worth for me. That's because I only use caffeinated beans in them and I limit to 6 or 7 max a day.  I also drink decaf in the late afternoon and evening, but those are actual Nespresso capsules (I'm not gonna clean out the grinder every time I switch over, a main reason I went with this system).   You'll have to estimate how many you will use per day.  Then decide if you want to set them all up the night before or do a couple days at a time.  That should guide you in terms of # of sealpods.  Just remember to be patient as you learn to dial in the grind/tamp to get a good result.

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","Way way op, your level 3 ability is pretty similar to the *capstones* of Shadow and Drunken styles. It‚Äôs a really powerful ability to also get to swing back as a reaction, especially at level 3 (so from early on through an entire career adventuring). This needs revision.

The level 6 is blatantly overstuffed. 15ft blindsight is very strong, paying 1 ki to Vow of Emnity basically any creature (up to 6 times per short rest) seems like an entire cake on top of the cake, instead of icing. 


The level 11 encouraging you to dump Con and be rewarded by boosting your wis seems fairly strong, and *then* you staple on an added Evasion effect. Way way too strong.

I like the capstone (buff blind aura range and give resistance to damage from marked targets), but jumping up to 4 targets at a time seems totally unneeded. Maybe 2 at a time if you really want to upgrade it, but 4 is way more than would ever be needed.

You have some great thoughts here, I‚Äôd just refocus your concept around a more reasonable power level. You‚Äôre also missing *any* social/exploration features, which are nice ribbons to add to make the subclass interesting. 

Hope to see revisions of this in the future.",1612137716

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","50% reduction - thinking behind it was that more experienced players would still kill them, but having just a little longer ttk would at least let new players exchange fire, thus getting used to the weapons. The benefit would be clearly stated as enabling players to take more damage while focusing of accuracy, recoil etc. and that it will go away. Besides - it is equippable item.

50% cert cost reduction - yeah, someone could spawn tanks for their squad, but realistically what are the odds someone is going to create a brand new account (not just character) to do it each time? New players tend to pull expensive stuff just to lose it, and this would give some more room for errors. Ideal? No. Encouraging and supportive? Maybe.

Implant - not sure, but mostly passive stuff that raises awareness, including counterintelligence, or maybe a new implant with unique functionality altogether.

&gt; The Aminwahr(unique name but how do you say it) crusades were a war earth fought against colonies the separated from it and started their own religion

The Aminwahr (pronouced a-MIN-waar) originated in one of humanity's colonies. The Crusades were fought because the Aminwahr believed their ancestors were wrong to have uplifted so many species and had created unnecessary competition and conflict in the galaxy. Because the Sol system was the epicenter of uplifting, it was one of their primary targets.

&gt; The hoag's object was discovered by professor Jessica Hoag.

The Hoag's Object was actually discovered by Arthur Hoag in 1950. It's [a real galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoag%27s_Object).",1612137718

"bigdickproblems","t5_2sqd6","I have to disagree in some of your statements:

""If it's a boy, the thing is most of the boys at this age almost dream to be approached for sex from an older women""

Not really, don't get me wrong horny teenagers are thing (and heavily depends on a person, some crave sex from young age, some start to want it later) but it's regardless of gender. If you think that girls that age are not horny, well they really are just talk about this topic with any woman that is open enough to you and see yourself. All humans are sexual creatures, however at that age it's just a DREAM as you said and that dream is really really like really disconnected from reality, like if you had long relationships you should know how much communication there is needed for both people to fulfill their sexual needs and that is even in mature age. Also I'm not going to speculate about fetishes but I really doubt that  most boys are into MILFs, from what info I remember from my teenage years most wanted to have sex with girls their age from school \\ neighboorhood etc.

""Yes, it's true, that might not actually be really healthy for the kid in the future""

No it won't be really healthy in the present as well, just read comments on r/AskReddit on posts about sexual assault on males. This can really fuck with adults brain even.

""Most of the girls at this age are probably still virgin and are really really insecure about sex""

Absolutely the same with boys.

"" So from this perspective, you can't quite argue for gender equality in this particular case, just because the experiences between the genders will be massively different on average. ""

Look there is no true equality in the nature, every human has different qualities from muscle mass to facial features. Yes even genders are different and men for example have greater potential in gaining physical strength, first example is combat sports where there was precedents with trans women beating the hell out of top tier female fighters. So yes genders are not different by nature. HOWEVER, we as humans in order to build this civilization and society made up such things as rules. There are legal rules such as law and there is moral rules that is unwritten but much more broad, both are not stale and as time goes by they develop and evolve. And that is what needed to make our society even better: we shouldn't treat eachother inequally when it comes to toxic, abusive and violent behavior and interactions, we shouldn't treat rapists any different, we also shouldn't ignore the mental health of kids that get raped, we shouldn't let females shame or abuse men with no consequences, same thing applies to women.",1612137719

you can take on squads in buildings. holding angles doesn't work in this game because of peekers advantage. play fast. swing corners quickly. it's difficult but you can do it. also most buildings are big enough you can get in and get out even if a squad is in there. dorms on customs being a minor exception.

to loot as a solo learn where everyone else spawns. learn where people will be at any given point in the raid based on those spawns. for instance: on shoreline if you spawn up in the hills behind the resort on rock passage side you can get into the resort and loot almost an entire wing before anyone else will be there, usually. play smart. go where people wont be. or, go where they will be and prepare to kill them.

again, as for tasks, learn to anticipate where people will be. you would be surprised about how much time you have when you rush exactly where you need to go.

play smart or play aggressive as a solo. it's not impossible.

West Texas, 1892. When Texie Cortez's father dies from a bad batch of coleslaw, she inherits his job: Sheriff of Abalone, Texas. 

She's proud of how she keeps both gunslingers and cowpokes in order. Then *he* shows up. 

Slick, handsome gambler Alec Malone takes one look at Texie and surrenders to his womanizing ways. But beneath all his dazzle he's hiding a mysterious secret. 

When an outlaw gang shows up, Texie and Alec must team up to capture the weirdest outlaws in the Old West--if they can stop bickering long enough.",1612137719

But it's the only explanation that makes any kind of literal, thematic, or emotional sense to me‚Äîi.e. that game mechanics and boss fights and all that aside this is a story about a deeply disturbed man undergoing his own personal grieving process, and every creative decision seems to stem from that.

Grief is a really strange, powerful kind of madness which everybody experiences at some point in their life. It's a perfect theme to pair with a series that's fundamentally about liminal states and dream logic, which is why SH2 resonates with so many people two decades later in a way its predecessor doesn't despite being (WARNING: OPINION INCOMING) not quite as good of a game overall.

I'm actually replaying the series (or as much of it as I can stand to) right now after about a 10-year absence, and I'm particularly looking forward to SH2. Because when I last played it, I could most charitably be described as having the emotional IQ of a used condom.

V-Rex? It would take some effort, he couldn't rip it apart like most things. It would be more like a boss but he'd still kill it.

R2: He could kill the smaller Skull Crawlers without much difficulty. Sticky bombs, micro missiles and whatnot could take them down. They wouldn't go down super easy but I feel like they'd die easier than the V-Rex

They might not actually convict her of the bombing of the Jedi temple, but as long as they can run some adverts that make it look like she did it, then the Jedi would not protect her.  The Jedi council does not want people to think that they are opposing the senate.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","So it's okay to strip people of their *human* right to bodily autonomy because of the non existent right to not have your feelings hurt. Okay, got it....

Pulling from your comment below:

&gt; The fetus does. Everybody was once a fetus, and they deserved to be in a womb, and so does fetuses today. 

Fetuses don't have feelings. They don't even have a formed prefrontal cortex till at least 24 weeks. The womb keeps the fetus sedated at all times with 80% oxygen level and hormones. They are incapable of feeling anything, let alone fear or the will to live...

Fetuses are not entitled to someone's body.

But you know where that belief stems from? The centuries long precedent that men were entitled to women's bodies, especially their wives and future wives. Hence purity culture and hence marital rape not being recognized until the modern day. 

Men are not entitled to women's vagina's and children are not entitled to their mother's wombs.

If they are entitled to it, then why aren't you raping the shit out of women and impregnating them? That couldn't POSSIBLY be a crime if their children are entitled to their mother's wombs after all.

Choosing to give your body to someone out of love and desire to be a mother is what makes pregnancy beautiful. Just like the same goes for sex. If it's forced, sex becomes perverse and vile and we name it rape. The same is true of forcing pregnancy. It is no longer beautiful. It is perverted and vile.",1612137721

As a person who built several apps with each having at least 60 pages and ~60different data models in flutter I can very confidently say that for smaller apps (10-20pages) - any dev on flutter will do the work. But when it comes to more - then flutter and dart becomes a craft. Because poor data structure in the beginning (which is influenced by state management) will influence slow buildup in the future product increment stages and extremely limit scalability factor. That's where business owners will spend much more money because developers will take more time to develop.

For me, it's all about scalability and implementing, iterating very fast. My specialisation is MVP development and moving fast and without any hickups is the end goal. As it will let my clients spend less and have more.",1612137721

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Here's my 2 cents. Keep in mind im inspired hugely by guitarist like frusciante and hendrix so clean playing for me may be different for you or someone else etc.

  


String muting is really powerful. Being able to play exactly what note you want while still hitting many strings is super useful for playing a lot of different kind of music. Look at pretty much and song by hendrix or any work from frusciante and you'll see how clean it sounds even though they're hitting every string. For the most part atleast.

  


There are still times where you need to just hit one string, and the way to get better at that is to ""just practice"". Put a song on or a metronome and pick a key and practice skipping strings/hitting single notes/etc. One thing that helped me improve that style of playing (which admittedly I'm not the best at, I'd rather just mute what I dont need to hit but sometimes that's not an option) is to put a metronome on, pick a key, and try to only hit one note per string then switch strings while staying in time. Just start slow with it and results will come faster then you think. Rome wasn't built in a day etc etc.",1612137722

You should also take note of the inscription at Auschwitz was meant as an insult. They were only ‚Äúfree‚Äù when they worked themselves to death. The Nazis would never let them leave alive.  It was a sick joke in that instance. 

I was just pointing out the parallel. That this conception that it is okay for people to go without healthcare in the US because they‚Äôre lazy or whatever, can be compared directly to one of the most heinous and infamous pieces of Nazi propaganda.

Edit: how the fuck are we supposed to prevent that from happening again, if every parallel to that ideology is shot down as disrespectful or disgraceful or whatever?

Not everyone has the social skills, wealth, or intuition to be amazing at what they do. They work just as hard as everyone else but they're left with little and end up seriously struggling through life. Society shouldn't have any losers. Whoever is willing to put some effort in and make their living shouldn't have to worry about paying off basic necessities. If they want the fastest Lamborghini or latest iPhone then that deserves being driven and ""exceeding at everything in their field"". It shouldn't need to deserve the right to have your own place, no matter how small, nor the right to have enough to eat or pay medical bills.

Koinly is AMAZING. It keeps track of your entire trade history. And remembers where your coins are. If you have exchange/wallet adhd like I do it's essential. You can sync it with most exchanges/wallets. Some you have to manually upload your trade history but it's easy.  

anyway it's good for taxes. It will calculate your capital gains/losses. It's totally free to use but you have to pay for the tax stuff if you have more than 100 trades for the year IIRC? but the average person won't pay more than $99 for the tax stuff. ($49 or $99 depending on how many trades you do, more if you're a pro)

&gt;Also just because a guy is feminine that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs gay. Gender and sexuality are not based on how you look like.

I think most intelligent people agree with this. There are plenty of individuals who challenge gender norms and have done for a while. Look at David Bowie in the 70s/80s for example.

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","&gt;his is what I am talking about. If you are gauging the design quality of Bayformers on the same rubric as the G1 Transformers, they will fail.

And that was only my *last* point. I didn't grow up on classic Transformers so I didn't hold stake in being G1 accurate. I included that point because 'accuracy to the source material' is a valid means to judge the quality of a product, but I already outlined other metrics they were lacking in.

&gt;This stands for both silhouettes and color as well. You can't simply judge a character's design on base metrics like that without taking in the greater contexts of what's at play.

Those *are* the 'greater contexts at play'. This is basic character design rules; use of colour and distinct silhouetting are important aspects of designing characters. The messy, indistinguishable silhouettes of the robots is *bad design work* because it makes the characters gel together and become unremarkable. This is why even super-teams with matching uniforms give each character completely distinct looks.

&gt;Like I said, I am not a fan of these designs, but to call them objectively bad and to say there isn't value in them is just blind hatred. These versions of the characters did resonate with some people, I am just not one of them.

Here's the thing, you're making the assumption I'm a blind Bayformers hater. I *grew up* on Bayverse. These were *my* Transformers as a kid. I was the 'kind of person' these 'resonated' with...but they 'resonated' with me because it was flashing explosions and action scenes.

Chromebook has a special hardware mechanism (CR-chip for laptops and Google Titan for servers) that absolutely guaranteed to prevent any tampering of firmware). Unlike default UEFI in common computers have some flawns. 

Moreover even after secure booting (thier bootloader rely on open source Coreboot bios) of trusted and sig checked OS image, OS still checking at all runtime. 

Moreover, every process runs on isolated cgroup, even every tab in browser runs on cgroup.

Top models have a native Android and Linux apps subsystem. Particularly, for other Linux apps they made special virtual machine based on LXD (ubuntu industrial lightweight virtual machines) with itself hardening tweaks. 

Chromebook non hackable indeed neither by USB nor WiFi/Eth. 

Moreover chromebooks have a powerwash reset mechanism - reset device to prime (factory) state by per byte copying/restoring OS image from hardware readonly ROM.

All user data on disk is permanent encrypted. 

Some laptop models have hardware key on power button for FIDO2 WebAuth standart, like Yubikey.

All telemetry is disabling on settings and first setup agreements. But you avoid from ghost ""hackers"" not from corps, is right?

Google announce a very big bounty for any hacking Chromebook but it still (many years) not claimed. 

I read your many posts and no doubt you have some mental disorder. UEFI implants is rare but reality. But information leaks thru AC/DC poweline is true paranoia, physical modulation AC and DC currents needs special gateway device instead power charger, just change it from default vendor to any universal charger for excluding any concerns.

By the way, Google pixel (smartphone) has the similar harware chip for integrity checking firmware and os image.",1612137726

Those crucial kits are generally the only kits with micron E-dies. if you can't find reviews of a specific kit that states that it's dual rank, get the cheapest crucial kit that's rated at 3000MHz or above and hope that it's dual rank. or get 2 sets of 2x8GB (4 single rank sticks running together =  guaranteed dual rank.)

BTW, those crucial kits are for people who plan on overclocking so, if you don't plan on doing that get the cheapest standard 32Gb 3200MHz Cl16 kit. Micron/crucial is the only brand I know that has 2x16GB single rank RAM kits.",1612137726

My only concern is that the doctors diagnosing them seem very sketchy and I worry they are diagnosing things they aren't qualified to, to justify treatments and getting money from patients.

"bodyweightfitness","t5_2tf0a","\&gt;  Yes, its hardly believable and seems like a huge amount of muscle to you because you don't provide your body enough energy to promote muscle growth. 

Who fucking hurt you bro? 

You sound so dogmatic due to merely questioning the mainstream views. If I'm wrong then explain to me why I'm wrong. My argument isn't solely dependant on the example I gave and if you read any of my other responses in this post you'd see that it's a multi-faceted issue. I gave a simple example to put it into perspective and you then criticise my example for being too simplistic? There is a better way to argue against a proposition you know than not being a total fucking asshole. You spend way too much time on reddit. You think that everyone who posts on here is some warrior of the internet. I'm trying to explain my views and you shoot them down with so much passive aggressiveness and vindictiveness. What I talk about has no bearing on what other people do. As I have said multiple times this isn't some false dichotomy, everyones bodies are different. The title of the post is 'Bulking isn't necessary to make muscle/strength gains'. That is essentially it in a nutshell. This much vigorous dogma is so unnecessary",1612137726

Mario Maker 2 is on the list and I've decided to go through 10 Super Worlds on Reddit as a way to validate the hard work of content creators. They're only on Facebook, but after a game is complete, I do a little write-up on the finished game to self reflect and talk myself through the experience of completion. 

It's kind of a way to A.) be financially responsible right now and B.) play the games that are metaphorically collecting dust, and get my money's worth. 

Originally I was going to make a Super World myself, but if I were to do it right, it would take months and months of work (like it probably did for you) 

I don't really have the time to dedicate to a full-fledged world, but I figured if I completed, say, 10 Worlds or so, then I got some great mileage out of MM2. 

And I think creators would appreciate someone playing through their levels and providing solid, long-form critique. I've only made a handful of levels, and just that alone was an incredible endeavor.",1612137726

And the ones who didn‚Äôt ghost me tended to be incredibly insensitive to my own childless predicament. They‚Äôd go on and on about their pregnancies knowing my only pregnancies ended in loss and heart ache. They‚Äôd tease me at baby showers for ‚Äúprobably feeling SO uncomfortable with all the mommy talk! Hehe!‚Äù 

Now, when trying to make new friends, I immediately feel hesitant if I found out someone has kids. Even women who are complete strangers feel the need to ask ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you have kids and don‚Äôt you want them and you must have SO much time on your hands! What do you even do with all your free time?!‚Äù Being childless can be very lonely and isolating. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this too.",1612137727

"algeria","t5_2qihd","I‚Äôm quite well read on the topic of history, which is why I dispute both of what you and louiai said. It‚Äôs quite laughable to consider the Ottoman Empire the zenith of Islamic civilization. They had some early gains but for the most part they did exactly what I described, they rested on their laurels and did not innovate.

They looked to countries like France and Germany and aligned themselves with them, giving away massive concessions to the former in the levant for instance (see:capitulations of the Ottoman Empire) which led to a massive decline. Ie they considered themselves so great that they simply bought everything from the foreigners and didn‚Äôt look to develop themselves. 

By ww1, there was but one factory which produced weapons in the entirety of the empire, everything else was bought from the outside because it did not innovate. They rested on their laurels as I previously stated and preserved the status quo. If you want to be more specific, I can say that Ottoman decline began following the death of Sultan Suleiman. 

As for traditionalism and the Ottoman Empire, it‚Äôs incorrect to call them traditionalist when considering their ideology and their reverence of the Sufi orders in the region for example, or their own religious practices which were divorced from mainstream ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Islamic practices. They employed a laissez faire approach with respect to religion and tolerated minorities via the Millet system which was unconventional at the time. 

Lastly, it‚Äôs laughable that certain people believe that the path of development lies between a woman‚Äôs legs and what she wears on her head. Development does not come from mathar, but from decolonizing ones mind and heart, removing corruption, ensuring transparency, and ensuring the rule of law. Every law is made for its time, yet principles are universal. Unfortunately Islamists don‚Äôt understand this and want hand cutting, head chopping, and to control how people dress and who thy talk to. Meanwhile the same people would happily accept bribes.",1612137729

After reading everything, I‚Äôve considered trading options, especially for AMD, but considering the time frames and having them either naked or covered (which you just taught me) were never considered.the only knowledge I had was from reading some articles from google and from robinhood‚Äôs options which were pretty simple, but were extremely risky considering what I had to lose in contrast to what I could gain. So far, trading on margin is also a risky feat, especially if you have lots to lose. I would say I have a fairly decent risk tolerance, but at the same time, I want to be able to enter the market with the right amount of knowledge to understand both concepts and timeframes prior to making awful decisions. Like why not just toss money into a Roth IRA for now and potentially gain an easy let‚Äôs say 6-8% from index funds? But at the same time, that‚Äôs like the safe choice which my risk seeking behavior would not be satisfied by lol... I guess it just comes down to appropriately dispersing the money to the rich accounts at the end of the day, just as you had put it.

When your pet is sick and has to be hospitalized is not the best time for him/her to be in a crate for the first time in their life.  If they are comfortable in crate/cage at least that will not be an added stress.  Cats quite like their carriers if you leave them out to play/sleep in they‚Äôll feel more comfortable in the car ride in.

It‚Äôs amazing how much familiarity with something will decrease the stress for the pets.  I have a patient that is generally scared/nervous when he comes in.  Even even hates getting weighed on the baby scale we have for smaller pets.  There came a point where we needed to closely monitor his weight so his owner purchased a baby scale and weighs him regularly.  Guess who‚Äôs not afraid to get weighed any more?!",1612137731

Tolerance is higher if, say, 14 is needed after reforge.

If you want 18+, get ready to give up early and often.

Reds need a decent speed roll at +6, and no more than one non-speed roll at +12. Meaning you can go at +6 immediately, then 3 at a time.

Purple need speed on every roll to +9 since you're getting something else at +12. So roll to +3 and give up if it's not speed. Two low speed rolls will likely mean it still has to be scrapped.

Blue gear should not be rolled at all if you're looking for anything over 12 spd.

Good luck, and welcome to the grind.",1612137731

As for TFT being for mega guilds and munchkins, I disagree. I have made 15 ex this league, and 7 were from selling harvest crafts, being the only 10 crafts/services I've ever sold. It feels really good to get consistent income and to contribute to other people's big projects.

"brexit","t5_33mm8","Firstly I wholly disagree with the idea that triggering A16 was appropriate, it was wildly inappropriate and politically damaging, it was idiocy of the highest order and imo a sign of Von Der Leyen's incompetence that the Germans had warned us about.

&amp;#x200B;

That said

&gt;If AZ have been sending doses from the two EU plants to the U.K.

From [this](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/health-pharma/supply-of-covid-vaccine-doses-held-up-by-manufacturing-delays-1.4430676?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhealth-pharma%2Fsupply-of-covid-vaccine-doses-held-up-by-manufacturing-delays-1.4430676) article in the Irish times on 8th Dec, [outline here](https://outline.com/wRnmdF)

 

&gt;*A vaccine considered one of the world‚Äôs best hopes for combating coronavirus has become the second to be hit by manufacturing delays.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The UK government‚Äôs vaccines task force acknowledged that just four million doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford university and AstraZeneca would be delivered this year.* ***And they will all be imported from the Netherlands and Germany as plans for manufacture in England have been beset by delays****.* 

Now I understand how this can happen, with multiple facilities they probably stagger their scaling up process to allow some facilities to function with lower level productivity while increasing output elsewhere, but it is quite strange to be honest, particularly because the UK hadn't authorised the vaccine at that point, the only real reason to move it would be either fear of brexit red tape or to start fulfilling their order, but didn't the EU have an order put in too at that point? In which case moving it is a weird choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Tbh I've been busy with work all weekend so I have not followed the entire situation, but ever since this whole saga started something seemed off to me, nothing has made sense thus far.

"UniSwap","t5_2xd5z","Oh man haha, that tells it all right thurr.  Its the purpose of the coin, well that and community governance.  Uniswap was the biggest dex on the ethereum blockchain until other protocols started vampire attacking liquidity and competing dexs as well as other platforms started giving out governance tokens as rewards for staking on the platform, these tokens hold value because they allow you to vote on the future of the dapp.  Instead of being run by a single person or team decisions are made by voting on proposals put up by the community.

For the longest time uni did not have a governance token but one was rumored, well when an infamous dapp named sushiswap came to town and stole a good chunk of liquidity from uniswap they released the uni token, pretty much unannounced with an airdrop that was worth more than our stimulus checks, im some cases depending on what you did with it MUCH more.  Alongside that they introduced a farming program that allowed you to stake your LP tokens and mine uni as a reward.  This what allowed them to come back from that sushiswap attack as people clamered in to mine uni instead of sushi ... I think at one point uni was almost number 1 on defi pulse during that period.  Unfortunately it was a test run and only lasted about 2 months, we have been waiting since for the community and devs to introduce the next farming program, im honestly amazed that they still have not been able to pull something together.  

If you want to see more of what I am talking about and how these programs work check out sushiswap or bancor.  They are dexs just like uni but they continue to implement farming programs.  I personally have been using bancor and making almost 200 percent apy since the uni farming program ended.  You should check it out.

Sorry for bad spelling im on phone and don't want to edit.  You can track all these dapps on the defi pulse leader board BTW.",1612137733

"Connecticut","t5_2qji0","This always pissed me off.  Where I live ,there‚Äôs a large stretch of road with no houses, and over the summer someone was walking their dog, and it appeared that they were bagging the dog‚Äôs crap and then flipping it into the brambles on the stretch of road nobody lived on. By the time fall ran around, there were blue bags everywhere, dangling from branches and all over the ground. Myself and a neighbor cleaned it up, and I guess he busted the person doing it, put a trail cam there and then confronted them. It was some lady in the neighborhood, she just told him that her dog pooped right at the beginning of their walk and never saw the harm in doing it. Can‚Äôt believe someone could be that careless.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","as of TODAY there have been 25 deaths to covid-19 in NZ almost ONE YEAR later - however the Ruby Princess cruise ship which docked in NZ just before this occurred - had over 28 deaths whist docked in Sydney 

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Health authorities in Australia have been heavily criticised in an official inquiry into the Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus outbreak.**

The inquiry found ""serious errors"" by New South Wales Health in its handling of suspected cases on board.

All 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney in March without sufficient screening. More than 100 of them felt unwell.

At least 900 people later tested positive. Twenty-eight died.

The ship, carrying mostly Australian passengers, had completed an 11-day cruise from Sydney to New Zealand and back when it docked on 19 March.

The passengers - some seen coughing and spluttering - were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour, catching trains, buses and even overseas flights to get home.

La questions aussi, c'est qu'es qu'on veut ? Est-ce qu'on veut la continuit√© de cette soci√©t√© mais sans le racisme, o√π est-ce qu'on veut d√©truire cette soci√©t√©. Cette questions se retrouvent aussi au sein du mouvement f√©ministe. Avec des ""f√©ministes"" qui veulent plus de femmes aux postes de pouvoir et d'autres qui veulent d√©truire le pouvoir.
J'ai l'impression que ces oppositions sont souvent nomm√©s entre f√©ministe dite ""lib√©rale"" et f√©ministe dite ""radicale"" ou anarcha-f√©ministe.

&gt;Enterrar a la Fundaci√≥n Pensar que ahora controla Rodr√≠guez Larreta (de ahora en m√°s si hay que pensar, solo se piensa para uno); multiplicar la marca de Macri, como cuando las grandes compa√±√≠as ponen su nombre a cosas (el Allianz Arena, el Personal Fest); crear alineamientos r√°pidos detr√°s de actividades de su Fundaci√≥n para apurar a los que duden entre Macri y Larreta, pero sugiere tambi√©n algo m√°s contundente, que el PRO y Juntos por el Cambio ya no representen temas de conversaci√≥n graves y controversiales, _las reformas, del estado, judicial, laboral, previsional_ y los abordajes para las mismas, sobre los que ya no pueden ilusionar como ilusionaron, y sobre los que quiz√°s la elite opositora supone que ya no tienen arreglo; sino que solo proyecten un liderazgo providencial, de alternancia, un pastor celeste con saco de lino y esposa presentable, listo para reemplazar al peronista que reviente como un sapo por ineptitud.

Getting censored and deplatformed isn't very comfortable you genius 

&gt;45k people sat there and pushed a button, to sign a petition. Fine. Great. I signed it myself.

Nice deconstruction 

By this logic, literally anything in politics is ""saying some words, signing some papers. Fine. I did it myself"".

What a stupid criticism...

&gt;I guess you could call it ""organic"" to use the earnest and genuine enthusiasm for Medicare for All to boost your online profile. 

I'm pretty sure Jimmy dore gets demonetized anyway, so your point is moot. Even if he was raking in the money cnn does (or more), the thing is that that's not the issue with msm. The problem with msm is the anti competitive monopolies, and selling influence.

Corporate media isn't bad because its profitable, its bad because they try to monopolize the public square and then sell off the few remaining outlets to the highest bidder.

Back to the vote thing: 

Ok so various people that were pressured had themselves been critical of Pelosi, big proponents of m4a, and the idea was to use speaker votes as leverage for a forced vote.

Forcing the vote does not mean forcing the bill, its a symbolic move, much like the idiotic Trump impeachment.

And its not like it gets brought up every other week, it's an opportunity that comes AT MOST every two years.

My cousins drug of choice is crystal meth. He used it as a party/hookup drug. He has been sober for 5 months and had a slip up two weeks ago, ever since then he has been tweaking and lying about being sober. 

He was living a in a sober living home for 3 months before I allowed him to stay in my second bedroom. 

He was great until a friend came to visit from out of town and then everything he‚Äôs worked hard for went down the drain. 

I have the option to resign my lease and need to let my landlord know tomorrow. I have no use for two bedroom and was only going to keep it another year if he was making efforts to change. It‚Äôs clear he is not. I told him I would sign again if he took his sobriety seriously and maintained a job. 

He got a job, and was enrolling in school. Also going to the gym with me. 

He hasn‚Äôt been to work in a week.... claiming he has so much PTO from a job he started last month. 

This was his second chance living with me. He was kicked out previously for drug use and promised me it was going to be different and he was different. 

Currently he is in the bedroom tweaking. Singing, dancing, moaning, making weird sounds... I‚Äôm getting pissed just listening to him. 

Today I looked at one bedroom and will be signing the lease tomorrow. He will have 30 (well 28) days to find a new living situation. 

I told him before moving in that there will be a one strike policy. 

Last week when he told me he used, he promised he was done... but that was a lie. He said ‚Äúif you kick me out, it‚Äôll be pretty messed up of you‚Äù 

AITA for giving him a month or should I be more understanding? All friends and family have pretty much lost all patience for him.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","so space isnt empty, its filled with interstellar medium which is a fancy way of saying random gasses (mostly hydrogen of course, but oxygen is there) and dust and light the like.  Now this stuff is super spread out but it is existent.   Gasses that escape the atmosphere (and tons do so every day) join that stuff and also get really spread out.  and by really spread out we mean close enough to vacuum that we can consider it vacuum for most practical purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

Also temperature is a property of matter, while as stated above space does have matter, its close enough to vacuum we can consider it to not have matter for practical purposes, and therefor not have temperature, space is *not* cold.  two of the three forms of heat transfer require matter to matter contact, as vacuum lacks this, space is an excellent insulator.  That means hot things stay hot, cold things stay cold.   The remaining form of heat transfer (radiation) is all that is left, so an object will lose heat via black body radiation (emitting light, though not necessarily in the visible spectrum), and gain heat by absorbing radiation.    Eventually the amount of heat lost via black body and the amount absorbed will be the same and this equalized temperature does tend to be on the low side, but it takes a long time to get there.   Those sci fi shows who go ""oh no, they are going to freeze in seconds in outer space"" are full of it.

&amp;#x200B;

""But Spy, we have video of water turning to ice super fast when released into space"" I hear you say.  So when matter is under pressure it likes to go to its most dense form (typically solid, but with water liquid is the more dense), and when under vacuum its easier to be in its less dense forms.   In the case of water, in vacuum, the boiling point becomes much lower, and this water, released into space, boils.  As molecules bump into each other they transfer heat, so some are much hotter than others (the temperature you read on a thermometer or feel on your skin is the average, individual atoms/molecules vary a good bit). The more energetic molecules become gas and fly away, and as only the hotter molecules are doing so, the average temperature of the remaining molecules goes down. I dont recall if this is exactly evaporate cooling or just pretty similar.  So the water boils away, leaving the liquid portion colder and colder, until it freezes.    So when you put a kg of water into space, you dont end up with a kg of ice, you end up with a mass of steam, and the remainder of ice.  Because of this liquid water can not be natural found in a vacuum, it will be steam, or ice.

For sure! 

I think it's only natural, when faced with observations we can't explain, to ascribe them to a yet-unknown mechanism. In ancient times, this was often called ""the voice of god"", and more recently, it tends to manifest as ""[transmitters are beaming thoughts into my brain](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/30/nyregion/belatedly-the-riddle-of-an-attack-on-rather-is-solved.html)"". (We see a lot of it on the various radio-related subreddits.)

If I can help explain the technology and its limitations, then perhaps it's easier to recognize that the observations may be at fault. It's incredibly hard for the brain to admit that it's fallible -- just look at how hard it is to say ""I'm sorry, I was wrong"". But saying that is so important to our civil discourse, you know? Being able to admit error and make amends is a mark of maturity, not weakness. 

It's even harder to say ""This seems real but it isn't"", but likewise, taking that step is both important and heroic. Insofaras part of your brain right now is scrambling to find the even-better-hidden cameras, another part is grappling with the uncomfortable notion that maybe there aren't any in the first place. 

This is an extraordinarily difficult thing to confront, but you can find the strength to do it.",1612137736

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

"oculus","t5_2uni5","Yeah, it's hard to tell from those videos, as that's a screen recording, not through the lenses.

In an ideal world, the best thing to do would be to try out a friends well tuned VR setup. But if you don't have access to that, then everything is very subjective.

The wobbling you're experiencing could be partly because of your tracking environment? Do you have many reflective surfaces in the room? Are you playing with the lights off? or very bright downlights on?  
All these things can interfere with the tracking.
The tracking is camera based, and also infrared.
So the cameras are always looking for high contrast detail to track and align you to.
If you have reflections, this can throw off the calculations.
If you don't have enough infrared light, this can throw off the calculations, 
or if you have very bright lighting, it can flare up in the camera lenses and throw off the calculations.

Perhaps try using VR in a couple of different rooms in your house, with some different lighting setups to see if that affects the wobbliness at all. (on a related note, use a microfiber lens wipe to give the camera lenses a clean, it's easy to accidentally get fingerprints on them which will affect the tracking)

If none of that helps, then I would say it's possibly faulty hardware. Or you may be very sensitive to minor visual distortion, or latency/tracking wobble that other people might not feel. 

Either way, I'd say try what I mentioned, and if that doesn't help. Contact Oculus support and tell them your tale. I'm sure they'll want to sort it out.",1612137736

&gt;**Durante la campa√±a de Cambiemos tuite√© que con Macri tendr√≠amos** _**un apple store vidriado en la 9 de Julio.**_Para los no familiarizados, un follower te pone like, otro te hace retuit, un tercero te gasta, un cuarto lo usa porque le pareci√≥ simp√°tico y el quinto ya no sabe qui√©n lo dijo ni con qu√© prop√≥sito; luego ya funciona como el Covid, se abre paso.
&gt;
&gt;Fue tan prometedora la imagen, se ve, que hoy se lamenta m√°s que otras promesas oficiales ca√≠das de la campa√±a de Macri-Michetti, como la uni√≥n de los argentinos y la pobreza cero.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  **Y pas√≥ que no pas√≥ nada.** Las ensambladoras de celulares y notebooks de Tierra del Fuego mantuvieron su status parasitario durante los cuatro a√±os de Mauricio, una de ellas es propiedad de Nicol√°s Caputo, su viejo amigo, lo que quitaba incentivo o pon√≠a un dique a desgravar las importaciones de tecnolog√≠a y, por otra parte, Apple no iba, ni va a venir, aun cuando Willy Kohan encabece una dictadura, porque nuestro mercado de consumidores es demasiado chico como para que la manzanita asuma una operaci√≥n que puede dejar en manos de revendedores.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  En 2015 la fantas√≠a de que la Argentina pod√≠a ser corregida con el desembarco de talentosos no contaminados por la pol√≠tica que nos hab√≠a fundido, a√∫n estaba viva y, por ello, la apuesta de la clase media por el PRO super√≥ largamente los prejuicios que se pudiera tener con las condiciones personales de Macri.
&gt;
&gt;**Contrario a la especulaci√≥n m√°s obvia, o m√°s est√∫pidamente izquierdista o prejuiciosa, cre√≠ entonces y creo ahora que el inter√©s de Macri es sincero y su vocaci√≥n pol√≠tica, real, y un buen ejemplo para los chantas millonarios que han preferido delegar su responsabilidad ciudadana en pol√≠ticos a los que tuvieron bajo su n√≥mina, como lo fueron su propio padre y √©l mismo en otros tiempos.**

Anything else is speculation.

"" If you don‚Äôt buy that Gregg actually told Coby he‚Äôd vote for Tom, fine "" -- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  But like I said, in 2020, saying you wouldn't vote for Tom is like saying you want to kill puppies.  Gregg would get slammed on social media.  The mere possibility that this could influence what he says on his own, or what he says to Coby is reason enough to question it.  The more reliable information is what he says about Tom on day 39.

The most accurate word in your last paragraph was ""allegedly.""

MY opinion is that Ian had an excellent chance of beating Tom.  I'm not saying it was a 100% certainty, I'm saying it was an excellent chance.

The reality is it just doesn‚Äôt stack up.

Did you see the old video of Billy on that scam post before it got deleted? Even in 2018 they were lamenting that all the early hype about restaurants and so on accepting crypto had all evaporated. Nobody was using it, so they gave up and pulled the stickers off their windows.

And why weren‚Äôt they using it?

For the same reason I don‚Äôt use Living Room of Satoshi to pay my bills with Doge. Why would I, when I can use BPay, Osko or direct debits to pay faster, with zero fees and zero risk of my payment devaluing in transit? Or worse, doubling because of a pump like this?

Look, I‚Äôm a huge fan of the best currency in crypto being used AS a currency. I funded the #DogeV8 with Doge, and we funded the Dogecar with Doge as well. But there isn‚Äôt a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell that would happen today. And the reason is the currency is too valuable to be given away.

I gave a million Doge as the prize in a contest here. I don‚Äôt regret that. I didn‚Äôt regret it then, and I don‚Äôt regret it now. But I‚Äôm Fully aware that it was $100,000 a couple of days ago. And $50,000 right now.

"Starwarsrp","t5_2tg2b","Leysson blinked, too. Though his mind latched not on the name invoked, but the usage of ""prot√©g√©"" by his companion. He opened his mouth then closed it again. *This will never work*, thought Leysson. Such a thought left him in bewilderment as the Valet scooted off in the direction of the club. Leysson blinked again.

After he snapped out of it, he lightly ribbed Freya with his elbow and shot her look. ""*Don't oversell it,""* he whispered, though it came out more like a hiss over the howling winds. ""Our normal credentials are plenty for this; we're not undercover, for Core's-Sake."" The urge to roll his eyes was a strong one, but he refrained. If only just.

When the second Valet came, clearly the head valet, Leysson's bewilderment only grew. *No way this worked.*

""Oh, yes, apology accepted, I suppose. Try not to get the interior too wet, it's state-owned, y'see?"" Leysson beamed innocently at the woman as she stepped into his speeder. Who knew it was so nice to be waited on.

Turning back around, Leysson glanced to and fro in puzzlement. He had half expected another valet to come rushing out to hold an umbrella over their heads, but he reckoned they weren't *that* special, as no one approached.

""Let's go, Grime,"" Leysson began as he led the way down the narrow pathway, paying no heed to the floral landscaping surrounding him on his way. He just focused on using his coat to keep his head dry.  ""And so we have our story straight:  You were nervous and meant to say *we're* Payne's *prot√©g√©s,* not the other way 'round."" While they weren't undercover, they might as well keep to Freya's wild claim lest they appear suspicious.

This entrance did not lead to the heart of the club. Instead: a foyer-like room. Immediately to the left was a small wet-bar hosted by a single tender in a similar yellow dress code as the other valets. The room appeared to double as a lounge or smoking room for the VIPs that entered through here. Several seats, couches, and benches with plush red cushions and polished brass trim lined the small room's walls and a plume of fragrant tobacco smoke hung low in the air. Between them, tiny end-tables containing the latest holo-mags and tabloids. Flanking either side, grand staircases leading up to a pair of doors. Those doors, Leysson surmised, led out onto the balcony overlooking the interior amphitheater.

The ladies and gentlemen mingling about wouldn't have seemed too different than your average airheaded aristocrat, but Leysson knew the difference. These were New Money. They wore the latest fashion. Dressed in sporty suits, robes, and low-cut slim-fit dresses, and many of the young women forwent the typical extravagant headdresses their old-money, traditionalist, counter-parts would've worn. Though the jewelry was still in excess. Leysson even recognized a few faces, though not personally: Actors and actresses, pod-racers, up and coming entrepreneurs and etcetera.

From the modest crowd came a couple of employees.

""Your coats, sir and madame,"" the woman on the right asked them with a slight bow of the head and a wide - yet insincere - smile.",1612137739

"CamelotUnchained","t5_2w92e","&gt; Like the progression system or the skill system, show us how the skill system works.

I believe both those things were covered ages ago in previous newsletters, and recently again in a Q&amp;A. But not shown in the sense of, a video of someone running around in game leveling up. 

&gt;Or show how you progress your character... there's not 1 bit of gameplay loop here. They haven't shown us someone logging in and showing us how the game actually plays and how the loop will go.

Right, again, that's mostly because of what I said here: 

&gt;When a studio doesn't have millions of dollars to spend on advertising, you have to be choosey about when to show off your game. 

They were extremely transparent with videos and livestreams like, 3-4 years ago but the only thing that happened is people would laugh at ""how bad the graphics are holy shit 1998 wants their art back"" type nonsense, despite the fact that the graphics were literally placeholders not meant to look good. After that they mostly kept the streams and videos to the backer forums, because they're not trying to advertise to the outside world yet, and likely won't until launch is around the corner. Small companies can't sustain year long marketing campaigns. 

But we live in an age where people are so used to polished previews that anything they see they assume is a final polished preview, and if they don't like what they see, they'll write the game off. So better to be conservative with what you show until you're ready to launch and all your ducks are in a row. 

That's MY understanding of it anyway. 

&gt;It's literally nearly just concept art every month. 

Again, it isn't. I literally linked you to in game screenshots in the previous reply. But it IS mostly concept art. 


&gt;Like i want to see game systems. How will skill progression go? What about the skill trees or the weapons systems?n Show us how players will control a tower and the bonuses you get for it. Something anything that resembles a game!

Like I said above, all of those design concepts have been discussed in newsletters at one point or another (though actually I'm not sure if it has been said what specific bonuses you'll get from owning a keep beyond the fact that you now own a powerful fortification). If your issue is that you haven't SEEN them yet, then again, see my earlier point. They're not trying to fish for outside backers right now. If you're a current backer, you can see these exact systems right now by logging in. 

I do get the overall point you're making though. The development has gone on for an eternity, why don't we see more for it? All I can offer is what I understand to be the case. And from what I can tell from the forums and the tests and the recent Q&amp;As, more and more videos and information are going to become public as the Forest and all the polished art assets start going in. 

Until then, if you want to see the progression system in action, you've got to log on. Yeah, it sucks for someone on the sidelines waiting to see what's happening, but, it is what it is.",1612137740

For example, for the same option contract but with different expiration dates, say 6 months and 1 year, their option prices are pretty much the same, is this correct in general?

What helped me was switching srv control to game pad from hotas / kB mouse and put the assist off. It gave me much more control over it and I even managed to get unstuck a couple of times with 4 pips in engines. 

Also, as someone else pointed out, try shooting the crystals from the side, not beneath and once they fly, target them, that way you won‚Äôt lose the buggers. 

Finally, if you want to do the grind, do it once in a while, not often. I spent the better part of a day getting those mats from the different crystals 1500 ly away and I‚Äôm not planning on going back there anytime soon. I know some say don‚Äôt grind if you don‚Äôt like it and I learnt I don‚Äôt.

I also don't understand how your code works at all. You're saying that ""it goes 1, 2, 3"". But take this part of your code in ServerScriptService:

    local function onBackClick(player)
    	Level = game:GetService(""Players""):WaitForChild(player):WaitForChild(""PlayerGui""):WaitForChild(""ScreenGui""):WaitForChild(""Level"")
    	Level.Text = tonumber(Level.Text) - 1
    end

It can't possibly work. `Player` argument that gets passed into your function is a player object. `WaitForChild` on the other hand accepts a string, not an object. Which makes this line to yield forever and your  
`Level.Text = tonumber(Level.Text) - 1`

never gets executed. Are you sure that you posted the right code here?",1612137742

Thursday when 10million shares were covered the price jumped from 120$ to 350$ (this was shortly after robin hood blocked trading completely, there was a good timeline posted somewhere on WSB sorry I don't have the link atm). There is a lot of conjecture on when the other 50M need to cover, people are saying over the next 3 days but only the contract holders really know their contract details. If I may play devils advocate here and imagine that coming out of the gates on monday the shorts race to cover first to get the better price, Armageddon. Significantly higher than $450.

"AusSkincare","t5_310nr","I would not incorporate a chemical exfoliant (or any other active) until you have built up your tolerance to adapalene. You will ruin your skin's moisture barrier as it is sensitive due to using adapalene and you are experiencing inflammation (dark spots are PIH / post inflammatory hyperpigmentation).

Speak to your dermatologist about what is the minimum amount of nights per week you can use adapalene and it still be effective. Also, did your dermatologist say whether you can apply the adapalene after your moisturiser? This could help lessen the irritation.

Purging is a common side effect of retinoids. You just have to persevere. I'm assuming that you are using the adapalene to help your acne. This means you have to wait for it to work and your acne is under control. Retinoids can take 4-12 weeks to see results. Once your acne is managed then you can address the hyperpigmentation.

EDIT: when I say purging is common I am referring to breaking out / whiteheads / pimples / bumps etc. I am acne prone and just started a retinol and am also going through this. I am also prone to hyperpigmentation and my purge is causing PIH. But we have to wait until we build a tolerance to the retinoid (adapalene, retinol etc). Once we have built up tolerance, and the acne is under control, the retinoid will actually help the hyperpigmentation. You can also consider introducing niacinamide and / or alpha arbutin 2% (The Ordinary and The Inkey List both sell them) to help the PIH (but don't introduce anything until you are used to the adapalene and your acne is under control).

The only other thing that would seem to add to it is that it's likely part of just...society loving underdog stories.

David and Goliath couldn't happen today because Goliath truly believes he had to fight against people making fun of him because he was tall and scrapped and clawed to become the finest Philistine fighter, and David was the cheater who double-crossed him by being a slinger, not a swordsman to hold him down for being too tall.",1612137743

In modern politics (let‚Äôs say from Reagan onward), it‚Äôs definitely not bullshit, though the extent to which it isn‚Äôt bullshit will vary depending on your political stances and what you define as a good economy.

Reaganomics was fantastic for building GDP, but it was horrible for income inequality and improving the quality of life for everyday Americans. How it‚Äôs viewed depends on who you ask.

Regardless of the partisan perspectives on them, Obama did clean up after Bush‚Äôs economic messes.

&gt;&gt; # [La suba de precios comienza a impactar en la interna peronista](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/politica/panorama-politico/365)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Una verdad parcial: afinar **la sinton√≠a entre precios y salarios es el principal problema econ√≥mico del gobierno de Alberto Fern√°ndez para este a√±o**.
&gt;
&gt;Premisa B: si la inflaci√≥n se escapa m√°s all√° del 40 por ciento, la mayor√≠a de las PyMEs, que son las principales empleadoras del pa√≠s y llegan golpeadas despu√©s del macrismo y la pandemia, no estar√°n en condiciones de afrontar paritarias que se ajusten a la premisa A.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [Los negocios de Santa Mar√≠a con Clar√≠n y Cambiemos](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/multimedia/b5YXCNn97CM/en_vivo)La otra cara de la moneda es que all√≠ mismo, en esa carrera desigual entre ingresos y costos de vida, **Fern√°ndez tambi√©n se juega este a√±o su parada m√°s importante desde el punto de vista pol√≠tico**.
&gt;
&gt;**Este verano, por primera vez, las diferencias sobre pol√≠ticas de fondo comenzaron a tensionar de manera notoria el andamiaje que el Presidente y Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner montaron en 2019.**
&gt;
&gt;En un primer momento la divisi√≥n de tareas dejaba en manos del Presidente la gesti√≥n del pa√≠s en el d√≠a a d√≠a (y eso incluye a la econom√≠a, la agenda parlamentaria, la relaci√≥n con el Poder Judicial, entre otras cuestiones) mientras la Vice conduc√≠a la estrategia pol√≠tica del espacio.
&gt;
&gt;Un dato de los sondeos de opini√≥n m√°s recientes que no pas√≥ desapercibido: por primera vez se advierte que CFK paga costo pol√≠tico por las decisiones de Alberto Fern√°ndez.**
&gt;
&gt;**Si no puede proponer algo que sea diferente a pedir m√°s sacrificios y paciencia, su futuro y el de su gobierno correr√°n riesgo**, ante el asedio inescrupuloso de la oposici√≥n y los tironeos en la interna de un peronismo que siempre tiene un plan de contingencia, o varios.

Others, like Jugler's, Alustriel's, and Lana's, are pretty much must haves if you use them, because it enables a lot of different builds. 

Jugler is a bit obvious as to why it is game changing. 

Alustriel allows guard ignores on the right terrain and the self-heal allows her to counter-kill range units if you have her built out for specific maps. In mind is the Wed/Thurs JB where the stronger Alustriels can kill G&amp;L and then just counter-kill the mages/priests. 

Lana in particular allows her to use Astaroth for full effect all the time, without having to piggyback on someone else for a debuff. Of course, if you don't have Astaroth, you can probably wait on buying this.

Also, one other thing to keep in mind: you only have to get the shard at the specific time, you don't necessarily need to have the controllers to finish out the SP quests at the same time.",1612137745

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Sw/Sh and LGPE:

1. **If you receive an offer by PM or Reddit chat**, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpokemontrades) and redirect the other user to post publicly on the subreddit. PM, DM and chat trading is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.). 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the correct trader.
3. [Full details](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny and/or event Pok√©mon.
4. Both you **and potential trading partners** must have [Pok√© ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades involving shiny or event Pok√©mon. 

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

Canada has incorporated intersectional radical critical theory into every aspects of it's labor, academic and social status quo, and PM is threatening ever increased intensity of this forced replacement. This is well known. This is irrefutable. This is openly perpetrated genocide.

I know it can be hard sometimes with all the homophones, homonyms, antonyms etc. But don't give up!

Words in English (and most other languages) can often have more than one meaning. I know, I know! Crazy, right?? But if you take a bit of time to consider the context then it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.

And, if you manage it...congratulations! You have just added a new word to your vocabulary, and you didn't even have to learn a new word! Just a new meaning!

Just to help you along here, 'bean' can also be used as a verb. It means to hit someone in the head. 'Bean' can also be used as a noun to mean 'money'. It's where we get the term 'bean counter' to mean an administrator who deals with money or the phrase 'he doesn't have a bean' to mean someone who is poor. Another one is 'full of beans' to mean energetic. Then there is 'old bean' which is an old, informal British term for a man. It may well be the origin of the usage you heard.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

I love looking through my treasures from past generations. 

I have an album of 19th century ""cabinet card"" style family photographs, my great-grandmother's coin purse with shiny dimes and a few pennies from the 1940's as well as her knitting needles and notions, some squares of fabric I assume she was saving for a  quilt, a 19th century new testament with Psalms in German with birth, marriage and death dates handwritten in it, and two somewhat delicate-looking folding knives, suitable and handy for a good country woman like my great-grandmother.

Especially precious is my grandfather's journal from when he was a young man in the 1920's, which noted purchases of a coca cola, gifts for my future grandmother, and parts to use in his job as an auto mechanic.  There was a lovely birthday card with a poignant handwritten note to my grandmother, dated a couple of years after their marriage.  And I love the machine oil bottles and the clever little cast iron banks my grandfather tucked away.  The bottles have nice pictures on them and the metal is pretty.  It makes me smile to think he kept them because he liked the look of them, as do I.

I have other treasures from other family members.  I display as many as I can in my home.  I love to stop and look at them, to ponder what they can tell me about the lives of my ancestors.  They make me smile.",1612137747

Couples: Feel free to post, but we highly recommend you please read this page about [unicorn hunting](https://morethantwo.com/coupleprivilege.html).

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention. A+B (as with any major life change, your relationship dynamic will probably shift), B+C, A+C, and A+B+C. Imposing unethical, unfair dynamics on a partner may lead to your removal from this subreddit.

Yes! This is why I've kept him in the character charts all these weeks without an appearance.

"investing","t5_2qhhq","If there's one thing I got out of this that stood out to me, are these two paragraphs: 

""You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so. This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair. Why? Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze. You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning. Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over."" Actually makes sense.",1612137751

Starting off, I am going to assume that these golden nuggets are named via anvils.I am also going to assume you are using buttons to teleport you and your friends around,as well as that the teleporter will only function if you are specifically holding the key.

Start by inserting this command into one of your teleporter commands (If you are using buttons, then have the command be set to **IMPULSE** and **NEEDS REDSTONE**):  
`/execute as @p at @s if entity @s[nbt={SelectedItem:{id:""minecraft:gold_nugget"",Count:1b,tag:{display:{Name:'{""text"":""Key""}'}}}}] run tp @s [COORDINATES]`  
This should hopefully fit your desires, and if my assumptions are incorrect, please let me know and tell me what specifically I assumed is incorrect and what is the correct version.

**This teleporter will only work if you are holding the golden nugget!**

I hope this helps!*-FluffyLlamas2*",1612137752
"WitchesVsPatriarchy","t5_p3r73","It's a connection with the celebration of Sol Invictus for the Romans. The birth of Jesus and the rebirth of the sun have the same theme of light winning over darkness. The whole Christian (especially Catholic) has a strong correlation with the modern pagan one.

Candlemas connects with Imbolc season, when Jesus is presented at the Temple, and spring first starts showing signs of coming. Similar themes of the coming of the light. In some countries, the houses candles are brought in to church to be blessed to honor ""the Light of the World.""

Easter as the pinnacle of the year celebrating the foundation of the faith and triumph of good over evil ties nicely into springtime and birth. It's the Sunday after the first full moon after Ostara (the equinox.)

Ascension comes with Beltane, and the season of Pentecost follows with late spring into summertime, right as the farming season goes into full swing. The season of Pentecost goes until Advent, so there aren't any major holidays during this time. Works out well when the farmers are going to be busy.

Lammas (Loaf-Mass) is celebrated, where the first bread of the harvest is brought in and blessed. The first harvest being given to God goes back to early Jewish traditions, honoring God as the creator, and for the practical use of making sure those who aren't in farming have food. Mary's ascension is celebrated in this season as well.

Mabon/ the Autumn Equinox doesn't have a major holiday, but the holy day for all of the angels falls in this season. Harvest season is still underway.

Halloween, All Soul's Day, All Saint's Day are famously interconnected. It's a celebration for all of the heroes of the faith and those who have departed. Sounds like Samhain, eh?

Advent is the start of the Christian year, starting four weeks before Christmas so four Sundays fit in. It's about halfway between Halloween and Christmas, and is a season of celebration leading up to Christmas, and now we've looped the year.

Coming into Christianity with a witchy lens has led me to appreciate it in a new light.",1612137752

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","It will be easier to climb out of bronze on other characters (like Moira).

But some basic tips for bronze should actually apply for most characters.

With Ana though : stay much further back than you probably think you should (you should be the last person to die on your team). You pretty much want to be in cover if you are just healing. There is an exception, if you are getting dived, then you move up closer to your team, so that they can help fend off divers.
If the enemy is diving you, save your sleep and nade for them. May seem selfish, but keeping yourself alive is far more important than dying and not being able to heal anyone while you respawn.

Also, a lot of ults can be stopped by your sleep dart. Get good at reading telegraphed ults (Reaper teleporting over or behind your team, Rein getting very aggressive against your tanks with his shield down, etc). There are also a lot of ults that are easy to stop once they have started. Hog is a massive hit box that you should be able to sleep most of the time to stop his ult. Pharah can be slept pretty quick to stop her from murdering most of your team, reaper is very easy to read and you should be able to sleep him just after he starts his ult. Sleep the nano‚Äôd enemies, ulting bastion, and try (its hard) to sleep the ulting (nano‚Äôd especially) Genji, also soldier (though you can‚Äôt wake soldier or genji cause their ults will continue on).
Tell your team when you are sleeping someone and when you have slept someone. Communication is key (both with sleep and anti nades). And tell them to wake or not wake (example : ‚Äúsleeping Hanzo over here, let‚Äôs kill him in 3, 2, 1‚Äù then shoot and throw your nade at the same time (animation cancel) while the other person shoots him in the head).
Example 2 : don‚Äôt wake the sleeping soldier, let his ult run out (might do this if most of your team is dead or not able to help).
Be prepared for people to wake sleeping enemies when they shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs going to happen a lot. You‚Äôll sleep someone who can easily kill you and your Dva will shoot them awake from a mile away and do no damage, wasting your sleep and your chance to get away if needed. Also your friendly, spinning ball will knock into everything and everyone around him without realizing you have slept someone).

Ana‚Äôs sleep dart and nade make for an extremely powerful kit when used correctly. Being able to completely stop an ult with a cool down is extremely valuable.

Once you get faster at recognizing what the enemy wants to do, you can easily save lives by sleeping a hog who is hooking a team mate, sleeping a Rein who is pinning a team mate, using nades for burst healing while anti-ing out of position enemies.

Keep track of enemy ults while also keeping track of your team mates ults. If your Zarya has her ult, save your nade. Throwing your nade into a friendly grav is devastating to the enemy while at the same time throwing a nade into an enemy grav can save your team mates.

You should also watch what your other support plays. This can help determine if you can be more aggressive with your nades on the enemy or if you need to be the main healer and use your nades for more healing.

There are workshops to practice your sleep aim. Sleeping doom isn‚Äôt too tough, but if you miss most of the time, you can practice to find where it‚Äôs easiest to land it.
Tracer and genji are hard to sleep, so practice up.

Besides adding a burst of healing, Your nade increasing all healing for a short duration (including health packs). This is helpful to your team mates and yourself. If you are 1 health and can make it to a small health pack, hit yourself with a nade just before you pick up the small med to get the most healing out of the pack.

Learn quick scoping. It is very useful and only takes a little bit of practice to get the timing down (couple of days to a couple of weeks and you‚Äôll have it down).
Scoped in is hit scan but leaves a trail that the enemy can see, unscoped is projectile with no trail. This is useful depending on what is needed. 

Your nano can be great to combo with other ults. Genji is probably one of the most common combos, but you can nano a rein who just hammered down half their team, phara to keep her alive longer while she ults, reaper for the same reason and some characters are good to nano even if they don‚Äôt have ult, like tracer, ball, Zarya when she is fully charged.
But don‚Äôt underestimate the use of nano as it can be used just to save a team mates life. This may be a little harder to determine when to do this, but if you can break down a question like this : we have a numbers advantage, but only by one and our Rein is about to die. If he dies, we could easily lose the fight, I can‚Äôt out heal the amount of damage he is taking. The answer may be to hit him with nano to keep him in the fight and let him swing away while healing him up as he goes. Things like this. Even if he doesn‚Äôt get great value in damage with the nano, it can be worth it just to keep him alive during the fight.

Watch guides, most will go over all of this stuff.
Also, if you aren‚Äôt into watching streamers, I would highly suggest for knowledge and cause it‚Äôs fun. ML7 and KarQ are amazing Ana players that often explain what they are doing and why.",1612137753

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 

Otherwise, welcome!

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","I only know because I have spent a shitload on remote control cars recently and learned a lot about Lithium Polymer batteries and how unstable they are. They take a lot of care to make them last. 

Newer electric RCs demand insane bursts of electricity.

Also an acquaintance of mine's house fucking burnt down because of a lipo battery in one of those stupid hover boards. They need to be kept in a specific voltage range and can damage themselves if they are not. Keeping a battery full charged for too long? Bad. Leaving a battery discharged too long? Bad. Those shitty chargers they give you for these expensive batteries are too stupid and aren't to be trusted.

People's cellphones don't explode as often  because they are constantly being used. A full charged lithium battery will damage itself after only 12 hours of remaining fully charged. Batteries should never be charged unattended.",1612137756

"cobrakai","t5_3ncyn","So you think Tory is not psychotic but the writing is off. Could be, but that is also blaming the writers for not portraying a character in a way we imagine her and in a way we would want to portray them.

In season 2 Miguel says ‚Äúyour crazy!‚Äù and Tory answers that she has heard that many times before. Tory talks about this in season 3 again and this time Miguel is serious when he says Tory would need some help. In addition we witness how obsessively Tory wants to beat the shit out of Sam several times.

Also Kreese said to Johnny that he couldn‚Äôt get a military work anymore since they got some psychiatrists there nowadays.


So there has been references to these characters having some mental problems. That doesn‚Äôt mean we should hate them and I actually don‚Äôt. Especially Tory could still turn her life around since she is young and has a lot of time. But in order to do so I think she would need professional help. And that makes her a complex character. You don‚Äôt know what kind of mental issues other people have and do they get professional help or not because most people don‚Äôt talk about that. But it is a fact that people who would need help and don‚Äôt get it act in ways that are harmful to themselves and to others and Tory is doing just that.",1612137756

Top: Is it weird that, outside of the context of a camping jungler trying to get him fed, I find Darius to be a fun top lane matchup?

Jungle: Now, I'm saying this in advance: I know and agree that jungle is a pretty inherently unhealthy role, since it often strips champions with weak early games of some of their weaknesses, but, in my opinion, a fair jungler is Jarvan IV

Mid: Malzahar, less so in micro-based counterplay, more so because he exists to be an equalizer, between you and your team you should generally be able to deal with him by coordinating properly, since his job is clear and cut-out. Note, this does not include jungle ganks, but that's a problem with how riot executed junglers and their jobs than with Malzahar

Bot: Now, I REALLY wanted to abstain on this one, but instead I looked over the list and found that, for me, at least, Draven has always been the bottom laner who I can look at and think ""Yeah, I can figure out a way to deal with this guy""

Support: Nami, as far as supports go she generally doesn't feel that overbearing compared to some of the crap, although it's hard to judge since most supports are experienced alongside a bottom laner, which means many probably have extra frustration thrown in because of that",1612137757

A lot of the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù per se were often pretty disinterested in politics if not outright disillusioned with Nazi leadership (although there were still a fair amount of Nazis here, bear in mind many of the proto-Nazi political assassinations and antisemetic crimes were done by the Reichswehr Naval Brigade‚Äôs officer corps) as the war turned decisively against them, but due to the hideous losses U-boats suffered, those old guard guys were whittled down and their replacements were often extremely pro-Nazi as a combination of the fact that many were very young and basically grew up in the Nazi system, and had to volunteer for navy service *and* on top of that had to specifically volunteer to be a submariner. So you end up with a lot of young guys who are volunteering for something insanely dangerous, which meant they were typically extremely devoted to the cause they were fighting for.

And I also want to be clear that of course simply moving the capital isn't going to magically fix, well, anything.

What I should've said from the beginning instead is only that the farther a capital is from a states population center or centers, the more likely that state's government is to be corrupt, citing the amount of corruption convictions at the state level, by state. So, working off of that, it would be a good idea to try and put the capital between San Fran and L.A. to counter that specific issue. An alternative could be making either San Fran or L.A. themselves the capital, but I don't need to do any research to know that would come with it's own set of issues.",1612137758

"BitcoinBeginners","t5_2wju0","I am a hodler of a pile and a trader of a very small pile. I am pro bitcoin.

That said, I think there are real issues that need solution, and they will come, but perhaps not as bitcoin. I think digital currency is the way, and bitcoin is the model T to the future's mustang and porsche world.

Real issue #1: unstable price makes it impractical to use BTC for prices at a local grocery store or convenience store. Sure it can all be listed in USD or whatever local currency and then at point of sale there is a conversion rate (just as I have with my credit card when I am in Canada). But these things are opaque if you want to rely on and calculate/budget costs regularly in your currency, let alone draw up month- or year-long contracts. Good luck.

Real issue #2: transactions take a long time to clear and verify. Comparing Bitcoin transactions to visa and MasterCard, Bitcoin does thousands every 10 min but Visa/ Mastercard do hundreds of thousands of transactions in the same amount of time. if you're at a gas station and you're trying to buy some gas you do not want to wait 10 to 30 minutes just to verify your gas purchase. Three confirmations is a ridiculous amount of time. Sure we can use lightning Network or some other coin that is connected to it that does not take up as much resources on the network. But this is a workaround and obviously not directly connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Real issue #3: mining requires an excessive amount of electrical cost which is for sure a resource that could be based off of renewable resources like solar and wind. But as there is greater Bitcoin adoption and as there are greater numbers of miners out there the cost on the environment increases significantly. Perhaps this can be avoided by having more affordable electrical sources that do not impact the environment as much. Even so it's still a drain. We are not going into Bitcoin adoption with a zero carbon footprint goal.

Real issue #4: I don't have enough Bitcoin. Lol.",1612137758

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","Sorry dude, I disagree. With the money printer going brrrrrrr the way it is, silver WILL moon. The dollar and PMs are interrelated. The reason they have suppressed the price of PMs is two fold:

1. So they can buy up as much as possible at cheap to store in their vaults.
2. To keep the light off of the massive inflation occurring right under our noses. 

The more money they print (which is at an exponential rate currently) the less buying power the dollar will have, and it will take more dollars to buy the same quantity of silver. You have to look at this as the value of the dollar going down, not the value of silver going up. I DO agree that retail investors are not going to be able to stand toe to toe with these global banks. They have been buying up and storing PMs for years.

The question I ask you is....

If THEY are doing it hand over fist, why shouldn't we? I'm not talking fucking around with paper. I'm talking buy up as much physical as you can RIGHT NOW and store it. The big banks are long on silver for a reason.

I new here and mostly retarded so this is no financial advice. I can just tell you that at the end of the day I would rather have my wealth stored somewhere reliable and not all in on a stock that we all know will eventually correct, and when that happens ALOT of poor souls are going to be left holding a big pile of shit.

"biology","t5_2qhn7","If evolution is your interest, then both are good options. Evolutionary biology largely focuses on trends in evolution and the selective pressures/ origins of evolutionary plans. With biochemistry/ molecular biology, you can learn lots about evolution on the basis of biomolecules and even learn how to control selective pressures that accelerate some aspects of evolution (see the 2018 chemistry Nobel prize). A fairly new branch of biology, termed synthetic biology uses broad understandings of biology and biochemistry to use and change biomolecules to control aspects of biology (see igem.org). 

I don't think you have to necessarily choose between the two. After all, it is a commonly stated: ""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"" - Dobzhansky. At the end of the day, just about every biological product has been produced on the basis of some manipulation of evolution (think crops, drugs, etc.)

Evolution is a very broad topic so I recommend reading some papers in good, open source journals (like eLife, EMBO reports and Nature). They may be able to help you narrow down your interests.

"plaintextaccounting","t5_3m8r8","OK. So let's take a simple example that I don't understand: **every transaction money must come from somewhere and go to somewhere.** If I deposit $100 into my checking account from my job I do a:

Income:Job -$100 --&gt; Asset:Checking +$100

Right? But where did the money from Income come from? If we're saying it didn't come from anywhere why can't I do this:

Asset:Checking -$100 --&gt; Expense:ExpensvieBurger +$100

Without recording the income? This is similar to ""money just appearing from nowhere into an account"" that just happened with Income...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I guess I just can't wrap my head around income always being negative. In my single-entry accounting system, my checking account would have a transaction noting an increase by $100 but it would be categorized as Income.

I understand that the fundamental formula that DEA is trying to satisfy is: Assets = Liabiliites +\_ Equity + (Income - Expenses) but that makes some of the analysis really weird for me. 

I'm interested in seeing where my money goes but I'm really struggling with understanding how double-entry makes it BETTER than just single-entry + categorization.",1612137760

"ABoringDystopia","t5_3c6l1","I mean isnt this capitalism at it‚Äôs root? He can afford to pay people more so he does to hire better talent. People would prefer to work for him than at McDonalds because he pays better. Fast forward to a National minimum wage, this farmer would now need to pay a comparably higher amount to attract people to work for him because otherwise people wouldn‚Äôt move to the area because they‚Äôre already being paid enough to not need to move. 

Lets add some numbers to this example. Minimum wage in a city is currently ~$10 an hour. The farmer pays $20 an hour. It attracts people because it‚Äôs a larger pay and cheaper area. However people would prefer to live in a city because there‚Äôs things to do in a city. The farmer is just barely able to pay his workers $20 an hour and still make enough to pay him self and pay for the overhead of the farm. Minimum wage now increases to $15 an hour. He‚Äôs still paying more than the minimum wage, but the slightly larger pay and cheaper cost of living doesn‚Äôt incentivize people to leave the city because of the benefits of the city (things to do, etc.). This farmer therefore must also increase his pay by $5 to incentivize workers as much as previously. To offset this increased cost he must reduce overhead (by hiring fewer workers and himself working more) or increasing the costs of his produce. Hence making the costs of produce more expensive for everyone.

Seems to me the best solution is to find ways to make cost of living cheaper as there is a bottom limit on how much things can cost but there isn‚Äôt an upper limit on how much things can cost",1612137761

My main issue was to reach to about 75-80% calories from fat.

On the 1th month of keto i ate almost everyday ground beef but still, almost didn't reach the daily fat goal but at least was closed to it. When i stopped  with the beef on the 2nd and 3rd month, i neved reached the daily fat goal again.

 the whole point with this diet is to eat high amounts of fat which will convert to ketone bodies after the glycogen storages depleted , etc... But if i cant hit the fat goal im wasting my time",1612137762

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"AnotherEdenGlobal","t5_vii9r","m!Gariyu makes Antiquity really easy. He can oneshot all the mobs in Hokishi Forest and Talgana Mountain Trail which are 2/3 of the sparkle maps. The last one is Kuruchi Cove which has enemies weak to Earth so bring an AOE earth unit (I use Cerrine)

For the chest maps, Ship Graveyard has enemies weak to earth as well. Funeral Cavern has enemies weak to blunt (which Cerrine covers with her AOE as well). I generally avoided Dragon God Swamp but there's no reason it should be any more difficult to clear than the others.

For bosses, I went with Gonjuro and Sacred Beast. I had another Earth DPS in my frontline so with Cerrine + that other DPS, Gonjuro is a joke. You don't necessarily need a zone unit for Sacred Beast if you bring at least one Wind DPS - I used Amy and Azami because of their light. You can break the horn in 2 turns and then immediately AF to kill the main body.

My personal setup was frontline AS!Myrus, m!Cerrine, m!Gariyu, m!Mariel with backline m!Azami and Amy. 

Myrus and Cerrine as earth mob clearers + main DPS for Gonjuro. Gariyu as a fire mob clearer and Mariel as a mob clearer + support for boss fights. I switch Azami and Amy to the frontlines for Sacred Beast but otherwise they're just light batteries.",1612137764

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

So, level up moves changes every generation, right? They base it around the difficulty and level curve of the game. So why not change the evolution level based on this as well? You're telling me depending on what game i happen to play, rhyhorn will, just as an example, learn earthquake 10 levels earlier than in the last generation but I still need to get it to level 42 every time to get rhydon?

I think you‚Äôre overvaluing the spell list on ranger if you think they‚Äôre having serious debates on which particular spell to use in a fight. They‚Äôre just archers who have like 3 spells that are worth casting, depending on which slot you want to use in that particular fight. 

Paladins don‚Äôt have that problem because their spell list is much better, one channel divinities use charisma, and the aura is possibly the strongest individual class feature in the game. You can use one concentration spell in each fight then maybe one or two utility out of combat spells, and be far more effective than most paladins who throw out smites on their first attacks of a fight because they like rolling more d8s",1612137765

FYI He's based in Montreal, Canada and also carries different sandalwood EOs and amazing aged patchoulis.
You can usually score 0.1ml oud for about $20 CAD. I usually stretch it out by diluting so it lasts longer. Fair warning though, it can become a bit pricey if you get carried away like I have, however the quality of the oils speak from themselves.

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","&gt;When the Wilpons lost hundreds of millions due to a Ponzi scheme, it directly affected their ability to be MLB owners.

Everything about the situation points to the opposite. The Mets had the second and fifth highest payroll in MLB the two years after Madoff got pinched, and added tons and tons of payroll those two years.

They also held onto Johan Santana's contract with a death grip, long after it would have been feasible to get rid of him, when any team supposedly suffering from terminal brokeness could have easily moved him.  Madoff got busted in December 2008 (the same offseason Santana was signed). Why not trade him after 2009 for a massive haul of prospects if you are that financially destitute?

They clearly were trying to compete, and backed that attempt financially, but just made a bunch of dumbass moves because Minaya was the GM.

&gt;Yes, he was an ass about it on Twitter, and yes, it was silly for him to have a Twitter in the first place (because, let‚Äôs be real, it was all going to come crashing down at some point), but really, this whole situation is independent of the Mets, and should be treated as such.

The larger point is not whether it was ""about the Mets"" or not, but whether it's valid or not. Certainly there were many critiques of the Wilpons that were accurate, but a lot of it was ridiculous. There were long rambling threads on Twitter saying that the Wilpons were actually in it with Madoff, knowing what was going on and being silent about it, or even sometimes helping engineer the fraud, rather than being defrauded by it. There was also that hilarious thread about how Citi Field was part of a big plot to move the Mets to Montreal (?!).

The idea that it's suddenly bad to speculate and say bad shit about the owners now, when it's been like 90% of Mets culture for like a decade and a half, is just mind-blowing to me.  This is an example of a guy being involved in extremely high-profile shady shit, and there's a good chance he has something to do with it, and not just dumb defrauded goobers like Fred and Jeff with Bernie Madoff. It's perfectly reasonable to critique it, and you also have to expect outside people to make fun of it.

Try to picture this subreddit if the exact same thing happened 4 years ago and involved Fred and Jeff, and if people would be writing rebuttal arguments about whether this ""technically"" involves the Mets or not.  No, they would be uniformly dunking on them (as well they should in that case).",1612137767

A.) I was told: ""Beggars can't be choosers."" I'd respond: ""Choosers won't be beggars""

B.) I was told: ""College isn't for you"". I responded by starting my own contracting business that paid my way through school.

C.) Any new school clothes were purchased at the store that was having it's ""Going Out Of Business"" sale. Same sale every year. The clothes were awful.

D.) Pickled cow tongue and heart, Pigs Feet and Split Pea Soup when the butcher would give us a ham bone, Shit on a Shingle, but, fortunately, no spam as time went on.

.

There's other expectations I ignored, but can't think of any right now.

After school, I rubbed elbows with people of all stations of life, from Harvard trained doctors and lawyers to movie lawyers and producers to ""every day people"". Anytime anyone started blaming the poor for their own situation, it's start an argument with me, which usually ended with that person angrily leaving and me ending any association with them.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","Well privately owning the land and it's resources would by definition be an issue, but leaving the land fallow and enjoying and cultivating it as a wild space wouldn't be. Wild spaces like that are important to communities and the planet. 

I suppose it would be left up to the community if it was needed as a resource for a more pressing issue, but until then I would imagine you could get support for helping protect and manage it so everyone can enjoy. We already have spaces like that in our publicly managed game and wildlife preserves. My state is like 30% or more made up of public lands of varying degrees of conservation managment. 

Your PERSONAL wants and needs for the space would be balanced and negotiated along with the personal needs of the rest of your community. Your PRIVATE ownership or right to use and restrict the resource regardless of the personal needs of other wouldn't exist. We also do that now with eminent domain in which we force the sale of property for development. The difference being there wouldn't be a class of individuals with any more power or money (also power) than you have. It would be more democratic. No persons with undue money or influence able to pressure you, your community, or a governing body to do what they want with the land on behalf of their PRIVATE interests.

Edit: There will of course be some money for a while, personally I think for a long while. It also won't exactly be evenly distributed. There just won't be people who are able to make money by exploiting labor and resources so their wealth will be limited to what they themselves are able to earn so income disparity will be limited to a much more significant degree than now.

 No one can in good faith tell you exactly what a society without money and private property would look like or how it will take shape, we should just allow ourselves to challenge what isn't working currently and work to dismantle it as we press forward to a more democratic, equitable, and just society.",1612137768

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","So I have a few questions. 

1. Why couldn't institutions just trade back and forth to unwind the shorts? Do they really need retail involvement at all? I'm sure there are institutions already involved that are looking for money off this stock, too. Why couldn't they set massive sell limit walls to profit off large buys to take advantage of the retail holds and super high sell limits that WSB'ers have been told to make (well into the 10s of thousands).

2. We've all been waiting for some type of margin call once the stock price has risen so high that would trigger the squeeze. Aren't we well past that point now? The stock is up nearly 500% in a week. Shouldn't the squeeze have been triggered by now? Doesn't this tell us that they're probably out of their small dollar shorts?

3. For all we know, all the shorters could be out of their $10-$20 shorts and into much higher $200-$300 positions that would be much easier to get out of. Everyone is running on complete guesses and assumptions at this point.

4. Isn't holding no matter what a terrible strategy here? If I hold with no sell limit, I will miss the squeeze if it comes. If I hold and set a $42,690 sell limit, I'm not going to get filled as long as there are millions below me. Shouldn't the strategy be to try and double/triple your money and then get out? Once all the shorts buy, there is not going to be any market for this stock above $1,000, let alone $300, $200 or $100. If you miss selling during the squeeze, you're done for. You're just holding on the sidelines like a chump.",1612137769

Promoting a company you are affiliated with or profit from, giving out referral codes which you benefit from, as well as using the sub solely to engage in targeted hate are things you need to avoid here. This sub is for a diverse discussion of solar, not a singular focus on your opinion about a company / person.

If you think it's subpar, I mean fine whatever that's your opinion, but saying ""ugh, they sucked, thank God Seungmin is so amazing and didn't do as bad as them!"" is tactless, rude, baseless, objectively false and also stupid. 

Please get off my post if you're going to use it as an insult to others. Lia showed off her range, Jongho is always incredible, Eunbi has an angelic voice (though I think her mic was turned down), Hyunjae sounds so sweet and calming, and Seunghee is a damn powerhouse.

This laptop is very lightweight (2.65 lbs), has a strong build quality (magnesium and aluminum) which makes it very portable as it is able to withstand the stress of travel as it will be able to take a few hits without breaking. It has a fair amount of ports, USB Type-C, HDMI, USB 3.2 Gen 1 type-A, USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack so you don't have to walk with a dongle. It also has a fingerprint reader if you like that sort of thing.

Its display is pretty much what you would expect at this price point. It has decent color accuracy but 

its display is a bit dim so it is not ideal for outside use.

With the AMD Ryzen 7 4700U Octa-Core Processor and 8 GB of RAM, it is able to handle most productivity tasks such as light CAD work and editing fairy well. It has decent integrated graphics so it will be able to manage light gaming well. Its battery life is very impressive as well, if you set it to 50% brightness it is able to last around 11 hours.

"EDH","t5_2scee","Flashback's probably the easiest thing to get working; [[Flash of Insight]] and [[Deep Analysis]] are the overall cheapest draw options to get out, but there's plenty in the card draw space that'll work from graveyard ([[Think Twice]], [[Radical Idea]], [[Chemister's Insight]], [[Glimpse of Freedom]], [[Oona's Grace]]...) if you want to include a draw package. [[Teferi's Ageless Insight]] is also just a trigger doubler, which is nice. 

If you're using adventures, then [[Words of Wind]] seems promising; you can bounce your adventure creatures in place of a draw and it sets opponent back and is repeatable.

An old, weird option is [[Ice Cauldron]] which basically becomes {T}: Draw a card because you can just exile a card you were planning to cast under it (paying 0 for X) and then cast it from exile right away. You can do more with it, of course, but that's the base case.

As for actually winning, there's a suite of stuff that triggers on card draw (some for +1/+1 counters like [[Oneirophage]], some to mill opponents like [[Psychic Corrosion]], some more esoteric like [[Ominous Seas]]) that could be used, or just pack in unrelated wincons (or wincons that cast from out of hand for synergy bonus?) and have the deck run as generic U/W control.

One thing that might be fun to run (albeit a touch unreliable) is [[Daxos of Meletis]]. Moreso if you're going any route that involves potential Voltron stuff as he acts as a backup hard-to-block dude.

[[Treasure Keeper]] is a decent generic option that'll just net you a card on top of the effect.

If you're going big then [[Aminatou's Augury]] is worth a whole lot of cards on top of the already over-the-top effect, and if you're doing any of the cast from graveyard stuff ([[Spelltwine]], most notably, but also stuff like [[Snapcaster Mage]], [[Jace, Telepath Unbound]], and [[Scholar of the Lost Trove]]) then it works with that too. [[Baral's Expertise]] is already great rate, and getting a card on top is just gravy (there's also [[Sram's Expertise]] but if you're not employing a go-wide then it doesn't do a lot for you). [[Cast Through Time]] is good for the spell-heavy build that I seem to have accidentally tripped into outlining. [[Counterlash]] is a meme but it's a really funny meme if you're playing a lot of expensive stuff. [[Elite Arcanist]], [[Isochron Scepter]], and [[Panoptic Mirror]] get you repeated triggers, as will [[Spellbinder]] which works better since your commander has evasion. [[God-Eternal Kefnet]] has you cast the copy it produces also. [[Kaho, Minamo Historian]] earns double card advantage. [[Mnemonic Deluge]] is good for three cards on top of the already...wait, we did this bit before. [[Narset Transcendent]] integrates well with this plan thanks to the rebound granting. 

If you're going for the mill thing someone else pointed out then there's the aforementioned Spelltwine along with [[Diluvian Primordial]], [[Chancellor of the Spires]], [[Jace's Mindseeker]], [[Planeswalker's Mischief]] (this isn't great though, I don't think), [[Psychic Theft]], etc. You can also slap in a [[Merfolk Secretkeeper]] and maybe [[Sweet Oblivion]] (bit costly, though). There's also [[Stolen Goods]], [[Talent of the Telepath]], and [[Chaos Wand]] if you want to focus on taking stuff from opponents (good interactions with the other spell package stuff, too)

In summary, there's a fairly coherent plan around resolving large haymaker spells repeatedly, and a few other hangers-on that'll be good regardless of the build.",1612137775

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","I would like to post some info. about this hidden gem following spectacular result of their SARS-CoV-2 UK Phase 3 vaccine trial last week. Following the announcement some new or potential investors may be wondering what the future may hold.

Like many of the ‚Äò$1,000+‚Äô posters, I believe the current share price is significantly below where it may reach in the next year or two, or sooner if as I think is probable and they are acquired by an established pharmaceutical company this year. I expect the share price to appreciate to somewhere between $1,000 and $1,500 for the many good reasons suggested by other posters but most importantly for these key reasons;

\- SARS-CoV-2 is endemic and it is likely it will require vaccines indefinitely in a similar way to the Influenza virus.  
\- Novavax has a proven ‚Äòclass leading‚Äô vaccine technology and adjuvant (Matrix-M) that protects against SARS-CoV-2 and has shown efficacy against antigenic drift (i.e. variants which are typical of single strand DNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2). Based on information to date, their vaccine candidate appears to have outperformed other leading vaccine technologies with the original virus strain, let alone the variants.  
\- Novavax‚Äôs ‚Äòclass leading‚Äô vaccine technology and adjuvant has the potential to protect against and rapidly respond to evolving respiratory diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. With NanoFlu there is the opportunity for a combined vaccine that also protects against antigenic drift. Given the low rates of Influenza this year, the three leading Influenza vaccine manufacturers (Sanofi, GSK and CSL; none of which are American\*) will struggle to select strains to protect against in 2022 (see today‚Äôs Sunday Times article). Therefore a combined vaccine technology and adjuvant from Novavax that can effectively protect against a range of variants could be market leading. \* Given President Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuy American‚Äô Act and Novavax‚Äôs potential to cope with antigenic drift, it is possible that Novavax could become the vaccine of choice amongst US healthcare professionals, potentially one of the largest single markets by revenue.  
\- Assuming Novavax gains approval and achieves it‚Äôs targetted annual run rate of 2 billion doses by Spring, then I expect net earnings (i.e. profit) of $4.5 billion. This is based on the 876 million doses for higher income countries with a net margin of $4 per dose; together with $1 per dose net margin from the 1 billion doses expected to be produced by the Serum Institute of India for low and middle income countries. Given what I believe is a conservative PE ratio of 20 this equates to a market capitalisation of $90 billion and over six times the current share price (i.e. $1,325.64). It should be noted that this doesn‚Äôt include revenue from NanoFlu which could generate additional profits in the hundreds of millions by 2022 / 2023.  
Please note that these are my opinions and you should do your own due diligence or seek professional advice before deciding whether to invest.  
Lastly well done to all the Novavax investors who bought and held through the various attempts by nefarious short sellers and media outlets to drive the share price down over the last year. Through supporting Novavax through a number of equity raises, it seems likely that you have played a part in saving many lives in the future!",1612137776

"workout","t5_2rir8","What you can do is maybe try doing a compensation  for what you eat to satisfy your cravings. What I mean is say over a 3 day period, to maintain your weight, you‚Äôve gotta have consumed 4500 total calories (1500 a day on avg) so if you are able to gauge roughly how many calories you consumed on the binge day, then the next to days you compensate to keep that mark of 4500 calories in 3 days. You can do this by adding more activity over you‚Äôre next couple days and eating a couple more less calorie dense foods. Salads done right without over doing it on dressings and such can be great for this. A big fulling salad may only come out to be 200-300 total calories rather than a big 600-1000 calories pizza slice or something like that. This method will allow you to stay on track during times of either a slip ups, bad cravings, or life getting in the way of maintaining your usual stable routine. Things like holiday meals stuff like that. But this should allow you to get away with your cravings and stay on track. Just remember that it‚Äôs best to try and keep it more stable and consistent so you‚Äôll wanna avoid as best you can from having to do this, but sometimes you just gotta do it and that‚Äôs ok.

**AITA for ""taking vacation"" and leaving my husband with every single house duty there is for 4 days?**

My husband and I have been together for 8 years, recently married (15 months ago). We have a 4 year old son. For the past 3 years I have worked from home (such a god send), 12 hour shifts 4 days a week. It's a struggle, because my husband gets home from work at 1am and takes 2 to 3 hours to unwind so he doesnt get to bed until maybe 3 or 4am and sleeps basically all day until he has to leave for work. On his days off he spends that with me and our son, obviously, but I have noticed that as time goes on, he does less and less around the house. Before this he would make dinner on his days off, take care of ALL of sons needs and do basic cleaning so that I could have a breather. Now he doesnt make dinner at all, falls asleep on the couch by 7 so I have son duty 24/7 and hasnt lifted a finger to clean in weeks. So on my 3 days off a week, I end up having to deep clean my entire house because I dont have time to do anything on my work days aside from the bare minimum. 

2 weeks ago I asked him for some help. He happily obliged for all of 30 minutes before taking off to go help a buddy with his car and didnt do jack squat after returning home because he ""was tired"". I needed a break. I told him this. His way of comforting me was by hugging me and saying ""You're doing such a good job"". Didn't offer to help or anything. So, I made a plan. Asked my mom to take my son for 4 days and planned a vacation for myself with work. I dropped my son off yesterday with my mom (i only did this because my husband obviously works) and took off to our cabin 58 miles away to relax. 

My husband started texting me last night asking where  I was. I told him the cabin. He asked where our son was so I told him. He then started going off about how this is selfish of me and that if he had realized I wasnt merely stressed out that he would have helped out more. Used the argument that he too is stressed out and tired. He claims my communication on the issue was terrible and that I could have been more open and laid it out. Says that I'm an AH for taking a vacation without him because he ""could have used it too"". But the thing is, I straight out told him I needed a break. I asked him for help. He disregarded it all. But now I'm curious if I'm an AH.

ETA: Our conversations went exactly as I wrote them above. So maybe I was lacking in the communication department.

"RetroPie","t5_31mi1","I made a 4 player setup and then took it apart for parts. Here‚Äôs what I learned:

Players 1 and 2 should have a bit more room. They‚Äôll get 99% of the use.

Players 3 and 4 (far left and far right) can be crammed near the edge a bit, and only need 4 buttons max. I don‚Äôt know of any 4 player games that use more.

Players 1&amp;2 should be angled straight on at the screen. In my opinion Players 3&amp;4 should be too, but there‚Äôs more debate about this. Some folks prefer them angled in a touch, but  make sure your players know which way is up. 

I made mine as a tabletop slab that we would put in front of a display for parties. It worked well but slid around a bit. I would have put some rubber feet on it and make a wooden ‚Äúskirt‚Äù around the front 3 edges if I wanted to keep it long term.

My kids played through the simpsons in its entirety which was pretty great and it got some 1-2 player use but eventually it was gathering dust and I decided to make a nicer 2 player rig.

"keto","t5_2rske","The interface of that phone application is very pretty, but it's missing the point by making everything look the same. You can calculate your macros from the calculator in the FAQ of this subreddit.

[https://calculo.io/keto-calculator](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator)

Enter your stats and then play around with the weight loss you want to achieve. And notice that if you increase your calorie deficit, you increase your weight loss.

But also notice that the protein amount doesn't change at all when you do that, only the amount of fat.

Do you understand what I'm saying? In other words, if I were to make a phone application with a pretty UI, I would prioritize the protein (to ensure you get the minimum recommended). And I would use a different graphic element to represent carbs or fat to make sure people understood that they can eat less of those if they wanted, but that they can not go over their recommended limits.

Also note, that if you eat more protein instead of fat, that's fine also. It's ok if you go over your limit of protein. The protein limit is a lower limit, not an upper limit. The main reason we eat fat is to feel less hungry for longer periods of time, but if hunger is not your problem, fat is not strictly necessary.",1612137777

The source you cited claims a CAGR of 4.5% and $5.24bil revenue by 2024, but [this](https://ksusentinel.com/2021/01/29/impact-of-covid-on-biochar-market-to-reach-us14751-8-thousand-by-2025/) source posted two days ago predicts a CAGR of 14.5% (holy cow) but a total revenue of $14,751 thousand, or \~$15,000,000 by 2025. Large growth, but much smaller market overall. (someone correct me if I've misinterpreted the meaning of ""$14,751 thousand"". Seems a convoluted way to phrase a number)

I think the study you quoted considers all medical waste whether it can produce energy or not. SNPW will be using pyrolysis to process waste at their facility. The study I linked above specifically addresses biochar, the product required for pyrolysis. The market for this kind of energy facility may not be as big as you think.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","The order of Projectile operations is Split -&gt; Pierce -&gt; Fork -&gt; Chain -&gt; Return

I'm ignoring the extra hits Lightning Arrow itself causes.

With 5 Chain you'll hit enemy 1 and then it'll Chain to 5 other enemies for a total of 6 hit.

With Fork +2 Chain you'll hit the first enemy, then usually hit two more behind for a total of 3 just from Fork, then each of those can Chain so you'll go up to 7 total enemies hit.

Fork +2 chain is generally superior to 5 chain, even without the Split Shot notable.  If you do take Split Shot then instead of 7 enemies hit you'll have 10 hits (1 primary, 3 forked to, 6 chained to) 50% (or 60 with the preceding node) of the time.

If your goal is simply more stuff hit the Fork option is superior.  However, Fork is not guaranteed to hit since projectiles will always Fork at certain angles.  Usually this isn't an issue since you'll be hitting things that have other things behind them but not always.",1612137778

You sure about that? Seems like him rarely having the most shots in the 3rd would directly confirm me saying he stalls possessions with dribble isos that go nowhere and takes possessions off ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

&gt;*You know there have been moments where he's started off games hot and then he just doesn't see the ball for half a quarter. Malone doesn't call plays for him or anybody on the team really, nobody sets screens or helps him get open except for him running around trying to shake his defender.*

And what do we call it when he stands around and is stationary in the 3rd quarter but in constant motion the rest of the game? Below average.

&gt;*And you just complain about him and have no viable solutions.*

The solution is to not play him and let him get healthy. We can't do that right now, but the issues caused by him being hurt are still there and worth calling out.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","There are two ways to win a pump and dump.

The first one is having two monitors, one with all exchanges you're registered on, the other one with Telegram with the right channel opened.

As soon as you see the crypto name, hit buy and IMMEDIATELY switch to sell and hit sell. Without checking the price. Just sell, it's already pumped to infinity in the 12 seconds it took you to do this. It's not only already pumped but it's being dumped too.

Those pump and dumps are insane as fuck and literally make the price shake by 10x its value up and down every second. Being among the first ones to buy is the key to not buy it at 10x the original price.

Of course, you should be putting just $50 there as a fun experiment, if it turns out to be $500 you won, if it's suddenly $20 it's okay, you took a huge risk and you failed.

The second way to win them is staying away from it.",1612137779

"massage","t5_2qmyc","I would recommend speaking with an Occupational Therapist specializing in hand therapy, if it gets particularly troublesome. They are experts in the upper extremity. If not, an orthopedic doctor (also specializing in the hand/upper extremity) can test for nerve irritation too. It is difficult to say without professional input on where you might be impinging on the nerve. You can google ""Ulnar Nerve Glides"" and see if that helps. If you have any impingement on the nerve, the glides floss the nerve through the muscles. If the nerve is getting ""stuck"" anywhere, the glides may help mobilize it. Problem is it could be in the hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, or further up in the shoulder or neck. 

I'm all forearm and I have had ulnar nerve issues from breaking my wrist (hamate, cubital tunnel) and opposite arm (ulna), in the past. How I was sleeping was part of the problem, I would guard both upper extremeties by sleeping with my elbows hyper flexed so my forearms were tucked against my chest. So my ulnar nerves were being aggravated in the elbow, and then by any swelling occuring by the hamate and ulna individually would pressure the nerves.

You need to check your daily doings, not just massage, to make sure there isn't anything else you are doing that may aggravate the nerve (like sleeping on your arms and shoulders funny). You may want to look into reducing any inflammation in the forearms/wrists/hands. And as for technique, what in particular is aggravating? Using the proximal ulnar (boney side)? Using the olecranon (point of elbow)? Or using the fleshy side (anterior/flexor surface)? When you use your forearm, are you extending or hyper extending the hand to keep your fingers out of the way from dragging on the client? That will some cause issues as well, and you will create unnecessary tension in the forearm. If you are elbow heavy, you could aggravate the olecranon bursa too. 

So be hyper vigilant, pay particular attention to the mechanics of what you are doing. Relax the wrist, be careful with the olecranon, alternate use of the flexor and boney surfaces of the forearm. Check in with your massage medium (oil, lotion, cream) and see if you might have to little glide, enough to cause excessive friction on the forearm. You may want to change mediums and see what that does as well.",1612137779

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I seem to be one of the only people who enjoyed the final act. Maybe it's just because I'm not huge into true crime or whodunits, but I found it really refreshing when I realized that the movie isn't just a simple ""Who is the serial killer?"". Ultimately, it doesn't matter who the killer is (although I choose to believe it wasn't Leto because the movie is stronger that way), it's about how obsession can drive us crazy and lead to further destruction. It reminded me of Zodiac in that way, since in Zodiac it isn't really about the killer either, but instead the impact that his acts have on the stability of the community. I do wish Rami Malek's ""turn"" was developed better, I almost feel like the movie should have been from his POV instead of Denzel's.",1612137779

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","&gt; I said she doesn't have control over any of this and like you said, she doesn't.

So you didn't even read what I said. Here, I'll copy it:

She's fully in charge of the United States Emergency Economic Stabilization fund, known as the TARP and signed into law in 2008. Technically it only has about 35 billion left, but as the power exists, reallocating budget within the Treasury Department would be within her purview. The funds [of the TARP] cannot be reallocated (due to Dodd-Frank) but they still exist and can be used within the program [on which she has complete oversight and control, so she could use them].

&gt; Tons of people could advise the president to suggest to the sec to blah blah blah. So what? 

Except it's her JOB to advise him on that. It's literally her responsibility. It's what she does.

Are you seriously trying to downplay her role in trying to say that it's not important because other people can give advice on it anyway?

""It's fine if the person who will be advising Biden on this has a conflict of interest, other people can also advise Biden even if it's not her job but it is hers, so it doesn't matter!""

&gt; Like, give me something other than conspiracies here.

It's not a conspiracy to state that someone has a conflict of interest when they had significant financial exchanges with a morally bankrupt company and will be advising the president on what to do regarding the events surrounding that company.

&gt; Someone experienced in economics and works in government gave a speech at a hedge fund. Okay? Where is the legitimate reasoning that this would mean anything.

Quinn and Sam was a good way to introduce his character into the show. Mercedes and Sam is superb and should have been endgame. And Brittany and Sam was some comedic gold. But at some time he always had a new girlfriend lining up next to him when his character is not even a womanizer - and with every new girlfriend his character also changed.

2. Do a time jump after Season 3. The first few episodes of Season 4 could be fillers of what happened in the last few years (I think 2 - 5 years would have been a good time jump) and then it starts with the actual storyline. Rachel recently graduated from NYADA tries to score her rirst Broadway role, Finn finds his destiny in Glee Club, Mercedes tries to have her breakthrough as a singer and more storylines. The new members of the Glee Club could still be featured but not as heavenly and the focus stays on the original group who tries to find their meaning in life and somehow still always find themselves going back to their roots in Lima, Ohio.

3. Rachel not dropping out of NYADA. To be on Broadway was always Rachel's dream, she fought hard to get into NYADA and it makes no sense for her to let her most successful chance of becoming a star slip away to pursue a career in television which she never cared about.

Extra: Make the band members more important. They are there every episode and do not even have a name or interact with the other characters. It would have been cool if a major member of the show would have played a band member and not a singer.",1612137781

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I must ask you, are you a man or a woman? Are you saying that women shouldn't care if a man only works part-time?

History has shown us that the main driver for marriages has mainly been finances and producing a family. Finances mattered even more back in the day, particularly for men (as they were the ""providers""). Finances matter more for women now, partly because it's become so expensive to live, and partly because few men are true ""providers"" now.

I must disagree with you. It is absolutely important for men to be financially solid, and I would say important for women to have financial independence. I can't speak for men, but I know some of them don't care if a woman is financially well-off because they care more about having someone who wants to prioritize a family. Many men do care, because they... don't really want the responsibility or because of valid concerns with finances.

I do agree that capitalism has taken things too far, but mainly in the sense that women should have more freedom and flexibility to be home with their children (if they choose to have them). I don't think men need to be taking any steps down, considering they're regressing as a whole, on this front. But in the ideal world, both men and women are working part-time and sharing children/household duties in similar ways (with each taking on the roles that suit them best).",1612137781

This is all just my opinion, so you don't have to take it seriously. I really love the slideshow and the models you have right at the start of your website. The mockups for each product you have displayed are good, but if I were you I would bring the t-shirt price down to $25. You don't have to do this, but it may help you get more customers. I absolutely love the designs you have on your clothing, they really fit the vibe you're trying to portray. If I were you, I would try to add a design to the back of your t-shirts and hoodies. 

For advertising, I would make a tiktok account and start posting videos there. Every time you post a video to tiktok, it is almost guaranteed that someone will see it. I wish you the best of luck with all of this!",1612137781

&gt; # [Deportivo Maip√∫ de Mendoza venci√≥ a Madryn y ascendi√≥ a la Primera Nacional](https://www.nuevarioja.com.ar//400)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; El conjunto mendocino volver√° a la categor√≠a despu√©s de casi 29 a√±os y acompa√±ar√° al campe√≥n Atl√©tico G√ºemes de Santiago del Estero. Mientras que el perdedor jugar√° un repechaje con San Telmo.
&gt; 
&gt; Deportivo Maip√∫ de Mendoza le gan√≥ este domingo en su estadio a Deportivo Madryn de Chubut por 2 a 0, se qued√≥ con el torneo reducido del Federal A de f√∫tbol y obtuvo el segundo ascenso a la Primera Nacional para la pr√≥xima temporada.
&gt; 
&gt; El partido se jug√≥ en el estadio Omar Higinio Sperdutti, en el departamento mendocino de Maip√∫, y los goles del ""Botellero"" fueron marcados por √Ålvaro Viellez y Mat√≠as Persia en el primer tiempo.
&gt; 
&gt; Maip√∫ se qued√≥ con una merecida victoria, que la edific√≥ desde el primer minuto de juego porque sali√≥ decidido a quedarse con el triunfo y con el ascenso a la categor√≠a superior.
&gt; 
&gt; A los 7 minutos, Maip√∫ se puso en ventaja luego de una habilitaci√≥n de Jos√© M√©ndez desde el sector derecho a √Ålvaro Veliez, quien enganch√≥ desde el centro y desde afuera del √°rea clav√≥ el remate en el √°ngulo de Pablo Lencina, que nada pudo hacer para evitar el golazo y el 1 a 0.
&gt; 
&gt; El tanto de la apertura tranquiliz√≥ a los mendocinos y desequilibr√≥ a Madryn, que intent√≥ reaccionar, pero no encontr√≥ el camino y, para peor, en una pifia de Fabricio Elgorriaba, Mat√≠as Persia aprovech√≥ el error y, con un tiro bajo al palo izquierdo, marc√≥ el 2 a 0 para Maip√∫, a los 25 minutos.
&gt; 
&gt; Tras el segundo, Maip√∫ le cedi√≥ la iniciativa a Madryn, que adelant√≥ sus l√≠neas en el campo y busc√≥ acercarse con peligro, pero no tuvo ni ideas ni criterio para complicar al conjunto ""Cruzado"", que hizo su partido en el comienzo y esper√≥ luego ante la desesperaci√≥n e ineficacia de los chubutenses, para quedarse con el festejo final y el ansiado ascenso a la Primera Nacional.
&gt; 
&gt; De este modo, Maip√∫, fundado el 16 de diciembre de 1927, volver√° a la B Nacional despu√©s de casi 29 a√±os y acompa√±ar√° al campe√≥n de la categor√≠a Atl√©tico G√ºemes de Santiago del Estero.
&gt; 
&gt; Por su parte, Deportivo Madryn tendr√° otra opci√≥n de ascender a la Primera Nacional, ya que jugar√° un repechaje con San Telmo, que perdi√≥ la final de la Primera B ante Trist√°n Su√°rez.
&gt; 
&gt; \- S√≠ntesis -
&gt; 
&gt; Maip√∫: Mat√≠as Alasia; Ezequiel Bonacorso, Leandro Corulo, Fernando Moreyra y Edgardo Diaz; Jos√© M√©ndez, Federico Illanes, Franco Moreno y Diego Tonetto; √Ålvaro Veliez y Matias Persia. Luciano Theiler
&gt; 
&gt; Madryn: Pablo Lencina; Mauro Peinipil, Cristian Gonz√°lez, Nicol√°s Torres y Fabricio Elgorriaga; Gaspar Triverio, Marcos P√©rez, Fabio Gim√©nez y Alan Moreno; Sebastian Jeldres y Emiliano L√≥pez. DT: Mart√≠n Liguori

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","To clarify, I also see luck as a constant scale, not just a thing that happens. Doing something like hard rolling Sucrose specifically on Wanderlust when you do not already have Sucrose and she is the 4* you want the most in that moment is a case of the luck scale spiking for a moment, after which it returns to neutral. Likewise, not getting into a traffic collision is also a neutral point of luck, and if someone is texting and floors it into you, that's the luck scale spiking as well, just in an unfavorable direction. Indeed, if you are the texter, then you are still a factor of luck, just not your own.

Being born with a reasonably functional body that isn't missing any parts is, likewise, neutral luck. Born missing a foot is luck spiked unfavorably, and born to rich people is in a vacuum luck spiked favorably, but of course it could also run in tandem with other factors that might influence the situation.

Come to think, you can't really measure it on a straight line at all, huh.",1612137782

OR

2. After turning off your PS5 with the PS5 controller, just hit the power button from the TV remote once and it will fully turn off the TV for sure.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt;Well you're 100% wrong there. Christianity has changed a lot and continues to change. The values they push change and each denomination that's created it created out of a need for that change. By your logic we should be living like the Amish if Christianity is all the same

So religion adapts to societal changes like the catholic church and gays?

Or are you suggesting that society is more open minded because of small changes in the church?

Also no. Christianity is still 95% the same.

&gt;You'd be wrong then. 


No. You're wrong. What percentage of people dont have premarital sex because of religion? 95 percent do.. is that because they don't fear religion enough to go to hell for one sin but are taboo against another for religious reasons?

Or is it what I'm saying and that its socially taboo currently to have an abortion.

Clearly the social aspect. 

&gt;Is this your way of saying people aren't for abortion? Because the majority of Americans are pro choice. Some states have more people against it, but nationally people are for keeping it legal. 

Most people are probably pro choice, but the caveat is they don't want their tax dollars going to it. Which is understandable. Especially when planned parenthood donates millions to democrats,  it becomes political.

Not all abortion is the same. And not all people feel comfortable with abortion without limits. You know that but you choose to be disingenuous. 

&gt;Voting bloc that's pro life. That was explained earlier. Also the majority of religious Americans identify as Christian. Jews for instance don't have a large pro life movement, actually the opposite is true and a large portion were in pro choice movements. Muslims are also pro choice (depending on circumstances) in general in most sects. Really you're just showing your ignorance on the topic as a whole.

Muslims are pro choice? According to who? 

So jews ideals around choice are not important because they don't have a voice?

That changes nothing.  If it is religions as a whole that are against abortion,  and they are... doesn't it make more sense to say bibles, or religion instead of attack one religion? 

The answer is yes. But thats taboo for liberals.",1612137783

^(By: Ibram X. Kendi | 592 pages | Published: 2016 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, history, nonfiction, race, anti-racism | )[^(Search ""Stamped From the Beginning"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Stamped From the Beginning&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti‚ÄìBlack racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the lives of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and anti-racists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W. E. B. Du Bois to legendary anti‚Äìprison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading pro-slavery and pro‚Äìcivil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America.
&gt;
&gt;As Kendi illustrates, racist thinking did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Racist ideas were created and popularized in an effort to defend deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and to rationalize the nation‚Äôs racial inequities in everything from wealth to health. While racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much‚Äìneeded light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers tools to expose them‚Äîand in the process, reason to hope.

[**How Europe Underdeveloped Africa**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40630.How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa)

^(By: Walter Rodney, Vincent Harding | 312 pages | Published: 1971 | Popular Shelves: history, non-fiction, africa, politics, nonfiction | )[^(Search ""How Europe Underdeveloped Africa"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one‚Äôs will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment.
&gt;Before a bomb ended his life in the summer of 1980, Walter Rodney had created a powerful legacy. This pivotal work, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, had already brought a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. his Marxist analysis went far beyond the heretofore accepted approach in the study of Third World underdevelopment. How Europe Underdeveloped Africa is an excellent introductory study for the student who wishes to better understand the dynamics of Africa‚Äôs contemporary relations with the West.

It‚Äôs an acquired taste, for sure, but there‚Äôs a lot to appreciate. I just try to put myself in the shoes of someone who had no idea what Hip Hop/Rap was and was just hearing the style of music for the first time and how exciting that must‚Äôve been. I think when you approach it with that mindset, you really start to get a feel for how dope it truly was. I definitely agree that some of it sounds ‚Äòdated‚Äô, but that‚Äôs only because Hip Hop went on to become one of the most culturally dominant forces on the planet in the subsequent decades.

My sister and I had two rabbits when we were kids, mine was grey and hers was white. They lived in a cage outside and one morning the gate was open and the rabbits gone. We found the gray one under the porch, but the white one were nowhere to be found. We asked all the other kids in the area to help us search for it in the woods. We didn't really think we would find it, the forrest is huge and the rabbit was probably long gone. 

We didn't get very far before I saw something white in the bottom of a crater-looking bushy area, I could see the white ears and signalled to the others to surround the area and I started to slowly sneak up on it. I could see the two ears standing up, and it was complete still (and I remember thinking it was odd, that rabbit usually ran away from people approaching) It wasn't until I was right beside it that I realised that the ears that I've seen was just the handles of a tied up, white plastic bag. Perplexed, wondering how a tied up, seemingly heavy plasticbag had ended up in that area of the woods, so I picked it up and looked inside.

And in the bag was the rabbit. In pieces.

So I have not seen my now 18yr old daughter, and my 16yr daughter in 4+ years, my son 11yr in the last 3 years. My 13yr daughter came 1x about 7 months ago (first I had seen her in years) and now she comes everyday of my extended standard schedule.

I hate it for them. I hate her for this child abuse. I decided I will be there every chance I have, even if I show up and ride home alone every week. I have never missed a school event, even though they and the school treats me like a sickness. (She cheated on me, and we decided to part ways, I left everything for them and pay 50+% childsupport and medical.)

I decided to move on and build my life. The children that are with me are going to experience the fruits of my life. If the others ever show interest I will accept, and embrace them, but we will need to build a new relationship together.

I'm very surprised you mom let you see your dad. I have hope my children will one day see the lie and give me a chance. We have lost so much critically important years, but we are still alive.

Someone will fold eventually, but I wouldn't put it past a bunch of people without much to lose to hold on until the bitter fucking end and force these billionaires to fold. We'll see.

Edit: and as long as they wait, they pay more interest, tempting their lenders to call up their margin bets. The longer it goes on, the more they lose. Shareholders only stand to gain, since they own the shares and aren't paying interest, and won't pay taxes until they sell.

Edit 2: and as long as other people see the viability of the stock, and decide to invest, the stock increases, further pushing up the interest on those eventual margin calls. They can put it off by playing dirty tricks, like getting shady brokers to halt trading, so they can push the price down and buy their later shorts, but they can't escape the mathematical inevitability of paying more if people just keep buying the dips and don't sell.",1612137785

Also, keep in mind that you're entering the prime time to be putting on muscle mass. After a certain age it is much harder, and the strength that you build in your 20s will help extend your functional years as you age.

There are lots of humane enclosures you can change to, but [a DIY bin cage](https://youtu.be/ZJYIVkqTZBE) would likely be the cheapest and easiest to make so that you hamster can get suitable living conditions ASAP :) Bins are cheap, and a really easy way to provide 600+ square inches of floorspace, as well as 6+ inches if bedding so that hamsters can have a great life :)

Also, if someone is working full-time there is not enough time to study.

I was wondering if there are any 0L students out there that are planning on going to school part-time and working part-time? Or if there's anyone out there that is currently do this? If I choose to work part-time, then could that potentially allow me to get a summer internship and help with that particular disadvantage?",1612137786

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","The correct answer: 

Most of the grain going to livestock is a *byproduct* of seed oil production. This means it would be produced anyway. Its existence is a consequence of the explosion in demand for seed oils over the last century. In other words, the stuff is *not* grown solely to feed cows. 

We can do one of two things with this mash: 

‚Ä¢ Use it 

‚Ä¢ Throw it all away 

Option number 2 is tricky because we produce quite a bit of this stuff. Where do we put it? Let it rot? Dump it into the ocean? Probably not great for the environment. It would also require farmers to take a big cut in pay, since they're no longer able to sell it. 

Further, it is not fit for human consumption because it is contaminated with known carcinogens like hexane. Hexane is a chemical used to extract the oil. 

This means that the vegan claim of ""80% of grain produced goes to feed humans"" is not only inaccurate, it's a form of gaslighting. 

The vast majority of grain we produce is produced as a byproduct of seed oil. It's vegans and people eating SAD that consume things like soy bean oil in dressings, sauces and other products. 

&gt;[FAO sets the record straight‚Äì86% of livestock feed is inedible by humans
](https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/fao-sets-the-record-straight-86-of-livestock-feed-is-inedible-by-humans/)

A person eating a whole foods omnivore diet isn't contributing to that demand much. They have no use for seed oils since they don't arbitrarily avoid lard and pressed plant oils like olive and palm.  A person eating store bought processed food‚Äîeven vegans‚Äîcertainly is.

I will give you a similar example - when I played the item rework on PBE, before all the balance change the original Liandry + Demonic outperformed Luden's by a LOT damage wise, and a champions like Lux / Leblanc would straight up deal more damage building Liandry than if they built Ludens, they would deal it slower, they couldn't one-shot, because it is a dot, but overall they performed straight up better.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

This is an extremely unique situation that no one saw coming, and TD does not actually give a fuck where you set your limit sell. It makes no difference to them. 

Besides, you still CAN have a crazy high limit sell in TD anyways. You just have to do it in a slightly roundabout way with conditional trades and whatnot. It takes like an extra minute to set up. 

In fact - if TD was in bed with Citadel, they would WANT you to have limit sells, no matter where they were placed. The worst thing for them is if you hold, which would happen automatically if you don‚Äôt have an open limit sell. 

Citadel has nothing to do with this specific issue. They buy lots of data from a lot of different sources. TD selling data doesn‚Äôt make them bad, and is the reason why they don‚Äôt have non-option trading fees anymore.",1612137789

So a seventeen year old girl acts weirdly and undresses herself- yes drunk people who cannot consent CAN still talk walk and speak, but that don't mean they are capable of consent, cause once again, she can't even remember who she fucked or if she got fucked by OP. Once again, there is no way she would do that if she was not intoxicated. Once again, LEGALLY and ETHICALLY if you have with sex someone who is drunk enough to not act like themselves or act irrationally, THAT IS RAPE. TIS THE LAW SONNY BOY. Thems the rules. Also, how do you know they were all seventeen? Someone of them could have been older. Also SOME GROSS FUCKER FILMED IT ALL. THAT BE CHILD PORN. THAT IS ILLEGAL. Actually even if it wasn't child porn, that would be considered revenge porn. As for the ""did she rape them"" well... they filmed her and posted it so already I suspect their case if far from innocent. But, it depends on level of alcohol content and age after that, really.

"survivor","t5_2qhu3","Oh sure that's totally legit, and for the record I also think that Probst going so hard on Osten actually made that episode a lot better. It's a great, memorable moment that feels very dramatic as you're watching it and that ALSO (and I suspect this is part of why they came down so hard on Osten to begin with) juxtaposes with the Outcast twist while at the same time validating it. Viewers might be inclined to think ""Why should *they* get a second shot? They lost!"" - and obviously many viewers still do to some extent - but that's not only mitigated but also turned into the basis of an actually super interesting and effective contrast when you place the Outcasts up against Osten and can then make the case of ""Sure, they were voted out, but *they want it more.*"" Like there's this whole angle that they lost, they suffered the ultimate humiliation, and yet they STILL want to fight to get back in just to get a SHOT at being voted out AGAIN and meanwhile this guy who hasn't even been voted out ostensibly wants to just give up? It's a really solid contrast that makes the episode a lot more dramatic while also helping to justify the Outcast twist in itself and give you a reason to root for them, or at least less reason to root *against* them. I mean Probst even draws this contrast explicitly in the episode itself.

So honestly what they did to Osten was fucking AWESOME television, in my opinion. It made a great TV episode. I can just also separate myself from that afterwards, recognize what the producers are doing and how the spin they choose to put on the episode completely changes how fans will respond to it, recognize *why* they're doing it and what they get out of that - and through all of that, appreciate the show MORE, not less (Survivor becomes much more interesting when you start recognizing that what we see is not really reality) - but also separate myself out from it and recognize that at the same time that great TV episode came at a cost to Osten and that on a human level, the way I feel about him and his decision does not need to line up with what the manufactured TV episode manipulated me into feeling the first time I saw it and that he didn't actually commit some grievous sin by stepping out of a reality TV show when someone from his core alliance had to go. The producers who get paid a ton of money to make a compelling TV show just did a good job making it seem that way.

This doesn't even really rely on outside info about his staph infections, either. (I mean those certainly help and those make it more ""forgivable"" to a lot of people - but from my perspective he's not in the place of needing *forgiving* to begin with because *I* am not in the place of decreeing when people are morally obligated to starve in the woods for my amusement, because that is absolutely horrifying, nor am I in the place of designating when it is or isn't ""okay"". If you're miserable get out of there and take care of yourself, that's more important. So whether Osten had staph infections or just really fucking hated the rain doesn't really matter to me.) But like even from the episodes *themselves*, you can see that Osten wanted to quit a lot very early on, and that then, eventually, he does. And the way the show manipulates you into feeling about that is that Osten is a big dumb baby who was bad at everything and couldn't handle it... but like, if you take the information we're given but *remove* the producer spin for it and think critically about the events, if that's what Osten did, why didn't he ever quit between Day 9 when Lill went out and Day 19 when he did? Hell, go back even further, why didn't he quit in like the entire two weeks when he seemingly wanted do starting with when Ryan S. was out? Because he wasn't really much of a ""quitter"" - he individually, subjectively wanted out, but his tribe and alliance decided otherwise and so he was fine with honoring that and rolling with that and continuing to fight. He didn't quit when they weren't at TC, he didn't quit when they had other people to vote off, but he only quit when the alternative would have been outlasting one of his actual allies who all wanted it more AND outlasting them at a Tribal Council none of them expected that absolutely killed their momentum on a dope underdog winning streak when they all thought they were gonna get to merge and eat a ton of food.

Absolutely all of that is apparent even from the edited TV episode. The edit just compels you to ignore it.

Anyways as to your coment, yeah like you said it totally fucks up their production schedule. I mean Nicaragua is a big example where they ""had to"" hold a whole additional Tribal Council on a day they weren't expecting to which probably means a whole extra crew operating on their day off, scrapping a challenge they tested extensively, etc etc, tons of logistical stuff I can't imagine so yeah I can see why Probst is pissed-off there.

But at the same time: a.) NaOnka and KShinn didn't even want to wait until Tribal lol they wanted to dip then and there so, like, the ""hassle"" of the producers setting up a new TC is entirely self-imposed at that point; b.) if the producers don't want people to quit then maybe they shouldn't lie to a recruit and tell them they'll go out on day 3 for a free vacation and then force them to wear almost nothing in the rainforest when they normally live in a hot and arid climate; c.) again the argument that they shouldn't have quit because it'd just be *sooo* hard on the producers is intrinsically an argument that these women had some type of obligation to continue going through immense physical, mental, and emotional stress in order to save some television producers time, money, and convenience which reaaaaally isn't an argument that hold a lot of water, to say the least, in my opinion, I mean at the end of the day if ongoing intense human suffering means less to someone than the convenience of TV producers (who chose to cast those people at all - and who are presumably fairly ready to adjust their schedule at any time anyway, given the potential for evacs) or this vague abstract idea about ""respecting the game"" (which clearly the producers don't at this point or all the wacky stuff they've added over the last few years in particular, like the executive producer coming out on the last night and explicitly instructing the jurors on how they're supposed to vote, wouldn't be a thing) those are just some skewed priorities imo.

Which I think also makes sense because I don't think a ton of people exactly reasoned themselves into the position of hating quitters. It is the angle the show wants you to have, especially because editing quitters to be hated will hopefully discourage future quitters and thus make the producers' lives easier which is all they really care about. And so the episode are very much designed to get you to feel this way and it seems to more or less add up so a lot of people will never really question it.

But yeah in short I totally agree with you that the producers have logical reasons, as far as their own self-interest is concerned, to make quitters look bad. We just also don't have to, like, agree with that. And I bet a lot fewer fans would if the default mode were less to just take in the TV show and respond to it as intended, and more to critically look at it as a manufactured piece of media created not by some neutral messenger but by producers that will have biases to make certain things look better or wore a lot of the time and to think about what those biases are and how they impact the product, and especially to recognize the real distinction between the real human beings participating and the edited TV characters we watch.

In short: Yeah it's a hassle for them but who cares. Starving in the woods would have been a hassle for the people who eventually decided doing it for a couple weeks was more than enough to get what they wanted out of the experience. Fans who ignore this are basically arguing that there's some type of imperative for people to be starved and dehydrated and physically and emotionally exhausted without their consent for the fans' own entertainment which is absolutely ridiculous if you stop to think about it",1612137790

"quotes","t5_2qhdx","How I spent my time, and who I spent it with, predominantly. Want to hang out with people from ""the wrong side of the tracks?"" No, focus instead on keeping on the straight and narrow--and later, find out that all the people you didn't like as much, but who you hung out with because they were the ""right sort of people,"" were actually looking down on you the whole time. I missed out on a lot of potentially genuine connections in the name of discipline.

Later, in college, when invited to parties--or on dates, or to concerts--once again, I avoided any that weren't ""the right kind"" of events. I missed tons of experiences, because of the ""strength of my character"". 

In my first career, which I absolutely hated, and which was NOT a good fit for me, I ""stuck it out,"" for years, because that's what you're supposed to do, right? My first marriage, which was abusive and which I should have left before the wedding? Stuck with it for seven years, because ""a real man makes it work"" and ""the more you suffer the more you care, right?""

If I had stopped caring so much about ""doing the right thing"" and more about ""what makes me feel good"" (or at least ""what doesn't make me feel bad""), I would have spent a lot less time unhappy. And, frankly speaking, that would have helped me be less of a jerk to the other people around me--something else I regret.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","Your post was removed by the moderators:

Your post was removed because it is a very common question or post that is addressed in the /r/chess **[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/faq)** and/or **[Online Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/resources)** pages. Here is the relevant section:

**[What is a stalemate, and why is it not a checkmate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/edit/faq#wiki_what_is_a_stalemate.2C_and_why_is_it_not_a_checkmate.3F)**

A stalemate happens when your opponent has no legal moves to make on his/her turn, but is also not directly in check. It is **not** considered a checkmate, since the prerequisite for a checkmate is that your opponent must be in check in the first place! In chess, you win when your opponent is in check and has no legal moves to get out of check (checkmate). In stalemate, you've only fulfilled half of that definition. In this case, you do not win -- the game is unconditionally declared a draw! 

Stalemate is a very important rule that **will not be changed**, no matter how many impassioned letters you write to your local chess federation. It is a pattern that helps define specific endgame drawing techniques, and is critical to learn. To avoid stalemates, try to continually deliver checks until mate, or ensure that your opponent's king has a move until you can set up a mate. There are some lessons on identifying stalemate on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/learn#/16).

The official definition of *stalemate*, per the [USCF rulebook](http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/chessrules/US_Chess_Rule_Book_Chapters_1_2_11_v7.0.pdf):

&gt; A game is drawn when the king of the player to move is not in check **and** that player has no legal move. This type of draw is called stalemate. Providing that the opponent‚Äôs previous move is legal, this immediately ends the game.

Almost 18 years ago. This guy is one of the leading trans specialists in Poland (which is generally really bad in transgender care).

Lists 10 criteria that can be used (have been historically used) to determine [sex/gender] (those are the same words in Polish). This also includes stuff like social/cultural stuff, so gender. It also separately lists brain and psychological sex, which nowadays is usually merged into one... So it was 8, not 7, sorry. Seems that one source that cited this missed one of the aspects when listing them, oops. 

So the aspects listed are: chromosomal/genetic, gonadal, gonadophoric, outer genitalia, phenotype, hormonal (this one was missing on the list I've used to remember the 7), metabolic, and this brain stuff.


Examples of other sources: 

Nature https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943 mentions chromosomes, gonads, hormones, cellular sex, it ends with conclusion that no ""biological"" factor is better than any other to determine ""sex"", so gender identity should be used when it's needed. (This doesn't state clearly that gender identity is biological, but read further) 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25667367/ ""Evidence supporting the biologic nature of gender identity"" - if we analyse it together with conclusion from (1), then this ""use gender identity if you need to determine who someone is"" is clearly biological. Thus disproving your ""biological males/females"".

I could list many more sources, but some are not in English or I haven't read the papers yet (just know about their existence as they were listed as sources to more... human-friendly articles), or just don't remember exact terminology that was used (eg that I remembered 7 aspects instead of 8).",1612137791

What I‚Äôm saying is, obesity is too often determined by a person‚Äôs environment and available options and not purely by personal choice. Just speaking for the USA, but if 40% of the country is obese, that‚Äôs not by choice. You must examine the factors leading to such widespread obesity.

NOW, having said all that, on a person to person level you will probably have a better idea of what a friend or family member‚Äôs schedule and budget look like.

Meanwhile Winston wasn't even trusted to start consistently over a gimmick baller in New Orleans (and having adopted the Saints after 6 years of living there as my number two team, I follow them fairly intensely).

2 cops on duty is a minimum.  If one is unexpectedly involved in a situation that gets problematic, other cop has to be free for backup.  I understand that.

When my kids were in high school, one of them left a door unlocked and someone else snatched the faceplate off the stereo.  I told the eldest to offer 20 bucks to whoever could give him the faceplate back.  Later that day, he got the faceplate back.  $20 is cheaper than new stereo, and a lesson was learned about locking the car.
Practicality over morality.
I've had a crapload of tools and building materials stolen in Tacoma.  The only police report I ever filed was a break-in and all-night party in a vacant house I owned.  Took a little over three very busy days to fix that.  Criminal prosecutions-none, monetary compensation-none.  It could always be worse.",1612137792

"babylon5","t5_2rhrd","I guess you could do away with couple of plots that are great and all but don't contribute to main plots, if we consider those Shadow war (of which Centauri-Narn war is a part of) and EA becoming fascist. You could cut several stand alone eps, most of raiders stuff, Garibaldi's and Franklin's substance abuse, Ivanova's family background, Minbari civil war, some B plots (or even A plots while keeping B plots)...... Also some stuff that was result of characters leaving and being replaced so stories had to be written to explain all that. But would you want to? It creates deep, multidimensional characters that are human and flawed.

As for time, eps were 42 minutes long, standard for this format, that means 4620 minutes overall. Movies can be ignored as only *In the Beginning* has actual relevance and even that one is more of a background with some fluff that could easily be cut to various relevant scenes and those inserted in the story via flashbacks, so lets say 4650 minutes. That's 77,5 hours, i.e. 77 eps if you are going for one hour mark and stretch some. Let's say we trim original run to 90 eps by removing some plots I mentioned. That's 3780 minutes in original format or 63 hours, same number of eps in new format. If you want to really push it and remove some more background and explaining motivations that's 80 eps, 56 hours. And that would likely leave gaps, plot holes, shallower characters etc. So even with very trimmed down story and 1 hour format you are still looking at 5-6 10 episode seasons. And as I've said, nobody is going to commit to that right away, not with B5 having status it has.",1612137793

Except thats not really how it works out. If your stocks hit 0 or pennys on the dollar, you don't necessarily go bankrupt. If the company is somehow relying on the stock for capital, then that might be true, but Gamestop could stay at $300/share and still go bankrupt. The most likely (and even then not very much) thing that could happen if the stock was at near $0, is that it gets delisted on the NYSE, but the stock would have to maintain those low levels for some amount of time. 

If they had other goals, then one possible goal of Melvin's might have been to claim a substantial controlling share of GME for next to nothing. This would depend on the class of stock on the market though. Not all stock traded on the markets is actually voting shares in a company.",1612137794

Yes! Definitely play it, just keep in mind that it's totally different from the OT in tone, atmosphere and the gameplay and that's on purpose. Besides comparing one game to 3 + dlcs makes no sense in general.

 Andromeda's focus is not military, neither it's a war. It's about exploring new world, finding a home, and making allies on the way. 

The story is good but it's clearly just a start so by the end there will be a lot of questions. 

The characters are wonderful, just don't stick with 2 favorite, always mix the crew as often as possible to hear all the combinations of their relationships. They will have a lot to say about you, the events, each other and the world around.

In general talk to everyone as much as possible, read everything, don't get obsessed with doing every little quest right away, do them as you go.

"technicallythetruth","t5_3pzez","Hey, so I watched the entire video, thanks for sharing that point of view. 

So I think he is not addressing the underlying assumption in the bible. The bible is a book written be the case for the LORD to be the fundamental truth of existence and material.  In other words he is objective truth. Objective truth is that there is only one truth, this truth can't be contradicted, and must always be present. 

So what is the theologians arguement, that the bible is full of contradictions and that the only way it can be understood is through allegory. But what happens with allegory? Well you get hundreds of subjective different interpretations of what the ""bible"" means. These interpretations are all simultaneously correct, mutually exclusive, and contradictory to each other. Therefore the bible must be subjective, and not a document for truth. Also I'll bring up that allegory was not necessary at all, as there were  numerous writers (philosophers) hundreds of years before hand that wrote in logically systematic ways that did not lead to contradiction meaning that to write in allegory would have to have been a choice. 

Lastly, all successful major ( Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Judaism, ect.) religions have two main components: an imperialist past and the ability to be flexed into cultural sub context it's being read in. This makes them effective cultural tools for homogeneity in any diverse area. 

Though I will also admit, I do not believe science to be an objective alternative. There is no objective system of truth.",1612137795

That was when I found my doctor and told her what he said to me she was appalled. Turns out I have been suffering for years with psoriasis, apparently not in my head but for sure on my head.

Doll Tor is a stone circle located just to the west of Stanton Moor, near the village of Birchover, Derbyshire in the English East Midlands. Doll Tor is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages, over a period between 3300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circles' builders. With a diameter of 7 metres, Doll Tor consists of six upright main stones arranged in a circle.

Tldr; Other-ism is how ruling classes maintain control of the masses, money is how they maintain control of the politicians. And they use whichever of those 2 they can to hold back the other.

...

A) because it's easier to target an unknown group of ""others"" than to look at yourself in the mirror. 

B) because the rich as well as politically powerful know that if they can get those ""others"" targeted by the MSM reliant mass population that in the end the powerful people tend to be forgotten as the problem. 

Politics is driven by a hybrid of socio-economics (politicians) and bias-cofirmed religious instinct (populace). By religious instinct I don't mean through organizwd religion, but the fact that uniformed voting triggers the exact same parts of the brain that are locked but religious conviction. 

The wealthy always exploit that. 

This is most definitely beyond the point where it's being driven by a few anons wanting to make a big score (we all still want that, too, of course).

Again, just like every other ""free thinker"" I run into, you assume that I'm some starry eyed pseudo-communist that needs to be given some good old fashioned platitudes about life.

Equal rights advocates have been accused of being part of socialist/communist plots forever and have been told, ""go slow."" You know, you don't want to upset the very wealthy or the dominant white population for fear of the backlash? /s 

But the backlash happens regardless. So what does that tell you about the actual control they wield over all of the rest of our lives? Let me make this very clear to you since you aren't very bright; I could give a shit if you make $500k a yr thru non-fucked up means and treat people with dignity and respect and good faith, regardless of their economic status. It is all of the mega millionaires and billionaires that have gotten even richer since covid for example while the rest of us have gotten more poor and less stable. 

You won't address my very simple principle and proposal, which is telling about who YOU are:
The goldwn rule. I want them to suffer proportionally to the suffering they have caused due to their misdeeds, manipulations, suppression of freeing technologies, etc. Why is that so hard for you to understand?",1612137796

Go to [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/), for anything you want to invest in, check out the chart and uncheck everything other than *Price (BTC)*. Look for the Litecoin, Steem, Zcoin, DigiByte, Dash, VET, Neo, and Tron's that were ""top"" coins people were diversifying into not too many years ago, see how they have consistently lost value against bitcoin and are now moving down the charts as the latest ""new technology"" coins get hyped up.

Look at the latest bull run, which coins kept up with bitcoin? Which lost?  Which pumped in 2017 with ""alt season"" and then never maintained those levels and are now trending down.  Even ethereum hit 0.145/btc, before going as low as 0.018, and now ""recovered"" to 0.04, and it's *inflationary*...

Most altcoins are nothing other than a way to get you to part with your hard earned bitcoin.  Treat it like this before you sell that bitcoin and purchase &lt;coin&gt;.  What else do these coins do with the ICO bitcoin/eth? Why are they just sitting on it if their goal is to replace it?

Bitcoin has no marketing budget, no ICO with tens of thousands of bitcoin/ethereum in the hands of a foundation.  With bitcoin, we all get rich together as we assault the central banks monopoly on money, with altcoins, you're nothing but a mark for someone else to make more bitcoin.",1612137796

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

In regards to finding, the US and UK were the major contributors with the EU much less because they were focused on funding their french vaccine which didn‚Äôt come off.

Of course in the matter of vaccines it‚Äôs awful the quibbling coz the priority should be to get everyone vaccinated but I think EU made a major screw up here and are just gas lighting everyone for their own failings

Short Squeeze on!

AMC Short Interest rising to 86% [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)

Plus theater reopenings! Up Up Up!

Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment, which was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy last year by the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/), said Monday its doors will remain open in 2021 ‚Äî thanks to a $917 million infusion of cash.

   ""This means that any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table,"" CEO Adam Aron said in a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005273/en/AMC-Raises-917-Million-of-Fresh-Investment-Capital-Since-Mid-December-of-2020). 

With the new funding, AMC bought itself enough time to see if President Joe Biden's pledge to [ramp up](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-vows-to-ramp-up-vaccine-rollout/) the vaccine rollout to 100 million people over the next 100 days would be successful, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. Pachter said he foresees a huge return of audience members to U.S. movie theaters this summer ‚Äî if a majority of Americans are vaccinated by spring.

I don't think any regular player cares about map balance as much as apparently someone at Reto. 

Every now and then they update nearly all maps and the only thing noticeable is the fact they rearranged some sandbags while they should be focusing their efforts on making new assault maps and they haven't done the latter for YEARS afaik.

I feel it's quite obvious that if they had ~5-10 extra assault maps or did community map contests or something that the playerbase would grow most from that.

The PCI-E *slot* is the slot that you press the card into. That‚Äôs what passes data. When you‚Äôre asking about PCIE 4.0 you‚Äôre talking about the speed of that slot, not what you‚Äôre holding. 

What you‚Äôre holding in your hand is 6-pin PCI-E power. The card needs an 8-pin PCI-E power connector, which comes from the power supply not the motherboard. (Some pre-built motherboards pass PCIE power through the motherboard, but if you‚Äôre building from scratch it should come from the power supply.)

Edit: As far as what you actually NEED, look up the specific wattage of that card. The PCIE slot can supply 75W, and the connector you‚Äôre holding will supply an additional 75W. If your graphics card is under 150W, than you can get away with a 6-pin to 8-pin adapter. If it‚Äôs over 150W, you‚Äôll need a better PSU.",1612137800

EoC sephiroth appears to not be under Jenovas influence, which could mean either that he is in control of it, or he has been purged or cleansed of her cells.  If they wanted to paint Jenova as the true universal baddie with sephiroth simply being her puppet, I could see that being an interesting path because we know sephiroths tragic backstory.  Hero?

I don't know if it will let them buy GME again immediately because how the fuck could I know that - doesn't seem like it though since I think they are still limiting it. 

What I'm guessing happened here is that spotting all those new robinhood instant users $1000 proved too much and they lacked the assets to collateralize the purchases of GME. They could keep the non-meme stocks open because people weren't willy nilly dumping the $1000 into them and they weren't so volatile as to require huge margins from Robinhood. Maybe in a few days when the funds from those accounts have transferred properly people will be able to trade GME on robinhood again. 

That said, I'm far from an expert on this, my only knowledge comes from a few commerce classes I took for my econ degree so I could be way off on that estimation. We won't really know exactly what happened for a few months but its very clear that liquidity is the issue or they wouldn't be getting cash injections.",1612137800

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

Short story, you could make your skates work. You will hugely benefit from sizing down as your skates will loosen up (quite a bit w/ lolly) over time.

I wear a women‚Äôs size 8.5-9 in street shoes. When I first started skating 4 years ago I thought I was a women‚Äôs 9 in street shoes and started on a size 8 (men‚Äôs) lolly and a size 7.5 (men‚Äôs) Antik AR1. It was fine to start out and I learned to skate very well even on skates that were too big. I‚Äôve since learned that when you get new skates they should feel /almost/ too small - as they break in the suede will stretch! - more so and faster than leather skates. Now I have size 7 lolly, Jack, antik. Length wise I‚Äôm probably closer to 6.5 mens (2+ full sizes down from my women‚Äôs) but I have a wide forefoot so 7 works best when I can‚Äôt choose width.",1612137801

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Well if they could produce and sell twice as much over a wide range of items then they'd make the same or at least could because plenty of people can't currently afford their products but if they get cheaper they could. Basically what I'm saying is it's super complicated, I'm sure there's someone with actual data doing research but theres no reason to believe that the difference would be 30k in the first place. Like what if robots become cheaper (or one expensive robot does the work of 50 people) and it's actually 45k and so basically nothing else would need to change. Without real numbers I could say it's a different of $1 and everyone dies of starvation without money.  

Sorry I'm jumping around a bit but last thing I work on hospital robots, the idea behind them is to let drs do what they need to as dr and not spend their time managing meds. On top of that they don't track meds well meaning millions of dollars in extra meds are bought to make sure they have what they need. But if you have a better grasp of what is needed then you can save millions in something like this (one example I know is a hospital network that could save about 25million) they could pay 500 people 50k. So it could replace the lost wages of the dozen people it may displaced and pay for hundreds more but right now that profit goes right to hospital ceos maybe if we are lucky someone saves money somewhere but I doubt it.",1612137801

But then they decided to sell off and outsource everything, which means things cost more, require more regulation, and we get worse service.

Everyone is rich except for the paper hands who live on only as our butlers and workforce - in this sense everyone is free (except the paper hands).

The value of dogecoin is fluctuating between 1.9 and 2 trillion, theres only one problem left in the entire world: we are still not physically on the moon. A fleet of shuttles are assembled and the new human race begins life on the moon - this is the future of doge.

Be careful with the converter, pain in the arse(tip buy lots of 15A fuses, they blow for nothing especially when the heat gets high enough and you draw around 200A... Not sure which led I got exactly but his one is similar.

The Battery was a 60V tool battery. It was all I had at that voltage and portable but they were bloody expensive so use your descrsion there.

My led was 80V I think 1.5A. The converter I hooked up to a  ammeter to watch the current and a multimeter to keep an eye on the voltage and set the pots like that. 


Now next thing to worry about is blowing the battery, put a fuse in series with it. Other thing is you will start it up and either your peek will be to high and blow the converter or the current will be too high (mainly if its hot) and blow the converter. 

I basically just went by this and used trial and error. 

Heat wise that there is shit. It heats up like a mofo. Fans fans fans and more fans as the guy here said. The led can actually give you a sun burn... I found that out after 15 mins of sitting in front of it testing it... not a nice to your eyes either.

So yeah watch current heat and your battery. Thanks hope this helped  anything else you need or need to know?",1612137803

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","DD main here with mostly unicum stats in Destroyers.. I recommend any of these strong ships for Ranked:

* Tier 8:  LoYang, Cossack, Kidd
* Tier 9:  Friesland, Black, Fletcher, Mogador, Jutland (not as strong as she used to be tho)
* Tier 10: Daring, Smaland, Somers, Marceau, Z-52, Halland, Grozovoi

I realize alot of these are premiums.. If you're decent skill wise though, then most any high tier tech tree DD is workable.  For example, a good Shima captain can wreck the enemy team if played right. But bringing a strong utility such as hydro, radar, long smokes for teammates, and/or longer range torps will really be beneficial to your team.  French and Russian DDs can contribute too if played right..they are great for fast speed caps, yolo torp rushes and long range gunboating/HE spamming.  I mostly prefer hybrid DDs, ones that can gunboat, torp and cap, and generally US, British and European ships are best at that. Don't be afraid to use Tier 9 ships as it will balance out on the enemy team.

Lastly, Poor ranked choices (for like 90% of player base): Paolo Emilio, Khabarovsk, Kleber",1612137803

Abstract

**Study Objectives**

This report describes findings from an ongoing longitudinal study of the effects of varied sleep durations on wake and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and daytime function in adolescents. Here, we focus on the effects of age and time in bed (TIB) on total sleep time (TST) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) EEG.

**Methods**

We studied 77 participants (41 male) ranging in age from 9.9 to 16.2 years over the 3 years of this study. Each year, participants adhered to each of three different sleep schedules: four consecutive nights of 7, 8.5, or 10 h TIB.

**Results**

Altering TIB successfully modified TST, which averaged 406, 472 and 530 min on the fourth night of 7, 8.5, and 10 h TIB, respectively. As predicted by homeostatic models, shorter sleep durations produced higher delta power in both NREM and REM although these effects were small. Restricted sleep more substantially reduced alpha power in both NREM and REM sleep. In NREM but not REM sleep, sleep restriction strongly reduced both the all-night accumulation of sigma EEG activity (11‚Äì15 Hz energy) and the rate of sigma production (11‚Äì15 Hz power).

**Conclusions**

The EEG changes in response to TIB reduction are evidence of insufficient sleep recovery. The decrease in sigma activity presumably reflects depressed sleep spindle activity and suggests a manner by which sleep restriction reduces waking cognitive function in adolescents. Our results thus far demonstrate that relatively modest TIB manipulations provide a useful tool for investigating adolescent sleep biology.

 Abstract

**Study Objectives**

Over 75% of US high school students obtain insufficient sleep, placing them at risk for adverse health outcomes. Identification of modifiable determinants of adolescent sleep is needed to inform prevention strategies, yet little is known about the influence of the built environment on adolescent sleep.

**Methods**

In this prospective study, actigraphy was used to assess sleep outcomes among 110 adolescents for 14 days each in eighth and ninth grades: duration (hours/night), onset and offset, and sleeping ‚â•8 hours. Home addresses were linked to built environment exposures: sound levels, tree canopy cover, street density, intersection density, population density, and housing density. Mixed-effects regression estimated associations of built environment measures with sleep outcomes, adjusting for sex, race, parent education, household income, household size, grade, weeknight status, and neighborhood poverty.

**Results**

A 1-standard deviation (*SD*) increase in neighborhood sound was associated with 16 minutes later sleep onset (Œ≤ = 0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.49) and 25% lower odds of sleeping for ‚â•8 hours (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96). A 1-*SD* increase in neighborhood tree canopy was associated with 18 minutes earlier sleep onset (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.31, 95% CI: ‚àí0.49, ‚àí0.13) and 10 minutes earlier sleep offset (Œ≤= ‚àí0.17, 95% CI: ‚àí0.28, ‚àí0.05). No associations were observed for density-based exposures.

**Conclusions**

Higher neighborhood sound level was associated with lower odds of sufficient sleep, while higher tree canopy cover was associated with more favorable sleep timing. Neighborhood sound levels and tree canopy cover are potential targets for policies and interventions to support healthier sleep among adolescents.",1612137804

"learndutch","t5_2t6rf","‚ÄúJe‚Äù and ‚Äújij‚Äù are used for the 2nd person singular. They are quite interchangeable; ‚Äújij‚Äù is generally used to accentuate a bit more:

Heb je de sleutel? = Do you have the key?
Heb jij de sleutel? = Do you have the key? (But also: do *you* have the key? (In the sense of: is it with you?))

‚ÄúJullie‚Äù is second person plural:

Jan en jij hebben de sleutels. Jullie hebben de sleutels. 

‚ÄúHebben‚Äù is an irregular verb:
Ik heb
Jij hebt
Hij / Zij / Het heeft
Wij hebben
Jullie hebben
Zij hebben

You will notice that here, I use ‚Äújij‚Äù and not ‚Äúje‚Äù, and ‚Äúzij‚Äù and not ‚Äúze‚Äù; again, they are mostly interchangeable. In spoken language, ‚Äúze‚Äù and ‚Äúje‚Äù are more common.

When I sell puts... and they expire ITM. Then the underlying goes UP.

YOU DONT LOSE MONEY ON SELLING PUTS IF THE UNDERLYING GOES UP AFTER ASSIGNMENT. WHICH IT HAS DONE, LITERALLY EVERY WEEK. He understood that, can you? 

Back in 2018 Burry said GME would be at $100 by December. I sold several put options and rolled them well into 14.50, I got ASSIGNED those shares. Then the stock sky rocketed while I kept selling puts every $35...

"milsurp","t5_2rt7z","[This website describes the typical nomenclature for Lee Enfield Rifles](http://www.enfieldcollector.com/serials.html). 

&gt; The only exception to the 5-number sequence for No.4 rifles was the initial BSA Shirley production which ran from 0001 to 9999 then went with A to Z prefixes (A0001 to A9999 to the Z prefix) and some early dual letter prefixes (e.g. AT 0303), but then went over to A30001

I suspect you have an early BSA Shirley gun.  I suspect it was made in 1942. The only reason this wouldn't be the case that I can think of is if this was put through a rebuild in some country that didn't use the standard system that the UK used during this time for FTR procedures.

[This website also has a lot of details on it about these rifles](https://www.milsurps.com/enfield.php) if you were curious to learn more.

Also [this is a good book on the subject](https://www.amazon.com/British-Enfield-Rifles-Lee-Enfield-Collectors/dp/1882391241) and is still out there pretty cheap.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","I have allowed that as a one-time situational thing, with certain stipulations:

The end result can't equal another spell, 
The spell must have an element tied to it, 
The change must make sense (I regret allowing someone to change an Acid Arrow to a Force Arrow, so I agree with you on that), and 
The spell's new element must match another spell's element known by the character (no frost spells mean no switching a spell to frost energy).


They also come with an added cost:

Either a higher spell slot gets burned in its place, 
There is a higher GP cost (I've rarely used it, but it's worked to prevent wild shenanigans), 
There is a higher DC for the spell to succeed, 
It has a shorter range or duration, 
There is a physical toll on the character (ranging from exhaustion to non-lethal to HP damage, though rarely would it be permadamage), 
Or any combination thereof.


Again, I use it rarely. Either a sorcerer shapes the new spell to their will at great cost, or a deity imposes a new will upon the spell (but altering the mechanics of the universe throws their chosen vessel is harmed by the effort).",1612137806

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","&gt;Ultimately, the issue boils down to you having to do things you don't want to do.

Yes that's what I told you.

&gt;This isn't unique to work...life is filled with things you don't want to do.

Nothing like work. Work is something you're expected to do for 4 or 5 decades straight. Nothing makes me feel as forced as work does, other than maybe dealing with police. But I only have to deal with a cop at a traffic stop for 10 minutes, not 50 years.

&gt;I think it is relevant. I think your issue stems from a lack of perspective or gratefulness.

https://external-preview.redd.it/p7QHn7imxlzjwxCNWYO519aiBQeps049TAu-mvh2obg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e194a2f55d980d60c2e8e422ea91938b3a5e3f14

&gt;Being told to wear slacks to work is not even remotely close to the labor conditions that people in developing countries have to deal with. Being told to wear slacks is not even remotely close to the mental and physical suffering of living in the woods and hunting on your own.

I told you it's not really the slacks. The slacks are just one example of it. The main issue is actually being forced to go in and do the work / time itself. And being forced to do numerous other things, slacks being just one of a list of about 100 things. If I just had to wear slacks for 8 hours a day but not going in anywhere and not doing any work... ie I have to wear slacks 8 hours a day but I can just play video games or do something else, that wouldn't upset me much. I still wouldn't like it, but it would be a minor inconvenience, not something that makes me think of jumping off a building.

And obviously I get that people in developing countries (and developed countries too) have lots of jobs that are far shittier than mine. Just because you beat the fuck out of someone else doesn't mean I have to say I like the fact that you just punched me once.

&gt;I understand your frustation, but I don't understand it to the point of suicide. Maybe you need professional mental help too? I don't know.

There's nothing mental health can do. The solution is to retire. Mental health work would just take my money and delay my ability to retire.",1612137806

Definitely see an eye doctor to confirm but for me the best treatment to avoid flare ups and irritation is just making sure I clean my makeup/eyes thoroughly every day. You really want to make sure there‚Äôs no buildup on the lash line (which is what caused my first bad flare up). There‚Äôs special eye cleansers they prescribe but tbh I‚Äôve found you can do the same thing if need be GENTLY with a soft washcloth and water if there‚Äôs a lot of gunk. Also, being gentle with your eyes is key. It may not even be your makeup, but method of removal irritating it further. Make sure whatever makeup removal you‚Äôre using isnt the culprit. I oil cleanse to remove my makeup with balm rather than wipes, it gets all my eye makeup off and is gentle. Hope this helps!

EDIT: In the midst of irritation/flare up, however, your best bet is to have the eye doctor prescribe an eye ointment that‚Äôs antibiotic. My ophthalmologist prescribed me Erythromycin when I was still really irritated along the lash line. It nursed the area back to health but I still use it sometimes when my eyes get irritated even in the slightest. Seriously life saving.",1612137806

If you are poor and you have children, PLEASE talk with them about money. There's nothing more stressful or scary for a child than knowing their parents are frustrated or scared and not knowing why.

You don't have to show them your bank statements or give them exact numbers, but please share with them the reasons why they can't have every toy their friends get, or why you don't go out to restaurants as much, or why their clothes come from the thrift shop or discount department store instead of the fancy stores like some other kids at school.

It took me years to get over a lot of unconscious shame and able to talk about money with my SO, family, and friends. It also made me realize how many rules and behaviors I had internalized that I needed to break once I was actually making a decent living for myself but still not being able to enjoy the things that come with that without feeling a deep sense of dread.

Every kid is different, but they're also smart, and way more empathetic than most people realize. How much to tell them about your specific situation depends on how mentally and emotionally mature they are, but please don't straight up hide things from them. It will only make them stronger and more capable of handling money in the future if they learn young.",1612137807

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","So you would think so but it‚Äôs not.  I left being an ER beside nurse in August because the strain we were being put under was so bad and it wasn‚Äôt even flu season yet.  An ER nurse averages 4-5 patients.  Because of Covid the ICU became too full so half our ER became ICU patients.  An ICU nurse has only 2 patients because you have to constantly be watching the patient vitals and adjusting drips, suctioning lungs and a multitude of other things.  So in the ER we became ICU nurses, which is not a big deal because both are critical care. However as an ER nurse I could have 2-3 ICU patients and still be expected to take a 4th ER patient.  So imagine trying to manage 3 ICU and then a stabbing comes in, that was very much the reality, the day that happened to me was the day I realized it was time for a change.   One of the ICU almost died because I wasn‚Äôt right there managing the drips.  I wasn‚Äôt getting lunch, in fact didn‚Äôt even have time for a sip of water in 12 hours.  Exhausted doesn‚Äôt even come close.  So with all that do you think the money which honestly wasn‚Äôt that much was worth it?  To be worth as much as it took out of me I would have to be paid at least $100/hr...I barely made a third of that.  Not to forget not having enough PPE so the nurses were getting covid left and right, and once in a while getting shitty pizza or dry cookies to say thank you for not quitting and continuing to take our shit.  So ya my story is one of thousands and this pandemic isn‚Äôt slowing down yet and our pay is actually being cut, one hospital where I live cut everyone‚Äôs pay by $5/hour.  That‚Äôs a lot and pretty shitty considering what all medical professionals are dealing with right now.  Sorry for the rant, hope it answers your questions as to why.  And teachers, my heart goes out to you, my mother was a teacher and I clearly remember how hard she worked and how much she spent out of her own pocket that she couldn‚Äôt write off on taxes.

Gauge is how many stitches per inch for width and height, and will influence the size of your finished object.

You can estimate by measuring your finished kitten to see how many stitches there are in a square inch (measure both width and height gauge for mittens).

For example: a school district I am familiar with has an 89% mandatory on-time graduation rate. This means that it essentially has to be impossible to fail because schools are punished if they don‚Äôt make the mandate. The end result is a total collapse of standards and discipline because the schools simply can‚Äôt afford to not just pass the kids through.

She died in 5/6 of her states when the Interloper exploded. 
&gt;Given the curious quantum properties of the moon, at the moment the core of the Interloper ruptured, she was technically present at all of the moon's possible orbital locations at the same time. Thus, as the moon orbited the five planets within the immediate blast radius of the comet, she was killed along with the rest of her species. But in the sixth location, around the Eye of the Universe, and far from the reach of the comet's destruction, she was spared. As such, this is the only location in spacetime in which the player can find her still alive.   
  
Would be cool if you could die the same way and be forever entangled with her at the 6th location.",1612137808
