The Disney Channel wasn't entirely amazing to begin with. It was nice to watch old Disney Afternoon shows, Disney movies, and then old shorts. Occasionally I'd check out after midnight since I'm an old school television nerd to the highest degree. (The Ink and Paint Club was basically a program where they showed all old Disney shorts. It used to be on frequently but then it got to a point where you could only find it on at like 4am)

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","A while ago I managed to strain a muscle in my lower back moving a heavy object (""heavy"" here meaning probably around 40 pounds). Initially it didn't seem so bad, but within a few days I was unable to sit down for more than a few minutes without being in excruciating pain. Eventually, my back even became painful while I was sleeping. I became sleep deprived because I couldn't sleep for more than a few hours a night. Prescription painkillers were the only thing that let me have some rest.

It took over a month before I was able to sit down for more than 15 minutes without my back killing me, but that's when I swore I was done being an overweight lazy slob. My back had been bothering me on and off over the years (actually prompting a 30lbs weight loss a few years back) but this was the icing on the cake. Since then I have lost another 40lbs and am in the normal BMI for my height for the first time since I was in high school.

Was it difficult? Sure. It was no fun being hungry all the time when I cut my daily intake. But honestly being a bit hungry is a joke compared to the torture I had to endure those 4 weeks when my back was injured. And I think it was 100% worth it - my back problems have completely disappeared along with other issues I had when I was overweight - the chafing, the sweating, the inability to do physical activity for more than a few minutes without becoming tired.

That's what you should look forward to. Look forward to the time when you'll look and feel better than you do now because you put your foot down one day and said ""that's enough"" and accomplished something.","1349049601"

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p"," A state push to bring felony charges against noncitizens who voted in recent Iowa elections could run into two key roadblocks: local prosecutors who do not want to pursue the cases and jurors who may find no criminal intent.

The push to prosecute legal residents who were ineligible to vote because they are not U.S. citizens may raise questions about selective enforcement and whether they had the intent to commit fraud. Police and prosecutors this year already declined to bring some similar cases discovered before the statewide effort started, citing a lack of intent, the cost associated with the cases and the harsh penalties they entail.

In Linn County, home to Cedar Rapids, County Attorney Jerry Vander Sanden has declined to bring charges against a few persons who mistakenly voted twice during recent elections. The county auditor sought prosecution, but Vander Sanden replied in emails that those voters had ""no criminal intent"" to cast absentee ballots and vote a second time at the polls.

""I am not going to charge someone with a felony because they made an innocent mistake,"" he wrote in July.

Of course, he could have stayed, but the move seemed mutually beneficial (I think he'd also just divorced his wife at the time, so probably needed some kind of change).

His leaving allowed Fab to flourish. Plus, we still had Adebayor and RVP. Everything felt like it was on good terms.

RVP left us in a pretty terrible situation after talking the talk, but then when the time came for big decisions, he turned his back and walked away. And not only did he join Man U, as you mentioned, he came out with a pretty condescending statement about the club. You'd never see Henry or Fab say something like that about Arsenal.

"metanarchism","t5_2s3sb","Very much like the horizon you see in the distance. A general direction and a kind of ""within-which"". So: say we agree to address the question of the elections and are talking about anarchism. This is just an example. Well at this point, we would be talking about anarchism within the horizon of the elections. A light would be cast on the topic. We'd be making a way towards topics, or taking angles on topics, in view of the elections or elections in general, democracy in general, etc. The elections coming up do loom on the horizon. That's just one horizon or horizon type, really. It's pretty temporal in certain ways. And anyhow, that's an example, one is locak, the other general of a horizon. Local was, recall: say we agree to discuss anarchism within the horizon of the elections. Locally, that means our agreement to discuss this. We've set up a kind of false or very local horizon. Less locally is: the elections coming up. And far less local: let's think about anarchism, but especially in terms of democracy and the idea of voting. That's a more general ""horizon"". Then when you agree upon that (everything is not a simple matter of agreement), you're setting out in a kind of direction and within a certain light. 

And horizons have ""light"": the sun casts a light, so too do horizons of issues or problematics, say. ""In light of recent events"" is a good case in point. This is a common enough phrase. It's a bit like saying: ""keeping those recent events on the horizon, let us consider X"". It is good to use the term, not good to badger it or try to nail it down too exactly. I'm not trying to be vague and can be very n-th degree or meticulous, but that's just the best way to use such a term. 

So this can be explained easily enough. I'll assume just for the sake of seeing what this all means here that you may respond with: ""Oh, OK, that's not really so tricky or opaque."" It's quite easy, really. There is nothing especially troubling there. Indeed, that's going to end up being part of my point: that there is nothing especially troubling about a lot of what is possible in thinking. In fact...well here I go again...it's going to end up being so fundamental an issue as to lead to some other things. 

On the other hand, I've been thinking in this shit for years, so it's easy for me. But on a third hand, let me add to this that I think with a fierce view towards amelioration and responsibility. What that means here is a bit tricky: it means that my path in thinking and my particular skills (this is not in order to talk about myself let me say clearly here) are very devoted towards applicability and serviceability. So in any case some things I say may look hard like someone is doing differential calculus and says ""oh this is easy"" but it's fucking not, whereas I am already well abreast of how explications should run and are feasible. This in turn relates to issues of poverty, btw. 

Well I could go on but must run currently but I can explain more and an ethically devoted to such explicability btw. ","1349049621"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well, I can tell you that in a typical LHC pp (proton-proton) collision, less than 1% of the total collision energy goes into producing any one particle. Protons are made of quarks and gluons, which are collectively called partons, and what happens in a collision is that one of the partons from one proton interacts with one of the partons from the other proton. Each parton carries only a fraction of its proton's total energy, so it's only that fraction that actually gets involved in the collision, and it usually winds up being a small amount.

However, I don't know how (or if) that would change if a black hole were to be produced. I think the black hole would be too small, and would evaporate too quickly, to pull in much energy from the other partons involved in the collision.","1349049622"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","This does seem like it's a cut and paste menagerie of bad sex-driven articles from other popular womens' magazines, paired with the plateauing popularity of a ""mommy porn"" novel, which makes everyone up at arms.


Is it a bad book? Yes!  Read a few passages, and you'll realize just how terrible the imagery, story arch, sub plots, characters, metaphors, and use of grammar is.  It is edgy because up until now, most women didn't openly express their interest in sexual literature, even though we have been reading, and writing it for DECADES. 


Men seem to have this weird idea that the only kind of pornography worth investing in is visual pornography.
Women internalize a lot of their interests in sex, and tend to have just as deep sexual fetishes as most men, DESPITE the fact that we are *shamed* for having any kind of sexual urges, and are called ""sluts"" for having an inkling of desire for kinky fucking.


While men are very straight-forward about their sexual urges, ""that woman looks hot, I want to stick my flesh rod inside of her tender bits"" , ladies *tend* to (not saying this is true of every case) have a more complicated view of sex in terms of; relationships, compatibility, personal taste, attitude, stability, and have according fantasies.


Christian Grey represents what a lot of modern women lust after.  A ridiculously handsome man, with his own company, shitloads of cash he wants to spend on his lady,a hot body, a huge cock,with a sexual appetite to match, a dominant personality,  and attachment/possessiveness, but also having something to ""fix"". (which was kind of super fucked up in my opinion, and was a super turn-off for me)


While the book is very badly written, many women still find a kind of social unity in the fact that they aren't being shamed and singled out at the bookstore for buying one of these novels.  If you go up to a cashier with another (probably better written) ""bodice ripper"", you could expect to feel a bit of embarrassment.  Not to mention it falls under the advent of e-Books, so most women never have to step foot inside of a store.


While it seems almost a STANDARD for men to watch terribly written/ acted porn, ladies are being mocked for *READING?*

And if Yes... What is that feature called ?

2) If I have a domain say XYZ.com. Can I have ns1.xyz.com and ns2.xyz.com with Hostgator and say ns3.xyz.com and ns4.xyz.com with say Bigbrainhost.com VPS. ns5.xyz.com and ns6.xyz.com with say webhostingbuzz.com VPS.

This is about as nuanced as the arguments of holocaust deniers, or members of the flat-earth society. The people posting on this thread claiming that Stalin was responding to some grand Nazi conspiracy, clearly have an ideological axe to grind, and won't be diverted from that by anything as trifling as facts, or the historical record. So Stalin really thought that the entire leading cadre of the Bolshevik Party, composed of revolutionaries who had proven their uncorruptable character in the struggle against Tsarism, were in league with the Nazis?

Trotsky, Rakovsky, Kamanev, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Radek, Piatakov, Sokolnikov etc. And the artists Babel, Mandelstam, Pilnyak etc. etc. All Nazi spies? Really? Even though half of them were Jews who had spent their entire lives fighting for socialism?

Do you think it was the bureaucrats and careerists who Stalin surrounded himself with who represented the heritage of the October Revolution, and Bolshevism? People like Vyshinsky, the lead prosecutor during the Moscow trials, who had been a right-wing Menshevik, and opponent of the October Revolution, until he found a comfortable position in the Soviet bureaucracy?","1349049631"

Although Islamic tradition and belief is largely archaic bullshit that has long been superseded, I am often amazed at the naivety of those who blindly fault it. That fact is that some of these traditions were, often failed, attempts to solve social ills and that there is a fundamental truth to all of them. Those that might have seen some success were often only viable for the conditions of the time. I hate those who criticise solutions yet cannot even begin to fathom the problems they were meant to address.

The feminists whine on about how it somehow concludes that men can't stop themselves from giving into temptation. A nasty, vile little psychological trick where they pass their own agenda under the guise of standing up for the other side. Of course, anyone with a little sense would understand the suffering unsatisfied temptation can cause. They completely bypass this issue though.","1349049639"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","I can give you some advice for France, but I'll consider that you have at least a week to visit the country :

-Do not miss the Mont Saint Michel in Normandy, at any cost. It's the absolute best tourist destination ever. Maybe visit that site in the morning and noon, and take the rest of the day to visit the Normandy region in general, which is nice cow-country, true rural France (also, there are the WW2 beaches - with German bunkers and all, and allied cemeteries, which may interest you if you're American).

-Hit the ""Chateaux de la Loire"", or ""Loire Castles"" in English I guess - those are essentially beautiful, lush and rich Renaissance castles along the Loire river which is center-west of France. There are tons of them but maybe you should take a few days to see the most highly regarded ones (internet search). It's a nice region to cruise through too.

-In Paris, which is the obvious destination, check out the Père Lachaise cemetery (do an internet search to fidn the graves of famous people). Perhaps, you can also take a bateau mouche, those are pretty nice because many of the most beautiful buildings are along the Seine river :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau_mouche

Otherwise, visit the Notre Dame Cathedral, walk the steps of Montmartre, and if you like crowded massively huge museums, I guess you need to go to the Louvre. Also, there are places that tourists tend to not visit much : the ""Panthéon"", which features the graves of famous French people like Voltaire or Hugo, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on,_Paris , or ""Les Invalides"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides which is a War museum and houses the tomb of Napoleon. In terms of security, you might want to avoid North-Eastern Paris which are the poorer parts - most aren't slums, but I guess you're more likely to get mugged there than in the other parts (I've gone there hundreds of times and have never gotten mugged, so don't be too paranoid, it's just the least sure places in the city).

-If you want to check out the Mediterranean coast, avoid Marseilles, go to Cannes or Nice, or even Monaco (which is a separate country, as you surely know).

There, that should give you a broad idea of the country. Obviously, you won't have enough time to see less well-known things.","1349049650"

&gt;I'm sorry, but threats are not threats unless they're actionable

Threats are threats. A threat is a declaration of intent to inflict harm on someone else. Whether the person is actually capable of following through on the threat is unimportant to the definition of a threat. The point of a threat is to intimidate someone in order to control them, to bully them into submission. You don't need follow through for a threat to be a serious issue.

Furthermore, she gets so many threats. Who is to say that one of them doesn't figure out where she is and that one of them is just crazy enough to try something? Isn't 4chan in particular famous for its ability to ""dox"" people?

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I tend to have a non-dogmatic approach to applying the NAP to animals. In general, I think that anything that can argue (even non-verbally) against some inhumane treatment has at least *some* claim the status of an ""actor"", and therefore some claim to the protection of the NAP. 

The question is ""how much?"". I usually feel that the degree to which a particular cruelty towards animals can legitimately be outlawed based on the NAP is roughly proportional to their observed objection to the treatment and the sophistication of their species ability to ideate about their treatment. 

I say species, because it's almost impossible to say in any one case how much a particular individual animal is going to object to some mistreatment without mistreating it, which kind of un-begs the question if you'll pardon my twisting of a term. 

This is also how my argument extends to the question of whether babies or invalids should be allowed to be mistreated because they can't argue back. No, they can't, but members of their species can, so they get the benefit of the doubt. ","1349049652"

"infp","t5_2qn2o","Here's a response I made to another redditor looking to develop his Ne and resolve his issues with social anxiety.

&gt;Studying all of your functions overall and seeing how you apply them in everyday life is the best way of developing any of them.
&gt;
&gt;For social situations specifically, you need to identify what your weakness is, how you react in those situations and how you can stop yourself from having that instinctive response. Not all INFPs have trouble with socializing for the same reason.
&gt;
&gt;If underdeveloped Ne is really your problem, the best way to develop it is to rely on it. Like muscles, functions don't get stronger if you don't use them. As your dominant function and source of comfort is Fi, your compulsion is to stay within the confines of the ""firewall"" that your Fi puts between you and the world.
&gt;
&gt;Normally most things don't enter your perception for analysis (Ne) without being evaluated and judged (Fi) even if these judgements are minor or even unnoticeable (your dominant function is the hardest to notice in your cognition because it is the most natural.) Your Ne can neither function without this filter, nor function at its fullest potential if this filter is too strong.
&gt;
&gt;You'll notice that ENFPs with dominant Ne and auxiliary Fi usually have no problem with social interaction because they evaluate nearly everything after they experience it, not before. They don't get caught up in pre-emptive and defensive evaluations during conversation because these have no real place in spontaneous socializing. The more you use your Fi, the less you'll use your Ne and the less you'll develop it. Both are active at all times, but one can heavily outweigh the other. Your goal is to allow that balance to tip in the other direction if necessary. At the same time, don't aim to shun or treat your Fi as a weakness. It is your biggest strength and there are many social narratives where it can be applied. If you have strong opinions about something, speak your mind. That in itself is a good way to make use of your Ne and Fi in a balanced way. Your Ne is your loudspeaker for your Fi and Te after all.
&gt;
&gt;INFPs can turn into bunkers of judgement where they can sit and evaluate things without actually involving themselves in the world; lest they risk letting people they have not approved into their bunker. The worst case scenario of this is the Fi-Si tertiary loop where their external functions shut off almost entirely and their personality resembles a turtle that has gone into its shell.
&gt;
&gt;They have to realize three things.
&gt;
&gt;1. It's impossible to only ever interact with people you have personally ""approved"" of. Sometimes you just need to take in the world as it comes, not on your own terms. You've conditioned yourself to view this as a threat when it isn't.
&gt;2. It's equally impossible to judge everyone in a crowd without wearing yourself out. Don't view crowds as a ton of individual people, but as one singular entity from which you can pull individuals out of.
&gt;3. Raw, unfiltered social interaction is only tiresome to the person who is trying to constantly deflect and filter it. If socializing is wearing you out then it's because you're going about it on the path of most resistance.
&gt;
&gt;Basically you'll have to force yourself to do things that feel both unnatural and uncomfortable for a while. Keeping in mind that it's for the greater good and that succumbing to the comfort of your dominant Fi will only ever be a short term solution. Like any learned skill, eventually it will become natural and a part of you. You're rewriting your subconscious thought (the bulk of your mind) through elaborate and repetitive rehearsal of conscious thought (the outer shell of your mind) and that kind of thing takes effort and time.
&gt;
&gt;Another problem Fi dominance can bring to socializing is that it centers heavily around identity. Many INFPs believe that if they become social people then they will have to abandon who they were before entirely (because most social people they have observed don't appear to have much of a reclusive side.) This isn't true. Having the ability to be social and outgoing doesn't take away your ability to do the exact opposite. It just puts more control of your actions into your own hands, not your subconscious.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.

Also, when it comes to not making impulsive Fi based actions, you'll find that developing your Te will benefit you more in that area. Ne is not involved in making decisions, only seeing what decisions you can potentially make. Fi and Te are the two ends of your judgmental scale, so if one is weaker than the other then you won't make rational balanced decisions as well.

The thing is that everyone is both introverted and extraverted. If an INFP is having trouble acting the way an extravert would, the best way for him to learn is to simply fake it and learn by experience.

Doing so does not make him/her an extravert though. Their introversion is the product of preference, not behavior. Nothing short of massive psychological trauma can change that preference. It can however have a lesser grasp over them and how they choose to act. If they learn how to comfortably be more outgoing and upbeat, they don't cease to be INFPs. They simply gain the ability to be outgoing if they so choose.","1349049660"

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","The problem with creating figures on this scale is that the sculptor has to be *really* accomplished to: 1) create a reasonable likeness of a real, living person and (2) be able to anticipate how the production process will distort the result. Most action figure sculpts use material which shrinks during production, so producing a very lifelike representation of a person means that the sculptor *has to add extra material to the accurate sculpt of a person*. Essentially, it would be like adding 10 lbs. to the character, including in unexpected spots like the nose.

That's why it's so difficult to find a really good sculpt of a person in action figure form.","1349049674"

(What's interesting is the peanut-craze makes me a bit mad. Growing up parents of my friends were freaking the fuck out about peanuts to the point where peanuts were banned from school, no reese's cups for birthdays, that sort of thing. Everyone brought cupcakes and shit though and no one but me cared about that.

The reason it makes me mad is that recent science has shown that the old way of doing the allergen test specifically for peanuts had a 90%+ false positive rate, and a lot of parents didn't even bother getting an allergy test in the first place. In other words, most people who say they have peanut allergies really don't.)","1349049675"

Eventually, it would come down to a duel between the grooms, which my father would win.  Then someone would hold a flintlock on the priest while my father married my stepmom and carted her back over to the other ship where the reception would be.

No, I never really grew up either.  My big wedding plan was ""Victory of the Mad Scientist"" - we were going to have it at a local Hackerspace.  The top end of the plan involved making the bride's father dress up in a gorilla suit with a fishbown helmet, finding someone to play the defeated hero, and vows that included the phrase ""forsaking all others and making them rue the day"".

Once you figure out which product it is, take note of its ingredients.

If you subscribe to Synergy Sports you can find out how many points that player gave up per play when defending isolations, post-ups, pick and rolls, spot-ups, etc.  But really, none of these clearly isolate bad individual defense from bad team defense.

&gt;“In Germany they came first for the communists, and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a communist. Then, they came for the Jews and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn’t speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up.”

&gt;Wake up America. If we do not get a patriot in the White House, there will not be anyone to speak up for us.

Are you fucking kidding me? What a load of fear-mongering, narrow-minded, bigoted bullshit.

Edit: To be clear, I don't mean the quote. I mean applying the quote to *President Obama*. Suggesting that if Romney isn't elected, the US will descend into some sort of fascism? Bunk! Hooey! Codswallop! ","1349049705"

I worked there from Nov.'09- July '10. I live in Riverview so making 7.25-7.50 and hour and driving 26 miles each way wasn't worth it. The owner is a very shady man. He would refund tickets for cash and pocket the change. I found this out after he fired my brother who was a manager there because he didn't feel like paying him what they were anymore. Matt was the Jersey shore looking guy who had his name tattooed on his back. He is the kind of person who walked out of Inception because it was too confusing for him 10 minutes into the movie. He was the ""bar manager"" and pretty much did all his business with shady people. He didn't know how to manage anything thus the only person that ever made any money at the events. 95% of the time the events resembled club empire before it got shut down. There was always broken tables and the lobby was trashed. They broke their contract with Imax and got the Sony digital projectors. which in my opinion were really nice but the Pepsi digital theater or whatever the hell they called it was a ripoff. the projector was not supposed to and couldn't spread that far thus if you ever saw when the projector was warming up you would see that it was smaller then it was supposed to be. They knew the theater was going under and starting investing in their new theater. I didn't really know too much about that one because I ended up leaving.

tl;dr Used to work there. Owner refunded tickets and pocketed cash on a nightly basis. shady ""club"" run by a jersey shore wanna be.","1349049712"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Firstly, you've had a lot of great advice in this thread, and I may be repeating some of what is said.

I've been here before. VERY similar situation, both parents in similar roles, similar mental health and substance abuse status, but a few more things thrown in! For me, the dynamic also started BEFORE I had someone else to ""turn to"" (and by that I mean a person who might ""replace"" my fathers role in my life). I also ended up having a lot of spite towards my mother for not ""protecting"" me.
It is incredibly hard to deal with, I understand. As others have said, it is NOT your responsibility to make your father feel better about himself.

Getting to a point where I could even talk to my psychologist about it took a lot, but she was amazing.
I found ""The Emotional Incest Syndrome : What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life"" by Patricia Love to be helpful.

I actually recommend turning on private browsing and googling emotional incest, covert incest, and surrogate spouse.

I would also recommend you talk to somebody. Also, I know this is hard, but you need to start placing boundaries. It is INCREDIBLY difficult, but often the parent doesn't realize how inappropriate their actions or words are (though it seems referencing the BDSM side of things, perhaps in your situation it is understood..) I found it helps to act as if you would with a child that DOESN'T understand boundaries. Start small. One thing. It gets easier.

i.e. 

- ""No, that's enough massage for now. This is making me feel uncomfortable.""
- ""It's really not okay to joke about what I do with my partner. That's really something private.""
- ""I don't like talking to you when you've been drinking as much as this, things you say make me uncomfortable"".
- ""Dad, I know I'm your daughter, but I'm growing up and I need to spread my wings. It doesn't mean I don't still care about you.""

Again, I'm sorry you don't feel safe. It is not your fault. Please do some research for yourself, try and find someone to talk to. You are also not alone.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","I apologize if this comment seems kind of preachy but its subject is rather personal. I just didn't realize it until I started typing.

Puerto Rico would be the perfect place to test the claims of the [Amethyst initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst_Initiative). And from personal experience I think that it works. For the most part 18 year olds in Puerto Rico drink at pubs, bars, and night clubs, and not at remote locations hidden from society and from the law. And in the island, frat and sorority parties and Greek life in general is just rare. 

But what convinced the most me that allowing 18 year olds to drink legally was a good idea was the death of a fellow college freshman in 1997. He was taken to an underground binge drinking college initiation by his fellow townspeople. He collapsed drunk and never woke up. A few years later a bartender refused to sell me another drink because according to him I'd had enough. If Angel Padilla would have been taken to a bar that night instead of to a secluded location he would still be alive today. And the only time when I got dangerously drunk was at our equivalent of Spring Break. But that night I didn't drink at a bar. I stupidly carried the alcohol on a camelbak styled backpack with a hose dangling over my shoulder.

But local drinking laws have been somewhat toughened, and in my opinion, this has been a bad idea. In Puerto Rico bars were allowed to be open until late. Now they're allowed to remain open only until midnight during weekdays and until 2 AM on weekends. The politicians who came up with this law assumed that people would stop drinking early and go home. The result was completely different. Now locals consume as much alcohol as they can before closing time and then drive drunk in caravans to open locations where they can continue to party until dawn. What was once a somewhat supervised activity is now enjoyed without control. Driving back home at midnight on a Friday is now a scary experience and my parents are woken up on weekend nights because the parking lot of their local gas station has become the after hours hangout for drunks whose car stereo systems are bigger than their sense of civility. These laws, however, are enforced seemingly arbitrarily and appear to escape certain places. And the result is that people now have to drive farther away to drink. And this is never a good idea.

But the worst drunks that I get to see are the 18 year old American tourists who come down here to drink. When you're only allowed to drink legally for a week, common sense tends to stay back at the airport.

I strongly believe that prohibition and excessive regulation never work. They just sweep the problems out of view and under the carpet to fester with the rest of the filth.","1349049720"

"TalesFromRetail","t5_2t2zt","You know what makes me sick?  People who have thousands of dollars of clothes on who come into the store and buy $500 worth of junk food and steaks and then hand me three different EBT cards.  As much as I would like to be on the side of the people who need EBT.  There are plenty of them who are truly gaming the system. I'll admit there are probably plenty that don't, but I see many that do too.  You know what else makes me sick? The fact that on this issue I find myself agreeing with the people who I despise--the conservatives.  I hate that.  I want to be for the children who are on foodstamps, but I do see a lot waste.  I see lot of people who are getting just plain junk with there EBT.  I see people financing parties--ALL OF THE TIME--with their EBT.  They'll even tell you that they are having a big barbecue. I don't get foodstamps to have a barbecue. 

As a matter of fact, I have never been able to get food stamps.  I have been as poor as the come, living on minimum wage, and still never qualified for foodstamps.  I was told by the lady on the phone one time, as she was laughing, that if I had been more irresponsible and had kid then I would have had everyting handed to me.  So yeah, people who I see really don't need foodstamps make me mad.

It is so funny that people downvote a comment like this--they know it's true, and if not, then they really need to get a cashier job and see what really goes on--they would be surprised.  I know I was--I was completely shocked that so many people got away with the things that they did.  By the way, candy, chips, soda (of any kind) sheet cakes, any meat, any crackers, ice cream (of any kind), and pretty much anything you might think that a person might not be able to buy can be bought with food stamps--there is very little regulation with this.  This isn't the type of thing that upsets me most, though.

Its when people come in and have three or four cards and have to read off of a list of debit pins.  I don't think one person should have three or four cards, or when one person comes in and there is an obvious exchange of money going on which happens about every other EBT sale, or like I said the people who come in and let me know that they are buying everything for a party, barbecue, birthday, work party, etc, and then pay with an EBT which happens about every 4th sale.  I had one person let me know that they were renting out a park--complete with a bouncy house, vendors, a clown, and petting zoo--then paid with EBT.  You think it doesn't add up, but when I probably do 70-100 EBT sales a day, it adds up quickly.

I didn't used to be this way.  I wasn't even crappy when I couldn't get them, but after working in a store that takes them and realizing what really does go on--the people against food stamps have a real point.  There is a huge amount of waste and fraud that pretty much can't be enoforced--even if you report it.  I would have to report every 2nd-3rd customer with EBT.

EDIT:  I don't think people understand the severity of the EBT fraud problem and how much they are getting ripped off by it.","1349049728"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","Unless they're lying. Or they mean they love receiving but not giving :)

Being at the top let me add to this by saying that ""loving it"" has a lot to do with partner dynamics and persons involved. I have a friend who is basically kind of a blowjob-fetishist and most of her writing is talking about being super submissive, on her knees, being forced to ""take it"" until she vomits kind of thing. She does NOT like receiving though I'm not sure why except to say the focus is on her and I think she kind of has a lot of self-hate issues so being the other way round suits her more. 

I personally love it but not all the time or with everyone. Some people are just unenthusiastic in the sack and unresponsive. I hate going down on a guy who lays there like driftwood and after 20 minutes my jaw, which has issues and my mouth being super tiny too, is screaming MAKE IT STOP I'm like ... done. It's clear the person could care less and doesn't want to give input. Usually those same dudes haven't given me much in the foreplay department and it becomes ""let's just let him blow a load and get this wrapped up so I can go eat some nachos."" I love it when the sex is hot and awesome and we're both enjoying s-e-x. Sadly it's rare. Even rarer outside of a on-going partnership. I can count on one-hand the times I've LOVED IT both giving and receiving. 

That said while stuff like this is important I've found sex is not the absolute glue. Then again if you're dating someone where the sex is ""okay"" or ""meh"" or not meeting your needs resentment builds. Also you're not really with someone who is worth it and it probably becomes more of a person you live with and date kind of thing over time.","1349049732"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","The point i was trying to make was that i was never as immature as the current generation is today me and my friends play 18 rated games but never acted like ass holes or badasses because of it. What happened in a game stayed in a game. 
But today you just get assholes having a go at each other thinking they are 'all that' because he jumped off a building and headshot someone and now said players think they could apply such skills to the real world. Keyboard warriors and mad foreigners having a go at each other trying to prove shit when it's just a game.


Look at this way I never used to like the battlefield series as i loved call of duty but eventually realised and became smart to the things what was happening. Games that lack teamwork mean people are free to conflict with each other. I now love the battlefield series, you hardly get any trash talk because it try's to get you to work as a team.


 I recently had one of those moments of genuine enjoyment and happiness and enthusiasm that i have not felt in a long time.
I was playing battlefield 3 with a few friends and we were defending the  filling station or what not on one of the maps and we were just holding out as a last stand waiting for those reinforcements to come and help, it was carnage, hell broke loose as we were holding off attackers from all sides, tanks were on our position trying to capture it was just pure carnage but the feeling was overwhelming, working with my friends to keep this capture point it just felt fantastic we held them off it felt like a fantastic achievement, like a war zone last stand you see in the movies.


That never happens in Call of Duty. It hardly promotes teamwork I never felt like i did in CoD like i do playing BF3. With team work you bring people together no one trash talks because they are working together. When you work together you put differences aside and everyone wins because at the end of the day what a team of players achieves is because everyone played their part. 
Remove team work and you have people raging at each other, name calling and just being down right assholes.

I moved away from the point a little hah.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","First of all Bargnani`s contract is actually pretty fair. He`s the second best player on a playoff team. He's a big man and he's a scorer. They get paid. They just do. Bargnani at 10 million is probably below market if someone wanted to sign him away.


He's actually an average defender, if you average out his skills. Excellent post defender, but terrible help defender because he focuses on his man too much. Although one of the reasons this is so obvious and sticks out like a sore thump is because he's played on some of the worst defensive teams in NBA history and probably the most consistently bad defensive team in the NBA since his rookie year. If he played on a decent or good (or great) defensive team, no one would ever mention this.


This style of play is not very stat friendly. I like to think of it as the ""2K Problem"". In NBA 2K, Shooting bigs (like Dirk) are rated lower because they don't fit into the ""traditional"" way a big man should play. Move them to SF and they're overall ratings skyrocket. Bargnani is that way in real life. He's a great shooter, who plays too far from the basket to even GET many rebounds so his stats look bad. He's an elite offensive player. Watching him should tell you that. The stats don't give that impression.


Take the Knicks/Raps game pre-Linsanity this past season. Bargnani carried the team on his back. He nearly beat the Knicks himself, if not for a Felton lucky bounce jumper.


He doesn't need to be traded, he needs to be built around. He's unstoppable if given the chance and putting Val/Amir/Davis/Fields next to him to cover his weakness only helps that.","1349049742"

*** 
WORK

1. Are you working on your chosen field?
2. How many hours a week do you work?
3. What does your job entail? (For example, do you often travel for business, work at home, performs dangerous tasks?)
4. What is your dream job?
5. Have you ever been called a workaholic?
6. What is your retirement plan? What do you plan to do when you stop working?
7. Have you ever been fired?
8. Have you ever quit a job suddenly? Have you changed jobs a lot?
9. Do you consider your work a career or just a job?
10. Has your work ever been a factor in the breakup of a relationship?

HOME

11. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?
12. Do you prefer urban, suburban, or rural settings?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","What about people who don't get over it? We can't ask people who killed themselves if the solution was a good one, we can only ask people who didn't kill themselves, which is kind of a skewed perspective. I also don't believe in the base assumption that ""life is always worth living no matter how shitty"". That's the animal brain that says that, the part of our DNA that desires to survive and propagate.

Additionally, how do you determine ""unsound of mind""? Depression is terrible but someone who is depressed isn't necessarily unable to make judgments about themselves or the world. It's an incredibly patronizing view to say to someone who is depressed ""You don't know what your talking about, your brain doesn't work right. I know your life better than you, and you should keep on keeping on.""","1349049745"

It flew at the angle it was meant to fly at. Straight up while it had all 3 fuel tanks firing, then an arch when the 2 'solid' rocket boosters detached. 

It you remember, the robin reliant had to detach and glide down. What angle do you think it was supposed to be at when the detach happened? Facing straight up?

Also, if you watch a space shuttle launch the angles are actually pretty similar but obviously an order of magnitude faster and higher.

It is obvious you don't give a shit about ""lower options"" but they can be just as important as the presidential election. This is one of the reasons people who say """"I'm not voting because my vote doesn't matter"" are wrong. Local elections for US Congress, Senate, and in most states, state reps, senators, and local officials are just as important, and more likely to be influenced by one individual.

Those ""lower options"" can affect your life just as much as who the president is. What if some group manages to get a corrupt sheriff elected because of your apathy? What if your state passes a ""Vaginal ultrasound before abortion"" bill that was proposed by a man from YOUR district, and you did nothing to prevent him gaining office because you felt your vote didn't matter on a national scale, so it obviously doesn't matter at all. What if your house gets taken by eminent domain for a local government building parking lot that you did nothing to stop?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No, it isn't rape.  Basically, if he's considered of high enough intellect to be admitted into the army, then he'd be of high enough intellect to be sexually active.  
I think if the genders were reversed, people still wouldn't call it rape, because he's supposed to be dumb, not mentally disabled.  (And I really get sick of people proclaiming that kind of stuff.  Well, if the genders were reversed...then it would be a completely different story.  And I think, given the relationship that's supposed to be portrayed, and Forrest's obvious mental competence, if he were a woman, it sitll wouldn't be considered rape.)
When people talk about sex with disabled adults being rape, they're usually talking about people who have the mental capacity of small children - who literally do not understand what sex is.  In legal standing, a person is deemed to be mentally impaired if they have an IQ of below 70.  Forrest's IQ is supposed to be 75, so legally, no.  
Also, the movie deviated quite sharply from the book.  In the book he's supposed to be more of an idiot savant, as well as being 6'6"", and he works as a stunt man and professional wrestler, and is held captive by cannibals.  
Also, for the people in this thread insisting Jenny gave Forrest AIDS - it is much more difficult for a woman to give a man HIV than vice-versa. It isn't a 1 to 1 transmission rate - you don't have sex with a person who is HIV positve and BAM, you have HIV.  Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. Women contract HIV from unprotected heterosexual sex at a 2x higher rate than do men.

Thus when you cast ""one long lingering look behind"" you can be assured that you have spoken to these robbers in the only language which they have ever been able to understand, for they have never yet deigned to notice any petition from their slaves that they were not compelled to read by the red glare bursting from the cannon's mouths, or that was not handed to them upon the point of the sword.*","1349049760"

    # cat /etc/tor/torrc  | grep -v ^# | grep -v ^$
    SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
    SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
    DNSPort 9053
    DNSListenAddress 10.42.0.1


    # netstat -lupn | grep tor
    udp        0      0 10.42.0.1:9053          0.0.0.0:*                           14574/tor       

    # netstat -ltpn | grep tor
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9050          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14574/tor       

    # netstat -ltpn | grep redsocks
    tcp        0      0 10.42.0.1:12345         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14087/redsocks  

it's actually super easy you just use iptables to redirect all port 53 udp traffic from the wifi network to tor:

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9053 

and then another rule to direct all tcp traffic (i guess including tcp 53) to redsocks;

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp -m tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345


notice how I have redsocks and tor (udp 9053) listening on 10.42.0.1 -- that is the wlan0 interface's IP. It seems that you need to listen on the wifi interface, listening on 127.0.0.1 won't work with iptables REDIRECT.

redsocks then forwards the traffic to tor's socks proxy port. here is my super basic redsocks configuration:

    # cat redsocks.conf
    base {
    	log_debug = on;
    	log_info = on;
    	log = stderr;
    	daemon = off;
    	redirector = iptables;
    }
    redsocks {
    	local_ip = 10.42.0.1;
    	local_port = 12345;
    	ip = 127.0.0.1;
    	port = 9050;
    	type = socks5;
    }

I also have these rules on the iptables filter table:

    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i wlan0 -p tcp -j ACCEPT 
    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i wlan0 -p udp -m udp --dport 9053 -j ACCEPT 
    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -i wlan0 -j DROP

that just limits the traffic allowed to come from the wlan0 interface to udp port 53 and all tcp traffic only. All other traffic gets dropped since we can't do anything with it anyway. Hopefully this will stop any possible traffic leakage either to my other internal networks or to the internet.

I'm also pushing out the DNS server using dhcp (from my dhcpd.conf)

    # wlan0 -- new 'tor' network
    subnet 10.42.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      range 10.42.0.2 10.42.0.254;
      option broadcast-address 10.42.0.255;
      option routers 10.42.0.1;
      option domain-name-servers 10.42.0.1;
      option domain-name ""torproject.org"";
    }

I'm running all this on a spare laptop using the laptops' internal wifi.. it's using hostapd to generate the wifi hotspot here is the hostapd.conf although it's pretty basic

    # cat hostapd.conf
    interface=wlan0
    driver=nl80211
    ssid=tor
    channel=1


I also ordered one of these http://www.alfa.com.tw/in/front/bin/ptdetail.phtml?Part=AWUS036NH
which I think will also work with hostapd under Linux.. if it works ok I'll probably migrate this setup to a raspberrypi until I get around to messing with a proper wifi access point using openwrt or ddwrt. Hopefully it will have better range than my laptop anyway.

"InteriorDesign","t5_2r5qs","You have a great room!

I agree with the advice to hang art, but also it's more than art, you need more patterns and textures in the room.

Your windows are a great focal point. So I might rearrange the room like [this,](http://imgur.com/jIpOL) with your sofa back where your secretary is now and [chairs](http://www.houzz.com/celebrate-the-art-of-the-clash) like this in front of the windows. Here are some [pilows](http://www.zazzle.com/pattern_toned_red_grey_lumber_pillow-189968908154400681) that might work for that and match your rug.

I would put the secretary on the wall beside that.

If you would like to keep the sofa facing the wall it is, look at [this](http://contemporarylivingroomdesignideas.blogspot.com/2011/05/living-room-design-ideas.html).Your room also reminded me of [this](http://www.freshfreestuff.net/free/ikea-catalogue-2012-pdf-ipad-android.html)

If you want wall color there are [removable wallpapers](https://www.google.com/search?q=removable+wallpaper&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=I9T&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qdRoUNSKKobGygG7sIDQBQ&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=816).

I would add some more patterned pillows to add to your solids. I would keep the deep colored pillows and get rid of the pastelish ones. Here are some that could match with the window [chair pillows and your rug](http://www.1stdibs.com/furniture_item_detail.php?id=448776).

And some more: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tIXZzlWDDLo/TB-xHOO0JRI/AAAAAAAACOA/RqUOy4_iC5w/s400/etsy_willa_skye_pillow.jpg   http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_evlIKp1D64Q/TEBQBK8tDSI/AAAAAAAAHiU/xd0i11YyXuE/s400/silver+flower+pillow+cover_be+still+shop_etsy.jpg  http://rk.weimgs.com/weimgs/rk/images/wcm/products/201238/0029/img6t.jpg

You can do a lot to [mix patterns.](http://media-cache-ec3.pinterest.com/upload/8233211789084428_MXxHU9sj_c.jpg)

I would get a white throw for the sofa. 

Do you love your coffee table? You might geta boxy cuby white table? or wood to go with the secretary wood. a little smaller. if you have more money.

And if you want a tv wall I would also suggest a boxy, cube-y console or shelf unit. along the wall that seems to havve wires. but I think that would mean keeping your sofa on the wall it is.

Then you need a couple of lamps. I might use some funky standing and hanging lamps. http://welshliving.co.uk/News/Add-some-sparkle-on-a-budget--Modern-lights.html  http://knockoffs.olya.org/2007/07/07/tripod-lamp/","1349049761"

What happened was, we were hanging out at the park by my house, and we went back into the woods where the old train tracks were.  Now, beforehand, we had talked about this after she had asked me if I ever had my first kiss, obviously, I had not.  So she asked me if she could be my first, and of course I was excited and said yeah.  Fast forward again to the train tracks where I was standing there with her in my arms (she was VERY affectionate) I just kinda went in and did it.  That's the story.

Probably could have left the screw out and it still wouldn't have gone anywhere. Only needed to grind the stock and the lower handguard, and it's extremely obvious where you need to grind the lower handguard. I think I had to do just about every internal surface on the stock. Grip and upper handguard fit just fine, though the factory screw that comes with the MAK-90 isn't long enough, so I had to go order one from Tapco to finish it.

Actually had the furniture for a while now, but I took it out today and noticed it shooting to the left, consistently, for both me and my dad. Had the sight leaf sitting in the safe for a year now, figured it was high time to finish it.

If the voltage on top is higher, then Vin will be positive, and if the voltage on the bottom is higher, then Vin will be negative. 

In this case, the two terminals on the lefthand side would probably be connected to something (maybe a measuring device, for example) and the righthand side would be a transformed voltage (because oftentimes the untransformed voltage will have a lot of noisy stuff in it that you're not interested in) that will change every time Vin changes. If you're really interested in how this circuit acts as a frequency filter, you'll have to learn a little bit about [Fourier analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis) to see how several different frequencies can all be present in a single signal.","1349049790"

As for the Power Bands, no one is forcing anyone to buy them. It's up to the individual to use common sense and do a little research before making an intelligent decision on whether they want to spend their money on it (and there are laws regulating claims that products can make). Not every person who buys Power Bands will feel cheated. Some people will be happy they bought it and feel it is truly beneficial. Even if that is just a placebo effect, who are we to say the bands should be illegal if there is demand for them? If no one wants them, they would go out of business naturally on their own.

I am assuming that you titrated bases into acids, right? Operating under this assumption, then yes, the colors change because the acid is being neutralized by the base. 

I'm not too sure what you mean by whether or not this neutralization is an equilibrium or and endpoint, but just thinking about it, I would say it's an endpoint. There is no way for you to tell that the acid-base ratio in your flask is *exactly* equal, because you have to take into account the margin of error that is the amount of base that escapes from the tip of the rod that holds your base. 

Hope this helps! I think there is a chemistry hw subreddit also, if you're interested in asking them too.","1349049795"

"Cigarettes","t5_2qjd2","Hey OP,

I've tried most of the recreational drugs available and never found any to be particularly addictive.  It was more 'hey this is enjoyable' but I can't do drugs tonight because I am hanging out with my friends or have to do some work for an early meeting tomorrow.  Opioids are the more dangerous exception as they don't inhibit you anyway but I digress.

Anyways having smoked a few cigarettes here and there over the years I always wondered how people get addicted to something so relatively boring and so damaging.  While in France for a month I decided to smoke at the cafes and such just while I was there to absorb the culture and see what tobacco was all about.  The rush was mildly enjoyable and the social aspect was pretty damn awesome.

Upon returning home I can guarantee that if it weren't for the complete change of scenery and absolute turn about in attitude and lifestyle, I would still be smoking today.  The urge to smoke was incredible.  It's not overly strong or debilitating but just constantly there nagging away.  Finally giving in (I had a few fags left over in my luggage) merely provided relief.  Sweet sweet relief but nothing particularly enjoyable other than it got my mind off of it for a few hours.

Nicotine has got to be one of the most powerful, and now to me one of the most interesting drugs out there.  Smoking is like scratching a mosquito bite even though you know that it'll just be even more itchy later on, just so you get to scratch it again.

I'm certainly glad I had this experience, but it is definitely not for everyone.  I suppose I don't really have any advice for you and just want to ensure you are informed.  Remember that nobody has ever chosen to become addicted to anything.  Every single person went in thinking they could get out.  Don't think of taking drugs as a test of your will power, but as a purely random role of the dice.","1349049797"

BTW also use [MX Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad) to play videos on my nexus 7, doesn't need to conver anything it plays practicaly any video you give (mkv, avi, mp4, webm... etc) and support subtitles.

It would merely take a cop planting cocaine in my car for me to be thrown in a rape cage for decades. It would only take a clerical error to have cops busting down my door without warning, shooting my dog, and ransacking my house. There is very real reason to fear the police. 

&gt;Not the cops fault. Don't bring your drugs outside of the home if you're so scared of cops. You are SUPPOSED to be scared, that's the POINT of the cops in your case.

And I'm supposed to be on the side of these people that would enforce such an unjust law? It's only consistent of me to want to defund or disband the police force.

&gt;Alright, Aurora, CO. If you were in the theatre I'm sure you'd want a cop.

I'd prefer to have a gun. Where were the cops that night? They were writing speeding tickets and harassing potheads. And what happens when they [do](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/25/empire-state-building-shooting-nypd-bullets-shot-all-nine_n_1830007.html) show up?

"trees","t5_2r9vp","This story does not have anything to do with those, however I never did claim they were connected. I just said that this story opens the door to that kind of thinking. For me, at least. 

Quantum mechanics and the multiverse theory cannot be mathematically proven, however. Quantum mechanics has been equated to the sentence ""X is a four-sided triangle that exists outside of space and time, cannot be seen or measured and it actively hates blue spheres"". It is not visible, nor quantifiable.

But the point is to not get in an argument with you, dear internet stranger. I apologize for calling you a bad person, however I can only go by what I've seen. I didn't think that vehement of an attack against me or this story was warranted, especially when so many people found great meaning in it. Even if you or I do not think that the meaning they found was viable, it was meaning enough for them to change their way of thinking, and that's what counts.

EDIT: This story, while it does mention God, is not about God to me. It is more than that. It is about  humanity, love, and compassion. As I mentioned before, I am an Atheist. When I first read the story, I got a pang of contempt when I saw the part about the narrator being God. However, when I continued reading, the story became much, much more than one simply about religion.","1349049805"

It's hard growing up without a parent, and I know that's where some of my problems have sprung from. I was in therapy with a very nice counselor who was helping me with those problems. (Unfortunately I ran out of Medicaid, and though she would probably help me for free, if anyone finds out she could lose her license, so I just didn't risk it.) 

I've got a new therapist now and I'm just getting to know her, so I don't quite trust her yet, but hopefully I will. Once you don't have Medicaid anymore, if you can't afford insurance, I'm sure there are sliding scale offices like the one I go to. Because I don't have a job and thus make nothing, I only have to pay $5 per session. While it's hard to pay that when you're not making anything, it's still better than the usual cost per session--$60-$100. The place I go to will ask if I'd like to pay anything on my account, but if I tell them I don't have any money at the time, they say that it's okay and I just take my seat and wait. 

Things like this have become a lot more... open in the past few years, so there's more help out there now than there was even a decade ago. ","1349049805"

I'd like to comment on this. I have multiple friends in fraternities like this and there seem to be some common misconceptions:

1. Many have stopped fencing altogether.

2. Of those that do fence, I would say that only very few actively seek these scars. I only met one man who wanted one and he happened to be American. The scars are not any sign of social status. The way my friend described it it shows anyone in the know that you are one of two things: a) horrifically bad at fencing or b) a complete idiot with definite right-leaning political opinions (which is not okay in Germany).

3. Most groups that still practice do it as a form of ritual only and the intent is for nobody to get injured or disfigured. I met one older man who said he had had his ear split when he was at Uni. I couldn't tell which one.

4. It is no longer allowed to fight points of honor or personal challenges. All fights have to organized by the fraternity in concurrence with the opposing party. This is to prevent personal rivalries etc.

5. It has, quite simply, become ludicrously 'uncool' and difficult to be in this organizations. Most people will either scoff and stop talking to you or call you a Nazi. 

**TL;DR: These fraternities are rare and weird. Please don't think German males go around giving each other horrific scars. Especially that horse hair bollocks is unheard of since at least 60 years.**","1349049807"

It comes down to acceptance and forgiveness.  I used to try and avoid thinking about my mistakes, ignoring them or pushing them from my mind, cause they made me feel crappy.  Well that did not seem to give me the result I was looking for and in the end I would be thinking of them more but in a very destructive way.

Now, when I make a mistake - the first thing I do is accept it.  Just accept the reality of the mistake I made.  It's done and I have to accept it.  Then, I forgive myself.  I really forgive myself.  This is the part that took a while - to actually forgive myself.

Once I forgave myself I would then reflect on the mistake and decide what I could do next time to avoid it.  I didn't judge myself, or come up with crazy scenarios about ""Next time"" to worry about - I simply figured out what I could learn from the situation and then accepted that I had learned something from it.

Over time it did a lot for me - I actually started LEARNING from Mistakes!  Holy shit!  And I started making LESS mistakes.. and when I did make a mistake... It didn't bother me!  I was no longer afraid of the feelings I would get after making a mistake, because I chose to change how I felt about mistakes.

Hopefully this helps you somewhat, as mistakes were something that ""Held me back"" for a long time.  I know you can work through it!!!

The trouble with blasphemy laws is that they create unequal classes of speech that by definition confer a type of tyranny to the majority.  What if, for example, my religion teaches me that Islam is crap?  Am I therefore prohibited from practicing it?  In contrast, freedom of speech is a blanket law that applies to everyone equally.  What many Muslims have trouble realizing is that open and inclusive societies have to have equal protection under the law for *all* members of society, not just certain groups.  This is why The Enlightenment thinkers who gave The West the idea of freedom of speech were so smart.  They realized that in protecting even the speech of their enemies, they were also protecting themselves.  It was all about creating inclusive societies, even if they didn't necessarily think of it that way at the time.    ","1349049817"

"horn","t5_2svpc","Here are common problems with switching from trumpet to horn:
&gt;1. Accuracy of attacks.
 The partials of the horn are much closer together than those of the trumpet. You'll find that you'll consistently miss and crack notes or be unable to know whether the note you played is a B-flat, C, or a D. The only way to really combat this is to practice a ton and become accustomed to the intervals of the horn. While it is useful, Perfect pitch is not necessary. However, a good sense of relative pitch and intonation is key.
&gt;2. Lower Range tends to be more difficult for trumpet players to play loud.
 Try practicing arpeggios starting from the fifth of the scale in the low range: Low g-c-e-g-e-c-g, low f#-b-d#-f#-d#-b-f# and so on. In practicing low range volume, it is ok to neglect tone quality and accuracy for the time being. Opening up the bell and playing with your hand a little further out and further from your body will help with low register facility.
&gt;3. The right hand is a new aspect of playing for you.
 Your band director can tell you how to place your hand, but know that the further in and closer to your body you place your hand in the bell, the more flat and muffled your sound will get, but if you take the hand too far out, you will play sharp. When playing stopped horn, be sure to know that stopped notes sound approximately one half step sharper than the played pitch (if your music says f# stopped, then stop the horn and play an f)
&gt;4. John Philip Sousa is the worst composer known to man.
offBEAToffBEAToffBEAToffBEAT DOGFIGHT offBEAToffBEAToffBEAT
&gt;5. Fingering charts are not absolute.
Pretty much every note in the middle and high registers have alternate fingerings. This will confuse you. For example, open valves plays C in the third space in the staff, the Bb below that, the D above that, AND the E above that. Relative pitch and muscle memory help tons.
&gt;6. The tuning slides of every valve actually matter. 
Trumpet players usually ignore the 2nd valve tuning slide and can get away with doing so, but as a horn player you must adjust every single one to make sure your horn plays in tune. Your horn will often be out of tune. I suggest holding a tuning session with yourself every month, playing pitches using your most-often-used fingerings and tuning them using a tuner. Also know that it is better to have a horn tuned sharp than a horn tuned flat, as lipping a note down gives you a better, more open tone than lipping a note up (which tends to result in a clenched or muffly tone).
&gt;7. Horn mouthpieces are much deeper than trumpet mouthpieces and have much smaller rims, meaning you will feel all the pressure you put on your mouth.
&gt;8. The transition from a Bb instrument to an F one will screw with your brain a bit.
Practice.","1349049821"

You'll need a wiring diagram.
It looks as though someone prior to you had some wiring issues. More often than not on these bikes the front turn signal wiring terminated in the headlight bucket. Two for each signal and three for the headlight. There may be others for the instruments if they run through there. These are some of the wires that probably aren't plugged in. It's hard to see in the pictures, but a guess would be the prior owner had a short and spliced in their own wiring. Not good news for you. I'm not crazy about the routing of the rear fender wiring either. It should be tucked neatly through the bracket and routed properly. There are a lot of ""pinch"" points that will cause shorts otherwise. Under the seat and under the tank are good spots to look for shorts to ground. You'll probably want to get a multi-meter. They're only about $15-20. You're just going to have to start tracing wires. Good luck and feel free to come back with more questions or check out the KZ forums.","1349049826"

We give children fillings in their teeth, we give them braces, we give them antibiotics, vaccinations and take their tonsils out. We let children elect to see a counselor, psychiatrist or psychologist if they want. We have teens begin gender reassignment before reaching the age of consent. That's if its voluntary, and not forced.

Kids can go and see a counselor without parental permission even. We do things to children not based on whether they can consent to it, but whether it is for their benefit.

While certainly this therapy doesn't work, doesn't help and is only detrimental, and it should be banned on those grounds, the fact that a minor can't consent to it has no bearing in this medical context.","1349049827"

try cutting out grains, beans, sugar, and dairy and eating more veggies, fish, and meat for a few weeks.  it's a low inflammation diet and will help heal recent damage you've caused along with built up damage.  you should notice significant improvement after 2 weeks and the longer you stay on it, the more benefit you'll have from it.

And since alcohol intoxication is easily measurable the government views it as easier to keep track of compared to most other illicit substances where it would take an actual drug test to verify that the substance has been consumed.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","Your cover letter needs to give the hiring manager a reason to be interested in adding you to the stack of ""must interview"" applicants.  You have about a paragraph to catch my interest, and the rest of the letter to tell me what it is about you that makes you potentially a great fit for the job and our organization. 

Perhaps I'm more conservative than the hiring manager for this job.  But other than saying ""they are passionate about what they do"", nothing in the posting jumped out at me as the company being more on the creative side.  Given the type of job, and what they do, I would expect they are looking for the exact opposite of ""creative"".

As a hiring manager, I'd have to say that this letter really turned me off.     Unless you had a superstar resume to back up the letter, or the candidate crop didn't have anyone better qualified, this letter would not get you on my ""to be interviewed"" pile. Here's why (or at least how it reads on a first scan - which is all your letter will get).

* You start with an assumption that I am like you (usually a bad place to start with anyone you don't know) - quite presumptuous.
* Then you have 3 bullets that start with ""you must"".  That's really very off-putting. I don't actually have to do anything, and those words ""you must"" immediately raises a pretty harsh psychological barrier.

Which is a real shame.  Because (if the hiring manager hasn't already moved the application to the 'no' pile) the second half of the letter has some promising indicators in it.  The actual experiences and attributes you bring to the table.  Love of logic puzzles; an audit intern role; that in your personal life you organize and categorize your books etc.  That's the starting point for crafting a personal, compelling cover letter.

I've recommended this blog before - but it really is one of the best, most honest and straight-forward sites on the net.  One that I find myself nodding my head in agreement to the advice given to job-seekers.   [Ask A Manager](http://www.askamanager.org/)  Here's a link to a terrific post on the topic of cover letters (complete with example). [What does a good cover letter look like](http://www.askamanager.org/2007/06/what-does-good-cover-letter-look-like_13.html).

Sorry if this sounds overly harsh - I don't mean to dampen your enthusiasm, just show you how it can come across from the other side of the desk, so that you're better able to write that stand-out letter that will get you to the next stage.  

Good luck!

If you **MURDER** someone you should go to fucking jail!

I'm not ""glossing over"" anything. As an immigrant you agree to be bound by the same laws as everyone else. You don't get a ""get out of jail free"" card for being muslim, or whatever other culture. If someone murders me I don't want him sent back to his family in Africa. I want him to spend the rest of his god damn life in jail like he deserves.

Stop saying I'm ""glossing over"" things because it's kind of pissing me off. I'm not ""glossing over"" honour killings. You can't just say ""in some place somewhere there are people that are okay with that, therefore that is 100% proof that that is what happened here"". That's not proof of anything. I'm not ""glossing over"" it. I'm simply not addressing it because that fact is not a valid argument in any sense of the term on it's own.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Well, generally speaking the louder a track is the more even the frequency response, so radio people and such just prefer a loud track, which is generally why dynamics get all squashed to hell.  I'm honestly not as opposed to the compression trend as most people seem to be, simply because most pop/radio style songs don't really need all that much dynamics to them.

As far as your track, I'd say that the bass drum probably drops off at low volumes because there aren't any mid frequencies in it.  If you can find a way to bump up some mid frequencies on both the bass and the snare I think your mix would probably sound better at a lower volume.  The track doesn't have a whole lot of elements to it, so the elements that it does have need to cover a pretty big frequency range.

"Colorization","t5_2t9sl","Honestly, I don't know why so many people are saying this is good. Maybe it’s just because people like to be nice. 
Anyways...So yes this colorization is *good.* Of course that is after we take the image and color correct the shit out of it.  The definition of *good* I am using is not a definition of beauty.  Your colorization simply has the correct colors in the correct place. 

Yes all the colors are in their correct places except for a few things, the weird palm tree, and the lack of color on the camera equipment behind Elvis, lack of makeup on the woman, no pink in the lips of either person, woman’s hair is a bit yellow.  But that’s it, everything else is rather good. 

So what are some things you can do to fix this image? Well you could gray out the shadows, add a blue filter, overlay the original B&amp;W image with a Luminosity blending mode, and then add several more colors overtop, finish by changing the levels a bunch and fix the image with curves until you get something similar to this. 

http://i.imgur.com/zlTOl.jpg

The colors are full, they are blended together, and it no longer looks like a VHS recording of Happy Days. Yes most of the work of colorization is in the post production.  Although I’m sure many will disagree with me.

Also, I'm removing my Symphony X recommendation because I only just realised that I don't know enough of their back catalogue to give a good recommendation.

As for some of my other picks (i.e. Scarsick, no mention of Images and Words) I merely picked the albums that I would have liked someone recommend to me. I know that Scarsick isn't a great representation of the PoS sound, but they're one of the most eclectic bands around so it was a hard choice (I love the Perfect Element).

I would recommend you speak to the priest of the nearest Eastern Catholic parish you can reasonably attend.  Explain the situation.

He'd probably just tell you to attend there normally and go to a latin rite parish when you have the opportunity.  You wouldn't really be switching rites, you would just be attending a rite other than your own out of necessity.  

If it is unlikely this situation will ever change, that you will be attending this parish for the rest of your life, that would probably be valid grounds for joining that rite.  Especially if you were raising a family there.  Again, i'd just speak to the Priest and explain the situation.

-------

I know of three reasons for the statement.  
1. Some Eastern Rites allow married men to join the priesthood and we don't want married men switching rites just so they can be ordained.  
2. They want to affirm the value of the various rites and stress the importance of diversity in the Church.  You should take pride in the rite you were raised in, this is a good thing.
3. They want to preserve the Eastern Rites.  At the time there was fear Eastern Rite Catholics would join the Latin Rite in order to fit in better or out of the mistaken belief it was some how superior.  By condemning this, the council could help insure the Eastern Rites wouldn't die off.

Of these, the first is probably the least important.  There could me more reasons of which i am unaware.","1349049872"

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","I'm a man and I am a feminist. My mind has been blown by some of the things I have learned about the female experience and by some of the things posted in this subreddit.

I don't feel bad about being a man at all. I was born that way, and not only am I not ashamed of it, but I embrace it. I enjoy being a man. It is what I am.

But being a man isn't the only thing there is. There are lots of people who are being women in the world. And they should be proud to be what they are. I have lots of loved ones in my life who are women. Many people who I care about. I want them to be able to live the fullest and most complete life they can.

I dislike the fact that many of my loved ones face disadvantage or discrimination just because of their gender. I want everything to be fair and just for them (and everyone). That is why I am a feminist, because I recognize that there is an imbalance in society. I don't want womens' right at the expense of mens' rights, but rather, in partnership with it.

There are some that say ""why focus on womens' rights? Why not fight for the rights of all people, regardless of gender?"" I quite agree with that. I do champion the rights of all people. However, for most of recorded history, the default position for ""human"" has been considered to mean ""man"", and women have been considered second-class citizens and not worthy to participate in the discussion. Society is largely skewed in favor of men. That doesn't mean there is a Worldwide Man-spiracy, but just that institutions and organizations are set up to favor men. Feminism focuses on the rights of women to correct this imbalance.

It's about telling the other side of the story, the female side of the human experience. Feminism is definitely focused on the female experience. And that's cool. There are plenty of other schools/philosophies/stories/customs/human-deals that have the manside. It has been fascinating to me to read and hear about the things women go through because they are women.

"flying","t5_2qm1t","I started out thinking I was going to be a commercial pilot. I expected to get my PPL in a year and move right on into a college flight program. 
The intro flight showed me that I had the same passion for flight that I did when I was six years old sitting in the right hand seat of my Grandfather's Seminole. 

Everyone who has said ""go do an intro flight"" is exactly right. But even if you start out thinking you're going to be a commercial pilot - don't be disheartened or embarrassed if you change your mind. I made it to my solo XC's before it dawned on me that while I loved flying - I also love my wife. We want to have kids. Everyone from high-time airline pilots, bush pilots, and military guys I talked to told me the same thing: Balancing your family and your career is hard. Next to impossible - said some. 

I decided it wasn't worth it. Not right now, and not for me. But that's not stopping me from flying. I stopped viewing it as an investment, and started viewing it (as some have rightly said) as an expensive hobby. It was the hardest thing I've had to own up to. That a dream of mine, which is technically within my capabilities - just isn't right for me... for a variety of reasons. 

But that doesn't mean it won't be right for you. 

TL;DR - Consider more than just your passion for flying when you consider a career in aviation. Ask yourself: What is your family life like? Do you want to get married, settle down, and raise some kids? How well do you manage stress? ","1349049876"

Way back in 2003, Martin had [this](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Concerning_the_Dance_of_the_Dragons/) to say about the Dance of the Dragons:

&gt; *Hi, short question. Will we find out more about the Dance of the Dragons in future books?*

&gt; The first dance or the second?

&gt; The second will be the subject of a book. The first will be mentioned from time to time, I'm sure.

So we can expect at some point there will be another war between two ""Dragons"". Personally, I'm entirely convinced it's going to be Aegon vs. Daenerys. Aegon's story will convince some people initially, but it won't hold up under scrutiny. Barristan especially is going to have some choice words for a ""Targaryen"" backed by the Golden Company.

Now what about the title ""A Dance with Dragons""? Recall that AFFC was not part of the original plan for the series. ADWD was supposed to come after ASOS with a five year gap between them. The five year gap proved to be too awkward, so Martin introduced AFFC. Then AFFC went way long and was divided in two, the second half forming the bulk of what became ADWD. That means much of the content that was originally planned for ADWD *still* hasn't been published yet. That probably includes the war that the book was titled for.","1349049883"

The non-main-comics often re-caps what has happened in the main event comic during the book anyway, usually via internal monologue (""Golly gee, Cap and Iron man sure are angry at each other!"" etc)

Generally the most basic knowledge is necessary to understand whats happening.

Police chases of any type are ratings GOLD. They walk a fine line - they can't appear to get too eager about it to prevent them being seen as encouraging it or putting people at risk by covering it, but inside the offices, they know it's fantastic for the bottom line.

/Been in the newsroom, seen it happen. 

edit: to be clear - I was in the newsroom when a chase such as this happened - everybody went into this odd dual-personality thing, where one side of them was a concerned, caring, empathetic person concerned about the situation, only barely hiding the excited, jackal-like blood-thirst and ready to exploit the hell out of it for their own gain, hoping the end was gruesome and horrifying to ensure they get more out of it. The further away from the camera lens they were, the less of an act they had to put on for the others.

Personally, the thing that bothered me most was the 'caring, serious act' they put on for the viewers. Be bloodthirsty ratings-whores - I have no problem with that; but at least be honest about it. That ridiculous faux-caring bullshit act is just insulting.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I entirely disagree with your assessment!

1. Underwater skill's damage isn't useless. You might do less damage with your #1, but you do it in AoE. Which is more useful even, imo, because.. Well, that's the second point. We'll get to that. The spear? Ofcourse spear isn't all based around condition. That's the point - One favours conditions, the other favours non-condition builds. Can't just leave power-necros out, can we?  
I'll note as well, spear #3 ability is useful as fuck, whether you're conditionbased or not, and spear #5 actually does help for condition builds. Just like trident #4 is useful, condition build or not, and #5 is high damage for a power-based build.

2. Lots of mobs. This isn't so much a problem, as a change of pace; you're more suited to killing mobs AoE, and you pull more mobs. This isn't too much of a problem in terms of me getting overwhelmed and dying, generally; there's a few exceptions to this rule, but I'll blame those locations, not underwater combat.

3. I disagree for the most part. I actually really, *really* expected the whole ""new skills underwater"" thing to suck, when I tried this game. Gimmicky, crap, eh. But having tried it out and gotten used to it, I actually like it! They've got new things they can do with skills, which they couldn't on land; think sinks and cages. A lot of AoEs are impractical and not so great underwater, too, so some weapons just wouldn't work there (Staff, for necro, underwater? Come on.)  
I have found kiting to be incredibly easy. I kited that champion hylek event mob in malchor's leap for like 20 minutes before more people turned up, and we took it out with 10. I couldn't even use my #3 ability through it, or death shroud #2, since it absorbs poison. There are a few mobs that are exceptions to the rule, but generally, it isn't really harder than on land; if anything, I've found it easier. I'm also not getting you saying underwater dodge is useless; I'm finding it fine.  
I kind of wish there was a ""swim down"" key though, just like jump swims up. Maybe I'm just missing something there though.

TL;DR - I think a lot of your issues with it are there for a valid reason, and make perfect sense when you think about them. I feel you're blowing it out of proportion. Get in there with the mentality of ""fuck it, pull everything and AoE it down"", and you'll enjoy it a bit more - that's my advice, anyway. I'm having a blast there, especially as condition necro - Way more than I did with power build!","1349049894"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It feels horrible, yes.

I was raised in a very family-centric home.  It was also very co-dependent, but I didn't realize this until much later.  

My mother is very manipulative and overly selfish.  She uses guilt to get what she wants from just about anyone she can.. from my father, from her current husband and step-kids, from my sister.. and for a long time, from me.  It wasn't until I saw her start to wheedle her way between me and my immediate family that I started to get to the point where the stress and emotional cost of having her in my life outweighed the guilt I felt for cutting that cord.

The day after my wedding, she sent me a 2 page (screen) long email detailing all of the things we did wrong.  That was kind of my breaking point.. that even my own wedding had to be about her and the things she wanted instead of what I wanted.

From that day for about a year, the communication got less and less until everything ended abruptly in a huge fight.  She was beating the hell out of me emotionally, I was refusing to bend to her wishes.  That was the end of frequent communication.

She lives about 7 hours away.  We still stop and visit for an hour or two when we go back, mostly so she can see my son.  She still comments on my stuff on FB and I let her.  I haven't had a conversation with her for about 2 years now and I don't really foresee that changing.

Would I prefer to have her be an active part of my life?  Yes.  But when the toll it takes on me puts as much stress as it did on my other relationships, it's absolutely worth living with the guilt of not including my mother in my life.","1349049900"

This is the most effective way for people to express their political preferences in a representative system and for politicians to govern once elected.

Or, if this is an intentionally vague rhetorical question: this is quite silly. The existence of political parties does not necessitate that politics be divisive to some unreasonable level. And furthermore, Non-multiparty political systems have shown themselves able to be just as fractious -- if not more -- then party systems. ","1349049900"

**TL;DR**

OP had sex with a gal, they broke up but stayed friends.

Two years later, OP's best friend has a rough sexual relationship with that gal, but break up and remain friends.

Recently, OP breaks up with a long-term girlfriend and wants to have sex with his former lay, so he asks his best friend for permission. The best friend refuses, but the OP and his friends use peer pressure to intimidate him, to which he relents and grants permission.

The OP has now been having sex with the original gal, of which she wishes to keep secret to the friendgroup. Somehow, not even the best friend knows this.  The OP wants the gal to tell his best friend that they're having sex, but she gets emotional and upset.

OP wants to know if OP is being a dick for not telling his best friend that he's been having sex with the gal that he intimidated the best friend into granting permission to have sex with the gal with, because the best friend has a strong emotional attachment to the gal.

&gt; then you are less likely to sacrifice your life or in other words waste your life benefiting others, because again, this is your only life and you need to live it.

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","3L here. It seems everyone's in agreement that you should try and stick with it at least through the first semester to see how you do. Honestly, I didn't know what the hell I was doing at this point in my first semester - I felt like I was barely faking my way through some of my classes and felt very much like I was having to figure out everything on my own. 

Eventually things will get clearer - both in the sense of whether you really like the law and whether you think it's smarter to stick with it. But right now (a month or so in) it's a little to early to make a drastic decision like dropping out and giving up a free ride. So despite a little bit of echoing, here are my suggestions:

**Stick with it through the first semester.** Things will become a lot clearer in your mind once you get near finals whether any of the subjects are interesting or if you even like studying and applying the law. Right now you're in the process of figuring out what the hell law school is and how to succeed. It'll likely click in a few weeks, maybe a month, and then things will get a lot easier. And honestly, the arguments you made about ""the pragmatic part of [your] brain knows that its mostly bullshit"" could be applied to getting an undergrad degree (seriously, a lot of people go on to law school because they know they could never get a good job with a BA in Art History).

**Make those people that you like in law school your core friends.** There's always a few people who turn out to be cool and will look out for you.

**Make friends outside of law school.** Hang out with some people who aren't living, breathing, vomiting the law 24/7. My non-law friends are the ones I hang out with the most, as their lives are a lot more interesting than mine and my fellow students'.

**Exercise.** Seriously, this will help your depression in so many ways.

**Keep up your old hobbies, get new ones.** My biggest regret/disappointment with my first year was that I rarely rode my bike, which I had done without fail nearly everyday for nearly 10 years. It was like I had shelved a huge part of myself and consequently affected how I viewed the whole experience. Since my second year I've gotten back on the bike and taken up a couple other hobbies.

**Use Winter Break to figure out if you REALLY want to stay in law school, or if you're just looking for a fatter paycheck.** Seriously, winter break is the time that you should use to figure out if you want to invest another 2.5 years in this endeavor. Think about it long and hard. Make a pros/cons list or whatever you do to assess hard choices. Get advice from friends (lawschool and non), professors, family, anyone you trust. And if you come to the notion that it's just a fatter paycheck you want, maybe begin considering something else. A fatter paycheck may not be worth the next two years and the career you'll be fashioning for yourself. I often ask prospective 1Ls: ""Would you want a surgeon who went to med school just for a fatter paycheck and hated medicine operating on you?""

**Don't be afraid to Fail.** To quote Conan O' Brien. I think this is something to keep in mind. If you find that law school just isn't right for you, don't be afraid to admit it and move on. A free ride to a career where you'll be miserable may not be a great trade off 10 years from now. While most of us on Reddit would love to have the opportunity you have, we can't substitute our possible jealously for your position to encourage you to pursue a degree you may not want. Admitting you don't like law school and that it is not right for you is not, as one of us said, a 3rd grader's excuse; it's a realization that this career is not right for you and that your path lays elsewhere. To quote Conan O'Brien again: ""In 2000, I told graduates to not be afraid to fail, and I still believe that.  But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come.  The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.""

**Best of luck man!** It does get easier, and also harder. This is my toughest semester by far, and I have thought about quitting a couple times this semester. But if you think have it in you, keep it up and make it through to graduation.","1349049930"

"USMilitarySO","t5_2ta0n","&gt;This is just lovely, one side is bitching about the partner at home cheating, now you come along with the deployed partner being likely to cheat... even giving the group a percentage!

Honestly that percentage was an absolute guess.  I probably shouldn't have used a quantitative descriptor.  But using saying something like ""extremely likely"" didn't really convey how pervasive infidelity is in the service.

&gt;If you want to make sure people are aware and use protection, go ahead and say that, respectively. ""Hey you guys, thanks for all the support, but be aware, cheating during deployment is not unheard of...

That'd be pretty deceptive, cheating ""is not unheard of"" anywhere so such a warning wouldn't be a warning at all.

&gt;Think about the girls here, who are in their early 20s and are already struggling with friends telling them, that it might not be worth it to wait so long and then they hardly ever get to hear from their bf, think about how they feel when you come along and just tell them ""well, yeah, 95% chance he's fucking someone else now!"".

Are we to assume that these girls/guys wouldn't want to know the likelihood of their SO cheating?  Very nearly every person I've talked to about this subject has said they'd want to know if their SO cheated.

&gt;You didn't cheat, so imagine how it would be to finally being able to talk to your partner at home and then having her ask you about whether or not you're cheating, because she read somewhere... That would have sucked, right?

I wasn't aware of prop-building/general artistic construction until my late twenties, so I went ahead and pursued a lucrative career in the field of _______. Now that I've discovered the joy in being a maker (largely due to your TED talk about the satisfaction of objects and the stories they tell), I am really kicking myself that I didn't discover it early enough to make it my life's work. 

So, two questions: 

a) Would you advise someone who developed a passion for that sort of thing late in life to pursue it full time? Is it worth sacrificing the safety and security of a tolerable day job to pursue something that very well may be your true calling? Is it a noble pursuit when you have a family to support?

b) Does taking something like prop building, which is a thoroughly enjoyable stress reliever, and making it your means to an end ruin part of the magic? Do deadlines and criticism spoil the fun?

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","That was a very useful reply.  You know more about what you want to do than you implied in your first post ("" I don't know what I want to do, perhaps mainly because I don't know what I can be doing."").  In terms of curation, management for the museum/heritage sector, fundraising... these are all areas in which networking is absolutely your number one way of getting your foot in the door.  I would advise you to network as much as you can in ALL the areas you mentioned, because it's essentially a game of numbers.  The more places and people you target, the greater your chances of finding a career.  If you decided only to go for being a museum curator, you're drastically narrowing down your chances of actually being one.  So with that in mind, you need to start targeting people in your field(s) - you already have a great start in the fundraising and museum jobs you have , but you'll have to work fairly quickly for the museum one if you only have a month left.  Basically, look people up on linkedin (you do have a linked in account, right? You'll need one) and make a note of any names you hear on your job.  Contact these people and explain you're getting started in their field and you'd like to know more about how they got to their position and exactly what it entails.  Meet with them for 15-20 minutes, ask them if they can recommend one other person, and go talk to that person.  Basically, you're getting a feel for what can be done with your education and experience so you can determine what you'd like to do, and you're also getting your name out there so potential employers and people above you know who you are and remember you if positions come up.  Then keep in touch with these people semi-regularly so they don't forget you. While doing all this, keep your eye open for any similar positions (google the job titles of the people you've been talking to), so you are accumulating more experience that you can put on your resume and talk about to all these people while networking.  Even volunteering can help boost the resume and meet people.  You already have the academics down, and you're starting to get experience, but now it's all about who you know.  You may encounter some positions you don't like, but even that will help you decide what you do want to do.","1349049935"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Occam's razor is often misunderstood (by both sides) as a truth-finding tool, and it is not (at least, not directly). Wikipedia sums up the misconception well;

&gt; The principle is often incorrectly summarized as ""other things being equal, a simpler explanation is better than a more complex one."" In practice, the application of the principle often shifts the burden of proof in a discussion. The razor states that one should proceed to simpler theories until simplicity can be traded for greater explanatory power. The simplest available theory need not be most accurate. Philosophers point out also that the exact meaning of simplest may be nuanced.

Rather, Occam's razor is correctly used as a heuristic tool (a guideline for how best to proceed) in both science and more commonplace applications. It is used to develop models and theories, not to decide what is true. It is not proof of one theories correctness over the other. I have seen atheists and theists alike misuse it many times, and I freely admit I have as well in the past before I better understood the concept. 

All that said, the razor does seem to be a generally useful principle for figuring out which of two models is *more likely* to be true based on current knowledge. This isn't proof, but this is selection.

The reason it is more rational to use number of unjustified assumptions as a guideline is simple. Every assumption that a theory is based on matters. If a theory is based entirely on assumptions that we already know to be true, that is a good start. If a theory is based on assumptions we already know to be false, that is a very, very bad start. If a theory is based on assumptions we currently don't know either way...well that's a bit dubious. Ideally, you want a theory that has most or all of it's assumption already known to be true. If a theory is based on a lot of ideas that we just don't know, then it raises questions about whether the theory itself is sound. Even worse is if those assumptions *should* present evidence that they are true, but don't or we haven't found any such evidence. This is concerning. So if Theory A only has one new, unproven idea that it is dependent on, and Theory B has four, this puts Theory B on less stable ground than theory A. It does not mean B is false, but it does mean that there had better be some damn good evidence to believe it over A.

Most confusing in your question is this part;

&gt; Occam's razor seems like the weakest point in atheist epistemologies, because it can't be validated by evidence by its very nature.

Occam's razor is not a tool for atheists to use, it is a tool for scientific model development. It only has bearing on atheism inasmuch as competing models have equal explanatory power, which they rarely do. Further, it is certainly not a key component of why I or most other atheists don't believe in God.","1349049940"

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","On the other hand...

Wearable space suits, bonnets and Lincoln's hat happen to be real-world objects and it is perfectly realistic for them to be in-game. A ghoul mask, given its function, is merely practical. 

Tranquility Lane is, in my opinion, a poor example. As you said, it has grim undertones and the humour in it serves to makes it even creepier. This is not the case with Old World Blues - while being lobotomised might be grim, the DLC never brings this up except for humour purposes. Hell, Tranquillity Lane's music gradually becomes creepier as you progress through it, while Old World Blue's is consistently... Jazzy. The humour is used for different purposes entirely.

The Republic of Dave is very silly, yes. I found it incredibly jarring.

A cyber-dog is, in my opinion, not exactly laughable and seems to fit with the Sci-fi genre Fallout is part of. Elvis Impersonators are absolutely central to a Las Vegas setting and, again, are not laughable.

I do think Old World Blues is somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the series, because every other title uses a lot of dark, disturbing humour (perhaps aside from Fallout 3 in some parts). Old World Blues just makes me giggle for the most part.

That said, I really enjoyed Old World Blues *because* it was something different. And to BOS13: I hope you enjoyed the parts of the DLC that weren't humour based, because there was plenty of it. The lore behind the Harness Suits was disturbing and the DLC presented an excellent view of Science! from a post-apocalyptic 50's perspective. ","1349049950"

The claim that Stalin legitimately thought Trotsky was a Nazi agent is just absurd. Trotsky, a Jew who had fought for socialism his entire life, subjected the rise of fascism to a penetrating Marxist analysis, and called for the Soviet Union to move against Nazi Germany before it could strengthen itself militarily? The claim is also refuted by the fact that Stalin had begun the persecution of Trotskyists in the Soviet Union, long before the Nazis came to power.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Well when I was 335lbs.. I hated the way I looked, honestly.  I hated that I had a gorgeous fit husband who loved to go snowboarding and being outside and he had to help me put on my socks in the morning. I started with SparkPeople [My Page](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage.asp?id=DAPHASAURUS) and started joining groups, researching recipes and started doing their at  home exercises.  To be honest, getting started is easy.  It's when you hit the bumps in life when you find out if you can stick it out or not.

In October of 2010 I had lost over 80lbs, then my mom was sent to the ER where they discovered a huge tumor by her intestines.  She was in extreme pain and needed someone to watch over her in recovery.  That was me.  I relapsed badly and gained weight back (back up to 289 from 248).  I ended up in the fall of 2011 calling an ambulance in the middle of the night because of intense cramping on the ENTIRE side of my left body, and I started blacking out.  I had chest pains and could barely walk for days after.  Turns out I had several deficiencies from eating only junk food.  I was such a terrible case that my doctor referred me 6 months to a dietitian for free to help me get it sorted out.  I ended up being referred to counselling for Binge eating and was also referred to over eaters anon. (I still haven't gone however).  Now THAT is what motivated me again.  I almost DIED at 26.  How sick is that? 

Edit: I want to add that I'm very lucky to have such a caring doctor to do this all for me.  She really got the ball rolling!

Seriously, if you feel like you overeat/binge then I *strongly* recommend seeing someone for therapy or counselling.  It's the best thing I ever EVER did.  

I'm now doing this for myself, and not for any other reason.  I need to stay alive, I  mean really.. my husband is too gorgeous for him to move onto another woman! ;D","1349049959"

I have sinusitis and very dry eyes. The 30 day wear day/night lenses were new, and my optometrist was excited about them. She gave them to me to try, but they were like wearing sandpaper on my eyes. She gave me drops and said I'd get used to it. I was just a kid, still in high school. I listened to my doctor. 
A few days later, I was playing sport with them in. They started to hurt, but I played through, not able to get to my drops. I took the lenses out and didn't wear them anymore, but the damage was done. A week later, the grazes on my right eye had ulcerated, and I couldn't see out of it anymore.
 
It's taken years, and the scar is still changing, obscuring new parts of my vision. The texture of my right eye also means I can't get corrective laser surgery. I still play sport, at a pretty high level. I'm a hockey goalkeeper, and having to wear glasses under my helmet sucks SO MANY BALLS.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","I believe your black-or-white statement is on shaky grounds. I do not believe I am being silly. I do believe that your no true Scotsman claim is a bit brash and moot. Lena Headey plays Cersei. A character who's hair is light and gold being played by a woman who have dark raven  hair. We could talk about the hair colors of all the GoT characters but I'd rather not  and I don't imagine you making a stink about that factoid. I'm not going to cherrypick the right tone of skin color to match a character who currently only lives in the imagination of the reader.  The subtext of ASOFI is that Dornismen are not pale and fair skin. Therefore, we can work with gradients of skin color. Furthermore, you are blowing things out of proportion. Your statement about The Rock, Sylvester, and Tom Cruise is irrelevant and redundant. Yes, they could play the part. Your sentence is loaded enough and my hand is twisted enough to begrudingly agree with you on that sentence. Additionally, I don't need a socio-cultral less about the black people who reside in Sweden as that doesn't add substance to the topic. Now subjectivity aside, what I would like is for you to see that I merely make two points: acting ability comes first and that Martells should not be pale/fair skinned. Everything else is, I believe, fair game for people to play. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to this artistic rendition of [Arianne Martell](http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2010/263/2/4/arianne_martell_by_lauren_oh-d2z5djo.jpg).

No. I'm not saying they shouldn't. I'm saying that they can't. Human psychology being what it is, it's impossible for them to do so even if they initially agree to do that. One (or both) will shirk responsibility onto the other. Sooner rather than later.

And it's not just parents and teachers. Any time responsibility sharing should occur, it can't. Through all walks of life, all circumstances. 

&gt; I'm saying that this shared responsibility has been going on for centuries 

Jesus fucking christ. Modern public schools have only existed 150 years or so. Hardly the centuries you're alluding to. And what came before that bears little resemblance. Furthermore, the sort of religious education or education of the powerful aristocracy that occurred prior to modern schools... it most certainly wasn't shared at all. It was put off wholly on the ""teachers"" such as they were.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","AP Nidalee relies on spears for poke damage with a huge damage output upon landing, and has her cougar form's burst with %health for finishing moves. It's strong in a poke composition but outside of that you are probably gimping your team in a straight up fight because your burst is 1 spell and then you go melee range and probably die. Your traps and heal give you a slight utility in late-game.

AD Nidalee is a little more standard. When played bruiser top lane, zones out AD Carries pretty well with cougar's damage, mobility and innate tankiness. Nidalee also does very well top in a variety of matchups, so there's no real fear of getting beaten into uselessness during laning (unless you misplay).

Both can work, but it's basically a choice of how you want to play. Support Nidalee is terrible. You have a Zilean-esque early game with Spear harass and heals, but as you fall off you become the most useless support in the game with your minor heal and your traps being your only utility. So either play her top (best) or mid (situational).

Also people keep bringing up professionalism, I say who let the professionals figure out what ""we the fans"" like. If Doublelifts fanbase likes him taking a few jabs at other teams, then he'll keep doing it even if it pisses off other teams fans. If people like other players saying the all the teams are excellent contenders and we can lose to anyone of them then by all means keep doing that. 

It'd be boring as hell to just have everyone say ""yeah, yeah such-n-such team is good, and so is such-n-such, end of story"". I'd rather have them say ""Such-n-such is a joke we'll stomp them in the group stage."" Then watch as they either eat their words or prove themselves victorious. Other sports have used this too attract people in such as UFC and Boxing, which is why they have these huge drawn out smack talking interviews and pictures of them looking face to face like they want to kill each other.

Red Velvet has a hint of cocoa powder for a slight flavor, but the real star comes from the vinegar that's added just before baking. Yes, I said vinegar. Red Velvet has a higher proportion of baking soda, and by adding just a bit of vinegar (I believe 1 Tbsp) it causes a slight reaction which is what gives real Red Velvet cake the incredible flavor and texture that sets it apart from any other cake. Now I'll agree that 99% of what is advertised as red velvet is pure shit and barely different than any yellow cake.

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","I watch Doctor Who because I want to be entertained. And for me, both RTD and Moffat and all other episode writers have given me my semi-weekly dose of entertainment in spades.

Granted, I do not have the backlog knowledge of 50 years of Who-lore stuck in my brain, because I started with Christopher Ecclestone, and not with the 8 predecessors. I have seen a couple of old-Who serials (roughly one of each doctor, which the exception of Paul McGann, not gotten around to watching the movie), and I have enjoyed those too.   
But perhaps I'm not the prototype hardcore fan-nerd that gets a semi whenever they can deconstruct an episode to its finest cores to find those flaws that break the episode for them.

I think for the writers, it's entertainment first, continuity and canon second. A show with 50 years of lore under its belt, don't you think it's almost impossible for writers to stay close to canon?   
So what if the Doctor could've used doohicky from way-back-when to solve MonsterOfTheWeek's issues in seconds. How does that make for an entertaining hour?    
That would end the show like a WarGames simulation, the only way to win is to not make an episode at all. And I think we can all agree that that would not be a good solution.","1349049987"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","This sounds like you're discussing a scenario involving two of the most rational, un-emotional people on earth, people who have a mutual scientific interest in the various components of their past relationship. *I* have been discussing something more relevant to the original topic, namely a scenario where one participant feels they are already satisfied with the conclusion and the *other* participant is still hanging on. I assume this is the source of my strawmanning.

&gt; If one party is looking for closure, then professional guidance towards that closure can be very helpful.

Yes! Of course! Where we're disagreeing is the need for it to be *couples'* counseling.

Saying ""the two of us need to go to counseling"" is just saying ""this relationship between the two of us is not over yet, and it won't be over until I'm personally satisfied that it's over, and therefore you have to continue participating in it with me until *I* am ready to let go."" It's a hostage situation. 

If one person needs closure, they can get that by going to therapy themselves - possibly they'll receive some advice there about how to talk to their ex, or maybe they'll isolate exactly what kind of response they're seeking from their ex and their therapist will help them determine whether or not that's reasonable. But expecting the ex to go *with* them to therapy? 

It's just emotional blackmail. It's not respecting the ex's wishes to end the relationship. 

&gt; and having both parties there also helps (so as to be certain that the closure is based on the true feelings of both parties

Is this actually important? If the person who wants closure couldn't get an explanation that satisfied them from their ex on their own, is it really reasonable to let them drag that ex to a counselor like a naughty child and demand that the ex give a reason that makes ""enough"" sense? Do you owe everyone you break up with a dissertation on your every motivation? 

Part of closure is learning to live with *not knowing*. You don't know how things would have gone if you'd stayed together, you don't know exactly what you could have done to make it work, you don't know definitively if it was more her fault or more your fault, but you puzzle it out as charitably as you can, you accept it, you strive to be a better person going forward and then you move on. 

What's your experience been with this sort of couples' counseling? What does a couples' counselor actually do when one person is unreasonable and the other person just wants to leave?","1349049987"

In this case I would say that free will is different from optical illusions in that the latter deals with perception, while the former deals with experience. We can test evidence against our specific sensory perceptions because, after all, our senses are flawed in some cases. 

However, our perceptual capacity as a whole is much different, and I think the pragmatist must argue that our basic, intuitive notions of the world are trustworthy. Perhaps by appeal to Occam's razor: It is much simpler that our basic understanding of the world reflects the world itself, than our basic understanding of the world reflects something unlike the world itself.

After about an hour of jumping off this 1 foot tall ramp, he gets bored and decides to make it 4 feet.

This kid was 2 years older than me and told me that if I jumped it, him and his other 14 year old friends would treat me as though I was the same age. So I go at this ramp full speed thinking I need to hit it as fast as possible to make it. Big, big mistake, I hit the ramp so hard I jumped the entire 2nd half of the ramp, and land on flat dirt. Anyone that has jumped a bike off of a ramp knows this is the second worst possibility, the first is landing front wheel first.

Most interviewers are interested in your ability to be humble and realistic, and aren't judging you nearly as much as you think about what your weakness really is. 

Pick something that does tend to play a role in your personality or habits that might show through in your work. They don't want you to be perfect. They just want to hear what you have identified as your weakness and how you are working to build yourself into a better person because of it.

I will help you with an example. The weakness I most commonly used is that I'm very dependent on feeling good about what I'm doing for my health. I would mention that when I was young I suffered from body image disorders, and remnants of that have stayed with my personality. If I was far too busy for a period of time and stopped going to the gym or eating well, it would start to depress me, and that would show in my work after a while. Then the positive spin: to help ensure that I'm happy with what I'm eating, I am now starting to cook meals for the week ahead of time and shop for goods at Trader Joes. Also, if I find that I am too busy to work out, I will go on a 20 minute jog before bed to relax myself.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","I picked up and slightly modified a Brewer's Best Kit for my pumpkin beer this year. I decided that my pumpkin spice porter would include real pumpkin for fermentable sugars. (pumpkin is fruit, fruit has glucose, glucose is sugar, yeast like that.) I sliced a pumpkin in half and baked it, flat sides down on a cookie sheet at 350F for 90 minutes until darkened. Cleaned the seeds and mixed with olive oil, sea salt, and garlic powder to bake for 40 mins in the same oven to make the best pumpkin seeds I've ever had. 

So yeah, the major difference was that the recipe didn't call for any pumpkin (Pumpkin **Spice** Porter) besides that, I followed the [kit's directions](http://www.brewersbestkits.com/pdf/New%20BB%20Recipes/1062%20Pumpkin%20Spice%20Recipe.pdf). After they were done in the oven, I peeled the pumpkin halves of their skin, the fruit had become very soft and broke apart easily, probably should have put it in the oven for 45-60 mins instead. I added the pumpkin pieces at the same stage where I added the bittering hops (1 oz of US Golding) at the very beginning of the hop addition phase of the brew day schedule. After 40 mins I added 1 oz of Willamette aroma hops and after another 10 mins I added the whole packet of pumpkin spice (I have read that many people believe the provided packet of spice is overpowering at first but I also read that this subsides with time, so I simply planned on leaving this in the primary fermenting bucket for 2 weeks, secondary glass carboy for 8 weeks, bottle conditioning for 2-3 weeks+ or kegging it if it tastes good by then.) So basically I won't know for sure how this came out until mid to late November or so. 

My trouble began when I realized I was out of ice, I don't have a wort chiller/thermonator/etc. so I rely on an ice bath to terminate my boil. Without ice, I was stuck using cold water. Well, I had forgotten that I needed to pick my girlfriend up so I just left the brew pot in a sink full of cold water with the lid on (to prevent bacteria from entering) for about 40 mins. When I got back, the temp was down from 214F (boiling temp here) but was still up at about 138F. Although it smelled incredible, the extra time in hot wort turned my pumpkin pieces into stringy pumpkin guts and had completely saturated my beer. I figured I would just spoon out what little I could and just strain out the rest, how naive of me.. 

Basically between a food grade strainer and a filter screened funnel, the pumpkin hairs clogged up the works. I had to abandon the funnel because the screen was simply too fine. The strainer took work and the process moved at a snail's pace, I think it took about an hour to strain the mushy pumpkin guts out of the 2.5 gallon wort. (note: I use the word ""guts"" but I had removed the actual guts and seeds before baking the pumpkin, the heat from the baking process and subsequent boil had basically turned a firm pumpkin into ""guts"".) 

After I strained out what I could of the pumpkin guts and hop pellet refuse, I was left with what looked to be somewhere between 2 and 2.25 gallons of wort, down from about 2.5 gallons with the guts and stuff. I slowly added fresh, cool, well water while intermittently checking the OG to try to get into the specified range (1.057-1.061) I had gotten it to about 1.064 when I decided to add about 3 or 4 more cups of water (I wasn't being precise, basically just eyeballing it from the tap) when I went to check the OG again, it had fallen to about 1.048. 

Annoyed with myself, I went to grab my yeast starter (oh yeah, I had made a starter with the kit's provided dry yeast packet about 6 hours earlier and it wasn't really doing anything, unlike other starters I have made) So, being further annoyed, I pitched the lazy starter and aerated the batch. I happened to have an extra packet of Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast so I sprinkled that on top just to be safe. After sealing the lid, I added vodka to the airlock, took a swig for myself and went to bed.

I brewed this kit September 15th, I'm going to be taking a gravity reading/racking to a secondary fermenter sometime this week. Based on other forums I've read with overlapping membership into this one, there seem to be a few people interested in this kit, and some of those seem to be interested in using real pumpkin as well, just thought I'd share my experience to help with their decision. I'll keep you guys posted on the progress of this batch in the coming weeks..

**TL;DL** I made the Brewers Best Spiced Pumpkin Porter Kit and added some real Pumpkin for fermentable sugars. Ran into trouble with straining the pumpkin out before racking to the primary fermenter, ran into trouble with some lazy yeast, added a second strain of (champagne) yeast for insurance and not sure how it'll come out.. OG came out a little low but I'm looking forward to trying it out. 
**Also**, a lot of people who make beer with pumpkin spice (pumpkin pie spice) claim that you need a couple months for the spice to mellow out, this might explain any ""not so great"" taste you get early on.","1349050011"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","The sites were shut down not because they were scamming players, but because they were forced to ""illegally"" process withdrawn funds to get them to the players.  It was only found out after they were taken down that FTP hadn't properly segregated player funds from company earnings, as PokerStars had done, which made it impossible for them to properly pay their player base back the money they deserved.

Pokerstars on the other hand was shut down for the same reason, yet they had properly segregated the funds, and were able to pay back all US players the complete sum of their account within a few months.  And Pokerstars continues to operate outside of the US currently, and is still considered the best site.

Pokerstars has since bought FTP, will be paying back the players sometime this year I believe, and then will be able to enter the US market whenever regulation is passed that allows online sites to legally operate within the US.

Fwiw, online poker isn't illegal.  At least the act of playing isn't.  What was illegal was the way in which the sites had to process the funds so that banks would accept the funds without knowing it came from the poker site (since UIGEA made it illegal for banks to accept funds from online gambling sites).

Aluminum is cheapest, but stainless is best for longevity. It's much easier to weld onto stainless. It also dents less easily. Stainless retains heat better than Aluminum so hot spots tend to be less of an issue. 

I bought this one: [20qt Stainless](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WPY1A/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00) and I wish I had gone bigger. I'm doing 5 gallon batches and I wish I had gotten a 24qt (6gal) pot so that I could have gotten closer to 5 gallons after boiling. 

[This one is 24 qt's and looks identical to mine except bigger](http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349049585&amp;sr=8-3)

I'm actually considering getting one of these as well.  On my 20qt stock pot I have a coupling welded to the bottom with a valve on it. Makes moving liquids so much easier. 


&gt;Also, is there any real problem with using an electric stovetop or is it simply slower and less convenient? I'll only be boiling 2.5 gallons in my next partial grain batch.

tell me in your own words why people in the middle east hate the US gov, and how killing numerous civilians with indiscriminate drone strikes is a good idea in that context.

when you understand why they hate us you'll know why leaving would solve the problem (hint: that's why they hate us).

When we are taxed, we're giving up our right to decide how a pretty substantial part of our income is spent. Even if we deem the taxation to be justifiable, that's no small thing and has to be considered. That's why it's actually relevant whether we say 'taxing less' or 'giving tax cuts.'

Try and assess your relationship with this man on that basis, rather than what your feelings towards him are at present. You say you think your feelings are too strong to ignore - this is how I felt too. But my feelings were confused and did not reflect good sense because her emotional issues were dragging me down and made me feel unhappy more frequently than happy.

I met my former friend from the above story at a new years eve party year or so from the split. That encounter totally, absolutely convinced me that I had made the right choice in, essentially, dumping her.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","I agree with you with all points but one (or three, depending how you look at it):

* in all languages I know (like English ""to be""), copula is a verb (however this is anecdotal and thus not saying much),
* です is generally agreed upon to be a verb, AFAIK, and
* there is disagreement on whether だ・です is a copula or not.

I might tentatively agree with you if you complained about だ, as it really has no verbal morphology. It acts as an assertion particle for nominal predicates, and has its own て-form. です, however, is (probably) a contraction from であります or でございます (I forget which), and conjugates as if it was a form of である, which itself is composed of the て-form of だ and an existence verb (and ある・ござる most assuredly is a verb, by any standard). And just as だ has the semantics of an assertion particle (and is thus seen as unseemly or too forceful  for women's usage), です can be seen as a politeness verb, or polite assertion verb, which is a bit difficult to grasp coming from European languages - ""a verb with no action or state?!? huh?!?"". (It can even stand alone, not coupling anything, meaning roughly ""that's about it"" or ""well, that's what I think"", can't teally translate it properly. It can even be tacked onto plain verbs when the speaker forgot to polite-ify them, although prescriptive grammars would most likely condemn the practice.) And given how neither is actually required in Japanese leads one to view the proposition that Japanese is a no-copula language like Russian as not entirely unreasonable.

When you two start arguing, both of you should follow these steps:

1. Stop talking immediately. Exit to other room/area. 
2. Take deep breaths. 
3. Get pen and paper, or go to your computer.
4. Write/type the shit you want to say to each other. Be as free with your words as you'd like. 
5. Read over what you wrote. Edit it for emotional manipulative points (take those out) and edit it for hurtful and insulting words that are not constructive (take those out). 
6. Once what you've written is merely left with points like, ""I feel (insert feeling) because this (insert catalytic event which sparked the argument) happened. What do?"" 
7. Get together. Show each other the points you're left with. 
8. Brainstorm as a couple as to how to properly meet these obstacles you've come up against. 


I suggested these steps because it seems like you two don't properly understand how to **remove your emotions from a ""I say, you say"" type of discussion.** These steps will **help both of you to be less emotional in these discussions**. 

Once the two of you are used to this type of routine, you won't have to follow the steps as closely. It honestly becomes easier and easier to keep your emotions about a topic aside while really listening to what your partner is saying. 

Good luck!

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","Problem is keeping the insulin cold. NovoRapid goes bad after 4 weeks of being unrefrigerated, so even assuming we find a stash to last us until 80, we're still slaves to the temperature. Once the fridges stop working, we'll have to find some other method of keeping it cool. The most obvious one would be to keep it in a ziplock bag under water, I suppose. Or perhaps frio packs that you've constantly got active. In addition, there's finding batteries to keep sugar monitors or pumps going, and since there's a finite supply of electricity, there's a good chance they'll be in very short supply. Sure, you could rig up a generator to charge rechargables, but how long will the batteries actually last? 

Basically, I think it's more likely to be a matter of when these fail, rather than if they fail. Maybe some zombies happen to stumble over your camp, and you have to fall back suddenly, and don't have time to grab the syringes out of the water, or maybe there's a sudden drought, etc, or the generators go out and you can't check your sugars.

The way I see it, the more undead heads I kerb stomp, the quicker society pulls its shit together, gets the power back up, and pharmacies start dispensing again.

I don't care what anyone adds to this argument, but after reading half the shit in Enders Game, I just had the instinctive reaction that I was reading the fantasies of a homosexual set in space.

edit: (to whoever downvoted my comment, just read this)


Even when he heard them come into the bathroom he paid no attention. He was letting the water pour over his head, over his body; the muffled sound of footsteps was hardly noticeable. Maybe lunch was over, he thought. He started to soap himself again. Maybe somebody finished practice late.

And maybe not. He turned around, There were seven of them, leaning back against the metal sinks or standing closer to the showers, watching him. Bonzo stood in front of them, Many were smiling, the condescending leer of the hunter for his cornered victim. Bonzo was not smiling, however.

""Ho,"" Ender said,

Nobody answered.

So Ender turned off the shower even though there was still soap on him, and reached for his towel. It wasn't there. One of the boys was holding it. It was Bernard. All it would take for the picture to be complete was for Stilson and Peter to be there, too. They needed Peter's smile; they needed Stilson's obvious stupidity.

Ender recognized the towel as their opening point. Nothing would make him look weaker than to chase naked after the towel. That was what they wanted, to humiliate him, to break him down. He wasn't going to play. He refused to feel weak because he was wet and cold and unclothed. He stood strongly, facing them, his arms at his sides. He fastened his gaze on Bnnzo.

""Your move,"" Ender said,

""This is no game,"" said Bernard. ""We're tired of you, Ender. You graduate today. On ice.""

Ender did not look at Bernard. It was Bonzo who hungered for his death, even though he was silent. The others were along for the ride, daring themselves to see how far they might go. Bonzo knew how far he would go.

""Bonzo,"" Ender said softly. ""Your father would be proud of you.""

Bonzo stifiened.

""He would love to see you now, come to fight a naked boy in a shower, smaller than you, and you brought six friends. He would say, Oh, what honor.""

""Nobody came to fight you,"" said Bernard, ""We just came to talk you into playing fair with the games. Maybe lose a couple now and then.""

The others laughed, but Bonzo didn't laugh, and neither did Ender.

""Be proud, Bonito, pretty boy. You can go home and tell your father, Yes, I beat up Ender Wiggin, who was barely ten years old, and I was thirteen. And I had only six of my friends to help me, and somehow we managed to defeat him, even though he was naked and wet and alone -- Ender Wiggin is so dangerous and terrifying it was all we could do not to bring two hundred.""

""Shut your mouth, Wiggin,"" said one of the boys.

""We didn't come to hear the little bastard talk,"" said another.

""You shut up,"" said Bonzo. ""Shut up and stand out of the way."" He began to take off his uniform. ""Naked and wet and alone, Ender, so we're even. I can't help that I'm bigger than you. You're such a genius, you figure out how to handle me."" He turned to the others. ""Watch the door. Don't let anyone else in.""

The bathroom wasn't large, and plumbing fixtures protruded everywhere, It had been launched in one piece, as a low-orbit satellite, packed full of the water reclamation equipment; it was designed to have no wasted space. It was obvious what their tactics would have to be. Throw the other boy against fixtures until one of them does enough damage that he stops.

When Ender saw Bonzo's stance, his heart sank. Bonzo had also taken classes. And probably more recently than Ender. His reach was better, he was stronger, and he was full of hate. He would not be gentle. He will go for my head, thonght Ender. He will try above all to damage my brain. And if this fight is long, he's bound to win. His strength can control me. If I'm to walk away from here, I have to win quckly, and permanently. He could feel agan he sickening way that Stilson's bones had given way. But this time it will be my body that breaks, unless I can break him first.

2 jumps from spawn to resup cabinet, should land next to resup for 200 health.
Walk out to rollers and then keep walking to the tires.
1 jump from tires to the little fence or just beyond the fence to cross the first yard. 
1 left hand jump to land just on the point (if you do it right you can curve it around the point a bit, but not important).
Walk from left roller into second yard, 1 jump from right wall to choke. 

In all there are 3 notable jumps and you have your medic on you for 2  of those. 

As a medic, you would be healing no one but your roamer from the time you reach the rollers into second, as the demo should be far away now and so should your scouts and your pocket is escape planning. 

If no escape plan then you have to switch the heals between your soldiers and you should be aiming to get them both to mid at 250, with preference to your roamer because he'll be going away from you whilst you'll be on your pocket so he can get a little less of the heals on rollout. 

You need to have a look at some mid+ level rollouts to see if everyone is doing the right thing, a medic cannot be expected to give out proper buffs if everyone is not doing their thing. Check out fatmop or vanillatv or commft on youtube for high level games. ","1349050040"

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","So are you looking for jazz with symphonic orchestrations? Or orchestral music with jazz elements? The former I can help you with.

[Nelson Riddle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcZ1k4d02KA) did tonnes of work in the style I think you're asking about. He's one of the most influential jazz arrangers ever, so he's definitely worth checking out.

[Gil Evans](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFaK4q0pxcQ) is a bit less mainstream and a bit more awesome. His work with Miles was pretty ground breaking and still holds up today.

[The Birth of the Cool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWK2pLW0Rdc) has no strings but is a great mix of jazz and orchestrated horns. 

There are plenty of jazz albums with orchestrated strings dotted around the place. Charlie Parker released [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0rVXblI6g). It's pretty good. Charlie Haden &amp; Michael Brecker's [American Dreams](http://grooveshark.com/s/American+Dreams/3P8bS1?src=5) has moments of incredible beauty but I can only take so many ballads in a row.

And it's a bit harder to find, but the [soundtrack to Mickey One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrRUg4pvQns) featuring Stan Getz is one of my favourites in the genre.","1349050041"

:---|:---
Working for Mythbusters | [By and large Mythbusters is a super fun show to do. It's work to be sure. Like anything you want to do well, you've got to bust your ass to get it right, and it's tiring. Most tv shows have a few months off per year, we shoot MB 45 weeks a year on average. Add to that that I've got 13 year old twin boys and the weeks fill up fast. The other thing that makes it fun is our crew. We've all been working together for the better part of a decade and it's like family. We've all seen each other at our best and worst. They get just as excited about the science, the methodologies and the outcomes as we do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fku1e)
Expected Mythbusters popularity? | [Not at all. Our fame and the show's popularity grew really gradually. Which is nice because it's heady stuff sometimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flugd)
How long to film? | [We film an ep in about 9 days. The other team also takes just about that amount of time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fo7qp?context=3)
Keeping things from the show | [I've kept tons of stuff I made for the show. I get to make so many cool things. We just did one where I needed a water balloon but I needed it not to break when it got hit. So I sewed up a leather bag for it with a zipper. I used some kid leather that was Hermés orange and this thing is so gorgeous. The Hermés water balloon. That's the latest thing. I have a whole cabinet in my office at MB with my favorite stuff in it. I should do a tour of it for the show...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fkxst)
Fear for safety | [We've feared for our safety a lot. We are sensitive to when we start to feel spooked and seek to resolve the issue before it becomes an issue. I've been scared a bunch on the show. Underwater Car. Mythtanic. Hell, the first time we swam with sharks I thought I was going to have a heart attack.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flstb)
Working with Jamie | [Jamie and I have disagreements all the time, but none that threatened the show. On the big things (integrity of our brand, what we should do, how to proceed, money) we've remained shockingly aligned. As long as those things are in synch, everything else is relatively minor. That being said we drive each other batty every day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fld73)
Working with the Tested guys | [Will and Norm at Tested are amazing. They're the best partners for a web presence we could hope for. I love sitting in my shop on Mondays doing our video pieces. Our interests overlap so much the Venn diagram is simply a circle. We have more plans for cool stuff over there, but we're taking it slowly, methodically.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fl3x5)

Mythbuster Narrator | [His name is Rob Lee. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additional_MythBusters_cast_members#Robert_Lee He's a Canadian living in Australia narrating an American tv show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fnigz?context=3)
Using the Metric System | [We try, we do both sometimes. But we're both fully inculcated with the english system, sad to say. That's how we think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6flvak)
Who makes the signage? | [Eric Haven does the blueprint signage. He's one of our Associate Producers and an accomplished comic book artist. The main signage in the episodes is usually done by my cameraman Scott Sorensen or me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fldrs)
Wish you can make more shows! | [We make 23 some-odd per year, often 24. That's the most we can do and keep the quality (and our sanity). New ones start airing next week though!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fo1jw?context=3)
Next Mythbuster season? | [Starting next Sunday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fo3cn?context=3)
Episode in space? | [I would TOTALLY do an episode in space. I would LOVE to do that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fptwu?context=3)
Has any test been used in scientific studies? | [Yes indeed. Our episodes have been part of published papers about 6 times. The most recent one is the one in which we made a sewer and used a methane explosion to make manhole covers fly 150 feet into the air.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fpwcg?context=3)
Mythbuster behind-the-scenes crew | [Jamie and I shoot with Camera, Sound, Second camera (for high speeds etc) and director. We're supported by 3 Associate producers (location booking, permits, expert finding, esoteric item ordering, signage and everything else). We have a production manager (of course) and her team. Runners, Production assistants. K, G &amp;T also have the same. Entire San Francisco crew is about 25-26 people total for both teams. It's a terrific crew. Many have been with us for 6-7 years. Turnover is very low.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6frte9?context=3)
Do you have a group of people to consult? | [We consult with a ton of people. We have a bunch of regulars that we consult, but we also reach out as far as we need to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fvagt?context=3)
Any pressure to not air an episode because it might help criminals? Like the ""Beating the Breathalyzer""? | [Nope, it's all there. We're not in the business of helping people commit crimes, we certainly obscure certain pieces of info sometimes. But the breathalyzer is all there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10psj3/i_am_adam_savage_cohost_of_mythbusters_ama/c6fvbi6?context=3)

Many of them are assholes because they were raised by union steelworkers who believe things should be handed to them. (The steel union's inflexibility was one of the biggest factors in the collapse of the US steel industry.) So these kids grow up being taught a sense of entitlement and immunity from scrutiny and turn out to be assholes in general.

Then the super bowl rings happened and all the people who had no team allegiance or were fans of teams doing poorly quickly jumped on the Pittsburgh bandwagon.

And all throughout the land, all we heard was, ""Six rings! Six rings! Six rings!"" And every non-Steeler fan wanted to punt the fake Steelers fans in their nutsacks for being elitist jerks. And the steelers fans never shut up, and they still think Super Bowl XL was a legitimate win, and they still don't think Polamalu is a dirty player, and they still think Hines Ward is an upright citizen, and they still don't think Big Ben is a rapist, and they still think they are best team in the league despite being 1-2 after losing to the FUCKING OAKLAND RAIDERS.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Because people have hormones and emotions and can be immature when it comes to sexuality. Marriage offered stability because you know you are being cared for by someone who would not want to hurt you and things like that. In theory. Remember people used to get married at 14, 15 years old even a hundred years ago. 

Marriage doesn't prevent/solve any intrinsic problems with either partner, though. Plus there are a ton of other factors that come into play about society (in the past and now) that helped to keep communities together because of marriage contracts. 

The way I see it, don't look at the church's reasons why you must wait for marriage. Instead, look at the overall results of an object and determine *what* and *why* the cause (marriage as a ""necessity"" before engaging in sexual acts) is necessary for its effects (many and debateable). I'm saying be objective and think a bit for yourself, but remember you're studying people with emotions that are often times unreasonable and easily manipulated with negative things like fear and isolation for a so-called ""greater good"", in this case being God.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt;So you've inquired about a job as a migrant worker picking strawberries from dusk to dawn and been rejected then? 

A job is a job which was my point, and if farmers hire illegal immigrants because they take lower wages they are robbing from the citizens. 

**From your source** :""Mexican flows are key to the immigration debate because 58% of the 11.2 million immigrants here illegally are Mexican. Just over half of all Mexican immigrants in the USA are here illegally.""

So 5.6 million people in a country that is short on jobs and you're gonna talk to me like they all pick strawberries on a field all day? 

&gt;Agriculture, Forestry, fishing, hunting* = 3.8%- illegals 

*Notice how they HAVE to lump agriculture with other jobs to make this statistic seem important.

&gt;Construction = 21.2%

&gt;Manufacturing = 13.4 &amp;

&gt;Wholesale &amp; Retail = 11.5%

&gt;Professional &amp; business services =13.3%

&gt;Leisure and Hospitality= 16.7%

And these numbers are from a group specifically dedicated to Hispanics they even call illegal immigrants ""Unauthorized immigrants"". 
http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/appendix-b-additional-tables/

So go talk to all those American born construction workers and tell them how they're not getting fucked, all those unemployed Americans that apparently just wouldn't ""pick up strawberries"" all day. And remember to pull your head out of your ass.","1349050079"

"TELOS","t5_2u6b3","Confucius is trying to say that if we place our emotions in harmony humans can be virtuous and understanding of each other. It is so easy to display anger than to suppress it and look for the good. We had to read Columbine, a book documenting the school shooting, for our senior year. I learned that yes they were crazy for believing in such radical ideas, but those kids were in difficult situations such as failing classes and lacking parental guidance. You are correct in saying that instant emotions control one’s judgment, but one’s judgment can be flawed due to the environment. I think harmony of our emotions is possible and we can live in peace by encouraging these values in our society. Peace and happiness may seem easy for one to achieve but for one whole society is unlikely. Like we discussed in class, “realist” optimism, I believe, is the key to reaching harmony. ","1349050084"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","In the case of internet trolls, we probably have something less than psychopathy happening most of the time.  The desire to lash back is strong, and -- when the Devil's Advocate is running naked through my mind -- I almost see it as an opportunity to learn about ""turning the other cheek.""

The worst thing that can happen to a troll on Reddit is to see a big 1 next to his/her comment for all time.  Downvoting to a point spares people from having to see it, but it gives the troll something desired.  I guess it's nice that they can have that kind of fun, but zero feedback serves to bore them away.  Don't feed the trolls, yada yada.

But it occurs to me that meeting each troll with unreserved kindness might even work better.  It serves all of us in the end if we feel the compassion we've exhibited and they have nothing to rail against but how *supportive* we are.  The most obviously non-sarcastic, non-reactionary, friendly response might be just what is needed.

Obviously that's a real challenge and I'm being naïve about a huge percentage of the cases.  We can't stop each other from getting mad, and I certainly don't get mad if someone insults Christianity or the people of the faith.  I get mad when someone is simply looking for support in dark times and has to put up with obvious intent to hurt feelings.

My solution right now is to give the mods as much work as they can take.  From now on when I'm Redditing I'm singling out the requests for prayer and/or guidance and hitting that report button as often and as hard as I can.  I've seriously considered approaching the mods with time slots I know I can cover and a promise to use only the power to just nix the trash as it comes in, and treat it like a job.  I just know I'm not qualified to make ordinary judgement calls about the rest.","1349050091"

1) It's human nature to feel this way. People love the ""us vs. them"" struggles and like to feel like amazing little snowflakes because that's what's made good story and inspiration in the past.

If you see someone that's popular that you don't like nor understand, it's because you're that beautiful little snowflake that has this wisdom that no one else possesses, or if someone else possesses, are part of some sort of oppressed elite that the rest of the world is too stupid to understand. Us (the Redditors) are so glorious in our intelligence that we can see that these plebian sheeple (them) that love these pop artists and shows are beneath us, yet are so great in their numbers that it is up to us few fans of ""great"" art to fight for our art that really isn't even ours.

"history","t5_2qh53","&gt;I disagree. The size of an empire directly correlates to it's influence in the world, and ususally to its development, if you are the Persian Empire that you mention, you would have better science, techonolgy, and art if you were in contact with physicians from Egypt, philosophers from Greece, mathematicians from India, coin makers from Lydia, shipbuilders from Phoenicia, that if they had just stayed in modern day Iran.

Ridiculous! You can stay in contact with people without absorbing them into your empire! The Chinese were extremely influential in the world, but they were just an insular society and preferred to do business with other nations from behind a wall of safety rather than going out and absorbing them. If they had the same mindset as Alexander, they could certainly have taken most of the world, but they had no desire to!

&gt;But if you compare the Mali Empire to the Spanish one, who do you compare the Holy Roman Empire to? Or XIV century Venice? There was freaking civilization in Africa, I've said so myself, stop saying it like it's an argument, but on the bigger scale of things, the contintents as a whole cannot be placed on the same level of development, not by long shot. Europe didn't have wandering groups in the 1700s for Christ sake's.

Well, again those are post-renaissance empires. Also, Europe didn't have wandering groups in the 1700s because Europe is small as shit compared to nearly everywhere else in the world.

&gt;Of course it does. Brilliant and fascinating civilization. But does it represent the whole continent? Or half of it? Or 10% of the land mass of the continent? And did it not fade in importance as an independent African nation when it was conquered by the Persians 2600 years ago?

It doesn't represent the land mass of that continent because Africa is MASSIVE! Europe is a tiny speck comparatively, so representing the land mass of that region would be much less difficult.

&gt;Because why not? I'm talking about the history of a continent, if you want to force the discussion to an specific aspect of said history of said continent, against another one, and in an specific time lapse go do that with someone else.

Because we are all in agreement that European powers prevailed after the Renaissance. The main discussion is why there were no great African powers, and I'm trying to point out that before European supremacy in the globe, African civilizations and empires were indeed advanced and progressive compared to their contemporary European counterparts or otherwise known as ""great powers"". Make sense?

We also have no evidence for a worldwide flood a few thousand years ago, so science and religion are viewed as incompatible there, too. Many also discount religion because of evolution.

Not only do people use these as justification for science and religion being incompatible, but that science (as viewed by many) works toward a conclusion using means of collecting data used as evidence and observing or inferring from that evidence what happened. Religion, on the other hand, is viewed by some as starting from a conclusion and working to try to explain what happened using myths and legends. Some others view religion as a means to fill some of the small gaps that science explains but ordinary people don't understand.


Many, however, think that religion is a good way to explain supposedly supernatural happenings on our planet, such as thing deemed miraculous. ","1349050106"

Recovering from depression is a slow process, and most of the time having a good friend to talk to makes the world of a difference. That's what you need to be to ex-boyfriend now. 

Do not let this interfere with your current relationship. Tell boyfriend that you're talking to ex-boyfriend, and discuss the nature of these conversations. Don't lie to him. If you want your current relationship to work, you have to continue to nurture it. Boyfriend should know that he is still #1 in your life.

Be honest with yourself though. I know you probably miss ex-boyfriend, but understand that it might be a temporary feeling.","1349050113"

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","they can, but having a reliable and even redundant supply route between israel and iran's boarder is an important logistic for any conflict. 

an arab country allowing israel to fly over to attack another arab country won't make them any new friends in the arab world.  there was a time when turkey might have allowed israel planes ""unofficially"" safe passage and taking the political fallout from other arabs later, but since the Gaza flotilla incident of 2010, there is little chance of that happening any time soon.  my guess is israel would ""unofficially"" use saudia arabia airspace, since iran knows the second they do anything to threaten saudia arabia, that will bring america into the conflict in force almost within hours.  when i say ""unofficial"" i mean that israel alerts the country prior to fly over, the planes avoid major population centers, the country flown over tracks the planes, but does not challenge target or fly near them.  so azerbaijan is a place for the planes to land after the flyover country publicly protests the flyover - that way they save face, but isreal can't fly back as easily, it's like a one way trip, so israel would then need a safe defensible place to park their planes till they can arrange for their return to israel.","1349050120"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; The downside to this maybe that it it's hard to blow something up to prove evolution.

1. Build two big boxes, covered in mosquito net.
1. Fill the boxes with flies, or similar insects that reproduce rapidly and aren't subject to ethics committees. 
1. Provide food &amp; water for the flies, so that they can survive and reproduce within the box.
1. Also provide a very small amount of C4 in one box (in relation to the size of the box) such that blast won't break the box. The other box is the control.
1. Every generation or so, detonate the C4, and replace with new C4.
1. After many generations, natural selection should favour flies which avoid C4.
1. After a suitable number of generations has passed, put C4 in both boxes; count the number of flies which land on the C4 in the test and control populations.
1. Perform appropriate statistical calculations.
1. ???
1. Deliver results.

The biggest technical problem with this is sizing the boxes &amp; C4 to optimise the casualty rate amongst the flies to produce rapid evolution, without excessive risk of killing all the flies or causing them to escape due to the box taking blast damage.

The obvious practical problem would be that the rig would need to stay on the bomb range for ages, and so it would be expensive compared with other options. ","1349050120"

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","I am saying that you don't have to shut up. Feel free to keep posting. You are welcome to downvote if you are offended. 

The moderation system is not in any way going to hinder you at all! We encourage you to keep posting. :) 

I was only saying that you shouldn't downvote if you just disagree about something that is on topic. 

The moderators cannot direct the campaign for how the OP should go about her activism for equality, and if she is going against her own point that is not something that this sub reddit is promoting, we are just allowing open discussion for the user base. 

You are absolutely allowed to downvote her. There will always be people that disagree with you, or your views. I am not one of those people, but I am in a position where I have to protect both sides. There is no government here. There is no propagation. Just do what you think is right. 

If the OP wants to be countering her own point then that is her deal, and not affiliated with this subreddit. 

If you want to make a difference then I advise starting a catalyst for change. Propose ideas to help the community make more of an impression. Continue posting your thoughts. We are trying to support you and your efforts, but both sides must be heard. 

You are welcome to post what you want, and so is the OP. 

I hope that helped. Feel free to PM if you want to talk extensively about this, or any ideas you have. ","1349050121"

While it is true that concentrate goes through processing to add water and whatever else the they want to add...stuff that is not from concentrate also sometimes get things added to it as well.

The basis is that, in general, it's just the water was removed at one point...and then re-added. Course how much more or less water was added after may not necessarily be the same.

I guess one way to look at it possibly is...if you just not consider the taste. Grapes and raisins. Pretend you could put water back into the raisins easily and you get grapes again. That's from concentrate.

If I were to give you the grape right away, that's ""not from concentrate"".","1349050122"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I've had mine for a little over two years at this point.  Definitely the least painful piercing I've ever had done, to the point where I didn't even realize I was pierced at first.  They usually will put a clamp thing on your tongue to hold it still and get correct placement, and that's the only slight discomfort I had getting the piercing actually done.  I had a lisp for about two days after, but that quickly went away when the swelling went down.  The rumor about the nerve thing is just a complete myth, it really has the same risks as pretty much every other oral piercing.  And in terms of your teeth, unless you bite on it or play with it a lot it really doesn't hurt your teeth at all.  I think its more about correct placement then the actual size of your mouth.  I have a small mouth, and although at first it was uncomfortable because they initially put in a longer bar to compensate for swelling, once I moved down to the shorter bar its fits completely comfortably in my mouth.

Its also not obvious; people don't notice it unless I actually stick my tongue out, so your parents might not even notice at all.  So I wouldn't worry too much about people judging you, because it's kinda up to you whether you want them to see it or not.  ","1349050122"

I'm about 120kg (~260lb) so this is sort of a minimal dose I am taking. One of the things I have learnt is that you should be taking a multivitamin as well because that will give your body what it needs to process the tyrosine.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","The reasons I got married were, in all honesty, because I knew if shit hit the fan that he would be there for me. He was successful, relatively happy, and I knew he could take care of me if that was something I needed. I do love him, but I know now that love does NOT mean you should get married. It is not what holds people together. Perseverance, communication, honesty, and working at it together, is what keeps a relationship going. 
So, yeah, I didn't marry for love. I married for security. He knows that, it is no secret. I married him because I knew no matter what he would be right there by my side through anything. THAT is what keeps a relationship together. 

So, I think the question will always be there until you're old enough to realize (I'm 31, was in my first 10 year long relationship at 14)... that what you have done isn't settling. It's just, in plainer terms, what you need. That simple. I hope that made sense. ","1349050123"

As for money, just starting out is really difficult for everyone. The way I handle it is both my boyfriend and I combine our income in his account for bills. When those are paid, we split what's left in half and I take half into my account. He can do whatever with his money without asking me, and I can do whatever I want with mine. I usually save mine, but it's getting harder to save the closer we get to the holidays.

I agree with you that were he to sell the guitar you two should split the money, even if the guitar is his. However, this isn't an issue you should let get between the two of you. Just make sure the possession isn't a one-way street. If he gets to have things as only his, then so do you.","1349050126"

Archaeology is essentially systematic destruction. While science can recreate experiments, we have one shot at learning as much as we can - as the act of doing our work (excavating) destroys context. Without context, archaeology is useless.

Work is writing intensive, and extremely thorough. Most envision blasting away with pickaxes, but I'd spend most of the day taking notes, photographs, and measurements.

Only about 40% of the work is done in the field, with the rest of my time being spent cleaning, processing, preserving etc...finds and other data sources. Specialization on site is hard to find - most, for sake of convenience, are the jack of all trades and master of none. We were fortunate enough to have local Bedouin help us this excavation season, but even with the added labourers we did not finish on schedule.

Archaeology does not pay well. In this years two month season, as a field technician (""shovelbum"") I didn't make much more than $14 an hour. Many do it for free. I've been lucky enough to be sponsered by ASOR, the American School's of Oriental Research. My flights were *not* covered, but food and lodging was. Many students who participate get scholarships and fellowships from other groups. Specialist positions, such as ceramicists, illustrators or field administrators, often work separate jobs at museums and receive a honorarium for work done on site.

Stay away from bad neighborhoods, don't go around alone in the middle of the night and stuff like that. 

Where you'll be staying there is also important since it's better to go out closer to where you are (I presume you won't have someone to drive you around and taxis are VERY expensive).

If you think it's just a fad she's going through, then it's safe to look elsewhere. But if you think she'll still be doing yoga five years from now, then chances are she'd still be able to wear the lululemon you got her today.

Weak damage? She has perhaps the best poke of any support...dealing a maximum base of 575 damage at level 5, plus good ap scaling, which is important since most nid supports build ap.  Useless ult? Well, yes and no, she may not have some crazy cc ult but you have to remember that characters are built with entire movesets in mind, you cant just compare one champs single skill to another and conclude one of them is useless, you must look at them holistically.  Also, her ult gives her access to 3 new abilities, something those other champs can't say. Plus, she has great utility with her traps.  She might not work with all champs or all comps, but no champ does, and to say that she is useless because of that is illogical. ","1349050175"

What struck me about it was that only the plant in the container of this strain (2 other identical clones were planted in the ground) is having this problem and it IS noticeable in the size of the buds between them.

So far we have treated with Nitrogen and Calmag on two separate occasions and the problem seems to be progressing.

the runoff PH is 6.8 and tested on multiple occasions after watering.

The shot of the entire plant may not be clear enough but essentially this seems to be happening on the lower and middle leaves and upon closer inspection seems to be mostly the lower fan leaves on each branch.

Any advice would be welcome

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I could tell you the FPS of my game while playing it; I've gotten used to distinguishing between completely smooth &gt;60 frames and the almost imperceptibly choppy 45. I can't stand it for the faster paced games like BF3, especially when I'm playing in matches. 

When I installed my SSD, I saw my frames jump from 50 average (SD 10) to 70 average (SD 5). My infantry-based scores immediately jumped as I started to win the snap engagements. In close quarters, the guy who lands the first shot will end up winning 80% of the time; that's the difference between the ability to flank an entire squad or straight out dying when moving up. Note that this information was determined with render.drawfps, which reports FPS in realtime.

I will blame my tools if I know what the framerate is and how that affects the way I play the game.

There's also no reason the Doctor can't be lied to. River Song put that chapter heading in a book because she knows it's in the book. It doesn't necessarily make it so. The only evidence we have that this is their last meeting is because the book says so.

If 1938 is blocked off, go to 1937 and hang out for a year or so. Or 1939. Or 1972, or... How far is this 'nogo zone' for New York 1938 extending, temporally or spatially? Also, try popping back to 1937, reserving a couple of train tickets to California for 1938 under the name of 'Williams', and meeting up with them a year later far, far away from New York. 

Don't forget to pop back a few years from the present and make a fake tombstone also. The writing changes on it when Amy chooses to follow Rory, sure, but it could have changed simply because the lie got bigger.

I realise Moffat's trying to give the two of them a permanent farewell, and for the most part it works. But if they don't end up showing up in the 50th anniversary specials, I'll buy a hat and eat it. After all, look at Rose, trapped forever in a place where the Doctor could never get to her.

"healthcare","t5_2qkih","What? Shamans? The doctors I know work the longest hours of anyone else I know in any other profession for the longest amount of years (and yes, my dad is an engineer), and during their residency earn less than starting out teachers! and that's for 2-7 years, after they just finished being poor college kids for 8 years. They then go home and study more hours to keep up on the latest research and studies to keep up their skills to ensure they are doing the best practice they possibly can. It is a gruelling job and those high dollars, they don't start earning till they're in their 30's if the person had no delays and a short residency (not common) and need the high money to save enough for retirement and pay their MASSIVE crushing student loan debt. It's the most underappreciated job and you couldn't pay me to do it! 

But also I think a large percentage said they would quit because so so many work far past retirement age, into their 70's and later because if they quit there would be no one to replace them and they feel this intense obligation to their patients. 

Medicine is far from moving towards a checklist, it may seem like it to you, but this would be similar to saying building a bridge can be done from a checklist and done by someone with less education than you, an engineer. Which of course you know is something that would be dangerous and a horrible idea. I personally have been misdiagnosed several times by Physicians Assistants and only when I saw a M.D. was I correctly diagnosed, and while there are instances where lower educated people would be appropriate, it is certainly far from always the case.

I hate minmaxing and metagaming, but I guess I'm just used to players pushing the boundaries and trying to optimize in any way possible.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The problem people have with the Mormon faith is the same problem they have with every other religious faith. It is all a delusion. To tie my comment in with the pictures presented by the OP, no one (literally zero people) knows what happens after we die except for that which can be observed by science. The only reason Mormonism would make sense to you is because it is the religion you grew up with and were indoctrinated into by your parents. Many currently atheist individuals all have had the same experience, but they know that just because a religion may be comparitively comforting to you, doesn't make it true. No deistic religion makes sense as they all operate on the premise that ""We don't know (or didn't know) how or why X or Y works or is, so the answer must most definately and undeniable be that God is responsible."" There is no way around it. This is coming from a former Christian who went through years of confirmation (essentially bible study) classes during the week with sermon attendance on relevant days of the week. The more an educated individual learns about their own religion, the more they see that it is indeed just hogwash.

Not to sound patronising, but I am also curious as to what sort of Mormon hogwash makes sense to you and whether or not that could not possibly be found in any of the other thousands of religions that have and do exist in this world. 

It's not that it's difficult for outsiders to understand, it's that it's difficult for insiders to understand because they have put a road-block infront of their path to understanding with a giant ""faith"" inscribed boulder.","1349050200"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; real life (as it tends to) seemed to keep getting in the way

Mine too. =)  And everyone else's also.

&gt; I'll admit to not being as well versed on...the traditional Christian perspective of heaven.

Many ""traditional"" Christians are also not well-versed on it.  I frankly don't care what the 'average, typical"" Christian believes.  Wide is the path that leads to destruction, after all.

&gt; The LDS church pretty clearly sticks to the idea that salvation is intertwined with God's desire for us his children to be happy. Our idea of the lifecycle of our spirits (if you will) is often called the plan of salvation or the plan of happiness.

Good stuff.  Our plan centers on God himself and us knowing him, rather than us as individuals facing a kind of ""objective"" plan that exists apart from God, which he directs us along.  In other words, for us, God himself IS the plan.  He didn't follow a path himself.  He ""is"" the Path -- the Way, the Truth, and the Life, in other words.

&gt; I've had many Christians tell me that God created mankind to glorify him and that heaven is to sing God's praises through the eternities to further his glory (Forgive me if this is incorrect).... The LDS idea of God is that God doesn't need our glory.

Actually, we don't think he ""needs"" our glory at all.  That's a huge misunderstanding.  ""Glory"" just means God's ""radiated identity"" or ""creation's knowledge of him.""  The more we know him and become like him, the happier we are and the more all of creation experiences him the way he truly is.

We're like mirrors who experience pleasure in reflecting God and seeing him reflected from others to us.  God delights in our joy, but he doesn't need it reflected, as he radiates his own identity enough for every purpose he has ever had or ever will have.

&gt; we believe that his reason for creating us is love for us as his children. It is literally like a loving father here on earth. Your father is not going to say, ""I want what's best for you, but I don't ever want you to move out and have a family of your own or your own life.""

We believe this more metaphorically.  We don't think God begot us as spiritual children the way LDS does, nor that he intends for us to progress into godhood and beget our own spiritual children.  We believe God is such an infinite embodiment of love, goodness, truth, etc. that knowing him and becoming like him are final ends in and of themselves.  And we believe all other scriptural imagery centers around this.

&gt; God wants us to progress and experience all the greatness, love, and potential that he can give us. We don't believe that we will ever surpass God, but as we learn and grow in compassion and knowledge we can become more like him.

Agreed, word for word.  Even if the definitions are different. =)

&gt; Whether that means we will have our own children and be gods is something that is up for debate and subject to interpretation even within the LDS church.

Who told you this?  This is not what I understand at all, and goes flatly against the teachings of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and the core teachings of the LDS church itself.  

That doesn't mean it's wrong, not at all.  But I would be cautious.  Often, religious groups can compromise their core teachings to be ""sensitive"" (aka politically correct) to the culture of the time, and this may have happened for you.  Do your own independent research and see what you come up with on this topic.  Don't be afraid to boldly honor the teachings of your faith.

&gt; I don't know whether or not this answered your question

You totally did!  I just wanted to hear from you personally!  To me, this is more about *YOU* than it is about the LDS church at large.  Everyone has their own story and their own way of experiencing their group identity.

&gt; it's a difficult thing to convey with due gravity.

Understood and respected.  I do not intend to ridicule your experience/understanding, just as you are clearly not intending to ridicule mine.  We're safe talking about this.

&gt; while I try to stick with what is actually considered church doctrine I'm not perfect.

I think we can earnestly say this is true for all of us.  But we'll both continue vigorously continuing along our individual paths to maintain full honesty with ourselves.","1349050202"

Others involve designing transistors to capture electrons in certain circumstances, and thus maintain a certain charge (which will get the value of 1). This can be erased by applying the opposite kind of charge.

Finally, many types of memory rely on something in the computer interacting with the physical characteristics of an object (for example, a laser interacting with the pits on a CD or DVD), and interpreting the change in response as either a 1 or a 0 (for example, how much time it takes the reflection of the laser to return to a sensor).","1349050206"

***EDIT: TL;DR: History nerd goes on a tirade about Byzantine Empire and why it should be referred to as the Roman Empire.***

*I would argue that they didn't just think of themselves as Romans, they were Romans. Calling them the Byzantine Empire was a modern day development used, at least partially, to help undermine the idea that they were of similar stature to the height of the empire under the 5 good emperors. They spoke Latin (at least up until Justinian, anyway); encouraged the teachings of art, philosophy, and law; were viewed as Romans by the rest of the West (so much so that during the schism the Papacy thought that they could limit their clout by establishing the title of Holy Roman Emperor with Charlemagne); and maintained many of the traditions of the Empire. Sure many of the older things were lost; Latin was eventually abandoned, Triumphs and other traditions eventually fell to the wayside, Emperors lineage eventually diverged from the Roman blood lines they once claimed, and the military structures changed over time, but could this not be said for every great kingdom, nation, or Empire? Surely we don't look at the British Empire under Victoria as a totally different nation than the English Kingdom of Edward the Confessor (the argument could be made that they are, but I'm more concentrating on the court of public opinion), even though the differences between them were probably just as great as between Julius and Irene. Nations change, they diverge, the ruling families shift; surely the United States of 500 years (I'm fairly confident the US will still be some sort of entity) will look nothing like the US of 1810; heck the US of today looks nothing like the US of 1810.* 

*We've begun looking at the Empire during its Constantinople days as a lesser age than under it's Rome days, but I believe that's neither true nor fair. Sure the borders may have stretched a bit farther North during the 5 good Emperors, but aside from that the Empire was just as brilliant. Trade flourished; Constantinople was the envy of all, from Persia in the East to the Normans in the West; art and architecture flourished, and thanks (ironically) for the 4th Crusade some of the greatest works survived the iconoclasts that swept through the Empire later on; their law system (established under the famous Justinian) became the foundations for codes of law throughout the West, and, in my opinion, far surpassed that of the first half of the Empire; and of course the Capital of the Empire remained the religious center of the church, at least up until the schism that split the Church. In my view the Roman Empire did not die with a whimper under Romulus Augustulus, but with a mighty roar of defiance from Constantine (XI) Palaeologus 2,000 years after that glistening city was first established on the Tiber.*","1349050208"

If I were to talk to your friend now, I would talk to him about spirituality vs religion. And all the possibilities for things that I would not call a god. I worship Om, or Aum, it is simply the sound of the universe while meditating. I worship the multiverses. I recognize that the world we perceive is a holographic image/world created by the mind. I have morals, I do not steal from individuals, I do not intentionally harm other living beings. I recognize the 'light' in others.

Also - hound r/buildapcsales like a madman. If you see something you want then pick it up.

The i3 suggestion is spot-on if those are the games you'll be playing. You'd only be better off with a quad core if you use CPU intensive applications/games. Even though the 965 is a good processor and fairly on-par with the i3s, the upgrade path is better (so far) with an H77 board.

After looking at your build, however, I see a couple things that can be tweaked.

* 1) You don't need an SSD, and I'm guessing since you already have a mechanical HD (as one isn't listed), just use that. An SSD is beneficial for load/save/boot times, and won't really enhance your gaming experience. It's nicety and not a necessity - especially for builds on a budget. You're better off allocating that $100 towards your CPU/GPU. With that done, you can pick up an i5-3450 and an AMD 7950.

* Corsair's Builder series has gotten a bad rep for being unreliable, DOA, and noisy. They're not terrible, but why grab it when you can pick up a better (or possibly even modular) PSU for the price? Look at Corsair's TX **V2** series or better, SeaSonic, XFX, OCZ, and Antec.","1349050217"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Extremely unlikely. As far as I know, there are no languages being spoken today which were spoken 10,000 years ago.

However, things are different now. We now have recordings of how people speak. This is a very recent development, comparatively speaking - we've been able to record speech for less than 150 years, compared to millennia of writing. So, it's possible that language will change less, or more slowly, because we have these common recordings to keep language from changing too much. 

On the other hand, the BBC's Received Pronunciation was the gold standard of English pronunciation for decades, but it is now losing ground to Estuary English. So, maybe recorded language does *not* ""freeze"" the vernacular.

But retirement income is fundamentally different than 'working years' income, in that you (should) only pull out as much as you spend. Using me as an example, I now I make what I make, but 25% is going into retirement, and another 10% or so into savings. I won't need to save for retirement in retirement, and plenty of other expenses (mortgage) will be gone or reduced.

So I might be able to pull out $200k a year, but I'd really need to *spend* $200k a year to require that. And that's on top of all other earnings (Social Security) which I would use first. So you'd pretty much need to be living on a mansion on a beach, and own at yacht or two to really spend that each year :)","1349050222"

It tasted very nice. The the blue part tasted as expected – like a bleu cheese. But as I was eating it I noticed the smell of ammonia coming from the plate.

I read that ammonia can appear when the cheese is beyond ripe. I guess I am wondering, if this cheese can, or should, still be eaten.

I am also wondering if the blue part is supposed to be there. And if it is okay to eat that.

When looking at the last character in a string using the charAt method, the index will actually be the length of the string minus one.

So, in your code above, you would want

    char Letter = A.charAt(i-1);

Actually, you'd be better off with 

     int i= len - 1;

And then 

    char Letter = A.charAt(i);

Now, your assignment requires that you use a for loop, so here's another hint. When you are using a for loop, you'll want to start with the length minus one and count down to 0.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","&gt;I learned that if you're not really in a relationship, there's no need to have a breakup. No one is entitled to anyone else's time and attention, especially in the early days of casual dating.

I may be entirely inexperienced in dating and what actually happens in practice... but looking from the outside in this is what I think. It could also be that being male affects my viewpoint.

It seems to me that **both people have taken time** out of their lives to make time for the other, even if just for one date. Both people are looking for someone to become emotionally connected to, and first impressions weren't terrible if the date happened at all; so both people are taking the chance that the other might be someone they could fall in love with.

If person A wasn't an obvious asshole/creeper, just someone person B didn't happen to hit it off with, then yes, I do think the uninterested party owes person A the half a minute it might take to tell them they're not interested. Person B might be disenchanted, but on the chance person A isn't, ignoring them is rather mean. Person B ignoring person A as if he did not commit any time to her is disrespectful, it's... it's like she refuses to acknowledge that person A ever might have thought of her romantically, and refuses to acknowledge that she herself ever entertained the idea of being with person A; like she created a fantasy world where they've never met person A and she affords him as much respect.

I doubt most men would have let it get to them, but in all honesty, just ignoring someone in that situation is immature and rude, spineless and belittling... And in doing so person B has robbed person A of learning from the experience, rendering the entire affair a hurtful waste of time.","1349050244"

(Think of it as if you gave milk to a lactose intolerant person, you know they wouldn't accept, but they still have the choice to really do it.) 

When God calls out to them in the Garden, I'm not sure why exactly, but my theory is he may be giving them the opportunity to confess their sins. When he says ""What is this you have done?"" I feel it may be similar to an earthly father asking his son what he did when there is crayon drawings on the wall.

Yes and no; the TOC rune is getting hit (which according to his profile he doesn't even use), but vault in general is actually getting a buff in that it will now act as a jailbreak (making it easier to drop SS from your bar).

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;after the polio outbreak among un-vaccinated kids in Scotland, 

Hmm... you mean this one?

&gt;There have been no cases of indigenous wild type polio in the UK for over 15 years now. The last notification of polio in Scotland was in 1994, and was vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, rather than derived from wild type virus. **The patient had been in close contact with a recent recipient of oral polio vaccine.**

http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/immvax/poliomyelitis.aspx

Oh wait, you can't have meant that one because the **vaccination caused it**!

&gt;The 1999 European guidelines banned the use of bovine materials in the manufacture of injectable medicinal products in countries where there were known cases of BSE.

&gt;**The MCA said Medeva's assurances that no such materials were used in the process had proved inaccurate.**

&gt;Calf foetuses from the UK were used to make the vaccine, and while officials insist the vCJD risk to patients is ""incalculably small"", it is recalling all remaining stocks as a precaution.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/981716.stm

The second reason is that now there is a fairly comprehensive source for why it is all nonsense (at least in Canada), so if anyone tries to use any of this again, the Court/lawyers can just point to this decision.

Plus, as noted in the judgment, while the words etc. used are nonsense, that doesn't mean there isn't a real issue beneath them (in this specific case, a divorce settlement), and the Court should at least try to examine it.","1349050258"

"cfs","t5_2r4lw","You seem pretty similar to me in terms of your CFS. I had mono too, and I am also a university student. Most experts believe that CFS is many different conditions, so when taking advice, make sure their symptoms are similar to your own.

'Pacing' seems to be the most effective treatment for mono-induced CFS.

It sounds like you can still do a fair amount of activity without becoming housebound. If I were you, I wouldn't give up too much. You feel tired and that sucks, but it wont get any better by resting. One of the defining symptoms of CFS is fatigue that doesn't improve with rest.

I read in your last post that you sometimes have trouble sleeping. Try melatonin, I find the slow release ones work best. A normal sleeping schedule is in my opinion one of the most important things you can do to manage your fatigue. Also, I find that going for a walk in the morning (~30 mins after waking up) can help. Also, when you wake up, get up out of bed, have breakfast and a shower. Try to avoid caffeine, even tea! I find I am much more sensitive to caffeine these days. Also, avoid naps if you can! They can really screw up your sleeping pattern.

I really messed myself up by doing the wrong things when I first got sick. I kept trying to do too much when I felt okay, and then just lay around on the couch all day when I was feeling too tired to do anything. I tried to keep up rowing and netball (oops!!). My advice is to not give up too much. I ended up housebound for several years because I cut out too much, and only now (over 5 years!) am I finally resistant enough to go back to University.

I've found the most important thing with pacing is to do the same amount of activity each day. Saving up energy for the weekend or a special event does not work! It just adds to the horrible cycle of boom and bust.

Try to eat at the same time every day. Low GI foods are the best. Try to avoid sugar and processed foods if you can.

Do some exercise, I found that walking, weight lifting and yoga/pilates have been the best for me. Pretty much any low impact, slow exercise.

Something no one ever told me is that you will always feel tired. There is always a 'baseline' of tiredness. You have to learn to recognise different levels of fatigue. 

When you get a cold, flu, infection or other illness, rest up. But learn to recognize when that has passed, so you can get back to your routine.

Don't cut out too much. A week or two is not long enough for your body to adjust. I usually give new treatments ~3 months before I decide to cut or keep them. It's a lot harder to add things to your life when you have CFS than it is to never give them up.

TLDR; Don't cut out, just make sure your days are virtually the same. Eat well, sleep well.","1349050259"

Already you're showing your bias; there's nothing to indicate that homosexuality is harmful or a choice--despite its ability to make certain people feel ""icky"".

No, the child would perceive forced therapy by their parents to be a *discouragement* though, no doubt.  For one, the treatment is shown to have little or no efficacy while causing a lot of harm.  And second, it takes a neutral position on homosexuality.  It doesn't encourage nor discourage it.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Glucose is what is commonly used in your body for energy. Your liver either has it processed to be used by your cells via Insulin(this lowers your glucose levels), or it is forced out via a hormone called Glucagon (this allows cells to consume free floating glucose in your blood stream). Your muscles will always have it's own,independent, source of glucose that will *never* be used by any other force inside the body. However that is for short term use, the muscles in your body while at rest, will consume fat, assuming you keep using your muscles, and then resting. As far as excess calories go, everything is either pretty much turned into the three macronutrients, Protein, Carbs, Fat. Protein can be turned in glucose, but this isn't beneficial because it is usually broken down from muscle first and goes through a series of reactions to become energy, by which your body has almost broken even just to create that energy. Carbs are useful because it will support much of your body (brain, organs, muscle tissue), but excess usage will be turned into fat. Your fat container can hold up to IIRC 200x the amount it's given. It is highly efficient in this area. Muscle can be used as energy, but it is never explicitly stored as such. Either items are excreted or stored for later usage. Muscle requires energy to be made and sustained and if not used, it will waste away. 

TL;DR: Everything turns into fat or excreted.","1349050262"

2nd, you will never, EVER learn without accepting that you have put your nose to the grindstone and practice. A lot. You will sound bad and have trouble and your fingers will hurt and you'll want to give up because it's NOT easy. It's also the ONLY way to get better. We all suck when we start. It's hard to find motivation when you can't do what you want on the instrument, but I PROMISE you: if you keep bashing away at it, suddenly, it will click and just work.

3rd, try and learn stuff you like, even if you have to dumb it down.

TL;DR: it's a metric shit-ton of hardwork, but it pays off down the line.

Chords to learn: E, Em, A, Am, G, D, C (all open) These are all basic and will let you play about 500,000,000 different rock songs. You can move the E and A up and down the neck by Barring (holding all the strings down with your fore finger) a fret lower than the chord, this takes some time to get good at.

You can play most stuff with power chords, which are the two lowest notes from an E or A chord slid anywhere on the neck.","1349050265"

I wanted to know about their relationship with Victory Records. Specifically BTBAM's thoughts on their releases since they left.

* Victory put out a ""Best Of"" album.
* Reissued The Silent Circus, Colors, and released the Self-Titled on vinyl.
* All the pressings after they left were single LP's (lower sound quality)
* All the pressings while they were with Victory were two disc LP's (higher sound quality)
* On the self-titled pressing they spelled their name wrong. [See for yourself](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/6993190648_0bcc681816_z.jpg)","1349050276"

There were cameras everywhere in the house, and a shared bathroom. A lot of the other people staying at the shelter were hostile, and you can end up sharing a room with people (especially going in as a single person). If you have a car and it's not winter I would recommend doing that and getting a PO box as an address.

The other night, I was signing up a woman for our new Rewards card, and she wanted to use her husband's birthday because his name was what came up in the database for the phone number she punched in, and she didn't know what year he was born. She canvassed her kids standing there, ""Daddy's 34 years old, what year was he born?""  Shrugs all around.

I got a flyer and tried to do arithmetic in the margins: 

2012 - 34 = *i have no idea what i'm doing*

She stood there uselessly, waiting for me to problem-solve it for her. I thought, ""Who doesn't know what year their spouse was born?"" but hey.

Finally one of the kids piped up. ""1978.""

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","OK, I'm not the reassuring-young-cute-guy you might be looking for, but I can offer this:

Everybody has baggage. There's so many different kinds, some of it heavier/more toxic than others, but really, everybody has it. It's just that when you're younger, it doesn't always show. Maybe your baggage is that you're going to freak out when you start to visibly age the way your dad did. Maybe you're going to turn out to be a jerk about money, because your mom was. Maybe you've got sexual hangups, or are primed for an addiction.

A lot of baggage shows up later, once you've been in a relationship for a while -- and then you find out whether or not you can deal with it.

Yours is just early, right up front. It might cut down on your dating prospects, but honestly I can't see it holding you back from a new true relationship -- it's just going to screen out more people right at the start. A lot of people who start dating again later in life get really cut-to-the-chase about it -- we know that we ALL have flaws and limits and lumpy bits, and we know which kind we can deal with, and we just skip the people who have the kind we can't. It saves time, you know? 


I'm guessing you'll have fewer try-it-out dates, but just as many of the serious connections. So use the time you save to be with your kid, hang with other moms for support, and don't worry about it too much. You're just ducking out of the fun-dates-with-cute-douches stage early. 

Just my .02, FWIW.

-How quickly did you transition to the new food from her previous diet?  If it was a fast transition (less than two weeks), your doggy could be having adjustment issues.  

-Was the change in stool abrupt shortly after getting her?  If so, probably either a food transition or anxiety issue.

-Are there any streaks of blood in the stool?  If so, parasites, and particularly giardia might be the culprit.

-Did she eat any poop, drink standing water or get into anything she shouldn't have?  These all could provide ample opportunity for parasitic infection (long-term) and indigestion (short-term).

-None of the above? Try adding canned pumpkin to her diet.  If things don't get better, find out her previous food and transition her back.  If still no improvement, consider changing foods to a limited ingredient/hypoallergenic brand with a new protein that she hasn't eaten before.

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","I don't know about the orange, I'm trying to figure it out.  
I'm looking through my book of Symbols and it says:  
Orange  
Symbolic meanings: balance between spirit and sexuality; fertility and yet virginity; energy; the Sun; like yellow, orange is believed to be an appetite stimulant.  
Orange has two aspects that we see time and time again, pivoting between the material and spiritual worlds, which is not surprising given that the color itself is a balance between red and yellow. As such, it represents the second chakra, the first being red, and the third, yellow. Orange is vibrant, cheerful color that definitely lifts the spirits. The orange blossom is the traditional flower for brides because fruit and flower can appear on the orange tree at the same time, hence the virginity/fertility symbol. Similarly, a Hindu bride has an orange powder smeared on her forehead once she is married, a sing of her status. Hindu places of worship are indicated by an orange flag or banner, which is replaced once a year and effusive ceremony. Then the book goes on talking about the original color of carrots.

Try this: look at the eye and show a mild smile (practice with your own reflection in a mirror at home). After a short exchange of words (2-4 sentences per person) relax just for a couple seconds and look anywhere else not too far from you (your hands, your clothes, your shoes, anywhere in the room/street, lightly scratch any part of your body... never look at your clock!), and start again. During the conversation, while you're thinking about some question or response it's OK for a while to look down, to a blank wall, to the table...

In relation to textbooks, the biggest factor that will keep prices high is that there are set compulsory texts. There is *no* consumer choice possible, so market forces don't come into play at that level. 

Anyone selling textbooks right now will redouble their lobbying, their customer relationships (with the universities, and with individual lecturers), and be looking at their incentive structure (ie. their kickbacks). 

Whilst there is an incentive for individual publishers to compete, that is dwarfed by the gains to be had by all by colluding - and that's how the 'free' market works in the real world. Businesses are about making money, satisfying the consumer is a *means* to that end, not an end in itself.

The whole point of having role play even play a part is that you are given a new world where your decisions affect your experience. It is quite obvious this happens in the personal story, but it also happens with how you decide to grind for gear. Anet tried their hardest to balance this game to make areas fit to your level, making the entire game endgame to be enjoyed in almost any order.

* Never stop to make conversation with strangers EVER. Keep moving

* If someone begins following you make a lot of turns and duck into a crowded well lit place: coffee shop, bar, kinkos, whatever until they are long passed you.

* If you get trapped whip out your cellphone and make like you're calling the POLICE. The threat of the cops showing up will make most predators or drunk people leave. If it's like OP's situation **call the fucking police**. Don't go out alone without a phone call.

Biology majors are not qualified to do much if they only have a bachelors degree, so I don't see that as a good choice either unless you have researched how difficult it would be to get a job in a fishery or as a park ranger or something, and want to pursue that.  Make sure the careers you are pursuing also pay well enough for you to pay off any student loans you may be taking out, and enough that you can support yourself.  

I would consider other majors.  I also don't see how your minor is going to lead to too many careers either, so maybe reconsider that too.  ","1349050353"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I later realized I was a bit sloppy in my use of *object* and *subject*, what I meant by subject was the person uttering the moral proposition. Thus define *subjective* or *relative* moral sentences are those whose truth depends (among other things) on the person uttering them. *Objective* moral sentences are those that don't.

For example, 'LumenGentium is a male human' would still be an objective sentence, while 'I am a male' would not.

&gt; I don't think it's immoral to not procreate. Even if everyone decided that they didn't want to, and the human race died out, I wouldn't have a problem with it. 

I completely agree with you here. For example I think it would be completely okay if every one decided to join a religious order (out of their love for God) and so gave up the good that is sexual intimacy. Participating in sexual intercourse is not a necessary aspect of human nature (unlike say, breathing.)

What I'm saying is the *sexual intercourse* is linked with procreation inherently and separating the two contradicts the purpose of sexual intercourse. Similarly overeating + throwing up contradicts the purpose of the act of eating and digestion (and the emergency act of vomiting).

We inferred the purpose of 'striving for continued existence' from human biology and perhaps more broadly the study of the human soul. (The soul is the *form of the body* - this is best analogy for someone not used to classical philosophy I can come up with - the form is to the body as the mechanical/artistic/whatever design is to a car.)

Similarly, by the study of the human sexual intercourse we arrive at the conclusion that its objective purpose is both procreative and unitive. Going against this purpose of the sexual act (when engaging in said act) is *immoral* in much the same way going against yours (or someone else's) continued existence when you are both human. 

I would like to note that this particular age is remarkable in its struggle with understanding of the human sexuality. If you look closely most of the disagreements our culture has with the Church are over sex: contraception check, homosexual acts check, masturbation check, premarital sex check, condoms in Africa check, divorce check, blurring the boundaries between sexes check. Nobody (anymore) argues with the Church whether the poor should be fed and clothed, whether loyalty to truth is more important than loyalty to any king or ideology, or whether all men are equal or some are worth more than others. No, we have learned these lessons.

I think what happened was that the Puritanical approach to sexuality (a blunder of the previous age) became less and less tenable and finally fell apart. The pendulum swung the opposite direction to the point where it is unthinkable to the modern man to look at the human body as anything else than sexual. The modern man cannot comprehend the nude baths or (non-sexual!) wrestling of ancient Romans; he has shower stalls installed in public gyms so as to protect his genitals from the gaze of his fellow man which surely could not be anything else but sexual. He recognizes sex as something good, but just as a young child giddy over a new-found freedom, he has yet to learn to use it in a sustainable, healthy matter. 


&gt; I think we should strive to enact moral standards that are not exclusive to our individual subjectivites.

I agree :)

&gt; the issues of fairness and consent are lumped in to the equation. 

Right, and this is where objective moral sentences come into play. You cannot define fairness if subjective/relativistic morality is all you have.

&gt;No, but we can demonstrate why social cohesion and better standards of morality are good for us, and not just something we want.

Well again, *good for us* and  *better standards* only makes sense if you give us an objective purpose such as *strive for continued existence*.

&gt;Or, you know, we could just learn that it's not good to touch a hot stove and avoid the pain.

Yeah, but sometimes there is no-one else to tell you. Or without pain you don't notice until it's too late. See [congenital insensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis).

&gt;the desired effect (growing in character) is attainable without suffering. 

Not always, for example an excessively prideful person might never grow to be humble unless an outside circumstance humbles them (which is always painful to a *prideful* person.)

I trust God that the amount of suffering we are given to endure is exactly the amount that is best for us, not a cinch more or less.

&gt;So we can get closer to saying that it's objectively true that pain is bad for us. I know you don't prefer this meaning of objectivity, but it's valid. 

Well a statement like that I would consider to be objective, although I think this particular one not true.

Our one win is against UL-Monroe, the guys who beat Arky. And we took LSU to the wire. Then there are the losses to Clemson and Miss St (both ranked teams). Clemson is not a bad team, so I don't understand the mockery coming from a loss to the them.

Of our 4 games so far, losing to Miss St is where all the ridicule started. Again, I don't understand why people are treating Miss St as a free win. But nevertheless, it is typically our SEC opener and we typically win. That one game was enough to put Auburn's 2012 performance on the level of Arkansas somehow.

It definitely doesn't help but it's not exactly the same. First off it's still a far more precise striking method than we had used previously. So I'm not sure if resorting to Old bombing tactics is any better. 


I say that because it's unlikely we'd stop bombing entirely without drones. So I don't see why drone usage in particular is specifically hated, unless it's essentially summation of all hatred for Bombing. That I can contest is more reasonable. Sort off. I'll go into more why later.

Now in regards to the sentiment, the context is very different. Afghanistan isn't really a unified country and hasn’t been for awhile. Just prior to our successful invasion, they were effectively in a bloody civil war for ten years.  

Not only that they'd been fighting since the 80’s in their homeland. Where’s we've had two instances of ""combat"" in ours, since we can't count the invasion of Alaska (it wasn’t yet a state). 

The reaction for every bombing would likely be very different than how we react to them because of this. It’s unfortunate that you can get acclimated to it but you can. 

Now I'm not excusing the tactics that cause more civilian deaths. Occupational forces historically win through endearing the local population to the military presence. 

And we've attempted to do this by copying tactics the Brits used in Malaysia. However many things can be brought up why it's not as effective as we'd like. 

In regards to Killing dozen innocent in town of 400, based on most bombing studies it is often counter intuitive, yes you right, it doesn't help them like us much and can aid in recruitment. However were in a finicky situation where we are not fighting an enemy within their own territory all the time.  This changes the circumstances a tad.
It’s either let them recruit without impunity in other countries while the wars on a routine break (winter in Afghanistan) or attempt to attack them.  

The other options which would allow them to recruit with impunity and not harm us long term are the following (Only ones I know off).
We get a larger garrison of troop’s or revising the ground troops to be heavily specialized police unit, along with heavy infrastructural investment. The first option won’t happen because Id likely need a draft or increased funding.  The latter wont happen because of joint training programs with various other countries and lack of proper funding (also poor management when given funds).
So were left with trying to reduce civilian casualties with the most precise intelligence and weaponry or essentially slowly lose.  

/////////

Going back to drones on my iffyness. I see them as functionally the best case scenario for bombing, since I believe were bottlenecked into that being used as mentioned previously.

They are at least perpetually trying to make the strikes smaller but more precise and deadly/effective in that radius. Previously our strategies have been bomb everything to hell so..It’s a make the best of a bad situation in my view.

In other words, the fact that Northwestern's opponents are a combined 6-14 simply means that they are for the most part still unproven; they probably aren't a bad team, but it is plausible that they are simply a mediocre team who has taken advantage of an easy schedule. You then have to consider other factors like how they performed relative to the teams they played, and (at least in my opinion) since it is still early in the season how well one thinks they will do from here.","1349050377"

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","We were playing on a private hive. It was back when vehicle spawn servers were rare. So, this is a long story, so bear with me. I started off lone wolfing, which is out of character for me, since I usually roll in two man fire teams. I got a cz550 on spawn, and decided to go on top of one of the factories in cherno. I proceed to fall off the catwalk, and become stuck on the roof. I call for help in the side channel, and someone responds. I expected to break my legs, but surprisingly fell safely. They drove up in a ural and picked me up. Later we repaired a heli together. As we were flying around, we first were wanted on the server for some small banditry shenanigans. As we reclaimed our honor by taxiing people, someone called out for help on side chat, at the northwest airfield. He had become trapped by zombies, so I hopped in the pilots seat and we flew over. He kept being vague about where he was as he was freaking out, so we flew around until we saw the hoard that was surrounding him. I touch down, and we all book it to clear the ACT from the zombies. At this point, he doesn't answer our hails, over any chat. I assume he has lost consciousness. The four of us battle our way up the stairs, until we reach the glass housing. He had already passed by the time we reached him. 

As we were rushing, none of us covered our six. The zombies from all of the hangers, the atc and the firestation were ripping their way upstairs. Quickly the gunners and co-pilot fought their way out the front door, as I went down the ladder to make a different approach. The buggy ladder proceeded to knock me unconscious, and break my legs. As we were only using in game chat, and I was unconscious, I saw they had no idea where I was. They searched around the ACT and grided out, all while being chased. The gunner found me, and started dragging me as the co-pilot started up the rotors. She ejected as the heli warmed up, and covered the gunner as he dragged me into the dust cloud, trailed by dozens of zombies. They loaded me into the back, and proceeded to dust off as we left many zombies in our wake. We realized as we left the field, we had left the second gunner behind in our rush. We landed in the closest field, and I got out, still with broken legs, as the only person with morphine was the man we left behind. In our haste, the pilot broke the chopper landing, so we hailed the gunner over side chat and led him to our position.

The Panthers defense still sucks, of course, but taken as a whole, this was a pretty good game.  No Cam turnovers,pressuring Matt Ryan, and getting the ground game going - with that stat line, the Panthers would have beaten most of the teams in the NFL today.  This wasn't most teams - Atlanta has the hottest offense, with two WR's that can torch any defense at any time.  Atlanta as a team is one of the hottest and best right now, and they showed it.  The Panthers were able to stick with them, and should have won the game.  I was very sad that they didn't, but I'm able to see the positives.  Those positives just came against a very good team.  
That said, the defense on that last drive was inexcusable.  It was a fucking disgrace, and if the damn team could actually CLOSE OUT A FUCKING GAME the Panthers would be 2-2.  ","1349050379"

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","I am a Southerner. Though I was born in Tampa, FL (Once you get to a certain point in Florida, you're no longer in the South until you hit the Everglades). I've spent most of my life in South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. No one from my family has lived North of the Mason Dixon line since the 1850's. 

1. The Southern Drawl is an amazing distinguishing feature that can be a real blessing and also a real curse. I have a drawl, but due to this, many people hear it and assume I'm a dumb racist redneck. On the other hand, besides making tons of women swoon, it's an identifier among people. There are many Southern accents that come from the different regions of the South, based on this, some people can identify where someone is from, and a lot of the time they can tell if a person is nice or not. The way we speak is just like the lives we live. It's a slower and simpler dialect, which really lets you get to know people.

2. Most Southern Stereotypes, like most other places, have some that are wrong, and some that are right. I have covered a few here, just to give you an idea. 

**Southerners being racist** seems to be the biggest stereotype. I don't think that it's the case at all, I think it's just a stigma that has followed the South since the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. People like to pin us as racist, though most of us don't really care about race anymore. As someone who has traveled a lot, I have met a lot more closet racist up North than I have in the South. I'm not talking about people making a racist joke or two either. I found more closet bigots in the North East than I have the rest of the US. Fact is however, racism is everywhere, it has no boundaries. People of every race, religion, and belief have racist in them, the South just gets a bad rep due to the past. Contrary to popular belief, I think Southerners hate Yankees more than we do Blacks /s. But really, race isn't a problem here.

**Crazy Religious People** Same thing, they're all over the country, just many places here have Blue Laws, which are basically religion backed laws. Most of the people who vote and back these laws are the older generations, we have a lot of older people because they move south looking for better weather, so we have a higher concentration of devout religious people. Much of the younger generation, though still religious, acknowledge and accept what science has proven.

**Southerners are dumb**. Once again, Stupid people are everywhere. Southerners are actually some of the most innovative people in US history. Take a look at Nascar, the engineering that started it was created by the Moonshiners during prohibition to run Moonshine throughout the country. Hell, a Southerner even invented Air Conditioning, now that's something we can all get behind.

**Southerners are nice**. Southern Hospitality is not simply made up. I talk to a lot of Yankees who have come South for schooling and what not, and the major thing they have told me is that people in the South are a whole lot nicer than people up North. Generally in every aspect, Southerners are a whole lot nicer, a lot more polite, and courteous to others. 

3 The North, a place that everyone seems to talk great about though I don't really know the big deal. Like I've said previously, I have had the great opportunity to travel in my life, and I've been to every state, and just about every major city in the Nation. I've been to New York a couple times, both upstate and in the City. Both places people were put off by my drawl. Another thing was people were incredibly rude up North, they didn't hold doors for one another, they didn't talk to one another, they didn't really interact unless it directly benefited them. People were extremely angry too. In Boston I had a woman yell at me when I held the door open for her. The North's pace of life is way too fast. It seems everyone is too busy to just take a day off and relax, even on their days off they're busy as hell trying to get things done. My advice to them is to just chill for a bit, literally. Just go do nothing but relax for a day, sit at home and do nothing, or go on a walk and just appreciate life. You're only alive once, so why not appreciate it.

4 All of it. Really. I can't choose. I love Barbeque, and I love home cooking. Soul food is delicious too. Corn bread made right is amazing, but you can't go wrong with chicken and biscuits. Pulled pork on a buttered bun? Give me 6. Biscuit and gravy with some fried chicken? Sign me up for seconds. A lot of people make fun of the South being obese, yes it's a problem, but the pace of life, plus all of our good food, it's hard to stay skinny. I rather eat whatever I want and die happy anyways. Southern Food is another identifying feature. People across the world know what Southern cooking is, and for good reason too. 

5 The Southern Identity as a whole. I love the slower pace of life, I love Country Cooking, and I love my accent. My hair falls naturally in what is known as the Southern Swoop, or the Frat Shag in many places. Our identity puts us apart from everyone else. We belong to a distinct and beautiful society that has so much to offer the world around us. We tend to treat people civilly but we're also not the type of people to push around. It's an identity that has taken hundreds of years to form. It's been molded by good and bad events. Yet it is who we are today, and I for one thing am proud of who I am.

If you have any other questions let me know, I know this is a lot, but I wanted to answer your questions fully.","1349050392"

I have never felt the urge to teach a parent how to read, because I don't know how to teach adults how to read; I don't have the time or resources to teach adults how to read; most of my parents work too hard and too much to have the time themselves; and I don't think I could offer without coming across as patronizing and rude.  I have a lot of respect for my students' parents and guardians--they sought out information on, and went through, the lottery process for getting their children into a charter school.  

I try to be very explicitly respectful to parents in all of my interactions with them.  Not only because I need mutual respect with parents in order to best impact my students, but because one thing that I care deeply about is preserving my students' respect for their parents.  I think some of the ""college-bound"" language that's very common in charter schools can really erode how students see their parents and communities, because implicit in that language and narrative is the message that if you don't go to college (or learn how to read), you didn't work hard enough and you're a failure.  I want all of my students to have all of the options that I had when I graduated high school as a wealthy white student from the suburbs, but I don't want them to see many of the adults who care a tremendous amount about them as failures because they didn't have the same options.

Secondly, God won't give us anything we cannot handle. This, I truly believe in.

He obviously believes you have the strength to get through this, so please don't give up on Him. Just keep praying, keep talking to God. Tell Him you're angry and fed up and confused as to why you have to endure this painful experience and not someone else. Express your feelings with God, so he knows how you feel. He'll appreciate your honesty with Him and love you more for it! He has the ability to release you of this pain, so don't give Him an excuse to say 'mm maybe I'll keep icantfindathrowaway on this a little bit longer' (I doubt this even happens but I hope you get my drift). Just don't lose faith in Him.

Also, God wants none of his children to be, or feel, alone in this world, so He will bless you with someone. Someone that you deserve.

You'll probably get a few responses on here giving you different explanations as to why this may be happening to you (that being your search for an explanation), but I don't think you should give up on Him. it's not worth it.","1349050404"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Oh lord, how true this is in both Brotherhood and Revelations. I finally hit level 50 in Brotherhood recently, and I am NEVER going back. It may be due to the inordinately low number of players, but I noticed a LOT of weird trends toward the end of my time playing it. Anyone who played as the Harlequin, Thief, Footpad or Marquis tended to be an incorrigible jerk, and spent most of their time jogging around rooftops, using the gun, and harassing anyone who managed to stun them.

Revelations isn't much better in that respect, based on the last time I played. Sure, it's easier to get stuns and whatnot, but certain personas seemed to attract the worst kinds of people, to the point where seeing a given persona makes me think ""Oh great, one of THESE games."" On top of this, people in general tend to run a lot more and spend a lot more time on roofs, which REALLY takes me out of the whole ""blade in the crowd"" mentality and makes it a serious pain to hunt anyone down. I've had a lot of success, but it was mostly due to luck and heavily favoring Poison/Smoke Bomb as my tools. Hopefully Assassin's Creed 3 can do more to discourage people dashing about and parking on rooftops in multiplayer, else I'm probably not going to bother with it.","1349050411"

"AcademicPhilosophy","t5_2r7v0","Copleston's *History* is excellent.  It might be worth supplementing with some more recent introductions to analytic and continental philosopher to cover some later twentieth century work.

Aside from this sort of general work, what you should do is pick a topic which is of interest to you and read deeply on that subject, and through this reading develop a writing sample and/or research proposal.  Many schools will request one or both of these as part of your application, and having quality writing showing some sincere engagement with the scholarship will immensely improve your application, even if it is not directly requested.  Showing quality, recent philosophical work of this sort will also help show that you have maintained an active interest in the field while you have been away from school.

Most professional journals will, in theory, publish articles written by non-graduate students/graduates.  However, it would be difficult for most people in such a situation to produce scholarship of sufficient quality for publication.  When you read more deeply on your topic of interest, you should end up reading a number of journal articles, and this should give you an idea of what journals there are and what quality of work they contain.  If you think you have scholarship to contribute to an issue, the obvious place to start would be to contribute articles to the journals which have published the articles you are responding to, or which have been an important part of your research.","1349050414"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","I have two.


1.  I don't like Karlson, I don't think he deserved the Norris.  He's a good player don't get me wrong but I think he's more of a forward that happens to play at the blue line.  He's not that great defensively.

2.  Since it seems to be a topic of discussion in here I'll throw my 2 cents in on Dirty Bert.  Bertuzzi was not solely to blame in the Moore incident.  While I do not condone the sucker punch; he was trying to fight Moore who was a known dirt player and who had recently taken a cheap shot who was supposedly also a very good friend of Bert.  Moore wouldn't fight Bert over reacted; however the fall is what broke his neck not the punch.  Bert was also suspended for a long fucking time and has always expressed remorse and has not been the same person since.  Everyone needs to get over the fact he's back in the league. It was a one time incident; he hasn't had incidents since and there are far worse players in the league getting off easy.  I fully support Todd Bertuzzi's place in the league.

TL;DR:  Don't like Karlson/ Do like Bertuzzi.","1349050415"

"Smite","t5_2stl8","So I have been playing some agni lately and I've been pretty successful with him.

I start with boots in sidelane, fill up with pots and pick up my 3 first. if i mid I start with the spear of the magi lvl 2 (for added health) and pots.

I get my 2 second and my 1 third, afterwards max 2 first, then three and 1 last.

For build if I sidelane I max spear of the magi after lvl 2 boots, for mid I go boots lvl 2 then max spear. As a third Item I always get gem of isolation.

MP5 items are not necessary since you can sustain so well with your 4 (it doesn't cost any mana).

After gem I see what I need, usually I go voidstone then rod of tahuti, but it depends.

Playstyle:

I usually try to land my 3 on the enemy god at level one, it does decent damage and you just have to pot up. I'm VERY liberal with health pot usage and always run around with at least 3 of them. try to harass them with your charged up 2 and your 3. Once you get your 1 you can try charging into them and then immediately stunning them in your flames. this way they take more dmg from it and you can follow up with your 2.

Using the stun is tricky. I usually charge in and then lay the stun in the flames afterwards to guarantee a hit. Another trickj to do is firing your 4 and immediately laying a 1 at their feet. this is good for burst as you can hit your other 4 charges as well or land another 2. 

Try to be active in harassing but not too risky (if that makes sense). if they have ults like hades and cupid don't use charge to engage unless their ult is on cd. keep your 4 not on 3 charges for too long, it wastes the regeneration. I usually hover between 1 and 3.

once you have gem your dot from your 4 will slow them so it will be easier to initiate. 

Due to the insane burst agni is great for quickly diving from your lane for a gank, he is also great at towerdiving (if you can secure the kill). With your charge you can bridge the distance, fire of a 4 and be off into the jungle in no time.


With these general guidelines I'm usually doing pretty well. Just now I went left lane with a pretty bad sun wukong and I went 12-5-8. I was a lot better at the start but once they started to realize the threat I posed they were focussing me pretty hard.

Hope you have as much fun with agni as I have!","1349050421"

You gotta get out. Only person that is going to get hurt is YOU and that just sucks. Get out now while you still have some sanity.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Right, but this is what I think you don't understand because you're not an economist; it is perfectly possible for some very counter-intuitive facts to hold on a macro level that mean you have to use university-level maths to come up with a sensible answer. Let me give two examples:

1. In a demand-driven recession if the government spends some amount G, it will get back more than G in taxes, which we will call T, provided the Keynsian multiplier is high enough to balance out the liquidity preference of the economy. So it is theoretically possible that taking in $5 from tax loopholes while spending $10 of G will result in T+$5 being added to the national balance of payment.

2. Increasing people's wages does not necessarily incentivise people to work harder so under certain conditions giving the rich a tax break will cause them to work less and means not only will you lose $10 from the tax break but $10*some number that represents their leisure preference for a given wage.

Now I've intentionally not dumbed these models down (although I've spared you the maths) because I think you're struggling to see how the budget could be more complicated than ""Take money from group A then give that money to group B"". But in fact macroeconomics is extremely complicated, and the average voter would *not* understand the provisions in an average budget - it is unclear whether giving the rich $10 will cost $10, more than $10 or less than $10 in the long run. It might even make money under some *very* dubious assumptions.

Now none of this excuses Ryan for not being forthcoming with the budget; academic macroeconomists would be able to - for example - explain that we are in a liquidity-driven recession rather than a demand-driven recession (probably). But I think it quite clearly shows that the average voter - using you as a model of the average voter - would not be in a position to comment intelligently on the implications of the budget. I wouldn't even be surprised if *Ryan* only knows the 'broad brush' factors which go into his budget and has left the details to his staff.

And I think you're arguing in bad faith accusing me of derailing. I'm talking to you in a 'comment below threshold' thread inside *another* 'comment below threshold' thread inside a thread about the Ryan budget. That on a messageboard which is specifically designed to allow the kind of rigorous back-and-forth which we are enjoying at the moment to occur without disrupting anyone else.","1349050427"

After dialing a bunch of computers, I stumbled upon an awesome site with chess, checkers, backgammon, etc. (sadly there was no Tic Tac Toe). There was this awesome game with a world map called Global Thermonuclear War.  After starting it, I showed a girl from school it also.  Some stuff happened with the US government. I met the original programmer of the game, (who showed me that Tic Tac Toe did exist!) and saved the world and got the girl!  The next day I decided to call in sick to school and hang out with two of my friends in Chicago, but that is another story all together!","1349050434"

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","I work with mice in a lab... and I have also studied male mouse aggression. 5x cage are fine, as long as they are not obese (if this is the case, 3-4 max). Males do not need to be single housed at all, however, they must be housed together from the beginning and should not be rehoused with new males once group housed. It is best to house males from different litters at the time of weaning (4-6weeks old max- older than 6 weeks will result in more fighting). For the most part the males may fight but they should be OK as long as there are no visible bite wounds. You will normally see wounds/scabbing around the rear, if you see bite wounds around the head/shoulders remove this mouse and single house him immediately and treat him with a triple antibiotic until he heals. They are more likely to fight with each other when they are bored, so the more stimulating the environment, the less likely the fighting will result in serious wounds. However, an alpha male may fight over control of a specific toy, but you probably won't see any severe injuries. Separating the instigator only works sometimes, as usually once an alpha male is removed, another may take his place, so keep an eye on them if that is the case. 98% of the time mice can be picked up in your hand without them biting, even an aggressor, they really only bite when they think you are going to hurt them. Anyways, good luck with your experiment. If you find anything else happening or have any other problems, like barbering, malocclusions, or anything really, send me a PM, I would be happy to help, I have a lot of experience and I've seen a lot when it comes to mice.

The framework I'm dealing with in mutualism here is indeed one of this sort of radical agnosticism and uncertainty, and does not include any positive assertions from the start. To phrase the anti-theist and the agnostic as being one and the same is something I do think to be misleading.

Possession is a kind of use-based ownership (to the extent that it implies exclusivity of control as a matter of fact while the object in question is being used), so I'm not sure where you're getting that I'm trying to turn it into a universal a priori. I do honestly believe you're conflating two completely different things here. This new mutualistic kind of absolute exclusivity comes in a posteriori, through an analysis of our phenomenological experience and the fact that the subject is an incomplete self due to various subjective limitations -- i.e. historicity and spatio-temporal contingency. 

In fact, it may very well be precisely that I'm incorporating the concern for historical contingency that serves as the best retort to why I'm not using a universal a priori. The extent to which it is universal is, if it exists here, significantly limited to the conjecture that this can possibly apply to all people, but not to all time periods or epochs. To what extent this a universal as in universal a priori.... I think zero is the most accurate answer.

&gt;Because I think private ownership of capital leads to better results that only use-ownership. I developed this opinion through years of study of economics and economics history. I am unsure what, exactly, you would like me to present?

How? What is it about private ownership in particular? It's a priori universal exclusivity? Coase Theorem? Drawing boundaries? Responsibility concerns? Unlimited liability? What? ","1349050446"

the problem is that is a conservative district and the Dem going up against thim won't be conservative enough to have a reasonable chance. 

Honestly i have no idea why Dems don't try and get more conservative member to go up against GOP in really conservative districts. it means they have no choice, and instead of having someone that is more liberal(but still conservative) We get stuck with dipshits like Akin.

Also in CA, i have no idea why the GOP don't try to get more control by offering somewhat more liberal candidates that would be elected (actually does happen with the Governors occasionally, but seriously if they offered reasonable Senators, then they've have a chance)","1349050446"

however, if the two of you come in, split a Lousiana Spinach Dip (14$), and each get the ribs 10 oz (cause you wont eat more then that realisitcally speaking) with a baked potatoe, its 60$ plus tip and tax.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","All the retail jobs I had were focused on using customer service to make sales. Greeting customers, learning their needs, suggesting additional items, and closing the sale. You should be approachable and willing to help customers (even the difficult, hard to please customers.) You will have to learn as much as you can about the products you sell in order to get customers to buy them. It would help you to look up information about the place where you would like to work and mention it in an interview if you can. Some places also trained sales associates on loss prevention: never the sales floor unattended, and give suspected thieves extra customer service to deter them from committing the crime (""I noticed you picked up quite a few items, would you like me to hold them for you at the register while you finish shopping?"" or ""Hello mam, if you need help with anything just let me know. I'll be right over here."" and remain in view.) It's also standard to keep a clean and organized store to make shopping easier for customers. You might be responsible for straightening up a designated area. (Labels facing forward, clothes in size order, items pulled to the front of the shelves, etc.)

If you haven't worked in retail before, emphasize any experience you do have interacting with the public, being organized, and your ability to learn selling points about products. Try and think of an example of really great retail customer service that you have experienced and also a negative one, and figure out what the associate did in each situation to make you feel that way. (I remember this being asked in interviews.) Good luck!","1349050458"

The whole public folders are dead thing is an over reaction to the fact the tools to manage them were missing from the gui in the initial Exchange 2007 release (who needs it when we have powershell) and some blog posts that basically said MS thinks Public Folders are a bad solution for most of the problems they are implemented to solve, and they are a low priority.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I should clarify: What I meant is that people don't always get into trouble. That it happens often whereby the parents get away with it.

Either they dump the child onto a friend or relative or anyone that will take them and bounce, or they'll either just straight bounce or kick the kid out and they'll go live with a friend or relative or anyone that'll take them in.

If they end up staying with a friend or relative, then chances are that friend or relative wont contact the police. Why? Because they don't want CPS shitting on them for doing the right thing. It's also easier to just take care of the child in a lot of cases than it is to go through the courts. At least, it was before 9/11. Afterwards I don't know. The real issues come up when the parents come back and start demanding full custody. 

I don't have any experience in that part of it. All I know is that quite a few of my friends have been abandoned by their parents and that when I was younger, a girl was abandoned by her mother onto our family. We raised her for, IDK how long, I was very little. At any rate, her mother came back and took her. I'm not sure what happened, I know at the time my grandmother had contacts with the Texas Attorney General and tried going through that route. But if they gave up or were blocked by the courts, I can't say.

I was so oblivious at the time that I even smiled at him and said ""Hi"" as I walked past.

Brown, announced a series of indictments resulting from two nationwide investigations code-named Operation Pipe Dreams and Operation Headhunter. The investigations targeted businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly marijuana pipes and bongs, under a little-used statute (Title 21, Section 863(a) of the U.S. Code). Counterculture icon Tommy Chong was one of those charged, for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. Most of the 55 individuals charged as a result of the operations were sentenced to fines and home detentions; Chong, however, was sentenced to 9 months in a federal prison, forfeiture of $103,000, and a year of probation. While the DOJ denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, many felt that he was made an example of by the government.""

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I will use dark souls for my first point. Its a game I love and I feel was designed well. It doesn't hold your hand. It lets you play and kicks your ass every step along the way. No direction is explained besides you need to hit two bells. Ones above the ground. Ones bellow the ground. You get your ass kicked in a graveyard. You go down and you get your ass kicked by ghosts. You explore and you go up and you live and you continue to do so. You clear the first bell eventually. Then you have to go down. But where is the other bell? You die to the ghosts again. So you explore and you eventually wind up in a crazy ass forest. But its not the right way. You don't know this yet.

Anyways this game has multiple ways to go. None of them are easy. Nothing is easily explained. Sure I could go online to find it all out. Alternatively I could just enjoy the ride and figure out the world as I go. I wouldn't say this is bad design. Its just an uncommon way to design a game these days. The story and everything else are done in a similar way. No two people will play this game the same way twice. Its an amazing game and I think its designed well. Assuming its your cup of tea.

Other games like Torchlight 2 don't do a good job explaining stuff. They show conflicting info here and there. If you think too much on it, you will get confused. Torchlight 2 is a fun game. The stats and skills are not explained well. I'm not the only one who feels this way. Not explaining core game information is a bad idea. That is a bad design idea.

To me the difference comes from what in the game is done poorly. Is it the core elements like confusing misleading tool tips? Or is it the need to explore? To me the exploration is a key element of a lot of good games. The misleading information however is not. It all depends on what is not explained. 

(The only thing dark souls doesn't do a good job with is the stat weapon scaling. The stats their self are laid out well. But what does a freaking C on STR mean? What does a B do that a C doesn't? Clearly B is better than C but when it comes to numbers... what am i looking at? Its not crippling info but would writing percentage kill the devs? Why can't we have B(40% added) or whatever?)","1349050473"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","As someone that has worked closely with QA testers in the gaming industry, player submitted bugs aren't used as much as you would think, mainly because of how hard it is to build a test case or explain exactly how to re create a bug.  There are certainly a few gems out there but half of the time player submitted bug reports tend to be people bitching about things that aren't actually bugs (had several people e-mail bug reports that said that a certain dungeon was too hard, that's it) or players informing us of issues that we are already aware of and just haven't found a stable fix for it.  

That being said, with the nature of bug reporting, player submitted bugs are still necessary.  I can think of one bug in particular in the most recent game I worked on where in this MMORPG a player found a loop hole that allowed them to level up their character to the max in a matter of minutes.  He came forward, wrote an excellently detailed bug report and a potentially devastating loop hole was avoided before other people discovered it.  

It's just impossible for a QA team to test EVERY possible scenario in a digitally created world.  There is absolutely no such thing as a bug free game.  It just doesn't happen.  Developers simply try to weed out all the obvious game stoping bugs before release and then the QA team continues to search for bugs.  

But speaking from someone who has been on both sides of this issue player bug reporting can be amazingly helpful if done right.  The idea of using things like reddit seems like it would be very helpful in weeding out all of the lame bug reports and putting the more common ones to the top, basically acting as a triage for QA teams and programmers.  Also, people that can write a good bug report / test case are a valuable commodity so no telling when a well detailed bug report on here could land you a QA job at a developer (which is also the best way to get your foot in the door of the gaming industry).  

Hope this was helpful.  If you would like I still have some notes from my QA classes and from work that detail the proper way to create a bug report. ","1349050483"

i try to produce hip hop beats and all the musicians i know are guys.

what you need to do is sit down with your parents and ask them how much do they love you and if they would love you and support you for being yourself. ask your friends how much they care about you. use this information to gauge how to approach this. coming is difficult and frightening because we sit there and think about all the horrible possibilities.

i'll tell you this, the friends that i have now are the best i've ever had in my whole life. everyone picks up how much more authentic and happy i am now whereas before i was depressing and sorta fake. this gained me a tremendous amount of respect.

you have to ask yourself how you want to go about the rest of your life. you can settle for less and risk the whole pot, or leave with *all or nothing* when the show stops. its in my opinion that in this life if you aren't living to try and **be the best you that you can possibly be**, then you aren't living my friend.","1349050484"

Look at this JUNE review of the Sapphire 7970. It gets about 66FPS at stock speeds while a REFERENCE 670 gets about 72. That's a 6 FPS difference. Now, with the knowledge that the stock ASUS 670 performs about 1% (1FPS to be fair) better than a stock 680, which gets 9 FPS more than the 7970, we can see the advantages that one would get from a ASUS 670. the Sapphire moderately OCed got about 4 FPS added on which still didn't meet the 670 or the 680. the ASUS 670 OCs like crazy and can definitely outmatch a 7970 in BF3 no doubt. at 2560x1600, the 7970 doesn't even ""leave the 670 behind""","1349050496"

edit
&gt;Why are the temple’s tigers so tolerant of humans hanging around them? Despite rumors, CWI did not find any evidence of the tigers’ being drugged to stay docile for the tourists, nor has there been any other hard evidence found to indicate drugs are used. On the day that I visited, I asked Archie Ezekiel, a Canadian backpacker and volunteer at the temple, why the tigers seemed so mellow. He said, in line with the temple’s literature, that the tigers had just been fed (chicken and vitamin supplements) and were taking their regular afternoon snooze. “No matter what you do with animals there’s going to be controversy,” Ezekiel said. In the afternoon, he told me, there is a special session when visitors can observe cubs playing outside in less restrictive conditions. “There is no way you can tell me those animals are drugged.”

Humans are so lucky to have these big brains that can handle abstract ideas such as our own mortality. But it's also a curse because how do we deal with it? It can cause crippling anxiety. So, we create culture in order to give meaning to our lives. If we are part of a meaningful universe then our lives have meaning. More specifically, if you are good members of your culture and your culture lives on forever, then you live on forever.

So, what do you do? monks in Nepal surround themselves with the corpses of dead members of their guild because when they are constantly reminded of death, they don't fear death because it has always been a part of your life.

My opinion? You should always keep your mortality in the back of your mind. You should find meaning for yourself as a part of a meaningful world. Find something you value and gun towards it so in the end you will be able to say you always fought for a truly meaningful cause.  But also realize other people have other values they find truly meaningful so you can't really blame them for gunning towards a cause you might not find as valuable.","1349050501"

If you're familiar with the comics, it's clearly a character driven story, not a straight horror ""oh shit there's zombies and we're going to die"" kind of tale...a lot of people who got hooked on the show early weren't aware of this...so the bulk of season 2 didn't sit well with them.

I agree it's a LOT slower, and there's definitely some crap they could have skipped...but the whole season built nicely to the season finale, and it set the tone of the characters current paranoia and distrust for the upcoming season, which looks to be MUCH more intense.

and since I've been drinking a teensy bit, I'll continue to elaborate: This upcoming season is CRUCIAL to the shows survival. They're touting it as being much more action packed, which is incredibly important. The story arc of the comics that they're entering is BRUTAL and arguably the finest part of the (ongoing) story.

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","I never went to any fairs, but the important questions to figure out at any grad program are (in no particular order):

Funding for new students - some universities have department funding which gives you more freedom, many are able to provide funding through TAships, but the model changes how you are able to organize your time around research. 

Advisor pairing - different schools have different methods of pairing students with advisors, and its good to know what the model us at each school so you can judge if you are really going to be able to work with that one great professor. Obviously this depends a lot on the profs funding, etc., and will become clearer later in the application process, but it's good to know. 

Requirements for quals and dissertation also vary. Also, you might be interested in whether schools will grant you a masters after quals (assuming you're going for a doctorate.) 

Opportunity for collaboration and dual-advisorship, if that's something you're interested in. 

Funding for conferences and travel - some departments directly support student travel grants, some are dependent on advisors for funding travel. 

Industry connections, if you're in a STEM field and have an interest there. 

Plus anything else specific to the department. Do your research on them and try to show that you know something about them. Have an idea of which professors you may like to work with, etc.

Hope it goes well!

My way: Clearing zones 100% and always challenging my self. If I were lvl 30, i would go to a 30-40 zone and clear it 100%. This would leave me with a great challenge and I would be about lvl 35 when done. Then I would go to a 35-45 zone etc. 

I didnt really lvl a lot throgh crafting or pvp, but you could get some cheap lvls through crafting. 1 craftinglvl gives a percentage of you level as xp, so it would be ""better"" to level this up at later levels.

The best tips for leveling is just: Play the game and have fun! Don't feel that you have to rush it.","1349050507"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Quite often 3rd parties make lenses that Canon/Nikon just doesn't.

I ran into this with my macro.  I wanted something between the 105's and 180's that are common.  105's weren't long enough, and the 180's were too big to hand-hold / easily travel with (this is one of those instances where it will be fine for most people, but not me).  The sigma 150mm was really the *only* lens choice.  And it is a beautiful lens.

I wanted something like the canon 100-400 that was modern (newer IS / ligher etc), and wasn't push-pull.  Again, the Sigma 120-400 fit what I needed.  

And in terms of the 'issues' that people have, its really difficult to figure out people who have legitimate issues with their lenses, people who blame their equipment for their poor technique, and people who are expecting too much.  I ran through a bunch of tests when I got my lenses, and both were perfect on delivery.  Oddly enough, i have seen quite a bit 'bad out of the box' issues with Canon's cheaper / kit lenses.

I've had several girlfriends (many years ago) that couldn't go a few days without action (except when on their period), even if they loved me- it's uncommon, but for some people, sexual urges just take over, like how some people can't control alcoholism or desire to eat sugary fatty foods.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I can assure you, there's a downside to this. I mean, yeah, if a guy and a girl are at a bar flirting and getting on a lot of people would assume that the guy will buy her a drink and that is kind of outdated. It's also kind of creepy and sexist (to both men and women) that clubs will do things like ""free drinks for women"" night to try and pack the place with ladies. And yes, I know there are women who take advantage of the ""free drinks"" thing and will flirt with/do sexual things with men in exchange for drinks. And if you're a guy who would want to do that, then yeah, that does kind of suck.

The downside is that sometimes a woman can't pay for her own drink without some dude trying to pay for her and not taking no for an answer. When I go out, men quite regularly appear out of the blue and try to pay for me. I say no because I'm aware that if I say yes, the guy will assume sex or sexual attention will follow, and I don't go to bars looking for sex. A lot of them won't accept this ""no"". I've had men follow me round bars calling me a stuck-up bitch and other things because I declined to let them pay for my drink. I once had a guy physically corner me against a bar trying to get me to let him pay for a glass of wine. There's also the worry that if a random guy buys you a drink they might spike it (I and several of my friends have had our drinks spiked at various times in the past, it's not a pleasant experience). 

So yeah, sometimes free drinks are an unfair advantage. Sometimes, the ""guy trying to buy you a drink thing"" really sucks. ","1349050513"

Your analogies are truly awful. Staring is rude and you have every right to be offended by rude people. Having breasts doesn't automatically give everyone a free pass to stare at them like a side of beef just because I dare not wear turtlenecks every day of the year. 

Also, you are really contradicting yourself when you say this:

To be fair all the new gods that have came out since beta started have been terribly unbalanced. But then again this is beta and Hirez is new to the whole MOBA gaming.

Hirez is bringing balance patches out at often as they can but guys we need to remember that Hirez is a smaller studio than most game development teams (ex. Blizzard/ Riot) 

When Thor came out it showed that Hirez actually knew they were releasing overpowered gods so they tried to make him a little bit closer to weak than overpowered. Imo (seems to be the only one that feels this way) Thor was actually really balanced when he came out but everyone was whining cuz he wasn't like all the other new gods that would two shot everybody. People were just mad that Thor wasn't a face roll win.

In conclusion, I have faith in Hirez and I think people like you need to stop raging so much and just learn to play better. :D ","1349050529"

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","I find that the accent where I grew up sounds really dumb to my ears. Fun to listen to but sounds uneducated. However, other southern accents I find charming. I think this is just due to familiarity.

I feel like the stereotypes are pretty unfounded. Poor people are a certain way no matter what part of the country you go to. Worse than the stereotypes themselves is the casual way they are paraded around by people from other regions. Best example is someone from California complaining that Southerners are prejudiced. The irony is always lost here.

I think there are real differences in culture as far as relationships and families go. I much prefer southern style from my own experiences. Also: white people everywhere.

Sure, Google has a section where the best and brightest get to sit around and innovate. But why not all of Google? Why just the tech industry?

The people that are in those innovating sections... /they/ look at problems that society has and try to create some technology to make it easier. That's why they're so lauded and people look highly upon them. But it should be the other way around: the main purpose of the such a company as Google should be for what people need, to improve society, and all the fancier contraptions that are just amusing should be lauded and celebrated.

When lunch time would roll around I would say to her "" Miss Irene im hungry"" and I kid you not, everyday she would give me the same cold, emotionless response. "" Eat some candy corn"" in her pacific rim accent she said, over and over and everyday accompanied by the finger gesture to the large bowl of candy corn on the kitchen counter by the plant.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","What I really meant was Stalin's Russia. I'd say the article is sympathetic towards the Russian people but also in it's mentions of Stalin seems to be picking and choosing what he mentions.

I know about Russia making overtures to Britain and France to form an anti-fascist alliance and being turned down, mainly because of the British government business interests in Spain wasn't it? 

Yes it was a treaty of non-aggression, you are right, but that treaty included provisions of how to divide up Eastern Europe and Finland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Part of the reason for the pact was for the Soviet Union to protect itself but it also was a pact which was planning for aggressive occupation of other countries. It isn't as cut and dry as the Soviet Union being a lone white knight fighting back the evil fascist forces, only treating with Germany for it's own protection and it would be naive to believe anything else. I believe the more aggressive elements of the treaty were kept secret at the time.

Yes you are right that I was wrong but you are also wrong yourself, Nazi Germany forced Czechoslovakia to cede various parts of territory to Germany, Poland and Hungary. That played into Hitler's plan of eastern expansion for obvious reasons and he occupied what remained of Czechoslovakia after the Anschluss but before the invasion of Poland I think. 

You seem a bit paranoid, I am not someone who is lazy in making up my opinion on history and politics and any errors in what I've said come from failing in my memory (I'm writing from my phone) not my reasoning. 

&gt;Any article about this from the Western perspective does this too. Try to realize the extreme bias you've been raised in. I assume you're from the west, probably USA. Watch any documentary or read any number of history books/biographies made here that mentions the USSR and see how much they disregard, obscure, and twist historical facts. It's far worse than this, in my opinion, and far more prevalent.

lol, I'm a history student, you are preaching to the choir. Also I am from the UK, I'm not an anti-communist although I do disagree with some thing that some communists have done. I read extensively and I'm well aware of the importance of bearing bias in mind when studying history and current events.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;-No ""k"" texts, because they can lead to people over-thinking and believing you are mad at them -

Texts are not a proper medium for this kind of discussions where people can over-think or get mad. Texts are good for exchanging short, concrete information, and in such situations, a ""k"" is a quite effective way to either acknowledge you got the message, or that you agree.

Examples: 

""So let's make it 7 p.m.""  ""k""

""In a jam, I'll be 15 min. late."" ""k""

""Take two flashlights, mine is broken."" ""k""

I don't really expect answers like ""I agree that we should meet at 7"", ""I received your message and I'll wait for you"" or ""I received your message and I will take the other flashlight for you"". If ""k"" is too ambiguous, it's probably a subject for a phone call or long e-mails.","1349050551"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Do yourself a favor and look up the ""theory of evolution"". Although there is overwhelming evidence and it has been thoroughly tested, there is no way to prove that we as humans evolved from something else. We can only look at the evidence in what species we've actually observed making gradual adaptations and changes, compare ourselves to similar species(primates), and make an educated guess that this is what happened to us as well. We have not actually observed humans evolving from ape to man, we only have pieces of the puzzle that point in that direction.

Quite often these people have much better life than most normal middle-class people because they have genuine joy from God.

Now God is great and loving, and his plan is perfect. How then you might ask do we see so much destruction in the world?

It comes down to the fall of man at the beginning of human civilisation (Genesis 1-3). The curse of sin is what causes this destruction.

Now since the time of that fall, God has had a plan for the redemption and restoration of his creation. The first part of the plan was that he sent Christ Jesus to atone for our sins.

Now if sending your only son to innocently die for the rest of a world who will most likely not even choose you isn't love. I don't know what is.

Can I just say now that I've said most of what I need to that I completely sympathise with you. I am so so sorry that you have to live with this and it burdens me to see that it causes you so much emotional pain.

But eventually I built up my confidence, met a great girl who was really hot, and now I'm married to her.

High school is crap. Crapper for some more so than others...but life does get better if you hang on in there and let it get better.

At the moment, give up the porn and the fapping for you. You will be doing yourself a big favor for when you are 30 and addiction free. The self esteem and social bonuses actually come from something else - building confidence takes effort on your part, but it is worth it. Start small. Tell some girl that you thought something she said in class was interesting and made you think about something in a new way. The conversation doesn't have to last forever and she doesn't have to become your wife...just try saying something. If the conversation gets awkward after even a minute, just repeat ""well, I just wanted say I thought that was interesting...but I gotta go and talk to X teacher about some assignment, see you around"" and then leave.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","Daredevil. I think it's one of the great superhero films. Ignore the terrible, unfinished special effects for a moment. I love both versions. In fact, the fact there are two versions add to it. Both do different things and convey different feelings. It's almost a course in story editing. But forget that, too. The reason I choose Daredevil is well, everything else. I love the actors. It's just genius casting. Duncan as Kingpin is maybe the single bravest casting decision I can think of. Affleck is awesome. Mrs. Affleck was at the height of her career in 2003 and works perfectly as his love interest. The humor is great throughout. The main thing though, is the flow of the script. It shows exactly why Daredevil is the Marvel Universe's Batman. He doesn't give up. He's gritty. He sacrifices. All for who? Nobodies. His superpower is muted and only used to accentuate his passion for fighting criminals. I can't believe there are this many characters in the film and all are fully realized. Remember Bane in Batman &amp; Robin? None of that shit here. Excellent writing. Shocked that it's still the butt of so many jokes. 

EDIT:  I'm sorry, but Ebert was right about the movie you chose. It's to this day, his least favorite film. I saw that and the remake. The remake takes everything shitty about the characters and plot in that film, develops them, and makes a 10 times better film out of the partial remnants of that fetid turd you like.","1349050567"

I like school. It sounds corny, but I do. The best part about being a senior is that I got to choose all of my classes, and even though I just had to do some tweaking in the first few weeks it's awesome. I think I bit off way more than I can handle, but i'm enjoying it.

I like the people I associate with. I like, well love, my friends, and I like that i've already made friends with new people.

I like my job. Supervising middle school kids doesn't sound like the most enjoyable thing in the world, but it has some weird ups and downs, like Mario Kart tournaments and Ellen Degeneres marathons.

I like my family. My family is my rock. My little brother really does hate me though, which sucks but I don't really know what to do about it. We're like oil and water, and I don't think we'll ever get along. But sometimes we have good days.

I like myself. I think i'm attractive, likable, smart, have a good group of friends, and i'm funny. But mostly, what I know is I work hard, and I like that I work hard, even though I don't really have a choice (I have to). I think having to work hard makes you appreciate things more. I haven't got a stellar GPA, but I had to work really hard to bring it up to what it is today, and i'm super-proud every time I look at the college transcript.

Unless of course you instead decide to use a large round like a .50 BMG, in which case the damage is due to the sheer amount of gunpowder used in such a round and not the fact that it's a live round itself.

My secret fear is that I will appear snobby through practice. By snobby I mean '*trying to be profound all the time*', in a really negatively perceived way. Like I'm trying to be a wise-ass.    
     
I personally am in *love* with metaphors. I think a metaphor is brilliant because not only does it allow you to answer the question with an image, but it allows the listener to add some of their own perception. (If I say ""Well there's a good side and a bad side"" then it's so blunt and badly structured. If I say ""This situation is a double-ended sword."" then it provokes imagery of a physical sword, and the struggles of holding it. I just love the power of metaphors)   

     
I digress. My point was; When thinking of a metaphor and saying it, I sometimes get accused of *stealing it* or being a *wise-ass*, when really I just want to present my solution (I only give solutions if they are asked for. Never otherwise.) in the form of a metaphor. How come famous people can get away with metaphors but to a layman like myself, we are either stealing them, or just *trying to be wise*?","1349050581"

I guess I was speaking more for general relationships.  Relationships where neither party is suffering from any form of PTSD.  In those cases, compromise sex is just sort of a nuisance if someone consents begrudgingly.  In cases like yours, compromise sex could be more a minor trauma.

I dated a super horny girl in college (multiple times per day), and she would honestly pressure me into sex at times.  I'd usually end up consenting just to get her off my back, but I never found the experiences traumatic or violating.  It's was more like just a small chore that I enjoyed once I got into.  Like going to see a movie for your partner, when you'd rather just stay in.  Like any of the other small compromises that people make to keep their partner's happy.  I guess that's because I wasn't abused in my life.

For an abuse victim, there should never be any pressure for unwanted sex.  But there should be a push to move passed their trauma.","1349050590"

* MSM account for 75% of HIV infections in 2009-2010 in Toronto ([source](http://www.actoronto.org/home.nsf/pages/hivaidsstatsto))

* In a study in Toronto in 2007, 28% of MSM reported having unprotected anal sex with a casual male partner at least once in the six months prior to the survey. ([source](http://www.catie.ca/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-gay-men-and-other-men-who-have-sex-men))

* Based on 2008 national HIV estimates, sex between men may have accounted for the HIV infection of 33,360 men ([source](http://www.catie.ca/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-gay-men-and-other-men-who-have-sex-men))

* At the end of 2008, an estimated 19% of MSM living with HIV remained undiagnosed. ([source](http://www.catie.ca/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-gay-men-and-other-men-who-have-sex-men))

That gives a fairly high risk factor to a relatively small (gay men comprise an estimated 2.1% of the population) population.  Until 100% accurate, immediate HIV testing is developed, blood donor clinics simply must exclude MSM.

Look, a lot of gay men that I know are intelligent, wise, careful people.  But, I also know a significant number of gay men who think they are immortal and aren't always careful and don't think that they'll catch HIV anyway (at least not because of 1 or 2 unprotected hookups).","1349050591"

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","About 10 years ago a friend of mine had invited me and a few other friends over to her apartment for some drinks and movies.  It was the first and only time I was ever there and as soon as I walked in it just felt bad.  After everyone was talking for a bit she told me I could drop my stuff (purse, coat) in her room.  I was terrified to walk down the hall alone and it made no sense seeing that the apartment was pretty small... so I made myself do it.  I ran past the bathroom but on the way back I was stopped, I couldn't move and it felt like electricity was running through me.  I saw the bathroom only it looked different, like it was from the 70's (different wallpaper/tiling/lighting).  Some girl was dead in the bathtub with incredibly long black hair over her face and the side of the tub.  What started to really mess with me was for some reason I think the girl ""noticed"" me seeing her because she started to slowly move in the tub like she was going to get up.  Suddenly i could move so i ran into the living room, which was seriously about 3 feet away.  I asked my friend about her apartment feeling ""weird"" the next day and all she told me was that she was the first renter ""since like, the early 90's or something"" because there had been ""problems"" and before that nobody was in it since the 70's;  the landlords decided it was best left alone.  The only reason she was even offered the place was because it was her best friend's parents who owned the house.  She also added that she would run past the bathroom to get to her bedroom  because she always felt like someone was ""watching.""  I sometimes still try to find info on the place but come up with nothing.","1349050593"

This gave you a $7.50 profit each rotation. Being the good employee, I told my manager about the loophole. He promptly tried to get me fired from the job. He felt since I could figure these things out, I clearly was trying to steal from the company and I was a liability. Luckily the assistant manager (a good friend) stepped in and got the regional manager involved to save my job. Lesson learned.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Here is the best visualization I can offer. 

I took a couple of engineering drawing classes in pursuit of my EET degree. The first semester, we used different shades and styles of pencils, rulers, and other drafting tools to draw houses, circuits, etc. 

Then the second semester, we learned the same basic techniques using Autocad. It was interesting comparing our hand-drawn results with the computer-aided PERFECT drawings. I mean, snap-to-grid, and even line segments..it was unreal. 

That's what I think about when I think about SIN. God's standard is absolute perfection, which is impossible for humans. I can't even draw a straight line, much less live one. My life must look to God as crooked as one of those lines I tried to draw in class. Even with the best tools, when held against PERFECTION, my life is woefully inadequate. 

BUT, (and I was just studying this in Romans 4) when we trust God through faith in Christ Jesus for our righteousness, instead of God seeing our sin (our crooked lines) God sees Christ's in-line perfection. 

Or here's another analogy. A pastor once told me sin is like a broken watch. A watch that's broken is unable to perform the function it was designed for. As humans, because of our broken relationship with God, we cant do, or be what God designed for us to be. Then, when the watch is repaired, it is ""redeemed"" and newly able to do what it was designed to do. Where the analogy breaks down here, is that instead of repairing the old watch (the old, carnal heart) God creates a new watch, which is better able to keep time with the Master. ","1349050605"

Alot can be done in four years, and you might bring up that Congress has been getting in the way of GITMO being closed. Yes, but Obama has had no issue overriding Congress before, and continues to threaten it, so that is a moot point. When one rules by edict, four years is more than enough time to make good on his biggest promise to the world.

I wonder how many black site prisons there are that we don't know about? You know, the ones that haven't been closed down either? To allow them to operate is condoning torture, because that is what goes on in those places.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It's actually a deep philosophical question: does freedom include the ability to remove your own freedom?

You have no right to remove freedom from somebody else. We both agree I think.

But if you're not alive, you have no freedom.

Therefore, to deprive someone of their choice to remove their own freedom, you preserve their freedom.

That's the way I see it. Life is full of edge cases.

Now if someone has terminal incurable cancer, you are preserving a little more freedom... and a heck of a lot of pain. In which case, the freedom is besides the point, and suicide should be ok.

But if someone is depressed, depression can be cured. The will to live for decades more, and happiness for decades more, is a large possibility. I don't see how or why I can condone suicide by someone who is depressed, and I, in the name of freedom, I find myself duty bound to prevent it whenever and wherever I encounter the scenario.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Hmm... ok I was a bit unclear in some ways. When I said 'redefining' what it is to be muslim, I meant what it means to non-muslims. In a community with no exposure to islam except through the local news, the violent factions are the ones who are are defining islam for those who have no real idea what islam is. Now, I know 'people should educate themselves!,' but the reality is people are 'educated' by the mass media. Now, I'm not saying to pretend the violent factions don't exist, but the moderate communities need to project and image that more accurately portrays who an average muslim is. Honestly, I think the movie Infidel was a great way of showing that your average muslim is no different than your average christian. There are many christian churches or communities who run television ads, or take advantage of the internet and social media. Based on my exposure to islam, the moderate communities are starting to do this and I think it's important they continue to do so. 

As for what individuals should do, basically just continue to be good people and reject and incursion of extremism into their community. At the local level, continue to let people know it is not okay. No one is going to convince a radical that they are wrong, but if a radical is deprived of power (through numbers), their effects will be lessened, but never completely eradicated (every political or religious belief has radicals). I think the most important thing individuals can do is reject, and marginalize, the extremists when they show up in the community. It's not an easy thing, but what is the alternative?

As I said, it's important the moderates continue to speak out, not to change the minds of the extremists, but to educate those who know nothing about islam. Honestly, I think most religions cause more problems than they solve, but I accept religion as a fact of life and I can only encourage people to embrace the positive tenets. It's disheartening to see a good person take the side of someone who is the same faith as them, solely because of faith. Which is usually why I try to appeal to muslims, because, as an outsider, my words don't usually carry as much weight (from my experience anyway - it's easy to dismiss me as a westerner, ignorant, or a bigot.)","1349050612"

New additions since last time: Mandelbrot fractal, I-beam, construction crane, Saturn.

Many of you requested more stud earrings last time..I'm still working on those.  Here are two that are coming up:

Windmill Stud Earrings http://imgur.com/sYLK6
Space Shuttle Stun Earrings http://imgur.com/td5uq

I've been having a little trouble with these two recently.  The windmill dimensions need tweaking...the glue always seems to seep out and fixes the blades (I want them to be able to rotate).  And the space shuttle is ridiculously hard to paint right (the black parts) since the piece is so small.  

Comments, suggestions, requests welcome =)  Thanks in advance!

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","We're not going out but we're taking it slow.  I consider this guy my first serious love because our feelings for each other are quite mutual and we've been close for a long time. 

I met him in Year 6 (6th Grade) when he transferred from his home country to Australia. Back then we were just in the same class and we used to talk a little bit. We used to walk home with each other, running under tunnels and through fences. I loved it back then- simpler times. I didn't think much of him back then; I thought he was cute but I was too busy with other people. 

In Year 7 we were in the same music/art/science/TAS/PDHPE classes and I was disappointed to learned that he had moved in Year 7. I wanted to walk with him again. We didn't talk much after that but in Year 8 we were in the same language class and we would help each other out all the time. He gave me guitar picks and held my books several times. We used to talk frequently on MSN about gaming and several times I taught him how to play certain MMOs. At the end of Year 8; my attraction to him had expanded but we stopped talking.

Throughout Year 9 (Freshman year) we hadn't talked. I saw him several times and I often hid. I took a picture of him and his best friend at our Athletics carnival and I saw him perform on our school feast day. I saw him sitting with one of my friends so I assumed he had liked her; so I backed off. Then he got close with another girl and I just hid in the background because I didn't want to disrupt them. Turns out he hadn't liked neither seriously ahah. At the end of Year 9 (Dec 2011) we started to play on a minecraft server together by coincidence. He built a house near mine and we started talking again.

March 2012 (Sophomore/Year 10) hit me with a big epiphany. Was this crush that was ongoing since Year 8... Just a crush? Or do you love him. I shrugged it off for a while; the thought still lurking in my head. We talked a bit during a Year 10 careers week thing. I showed him a website I had helped make and he showed me what his group was doing (Music). Then we didn't talk much until late July this year. We started to talk and we continued to try to talk during school. He suggested anime for me and I did the same back. He started to take my bus home and we would talk a lot more in the afternoon.

He preformed again at this year's school feast day and he was amazing. He blew everyone away. We hung out a lot during that day. We both participated in a school Sleepout and I helped him keep warm for most of the time. From 4 - 6:30am we cuddled underneath a sleeping bag (Sitting down!) to keep warm. We started to call each other weird pet names. Psyduck, chipmunk, pikachu, Ash. We also started to call each other Darling and honey jokingly.

Yesterday we went to see Looper with each other... (so a date? But we don't see it as one) We held hands and shared popcorn throughout the movie, laughing at scenes that weren't funny at all. We ate sushi afterwards and walked to the music store and looked at the albums. We hugged and then left ahah.

We're going to our school formal together and I'm excited. He is my best friend, he is different and I like that. We know that we have mutual feelings for each other (from friends) but we're taking it slow :)","1349050615"

The 3D worked well and wasn't goofy or hamfistedly crammed into the action.

The story was exciting, and Dredd was hilarious because his facial expression was always the same. The rookie character was intriguing as well. The deaths (of which there were many) were satisfying and nothing disturbed my immersion in the movie, however, if you have a weak stomach, it might disturb its contents.","1349050615"

Do you have any wiring diagrams? Pics of them?

MidDayGamer is probably correct about the Ford style solenoid. This is probably making the click, but you need to make sure the power is getting to the starter and that power is going to and coming out of the solenoid.

Two thoughts:

* Check the condition of the connections and wires. Given that it has been sitting any small mammal can and will eat wires.

* Your starter could be frozen from lack of use. You could tap on it with a hammer to maybe shake it loose. It's best to use a deadblow, plastic hammer, or wood mallet so that you do not damage the magnets inside the starter. If you only have a metal hammer then don't hit thwe starter with full force. Be relatively gentle. If you break the magnets then you'll have to rebuild or replace it.","1349050619"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","I was raised as a Unitarian Universalist. I've found that one's experience of it can vary a lot depending on the individual church. Some UU churches are very atheistic/agnostic, while others draw more on Christianity. 

Unitarian Universalist churches are great communities for people that can't deal with the dogma or faith of other major religions. The focus is on moral teaching, social service, etc.

Something that I don't like about Unitarian Universalism is the emphasis on spirituality, but YMMV.

Here are the 7 principles which are foundational to the faith:

    The inherent worth and dignity of every person;
    Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;
    Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
    A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
    The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
    The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
    Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

I don't mean to sound like a pervert, but I was listening to LoveLine and my brain was in other places. 

But I would just talk to her. Tell her that this is important to you, so it should be something she thinks about. She is stuck with her family one way or the other, but she could loose you if she doesn't start taking your feelings seriously. 

You may not want to have that talk with her, and I understand. But what is your other option? You just deal with it, and bottle up your feelings? Smells like a bad marriage at that point. 

It may not be fun, but it's better than the alternative.

EDIT:( Forgot to suggest a way to bring this up) Really just sit with her and talk. Look her in the eye and ask her if she cares about you, and develop the conversation from there. Don't do it in a guilt-inducing manner or anything, just try to express how you feel about her actions, and try to make her see it from your perspective. 
I'm sure you will figure out a way to articulate all of that, just be sure not to come across as angry, and don't focus too much on how much it hurts (let her know, but don't keep repeating how bad you feel or how much it hurts you. It will probably make her defensive, which will just start an argument.)
Try and be calm and nice. She may not know that this hurts you, and she shouldn't be 'punished' for something she is oblivious to. Once she knows but continues it anyway, that's a different story. 

Best of luck!","1349050627"

Replacing Google eventually was arguably necessary for strategic purposes. But swapping out a working product for one which is a severe downgrade, presenting it as an upgrade, all the while knowing it wasn't ready? That's deception in advertising. What's worse is they knew people would find out the truth once iOS 6 shipped, but they went ahead with the ruse anyway.

What I mean is...blue switches are amazing for typists, but not great for all purpose gaming. Buying a keyboard that is really only good for one thing is a bad idea unless you are really nuts over one switch. I own both a blue, and two reds, and I don't use the blue any more because some games feel awful with it. For eg. It's very difficult for me to deploy my parachute in BF3 because blue switches are really bad for double tapping because the hammer must come up before re-contact.

All in all, brown and red are the two best switches if you are a normal user who does a lot of different things. If you play nothing but Starcraft and type shit on reddit, then, yea, blues are fine.

Being alone with a man, then a naked man, then giving him a blowjob, she gradually worked her way up to recreating the situation but in a context where she was choosing it and completely in control. It helped her a lot. I think that's amazing.

A few examples of this would be when he and his pre-schism X-force team stormed the purifier base where Bastion was, and Bastion said somethings to the like of ""The probability of your victory is small"" Until Wolverine went into rage mode running through the laser/repulser beam Bastion was using being torn to shreds, and Bastion only got away because he could fly. Example number .02- In the story arc where Wolverine kills (Spoilers) Sabertooth. After Sabertooth kidnaps Wolverine they crash the Plane in to a ball of fire, and are just muscle and bone, but STILL fighting. You might've notest that i'm a big wolvie fan, and can be biased, but really, Wolverine has a healing factor and Iron Man doesn't. ","1349050638"

It is the concept of my consciousness coming to an end. My only way of looking at the universe is through my own eyes. The universe may objectively exist but my only way of knowing about it is through my senses.

The idea of death being like going to sleep, a sleep you never wake up from, terrifies me. It means I won't experience the world any more, and I like the world. It has good things in it, like nachos and kittens. The entire world being replaced with a desire to die as I reach the end of my natural life, to seek out a rest from a state of existence that I currently love is terrifying.

I have occasionally feared the concept of judgement in the afterlife but I consider myself a good, moral person. I find it hard to believe in the classical view of hell, because an all loving God wouldn't damn people for all eternity for actions within a tiny lifetime, and if he did he is not the God he claims to be. If there is judgement in the afterlife then I am ready for that, for good or for ill. 

It's definitely the nothing that terrifies me.

The worst part is... it's not a fear like ""argh! Spiders!"" or ""Argh! a crazy mugger with a knife!"" it's fear like... like an emptiness. I looked in on my own soul, on my own existence, and saw a future where I no longer existed, unable to know about it. It's... existential fear. It makes me question everything. After all, my entire experience of life is from within this meat-sack I inhabit. Behind these eyes, using these hands.

Before I was born there was nothing of my existence. After I die... what will there be?

That thought, the possibility the two will mirror... it's just so... worrying. My consciousness will stop. The train of thought will terminate. I will die.

These are thoughts I have to put up with when I try to sleep.

Hugs are appreciated. Very. Very much so. ","1349050646"

If the answer is ""yes,"" I'll answer your main question of whether or not the military is a viable temporary option to college.

The answer is resoundingly ""yes."" After three years of active duty service, public college will be essentially free through the GI Bill. In fact, you'll be rolling in dough with the BAH stipends. In the state of CA, if you're a veteran, you're also considered an independent. When they calculate your tuition based off income, they won't count your parents' income and you'll be making less than $80k - which means, they'll cover your tuition. Any money paid from the GI Bill into your tuition fees get refunded to you. So, you get BAH plus tuition coming back at you. Bottom line, I can get somewhere in the range of $2,000/month for school. Not bad!

Money aside, the military is an excellent option to work and experience life before college. I've lived both lives, and I've noticed that many other students are just drones in class. With your real world experience, you can bring something tangible and an angle of analysis. That's a big plus for your grades, your character and overall just 'life' satisfaction.

If you go into the Air Force, I would look into doing something computer science related. They'll train you to learn various programming languages, and in fact, there are a lot of AF folks who get out and make $100K in the civilian world with their skills. Get a security clearance and you'll be set. If you decide to go to college afterwards, college will be just a bit easier.

Good luck!

"breakingbad","t5_2rlw4","Ok, a bit late to the party but here's my theory FWIW...

First off, I would describe my attitude to Walt as 'ambivalent'. He's made some dodgy choices, done some terrible things, yet I can't help but admire his tenacity and pragmatism. 

In the beginning, when he is clearly the underdog, it's easy to root for him. Then as we witness his steady evolution into Heisenberg, we see him start to cross the line. We begin to feel differently about him, we question his choices more and more. We ask ourselves *""What would I do differently?""* 

That line is different for all of us. For me it was [spoiler](#s ""what happened to Jane""), for others it may be [spoiler](#s ""the Lily of The Valley""), but the line *is* crossed - again and again. It becomes harder to root for him each time it happens -*yet we still want to!* Taking this journey with Walt makes us *care* about him, yet we still judge him by our own yardstick, and the yardstick is different for all of us.

The same sort of ambivalence can be related to *all* the other main characters in BB. We see their motivations and drives (and all the ambiguities) just as clearly as we see Walt's, **but** his arc is by far the most powerful driver of the story. BB is *his* story, so even as we witness his gradual descent (into...what?) *we still want him to get away with it all!* 

Now, here's the thing: We're allowed and indeed *encouraged* by the writers to feel uncertain about Walt's actions and choices. So why shouldn't we feel the same conflicted ambivalence about Skyler's?

When she [spoiler](#s ""forced him to move out""), I felt Walt's annoyance and anger. *""Why does she have to be such a bitch?""*, I thought. But this emotion I felt wasn't anger at her for doing something morally *wrong*, it was anger at her for *frustrating* Walt's desires! 

When she [spoiler](#s ""fucked Ted, and later gave him the money"") I could understand her intentions and the justifications *why* she did it, but I was still pissed-off at her because she was *disloyal to Walt.* 

So, although we know Skyler's actions are justifiable, perhaps even *forgiveable* for a woman under extreme pressure, we're still *mad* at her because she's foiling the plans of the character we relate to the most.

**TL;DR We're so close to Walt, that we don't like it when someone frustrates him, even if they happen to be right.**","1349050652"

Which isn't even the point. 

It being easier to get into doesn't justify the preference Todai has for male candidates and the lack of effort on their part to attract female students. Contrary to the standard Japanese method of dealing with complex and difficult issues, something CAN be done.

Basically, it goes like this:

1. Melody Pond is born at Demon's Run and is kidnapped by Madame Kovarian (S06E07)
2. Melody is raised by Kovarian (and the Silence?) as an assassin, her one purpose being to kill the Doctor.
3. At some point as a child, she escapes the orphanage where she's being held by the Silence, and regenerates for the first(?) time.  (S06E01 &amp; S06E02)
4. In her new body, still as a child, she befriends young Amelia Pond, who she knows is her mother, as Mels.  She is instrumental in getting Amelia and Rory together (since she knows they have to get together in order to have her).  She then follows them and hitches a ride in the TARDIS with the intention of killing the Doctor; the events of *Let's Kill Hitler* ensue, where she regenerates into her River form. (S06E08)
5. She studies to become a Doctor of Archaeology(?).  When she completes her Doctorate, Kovarian and the Silence recapture her, and send her to Lake Silencio to kill the Doctor. (S06E12)
6. The events of *Wedding* occur - River ""kills"" the Doctor, time falls apart, River marries the Doctor. (S06E13)
7. River is sent to prison for killing the Doctor.  She regularly breaks out and/or is broken out by the Doctor to go on adventures.
8. The events of *The Pandorica Opens*/*The Big Bang* occur (speculative placement) (S05E12 &amp; S05E13).
9. The events of *The Impossible Astronaut*/*Day of the Moon* occur (""present River"") (somewhat speculative, I guess it could be before TPO/TBB) (S06E01 &amp; S06E02)
10. The events of *The Time of Angels*/*Flesh and Stone* occur (must occur post-TPO/TBB) (S05E04 &amp; S05E05)
11. The scene with River &amp; Amy at the end of *Wedding* takes place immediately after *Flesh and Stone*. (S06E13)
12. River is pardoned, since all records of who she killed seem to have vanished.
13. The events of *The Angels Take Manhattan* occur. (S07E05)
14. The events of *Silence in the Library*/*Forest of the Dead* occur.  River dies. (S04E08 &amp; S04E09)

If they do nothing to stop the clock (incomplete pass, time out, step out of bounds with the ball) the time continues to run.  Since you get this time before each play, and you get four downs (four plays) on offense, if the offense has the ball with under 2 minutes, they can run the clock out.  They kneel down, essentially rushing for -1 yards.  This is to prevent fumbles or interceptions which would allow the other team another chance.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","What you intend to do with it is very important. If it's just for basic photo editing, you don't need much. Grab an am3+ 880G motherboard as cheap as you can. They run between 50 and 65 bucks new. Before you buy one, check if it supports ""core unlocking"". Why? Because there is a VERY good chance the 560 x2 you have is actually an X4 in disguise. They binned tons of good X4's as X2's to meet demand on the low end, and of the couple dozen X2's I've used core unlocking on, I've only had -1- that couldn't run all 4 cores (even then, it ran 3 beautifully and overclocked). Unlocked and overclocked to about 3.5ghz with a decent cooler (hypercool 212) and you've got yourself a damn nice computer.

Why an 880g? Because it's got an onboard GPU that is reasonably powerful. If you don't intend to play the latest games on this computer, an 880g is perfect for basic NON-GAMING use. It'll play 1080P video without flinching, can handle light gaming (emulation, basic ""silly"" games, and even some harder games if you're ok with low settings - it'll run starcraft 2 on low settings well enough to enjoy). If you ever change your mind on the gaming end of things, grab a video card and you're golden.

If you're intending to game with it, different story. Obviously you'll need a video card, and that means really you don't need the 880g. In that case, just pick ANY random AM3+ board - grab one from a decent manufacturer like gigabyte or asus or msi. Anything in the sub-60$ range will be fine, or if you ever intend to crossfire/run sli you can bump up closer to the 100$ mark and pick up a higher end 990. Either way, they are pretty damn cheap. 

Bonus points too because the AM3+ board supports the newest AMD dozers and next gen chips, meaning an upgrade is not terribly expensive. Of course, if your 560 unlocks to an X4 and runs 3.5ghz like almost every other one I've seen, you might not need to bother. It'll run pretty decently in specs compared to the latest dozers, and should feel pretty damn chipper for several years into the future.

So, WITH a kickass video card, it'd look like this (if you don't intend to game, remove the video card and this whole thing is pretty dirt-cheap):

That's -with- a nice SSD to put your windows install on, and covers all your major bases. The SSD is the single-best thing you can do here, since it'll make EVERYTHING massively faster. I used the Antec 300 since it's basically the ""default"" budget build case. It has all the fans etc you need, is simple to use, and costs next to nothing. I picked the PSU at random, it's a decent corsair 500w unit and will handle everything just fine - if you don't need the video card you could shave a few dollars off here, but not enough to make it worth it. 

So, take those parts, fire up bios on the first boot and try the core unlocking. If it works and you're familiar with BIOS feel free to kick yourself up to 3.5ghz or beyond there. If you're not familiar with bios, boot into windows and use AMD overdrive to overclock - so easy a caveman could do it. A bit of optimization for SSD use (get rid of the page file etc, google this stuff, it'll take an hour to get everything set up right) and the whole computer will scream. Make sure you install windows 7 64 bit so you can utilize your ram. Enjoy.

If you want to shave things down to bare essentials, get rid of the SSD and video card, you'll be sitting at 200$ for a full blown running computer.","1349050667"

Think of it like this.  When I see a profile, I see data.  I see data about a human being.  But thats all it is, data.  Its not a human.  Its just criteria that doesn't allow me to form some kind of attachment to different parts of their personality and who they are. When I see ""smoker"" in text, I just nope right on out because I haven't formed any semblance of an emotional attachment.  

SOme one that I meet in real life becomes more than data.  They become a real person.  I'm when I form even the friendliest of emotional attachments to them, I am way more likely to deal with their flaws.   

We all do it.  I'm just conscious that I do it.   

(That said, I am not so detached to NOT treat them like human beings or realize that they are.  I'm just not interested in them as potential partners.  I have to have a perfect set of data for that.)

&gt; translated into widespread violence. I'd like to know more about this.

Its..  Really bad, actually.  :(  Really, really bad.  [Check this out](http://www.transgenderdor.org/about-2) and then head to the 2012 page.  All these are transpeople who have been murdered due to transphobic violence.  At least, they are the ones we know of.  

On a personal level, I have been harassed, beaten, and raped (although I don't think the rape was from transphobia, pretty sure the asshole was way too high on something).  The sad thing?  I have a mild experience compared to some...  :(  

The dating violence is at a stupid high rate.  Thats why I DO suggest disclosing a trans status before becoming intimate, but AFTER one trusts the person to, at the very least, not flip a shit.  ","1349050668"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","You wore your rim out. That's pretty common. Most rims have some kind of wear indicator, either a line all the way around or a couple of small dots. You need to keep an eye on the wear indicator, and when the rim material is worn down enough that you can no longer see the indicator, it's time to throw it away and replace it. There is a hollow area in most rims, so if you wear the braking surface too thin it will crack. I've done that to a couple of rims from riding a lot in the city in bad weather. 
You can help avoid this by cleaning off your rims braking surface regularly. Also, inspect your brake pads from time to time. It's pretty common to have little chunks of metal stuck in them. If you see metal chunks in your brake pads, pick them out with something sharp. ","1349050670"

Obviously that's at your discretion and as far as I can tell, you guys have been doing a great job - I'm just worried that new members of the community might be pushed out because their questions are seen as troll-ish or reposts when they're just new to reddit and need real advice.

It's a tough line to walk, with a community as volatile as this, but please bear in mind that being new doesn't necessarily mean that someone's a troll - my whole problem with the original post was that it didn't specify that a ""new account"" was one that was a troll - it made it seem as though all new accounts were not welcome, which is clearly not the case.

What better way to celebrate our freedom to vote than granting voters a paid holiday? :)

I guess you've gotten that the gist of this proposition is doing something to improve voter turn out rates and, by extension, the whole nation.

I feel very blessed to be given a second chance to be a parent. The only thing that gave me hope is that my mother was able to have my sister and I. She did have two miscarriages, but the fact that she could carry a child to term gave me some hope. I have pretty much followed in her path with my issues (other than the miscarriages). I had the same line of symptoms over the same timeline. I worry about my sister who is two years older and she hasn't started a family yet but wants one.

It is amazing that they can't figure out what causes it. There is never any knowing what it can do. I had several doctors tell me I *should* be on pain medication, but they wanted someone else to prescribe it. I had one doctor say I was only supposed to take it when I had my period, which was fine with me, she would give me 10 days at a time. When I went in she acused me of taking it more...I explained my period WAS 10 days that month. She replied that wasn't normal...but that was the reason I went to her in the first place. It basically was pushing me to a hysterectomy because living with the pain was no longer an option. I live in fear of what will happen after I have my daughter. I got into a state where I wouldn't trust my doctors to help me. It took my husband explaining how much it hurt him to see me suffer, to make me realize that I needed to speak up. I don't know what will happen, but I know that I want to explore as many options possible to keep my womanly parts until I am done having kids.

Just like everyone else, I think you should keep the rest of your accessories pretty neutral. You can do black tights, short colorful ankle socks or long black thigh highs could work.

Shoe-wise: oxfords in black or leopard. Creepers, doc martin style combat boots, loafers, ankle boots (studded is an option) or closed wedges.


If you want to wear something over it, I think either a forest green or light blue cardigan would compliment the color scheme on the painting. 


You could also try adding some collar pins like [these](http://www.etsy.com/listing/108055679/gold-studded-spike-chain-collar-pin). Or even [these statement earrings from romwe](http://www.romwe.com/pink-drop-earrings-p-47077.html). I think in general anything metal and studded would look great with this dress :)

You don't mention from where the blood is coming, but if its in the penis somewhere (i.e. coming out the urethra like semen or urine would) than you need to talk to a doctor. If you tore or injured something in there it's asking for an infection. Urine is sterile only until it hits the urethra. There's usually some bacteria around in the urethra.

If you do have an open wound in there somewhere you risk infection that you won't know about and the complications from that can be very serious.

I understand that its embarrassing, but doctors are duty bound to keep things confidential. If it turns out to be nothing, your doctor doesn't need to share the details with your parents. If it's serious, it is going to come out one way or the other, so better to head it off now than down the road when the complications could be serious.","1349050686"

And then, because you are angry, you lash out and do something stupid (break something new or cherished for example) which ... pisses you off further. It's a vicious cycle.

Being the lazy sod he is, my doctor put me on clonidine tablets to calm me while on the dex. For the most part, it works, I just need to remember to take them. Usually these days I do pretty well with it, but I don't actually handle it pretty well. Shutting down is not coping.

Honestly, other than exercise (I run. It's great as it's a full-body exercise that takes 110% effort, as well as the metaphor of running away from your problems. It helps me a lot) I haven't much advise. Running does the trick for me in so many ways, but I understand it's not for everybody.

South Africa seems to be on track to be the model for others to follow. I really am encouraged by the fact that the hot debate in that country is over living conditions, wages, and corruption in government rather than about ideological symbols such as blasphemy like it is today in northern Africa. The USA's big uptick (in the 1940s) was after the discussion turned to those issues that it's now turned to in South Africa.

I think that once the problem is defined properly, then it can be solved... but until people have established what they need to solve, they won't make much headway.

It's interesting how the institution of self rule (aka ""democracy"") is only the beginning of the struggle.

"electronics","t5_2qhue","I value my free time at ~$25/hr.  If I can do something quickly at the risk of breaking things, it's well worth my time to trash it and move on.  The cost of components is typically in the order of $10/board for the kind of stuff I do (AVR + Header + some passives + whatever interesting thing I want to do is).  I typically print two copies of anything I do, since there's really no cost difference.

I take a little offense at the ""never learn a damn thing"" that way, since before recently, I used to go spend time designing schematics, laying out boards carefully, checking them, meditating on it, sending them off to get them printed, five days later, getting the boards back, checking them, carefully applying all the solder paste, temperature-control reflowing the parts, then incrementally testing my code.  I maybe did four complete designs a year.

Sure, I learned things, but I did so slowly.  Now, I print boards at home and blast through probably a project a week on average.  I've learned to interface to more chips in the last year than in my entire experience up until then.

Here's an example.  I can design a schematic, and carefully check it, PCB-ize it and carefully check it again, make sure I have it all right and get it professionally printed.  This typically takes ~16 hours, plus however long it takes for the boards to come back, and typically costs ~$60.  Populating, programming, testing typically takes another 1 hour.

Alternatively, I can design a PCB without any schematic and print it without checking it ~2:40 hours.  I can print two copies at home in about 30 minutes (and about $2 in costs), and spend another hour and get it wrong.

I could get it wrong _four times_ before it would take more time/$$ to do it the /wrong/ way.

On average, I get about 3/5 of my designs wrong, or fry them on the first try.  Even if 100% of my designs that take 17 hours work, that (geometric series time) means on average I spend only 7 hours getting a working design.  For small, simple projects, i.e. a processor, two smart parts, maybe a USB interface, it's 240%* better to throw science at the wall.

*Mileage may vary, numbers may not accurately reflect reality.

I do fully accept that if I were to be using boards that cost in upwards of $100-$200 after population, I would have to actually follow a good bit more of a system.","1349050688"

"history","t5_2qh53","&gt;Yes, there were not as big as Alexander or the Mongols or the British empires, but you might think of them as exeptions.

Mayhaps the rule, for the Spanish, Russian, Persian, Roman and other empires existed as well, and outside the Mali Empire there was rarely a big political unity in Africa.

&gt;Categories like development or historical importance are hard to compare.

Not so much really. Take their knowledge of the world, life expectative, literature, political organization, military inventions and organizations, astronomy, art evolution, city size, agricultural landmarks, sophistication of jobs and stuff like that and compare them. Not always do African empires fare worse than their European, American, or Asian counterparts, but it's not a so subective thing to compare.

&gt;What is historical significance? Significant to whom? Charlemagne is important for Europe, but there are rulers who are important for some parts of Africa.

Europe's history, due to colonialism, is exceptionally signifacnt for most of the world really. My country was conquered by an European nation, so I know of the Kings of Europe, if my country had been conquered by an African nation, I would know of the Kings of Africa. Kind of the way people in Mexico and Poland know a bit about the history of the United States, (as the world's first economy and lone superpower for a couple of decades), but people in Poland might not know who the president of Mexico is and viceversa.","1349050693"

"GreekLife","t5_2s7y5","As a PAN exec member, sorority member, and now alum member who has watched chapters close and experienced a girl lying to us about her association with a sorority here's my advice.

If you joined for the reasons you state you joined for, then you will get involved with your houses alum association.  Unless you were closed and they did not give you alum status (which happened on my campus, they were allowed to rush other houses but of course no one took them). If given alum status PLEASE get involved they will accept you with open arms and help you experience things.

**But to pledge your devotion and love of the core values of a house then renounce it because you can't go to bid nights or social events within the greek system is the reason we do not allow you to switch** Your membership to a Greek org is not like a video game where you can restart when something goes wrong.  I know you wanted a different experience but you can grow a lot from this one.

Last thing:
A girl joins Alpha Alpha chapter at a midwestern school, she transfers home after losing her membership in Alpha Alpha chapter.  She then attempts to join Beta Beta (my house) without disclosing her initiation to Alpha Alpha.  We go to do paperwork, and end up in hot water with Alpha Alpha and National PAN.

"progmetal","t5_2s3pe","I'll address all of these individually.

Pain of Salvation - It was a hard choice to choose Scarsick over The Perfect Element because I love both of those albums equally. To me it just came down to choosing two albums that showed off the eclecticness (sp?) of the band. If I was going to choose two albums that showed the PoS sound I would've chosen Remedy Lane or The Perfect Element, but after Road Salt 1 and 2 I'm not sure if they will ever return to ""that sound"".

Dream Theater - Those choices for me where quite simple actually. Scenes is obviously a fantastic album and a must listen to for all DT fans. Whereas Octavarium just encompasses all of the different Dream Theater sounds (at this current time) in one whole album. Their sound has changed a lot since Awake and Images so I felt that choosing something newer might be good to reflect their current state of music.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I'm especially interested in the rationales you give them for doing ""the right thing."" 

Empathy and reciprocation are the main ones. 

Other things come in here or there but they tend to boil down to either a more abstract form of reciprocation or a generalized empathy.

My kids have no trouble understanding empathy, even when they were quite tiny. Reciprocation they learned well before school\*. In fact all the basic lessons that pre-school children should learn - taking turns, sharing, playing nice - they're the root of a great deal of morality.

They were astonished to discover on starting school that not only did a lot of kids not even know the alphabet, let alone some basic reading and writing, but that a lot of them had no concept of either empathy or reciprocation (... and it turned out the very worst ones were from the most religious families).

Please take a look at who created the first major alien movie which was highly popular. What was this film? It was ‘Alien’ by CBS FOX! How about Austrian Nazi, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s film ‘Predator’? Predator comes from CBS FOX! Who are CBS FOX? They were the creators of the Nazi propaganda films for the Nazis (National Socialists and Labor Zionists [Sabbatean Frankists]). Where did all the UFO technology come from? It was by men in the Nazi Party not aliens or any other veils given. Study who control Argentina and how important this region is especially with the nearby pole area for global control. CBS FOX is openly connected with Knight of Malta, Rupert Murdoch and also Marc Rich of Glencore, a puppet of Knight of Malta, George H.W. Bush who controls the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst Americas for the Dachau, Bavaria power.

The DVD are the ones who protect and shield the old Nazis via the Directorate for Intelligence division of the Central Intelligence Agency. Please remember that the Nazis were brought out of Nazi Germany and into the Americas aided by the Order of Malta and Vatican utilizing the Dragonovic Ratlines and Operation Paper Clip. Even Hitler was moved out of Germany on two separate aircraft into Spain and then out via the second submarine into Argentina. He did not die in Argentina in the  1960s as claimed by some, Hitler died decades later in the State of Maryland.

The Nazis aid the conditioning and mind-re framing of the Global populace through their Stanford Research Institute combined with Hollywood. Both working for the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations for social engineering and hoodwinking. The Stanford Research Institute was founded by Nazis, Helen Van Damme and Otto Von Bolschwing. You will constantly be bombarded by alien myths and propaganda for a long time to come ready for the next Nazi hoax of the Alien contact or invasion. This will make the hoax of the Moon landing look like childs play. The New-Age movement will continue to hoodwink people searching for knowledge and it was mastered by Jesuit soldier Pierre-Teilhard de Chardin SJ.

For the gas to come out of solution, bubbles first have to *nucleate*, then *grow*. My off the cuff answer is that agitating the solution results in lots of small air bubbles forming inside the liquid, which then allow the nearby CO2 molecules to easily fall out of solution. Normally, it's relatively difficult for the bubbles to nucleate on their own (they have to overcome the surface energy barrier associated with forming a gas/liquid interface), but since these bubbles are already there, the CO2 can just diffuse into the gas volume and the surface tension keeps the bubble in tact. Once you stop shaking the bottle, the bubbles all rise to the top again. ","1349050727"

Books like *The Book Thief*, *Walk Two Moons*, *The Giver*, *The Joey Pigza Series*, *Out of the Dust*, *The House of the Scorpion*; all these I have read as an adult (or reread) and realized what a profound challenge it is to communicate complex issues on a simple level in a way that maintains the integrity of the subject.

The Holocaust (but so much more), grief (but so much more), political and social systems (but....you don't really need me here for this, do you?), ADHD and messed up parenting, talent and guilt in the face of poverty and despair, genetic engineering; I could go on and on!

My point is that good child and young adult fiction does this:  It takes the most complex and sticky problems there are and explains it to a kid.

are correct. What is true is that U(p^(n)) is isomorphic to Z\_{p^(n)-p^(n-1)}. This is actually nontrivial to show. We already know that U(p^(n)) has order &amp;phi;(p^(n)) = p^(n)-p^(n-1), where &amp;phi; is Euler's totient function, so proving the isomorphism we want amounts to proving that U(p^(n)) contains an element of order p^(n)-p^(n-1). Such elements are called [primitive roots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n), and they do not always exist (for example, you can check that U(8) contains only elements of order 1 or 2, though the order of U(8) is 4).

&gt; Hydrocracked/Hydroisomerized = API Group III base oils. Chevron, Shell, and other petrochemical companies developed processes involving catalytic conversion of feed stocks under pressure in the presence of hydrogen into high-quality mineral lubricating oil. In 2005, production of GTL (gas-to-liquid) Group III base stocks began, the best of which perform much like polyalphaolefin. Group III-base stocks are widely permitted to be marketed as synthetic motor oil with few exceptions where they are not allowed to be marketed as ""synthetic"" (for example, Germany).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_oil

&gt; Question:
Have Group 3 Base Oils Been Substituted for Better PAO Base Oils?
Why does Mobil 1 refuse to specify as to the base oil used in their synthetic products. I remember the Mobil 1 oils in the past proudly proclaimed that it was a PAO based oil. We all know the newer group 3 hydrocracked base oils are much cheaper to use than PAO based oils and are less stable in high temps. It would seem to me that if Mobil 1 still uses the better PAO base oils as their primary base oil, you would want to clarify it among those who are switching to other oils because of the ongoing internet talk that says Mobil has substituted group 3 oils for the better PAO oils. Any comments that would clarify the issue?
-- Wayne Swicegood, Asheboro, NC

&gt; Answer:
As we're sure you can understand, ExxonMobil does not discuss formulations publicly,as this information is proprietary. We would rather focus on the advanced technology and proven performance that our engine oils and other products offer to our customers.  Mobil 1 is the world’s leading synthetic motor oil and the one chosen by more original equipment manufacturers around the world as factory fill.  We want those facts to speak for us so our customers feel confident they are getting a high quality, high performance product that provides ultimate protection to their vehicles.

However, given the vast strides in science that are being made, religion is being left behind and is sadly failing to cope. And, by starting to involve themselves in politics and science, are only going to ensure their inevitable failure as a existent group.

A belief in God is fine. A belief that a belief in God allows you to be ignorant, misinformed, or downright lied to isn't. Similarly with being beaten, or otherwise abused.

Yes, people may have mistreated Christians in the past. That doesn't change the fact that, right now, right here, there are Christians who are trying to get creationism taught as a scientific theory, or enforce bible studies or christian worship into schooling systems. There are Christians trying to bring prayer into common usage. And lets not even start on the ridiculous Sunday trading laws in the UK.

I'm not sure about the source of the top image, but the bottom image probably does not depict Iranian women. The burqa is not required in Iran, and is typically only worn in small, extremely fundie villages.

Up until the Ayatohllas seized power after the revolution of 1979, women in Iran were about as well off as in any other civilized country in the world, and only the very religious ones went around in any sort of hijab or other Islamic dress. 

Back in the 50s-60s, when ""free Christian women"" in the US were free to be secretaries, nurses, or teachers, Iranian women were doctors, engineers, and lawyers. It was not the average Iranian Islamic male that set the clock back for women, it was the Ayatohllas, who pulled lots of other shit to make the country at least as bad off as it was under the Shah who had just been overthrown.","1349050748"

&gt;We had like a 2 hour long conversation about our lives before i asked her to the movie, 

I hang out every week with a close male friend and we've watched movies together, have several classes together, and just talked about life. He even comes to Easter with my folks every year. Being close with a guy doesn't mean you like them as anything more than a friend. I'm in a 4 year relationship and he's had a gf during some of this.

&gt;and she kept using smiley faces

Sorry to say this means next to nothing for a lot of people. I use smiley faces with anyone I'm close to, they don't mean a thing.

&gt;oh god what am i doing

going out to the movies with a girl to get to know her better. If she seems to enjoy the evening ask her to go to dinner or something and use the word date. This doesn't have to end in disaster, it's just a terrible idea to ask someone on a date to an event that friends do together without using the word date.

"macgaming","t5_2rk3e","At least Aspyr is actually making games for Mac. Last time EA released a game for Mac (Battlefield 2142), they just stopped updating the Mac Version. It was crazy. It was a Cider/Wine wrapper of some kind and they could have just literally dragged and dropped the files from Windows into the .app and it worked and was up-to-date. But now with Mountain Lion the game is broken (the screen has weird strobing black lines). So after that experience, I almost prefer Aspyr stuff, even though they are not native ports.

As for price, it's just kind of the shitty reality of licensing. They probably paid Activision a buttload and have to be sure they can make that back.

Maybe Activision will learn something from Blizzard and make all their games Mac-ready on day one. C'mon Blizzard people, get promoted to CEO and shit.","1349050784"

All you have down is spewed unsupported nonsense. I am not trying to call you ignorant, dumb or lazy. But you have not presented any evidence. Really if you want to make your point you must support it with evidence.

Read the post above, it has a source. It explains what I was talking about. It is a meta data study, which collects data from a lot of studies.   If you went to the effort of reading it you would stop yammering an like you do. I don't think people above 18 should have to where a helmet. But your attitude is a perfect example of why the government does not think you are smart enough to raise your own children without a bit of regulation, thus most states require kids to wear helmets.

I can help you understand any part of the study that you like. But the conclusions are clear and follow from the data.

And please give me a source where people are bribing politicians. I would find that a really good read.

You are really doing more harm than good because you are misinterpreting reality or are just so stubborn that even in the face of overwhelming evidence that what you believe is correct is actually grossly inaccurate. If you can not get the basics of an argument down, telling me to do my own research when based on the post you are replying to I did makes me think you did not go to the effort of really reading the post.

&gt;Human engineering could also be liberty enhancing. In response to climate change, some people have proposed we adopt something akin to China's one-child policy. For example, a group of doctors in Britain has advocated a two-child maximum. But suppose that the relevant issue is some kind of fixed allocation of greenhouse gas emissions for each family. If so, given fixed allocations of greenhouse gas emissions, human engineering could give families the choice between having one large child, two medium-sized children or three small children. Human engineering seems more liberty enhancing than a policy that says you can have only one or two children.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Firstly, it is a joke that people jump on players for making clean, big hits these days; in the past, if somebody got lit up, it was because they had their head down or thought they could get by somebody and didn't; they take their hit, get up, realize it was their own damn fault, and skate off. I think it's a joke that people go after anyone that makes a big, clean hit anymore, and they should be punished extra for an unnecessary retaliation.

But other than those scenarios, the vast majority of fights are justified and worthwhile. Firstly, let me express why I love fighting: Hockey (aside from fighting-specific sports, but I have no desire to watch MMA where they roll around on the ground until someone gets armbarred) is the last medium in this country where two men can both consent to have a fight, fight until one goes down, and not have to go to prison or get sued. What is classier than that? Nobody is stomping on anybody's heads; the fight is typically over when one player goes down and loses. I find this beautiful, frankly.

The problem is that the NHL, due to the increasing fear of financial liability and lawsuits, is making an effort to contrive ways to police the sport outside the game, which hockey has never been that much about. Not only do they do it, but they do it inconsistently and ridiculously. It undermines the players' ability to keep others in check ON THE ICE.

What this means is that the justification for fighting will slowly diminish due to the NHL's interference until, when the last concussion breaks the camel's back, it will be eliminated. That is the day I will never again watch an NHL game; I hope it is not soon, but I fear it will be within this decade.

Fighting in hockey is valuable because it is one of the few opportunities for men to agree to a fight and settle it without fear of being arrested. It is part of the game. If you've played, you understand this. It is why the VAST majority of players are against banning fighting. It is a culture and tradition that will eventually be sacrificed because people are afraid of losing money (just like so many things).

Fighting must remain, but it won't.","1349050796"

&gt;…their profitability depends on the presence of the animals. The owners take every precaution against disrupting the natural habitat. Thus, tourists are fenced out at a distance close enough for viewing, while the animals are free to come and go, unlike in an aquarium or zoo.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I don't have a problem with people talking about words changing meaning. But I don't like when someone justifies their use of a word retroactively after watching South Park. What South Park did was examine culture in a nuanced and satirical way. Props to them on calling bikers faggots. But I won't give props to someone telling a gay person to ""get over it"" when someone calls them or someone else a faggot, even if they don't mean it as a remark concerning sexuality. 

And sure, anything could technically be offensive to someone. But I think there's a much more reasonable expectation concerning a word like ""faggot"" then calling a shirt white. When there's so many other words that can get across your displeasure at someone besides ""faggot"", why use it? There's a decent chance you're going to offend someone. At least more of a chance than calling a shirt the color that it is. 

I can't read your mind to know that your use of the word ""faggot"" is in part due to trying to overcome a stigma surrounding the word while also poking fun at your gamer buddy. When I hear ""faggot"" that isn't the first thing that comes to my mind. And even if for you that *is* the first thing that comes to your mind, I doubt the *other* definition is lagging far behind in your head. 

I just don't see the harm in showing some restraint in the word. I don't think calling your gamer buddies faggots automatically reclaims the word. Maybe if gay gamers began using the word, and only gay gamers, fine. But the straight kid screaming faggot isn't doing it in some righteous way. And who are they to even ""reclaim"" the word? It was never theirs to reclaim unless you've faced the possibility of being on the other negative end of the word. ","1349050801"

A few in-game behaviors from unrelated players, players that cannot be traced to OP, were good enough in my personal judgment to merit a gift in a currency that can't be used on anything else - this isn't charity money that is being denied from Doctors Without Borders or the local food bank.

And if you're wrong?  Somebody whose friend just died wants to reach out and thank a small handful of people that comforted him the moment it happened, and you want to shit on him because he didn't go out of his way enough to ""prove it to you"".  Except he posted the Summoner names, and then a replay with all of the correct Summoner names and a good amount of evidence, and *then* an article proving that a person of the correct age who went to the correct school died at around the correct time to line up with the story?

The bow of the ship looks like it has some steampunk themed potential which blends with the overall style nicely. The view from the stern makes me doubt this would be a gallente design, though. It looks closer to the rear of phantasm (sansha cruiser) minus the spikes and brutal aesthetic. It actually makes me with that this could be the design of the jovian ship that the Sansha reverse engineered to design the Phantasm*. The side and top views really show off the gallente side of the design, however. Overall, I like it and I'd love to see this and other fan made ship models more often added to eve for the artistic variety. If you make any more designs make sure you tell us!

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","As you get older you will probably start to feel that what you want is more important than what your family and friends think.  Try to imagine your life 10 years from now.  You'll be living on your own, and visiting your parents a few times a year, and your extended family even less often.  Chances are that some of your guy friends will drift apart (moving away, etc), and some will have families of their own (long-term girlfriends, kids, etc), so even though you guys will still socialize, spending large amounts of time ""hanging out"" will probably not happen.   I'm not trying to paint a bad picture, getting older is fun, but I'm trying to describe the way your life becomes more about *you* than the people around you.   

As for liking boyish things, and wanting to be friends with guys, these things don't make you any less trans, and you wouldn't have to give them up.   Being trans is about your body, it's about wanting a female body.   Other than that, you can have any personality you want, and if your current guy friends wouldn't treat you the way you want, then you can find new friends who will.  

Since your parents are not supportive, your top priority should be to start working, to saving money, and move out on your own.   This is a good goal whether or not you decide to transition, it's what becoming an independent adult is all about.  What I'm saying is, whether or not you will transition, your immediate goal is the same either way: make money, save money.   Once you make progress on that, your perspective on life will be different, and you'll be empowered to do what you want to do.   ","1349050809"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","CAPTCHAs basically work like this:

In order to identify the word, that the server used to generate the CAPTCHA image, in a subsequent request made by you (to submit the CAPTCHA solution), the server utilizes what is called a session.

A session is a mechanism to keep track of data, stored on the server-side, between subsequent requests made by you. The way the server typically identifies your session is with, what is called, a session-cookie, that was stored on your computer (in your browser).

A session-cookie is basically nothing more than a regular cookie (a small file that can store a small amount of data on your computer) with only a session-id as its data. This way, the server is able to store sensitive data on the server-side, while still being able to associate it with your requests. Because, with each subsequent request you make to that server, you send along this session-cookie, so that the server knows how to identify your session data with this session-id.

So, when the server generates the CAPTCHA image for you, it simultaneously stores the word that was used to generate the image in your session-data on the server-side. Then, when you submit the CAPTCHA solution, the server knows how to retrieve the word that matches the garbled word in the image, because it stored this word in your session-data earlier.

All it has to do now, is compare your solution with the stored word. When your solution doesn't match, the server typically discards the old word and regenerates a new image for you, reiterating the above described process.

**edit:** With reCAPTCHAs the added complexity of the process is indeed much [like hfbs described already](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/10pksq/i_always_wondered_this_about_captchas/c6fioqq).","1349050820"

Reddit hates hipsters yet cannot stop talking about them, anything culturally popular (Instagram, LMFAO music videos, dubstep, thick rimmed glasses) that redditors do not understand or like or feel that has been appropriated from them becomes part of this boogieman it's okay to hate and ends up as some twisted caricature that is filling Williamsburg.

The funny thing is that this ill defined over the top caricature created by those who hate it is probably going to become the image of the ""youth subculture"" of this period when future media starts making shows set during this time. It won't be the true and straight forward image of the period as shown in contemporary ""hipster shows"" like Girls, it will be full of fixie riding, thick rimmed wearing, portable vinyl carrying, moustache growing, white people discussing the recession between sets at an acoustic coffee house show, just like how modern media forever fills 80s references with frizzy haired shoulder pad wearing neon coloured synth-poppers doing cocaine while reagan speaks about the cold war.","1349050846"

This is all pre-Internet ubiquity days, so I hadn't heard anything about it, and because I'm wasn't a regular at the lodge, and everyone was so drunk, no one remembered.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","I don't know how invested you are in listening to music, but high quality music doesn't usually give itself up for free.

If you don't mind spending a lot of money, there's the vinyl route. However, the records are only as good as your setup. You need a good turntable, preamp, and speakers. Not to mention you have to clean the records. That all gets pretty expensive pretty quickly, but if you're really into music, vinyl sounds extremely nice.

If you're interested in paying less money, there's the torrent route. If you want the safest torrents (i.e. from viruses) and the highest quality music, look into a private tracker. You can get FLAC rips from CDs for most albums and a lot of the more popular albums have 24bit/96khz FLAC vinyl rips. You almost always have to keep up your seed/leech ratio to stay a member though.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No. It's not time to address this pseudoscience.  It hasn't harmed anyone.  It's time to address bullying and brainwashing.

It's just bullying.  It's no different than Michael Crowe being interrogated for hours.

So please don't bash pseudoscience.  People like pseudoscience because it makes them feel more comfortable, like horoscopes or the idea that gay people are just making the choice to be so.  Don't bash that.  Bash the people who force it on others.  The people who get paid to force their ideas on other.

"learnart","t5_2s6fc","Focus on body proportions and perspective. Do not draw from photographs or from your imagination/memory. Those sources have a place, but you have to learn how to draw from life *first*. 

I suggest looking for a figure drawing class (nude model) at a community college in your area. Most offer night classes if you don't have time during the day. Affordable price, and the hands-on experience is seriously invaluable.

If that's not something you're ready for, I suggest doing daily sketches from life. Sketch the backs of people's heads during class, commuters on the train, people sitting in a restaurant. Focus on just one area (like how their neck connects to the head, or how the shoulders bend), really stare at it and try to replicate it.

Examples: [one](http://www.dustinperkins.com/ashcan/wp-content/uploads/2009-12-05-Figure-Drawing-03.jpg) [two](http://www.frankstockton.com/uploaded_images/figure001-793076.jpg) [three](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs42/PRE/f/2009/068/7/5/Life_Drawing_sketches_by_Stingoray8u.jpg)

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;Threats are threats. A threat is a declaration of intent to inflict harm on someone else. Whether the person is actually capable of following through on the threat is unimportant to the definition of a threat

It's an act of coercion to elicit a response. If the threat isn't actionable then there is no coercion.

&gt;Furthermore, she gets so many threats. Who is to say that one of them doesn't figure out where she is and that one of them is just crazy enough to try something? Isn't 4chan in particular famous for its ability to ""dox"" people?

You're also assuming all threats are genuine threats, as opposed to someone simply trying to hurt someone's feelings.

&gt;Comments do count as threats and users who make threats on Xbox Live are banned.

That's XBox live policy, not the legal definition. XBox is covering their ass to avoiding any potential complicity in an actual event, which makes no sense to begin with. It would be like holding the paper company or post office responsible for threatening letters.

Imagine if you went to America, but stayed on your European schedule of sleeping, eating, etc. Who you go throw a hissy fit outside a McDonalds because they aren't on your schedule and won't let you in at 4 in the morning? I'd like to assume you wouldn't.

Riot has limitations beyond their own personal preference as well. They are renting out a venue, and that venue sets the times they are allowed to use it. Riot has no control over that. They may also be appealing to an American television station to show how many people they can get watching during America's prime time.

This alone changes the course of events that led up to him blowing all his money and getting married. His going back to kill Sara is actually a self fulfilling prophecy.

EDIT: From another thread. Sid doesn't realize that Sara is his mom until he loses it in the cornfield at the very end. So in the first timeline he thinks his mom is dead and that Sara is his aunt for the whole 30 years.","1349050868"

What the state is doing now is making this one thing illegal on the basis of protecting minors and removing their backing of this practice from those they have licensed..

That said. You are right the profession should be overseen by its own experts. Soo... this ban is actually long overdue and the fact that it was needed is ridiculous.. The APA (American Psychological Association) actually retracted their declaration that homosexuality is mental disease in the 60s. But that doesn't mean that a handful of psychiatrists (backed by the majority of society) didn't dispute that and offer therapy based on an old way of thinking... until today. But a cultural shift like this is slow and messy. It usually takes people in positions of leadership being replaced by hopefully more open-minded persons from coming generations etc.

When I'm in these types of situations, I don't necessarily shut down a girl I notice flirting with me but I always make it clear that I have a girlfriend and am very much committed to her, meaning I'm not interested in other girls. I also don't flirt with other girls, I am friendly and so is my gf, so we will both hold conversations with members of the opposite sex regularly. Which I appreciate a lot, we don't flirt, but we don't avoid or shut down the other sex completely. If guys hit on her when I'm not around she usually just tells me about how douchey they were and tells them to get lost or whatever, so neither of us flirt with others, but we are definitely comfortable and confident enough to still be friendly and sociable.

Guys like this are out there, we don't all flirt with everyone. You just have to find the one that kind of feels the same way about this as you do. That's what I did, er, what my girlfriend did. To appeal to your question.","1349050872"

So I made a trip back to my barbershop back home when I was visiting my parents and I asked my barber if he had any advice on finding a good place. He told me to look at his shop. It was a dingy, burnt out looking place in a dead strip mall, next to a laundromat. He informed me that he had bought this place when it was built back in the 70's and had been cutting hair ever since.

Found a similar place in my new town, two old geezers were in there, smoking and enjoying a beer with a couple of other old men, discussing porn. Got the best damn haircut of my life, and a free straight-edge shave to boot.

TL;DR, Look for the old, run down barbershops run by a couple of old guys. They have been working there for ages and will give a man a man's haircut, and do it the right way to your preference.","1349050874"

You only need 5 seconds of cloak time to avoid it entirely, which is the time granted by level one cloak. If you use more than level one cloak, it will not recharge in time to avoid the next super attack, because the cloaking device does not start to recharge until after the cloak is over. Level two cloak lasts 10 seconds and level three lasts 15, so level two cloak will recharge 5 seconds late and level three will recharge 10 seconds late.

Even if you have upgraded cloak past level one, only power it up to level one. Level three cloak is very useful, but using it in this particular fight will fuck you over.","1349050874"

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","I think breeders always look bigger than they are =).  The thing I love about them is that you can get just frags, put them in your tank and they look fantastic!  Helps keep the cost down as well.  I can look all day at those wonderful colonies but can't get any cause they wouldn't fit!  Instead a $10 or $20 frag looks just great!  

As ussual, the sump in my pride a joy (I get the feeling that sometimes we would rather have our sumps in the living room! hehehe).  I decided to go with a Plenum with this one.  1.5"" which is a bit larger than normal.  People say they don't do anything, but the sucess of the Dymico system (Dynamic Mineral Control), I figured I would use one.  Because I just used sign board to make the partition, there is a very very sight transfer of water there over time.  I will replicate that with my new setup by drilling a small hole in the plexi.  I went with the ""Slowly disturb"" your sand bed rather than taking the ""Don't touch it!"" approach.  I have nessisarus snails in there that turn over the sand slowly as they borrorw around, they also keep the algae down.  There is one turbo (Some species of turbo) down there to keep the glass clean and two hermits and a decorator crab to get any larger food particles that might fall down.  I use red halmedia (we think, no one knows what it is) as well for macro, although I started with Chaeto.  Chaeto is wonderful stuff, but it breaks down when you get below 5ppm nitrate in the water.  The Halmedia doesn't mind it so much.  

Above the pump I use this stuff called ""Bio Matting"".  Hard to discribe, but it this black squiggly stuff you use for filtration.  It has a great deal of surface area, so small particles just stick to it.  It is the perfect environment for pinapple sponges!  Great environment for small fauna to live as well.  At first I used it as a temporary replacement for live rock, now I am thinking it has advantages of its own.  The pod devour anything in it.  After feeding you see a build up on the screen.  8 hours later and it is clean like new.  They are amazingly fast at cleaing organic mater up.

The other main thing I do in my sump is it is set up as a gravity filter.  There is quite a bit of flow (1,300l/hr top and bottom) for this sized tank, but while it flows qucikly over the DSB (Preventing ammonia buildup) it flows very evenly with very very little turbulence.  That allows organics to fall out of suspention as it passes over the DSB.  That allows selective removal of organics as anything alive and capible of moving, won't get filtered out as it can keep itself in the water.  At no point is water forced through material.  There is filter material in there (Mulit fiter pad for heavy metals and a little carbon to polish the water) but the water can flow around as well as through.  Any animals in there can avoid the media all together.  

I tried to tripple filter the tank.  There is 2lbs/gal of sand in the sump making 5.5 to 6.5"" of sand bed.  1lbs/gal of live rock in teh display and then as much macro as I could get my hands on.  Each should be ""enough"" on its own. They all work together in the end.","1349050880"

"hockeygoalies","t5_2tf80","It allows you to get to shots around the high glove/shoulder area while moving your torso towards the shot, rather than away from the shot.  

When you hold your glove low and the shot comes high glove around your shoulder you have to either move your shoulder towards the shot to block with your shoulder or move your glove up and rotate it 90-120 degrees, which leads to you rotating your torso away from the shot.  From this position it's very awkward/not possible to do both, which means you risk choosing the wrong option and having ticklers go through you.

However with the glove held more fingers up, when a shot comes high into that shoulder-high-glove area it's an easy grab with the glove which is already rotated in a way that allows you to snag it infront of you body and you're still able to properly lean towards the shot which gets your shoulder and torso more in front of the puck to prevent any funny business.  The fact that the glove looks to the shooter like it is more covering the top corner is nice, but not nearly an important as the above stuff. ","1349050885"

To me, the worst thing about Nuit Blanche is the frankly pretentious chorus of moaning that starts around midnight from those who claim to, as if the combination of art and alcohol is some new, terrible, shockingly unprecedented thing. The horror, right?


&gt;**Not that I was there**

Makes sense that the worst thing for someone who wasn't even there is people complaining (not even to he way he said it)...but he wasn't even there, so why would his opinion matter?
YOU were there though, so lol at you if you think that he put it best.

Nuit Blanche Toronto did suck, for the same reasons already stated: Not much art, too crowded, etc.

But to be fair, that was my experience of it, and it could have been better if I had planned my night better. Rather than wander around through the massive hordes of people trying to see as much as I could, (with that strategy, you won't be very successful) I should have done more prior research and make certain exhibits my priority. Then I probably would have spent more time with art rather than trying to get through people.","1349050889"

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","Henry had done it all. Won the double, unbeaten season, Champions League final, top all-time goalscorer.

&gt;Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated: ""Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on.""

I actually prefer that he left in glory rather than stay around a risk things maybe going stale. It didn't seem like a betrayal but more of a natural conclusion to things and he moved on.

With RvP we were in rebuilding mode. Imagine how great we could be if he was still here with Santi and Podolski? But no, he shacked up with one of our biggest rivals in the league after one good full season. It's a annoying but I can understand his reasons for doing it.","1349050894"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; The reality is that in the late part of the 19th, and the early part of the 20th century, women were overshadowed by men in the field of science regardless of the merit of their contribution.

The reality is that you believe this because you have been fed feminist revisionist history since you were a child.  Now you **take it for granted** that men are evil, jealous and stupid compared to women.  How does that reflect your own view of men and women that you honestly believe that men are people who would **generally** behave that way?

In fact what happened is that women vastly overshaddowed the men whom they were comparable to because there were a hundred men and nobody was especially interested in who they were but the one woman who was doing the same stuff was famous **simply for being a woman and doing what was ordinary for men**.

So for example the first female doctor (Elizabeth Blackwell) is quite famous but she had skills comparable to thousands if not tens of thousands of male doctors of her day, none of whom you have ever heard of.  And why would you?  They all were just ordinary people.  She is only famous for being female.  **Her being a woman made her famous.**

&gt; I'm not a feminist, but that is a reality

It is not a reality.  It's the exact opposite of reality.

&gt; women who were working in the era are not as well known as men

The exact opposite is true.

Let's talk about aviators for example.  You probably know about Amelia Earhart right?  But why?  Did she do anything before any other aviator?  No.  In fact her first famous flight she was (as she said) like a sack of potatos - a simple passenger - in an early flight across the Atlantic.  And for this she was famous.  **NOT the male aviator who flew her across the Atlantic**.  Think about that one.  He did all the work.  She, by her own admission did nothing but sit there.  She's famous and I have no idea who he was.","1349050897"

"democrats","t5_2qn70","&gt; I am not equating it, obviously some sins are more offensive than others.

This does not jive with the closing of the very same paragraph:

&gt; However one should never level sins as worse or better.

You can't have your cake and eat it too.

&gt; You may have left the catholic church a little early without discovering all of the little details. 

Please don't talk down at me.  That is also offensive.  I am not a child and I do not appreciate being patronized or condescended to.  

&gt; It has more to do with us using our bodies in the way that God intended them. A reproductive organ needs another reproductive organ from the opposite gender in order to reproduce. 

I do not believe in your god, though I do think its presumptuous of you to claim to know the intentions of your deity.  Your myopic and puritanical views on sex shouldn't have any bearing on the value of another person.

&gt; You don't even need to be christian to understand it. If we have a body and our bodies have parts which are used for a purpose, to use them outside of that purpose is wrong. Especially in excess.

That makes no sense whatsoever.  I guess we should cancel all future Olympics, because I'm pretty sure handstands and swimming are definitely not the primary purpose of arms.  And speaking of gymnastics, that's what you're doing mentally here, to attempt to justify a predefined conclusion.

&gt; People who are homosexual themselves are not bad, they are good people. Great people. When they decide to go against their bodies design for what is going on biologically or mentally, it is against the way they were created. 

Oh, here it is.  The whole being gay is a choice thing.  What I do is *exactly in accordance with how I was created*, and fuck you if you think you have the right to call me or what I do evil because of your superstition.  

I'm done with this.  It's nice that you're not so craven and depraved as to use the ballot box to impose bigotry upon and deny civil liberties to people, but you've clearly got some unresolved prejudice against gay people, and I'm not going to sit here while you insult me any longer.

The league my friend is in is very open--he once needed to sub his whole team (except himself) on short notice. He asked his father and I, who've both curled, and needed a fourth. Enter my then-boyfriend, who didn't even know what curling ice looked like. We taught him in 20 minutes before the game started.

I've also heard good things about the Granite, though have no first hand experience. 

Yes, there are women's rec leagues and mixed leagues. Also blind curling, deaf curling, and wheelchair curling. Possibly others as well.

"Korean","t5_2rd8q","In Korean, seum-ni-da &amp; --m-ni-da are sentences endings that make the whole sentence polite and formal. (Polite informal sentences generally end in ""yo"" so you might hear that too.)

As far as I understand, ""desu"" in Japanese translates as the ""to be"" verb in English. In Korean, ""to be"" is ""it-da"" but when you add on the polite formal verb ending, it becomes ""it-seum-ni-da""

The main difference is that ""seum-ni-da/--m-ni-da"" (depending on if the previous syllable ends in a vowel or consonant) can be attached to any verb at the end of the sentence to change the politeness level. For example, ""go"" changes from ""ka-da"" to kam-ni-da, ""read"" changes from ""ik-da"" to ""ik-seum-ni-da"". Whereas in Japanese (I think, though I'm not that knowledgeable about Japanese so I may be wrong) ""desu"" always means ""to be"".

* Don't actually know what they are going to sell - Is it going to be only burgers? What else is there?

* The video makes it seem like they don't really know anything about business or the food industry 

* What makes them healthy and different from other fast food restuarants? They don't really say. As far as I can tell from the video, it might be using fresh ingredient, but places like IN-N-out and Five guys do that already.

* Everything they say is really vague, and doesn't really hold any meaning. It's like if I was making a pitch for a video game and all I said was ""What games are missing nowadays is originality"", and just end it there.

* Their presentation is really poor - They didn't really plan out what they were going to say beforehand, they didn't go to into detail, and the only time we see food is them making what seems to be a normal burger....in their home kitchen.

Now these guys seem like nice people who just want to make a living out of making healthy food for others...but as it is now, I don't see them going too far. It might sound harsh, but business is business, and avoiding the reality of the situation is the worst thing to do. I basically know nothing about business, but as a consumer, this is how I feel about this commercial.","1349050904"

I wanted a job so badly I actually walked into burger king on my 14th birthday and handed them the application. Felt great to have my own money. The sad thing was I hung out with a lot of wealthy kids in school who always thought I was cheap/tight for not wanting to blow money on this or that... Of *course* you're going to think I'm tight with my money, your parents give you $100/week in allowance while I work for $6.50 an hour to earn less than that.

It is interesting, because that lesson has carried over into how I manage my money today. I am extremely frugal because I value my time and understand the value of a dollar.

Whats really frustrating is that these people *will probably never* understand that money is a limited resource because they have huge trust funds, inheritances, etc. ","1349050904"

Graph theory does not have a monolithic body of essential theory that people need to comprehend before they can approach problems in the field (in the same way that, say, algebraic geometry does).

Another point which most people seem to have missed is that Verbitsky's teaching experience is mostly with very capable students, many of whom probably come from a competitive math background.  Such students are generally quite strong in combinatorics and discrete math upon entering university due to the topics tested in math olympiads, and generally have a much stronger grasp of the topic before even entering university than a typical US undergraduate student would after having completed an undergraduate course or two in discrete math.","1349050910"

Let me summarize what I think (and what I think I've said).

1. Not all fields have an equal number of layers of abstraction (as in one has to penetrate layer n before you go to layer n+1).

2. Some fields have a solid trunk, some not so much.

3. Experience in certain independent fields makes understanding concepts and results in other fields easier.

4. The previous relation is not symmetric. 

These properties are not judgments of value and not a gauge of difficulty of the problems.

You were upset when I said there is no coherent graph theory. That's point number 3. Let me elaborate just a bit: the work of people in graph theory can have literally no common prerequisites. That's because it is not a theory, rather it's an umbrella term that unites very different stuff of unrelated origin. That's because the notion of a graph is so simple they show up everywhere. Frankly I don't think you could argue with that. Compare it to complex algebraic geometry (btw, that's not my domain). You have to study like a half a dozen graduate level courses to get to the meat (multivariate calculus, complex analysis, commutative algebra, algebraic topology, homological algebra and so on). It doesn't mean it's ""better"" or more difficult, but it does mean there is a long roadmap. With spectral graph theory you can just dive in.","1349050914"

No one else in the city is even discussed or made aware of the threat besides the collector guy and the detective, so it doesn't make sense for something that would obviously capture the entire city's attention.

Of course, an Angels episode where they do manage to capture the entire city's attention would be really hard to pull off because it would be easy for everyone to watch the angels when there are so many people aware of them - in order to be scary the angels really have to be going after a relatively small group of people so that they can't all be watched easily.  But if they can't come up with a way to make that work, I think it would have been better to just scrap the Statue of Liberty idea than stick it into an episode where it doesn't really make any sense.

I put together some outfits using information from the sidebar but finding UK stores with similar items, since most of the sidebar link examples are US stores or URLs have expired. I was asking advice and only one person actually helped and explained why some items I chose looked bad/out of the trend. The others basically said ""if you're boring just *cop* uniqlo.com"" and any questions beyond that were met by ""read the sidebar. LOL DIDN'T READ"" even though I had explained my dilemma.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Draven is a tricky character to balance.

For him to appeal to all players he has to be good enough without being able to perma-juggle two (or even three) axes as you see Aphromoo doing.

However because of this when someone as good as Aphromoo is in control of the champion, the champion scales a little too well with items because it has such a high skill ceiling.

That said, draven's kit while it does a huge amount of damage relies too heavily on catching his axes, which can, be incredibly problematic given the semi-random nature of the axe catching mechanic.

Especially in team fights where he may not be able to go where he needs to catch them, or even be zoned away from the catch by well placed skillshots, aoes or enemy champions even.","1349050920"

There are 88 guns per 100 people in this country. There were guns in the theater, and they helped no one. The cops rushed to the scene and captured the shooter..what else would you have them do?

"surfing","t5_2qmde","Six years ago I was surfing a beach break near my house. Waves were chest or shoulder high. Went for the air and a two handed grab on a closeout section. Bailed when I realized I was 3ft over the lip and 6 or 7ft over the flats, and I would probably snap my board if I tried to land it. I figured the water was at least chest deep, however it was no more than knee deep. Landed feet first, heard/felt a nasty crunch and after getting pushed around by the white water, I tried standing up. Nope, not happening. I drag myself to shore on my stomach and turn over to have a look at what I knew was not going to be pretty. My right ankle has a bone sticking out close to 2 inches. Now the pain hits me. So I see someone familiar walking down the beach back to their car (4x4 beach) and he and another guy drag me up to my truck.

Paul is a great guy, and this speaker has been built by many people on both the HTGuide and Parts Express forums. You'll get loads of advice along the way from either forum if a floor-standing 3-way is what you're after. I still think that you could be well served by a solid 2-way design.

If you like the idea of casual sex with this girl, than talk to her and establish some boundaries. Figure out what sort of commitment she's looking for.

And for the record, I am a HUUUGE fan of the Souls series and have [written](http://kayin.pyoko.org/?p=1715) [a bit](http://kayin.pyoko.org/?p=1770) [about Dark Souls](http://kayin.pyoko.org/?p=1776). Hopefully some of that will be enjoyable to someone. Anyways I'll gladly answer your questions!

* The popularity didn't really surprise me at all. Judging from people's reactions to it during development, I had some idea what I was in for. I also felt it was the right thing at the right time and figured places like 4chan would help it take off. This wasn't any great foresight, I just had plenty of time to see things coming. There was no real big BURST of popularity (even before the game was finished), just constant growth. What DID surprise me was the importance of LPs! I knew of them before hand but I had NO IDEA what a disruption I was going to be to that community.

* Yes! Notably the two classics -- Cloud and UltrajMan's. I still stay in touch with both of them to an extent. If you watch EG Floe's playthrough of IWBTG and Gaiden, you'll hear him responding to me heckling him in the chat all the time. Funny enough, having been a member of the fighting game community before than, I was surprised to find out that Floe remembered me as a player and not just the creator of IWBTG. I haven't watched many other FULL playthroughs that weren't speedruns (most LPs of it are pretty long!) but I've watched choice bits from tons of LPs and it warms my heart every time.

* They're similar and different in big ways. Subversions can be less extreme, but the fact they're confined to the rules of the original game puts a whole new twist on them. The classic Kaizo block in another context would just be mean and unfunny -- but put in an ACTUAL SMB game, it's brilliant. If I was to have a Kaizo block in IWBTG I would have to spend a lot of time establishing the classic use of the invisible block BEFORE hand to get the maximum effect out of the joke. Also romhacking tools are better now than ever, so you get less hacks that scream ""made by a programmer"". Still, there is a limit to what you can generally do with romhacks, which is why they rarely become as popular as some of them deserve (there are some wicked Super Metroid romhacks that clearly had a lot of time put into them). Still, I think any tools that allow people to try their hands at level design is AWESOME. It's something you only truly get good at by doing it.

If that counts as voter intimidation then I think the black panthers with weapons outside the polling place does as well, however neither person was ever charged with voter intimidation.  One of them was charged with an unrelated weapons violation.

In this situation, I would view compromise as having to do ""whose"" home would you two be living together in?

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","This is a slightly complicated situation to assess; to start with, panache bras tend to have very stretchy bands, so you might feel nicely hugged right now, but a smaller band won't feel as much tighter as you might think.  I can comfortably wear a 30 or 32, sometimes even a 34 (mostly on my period).  A couple more usual features of panache bras: the band usually arches up from the wings to the hooks, making it difficult to tell if it is riding up or not (unless the riding up is major), and they usually have longer underwires compared to Freya or Fantasie bras.  

The comment in the fitting guide about wires digging in being an indication of a too small cup (I think) refers to pain caused by the wire sitting on breast tissue.  It sounds like the wire is a bit long for your body; if you are on the short side or your breast sit high on your chest, the wires may be diggin in because they are longer than what you need.  Depending on how irritating the wire poking is, you can try to (gently) bend the wire to better fit your shape, or decide whether or not you think you will adjust to the sensation.  I wear mostly panache and Cleo bras because the cups fit me so well, but the wires are a bit of a trial for me.  Once I'm sure I'm going to keep the bra, I usually adjust the wire to make it as comfortable as possible.","1349050950"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, when we all know that in nearly all cultures, women just aren't that violent or physically assertive on the whole. It's almost certainly influenced by biology and by the obvious fact that most of them know they'll never be able to compete with men in that and choose other paths. Some cultures do bring out violence in women, even encourage it, especially western culture but even in those cultures women are quite tame. Even in the USA where guns level the field somewhat it's men doing most of the shooting. Where are all the women in the USA shooting men?

Maybe get ""golf pants"" that are lightweight and quicker-drying given the climate.

I would bring the camera (especially if not huge) and would not bring the playbook given that you have an iphone. I do actually think a cheap MP3 is worth having so you don't have to flash your much more expensive iphone quite so much.

Additions: A hat (buy there since it's cheaper) would probably be useful as well as a simple swiss army knife or multi-tool (also buy there because of airline restrictions, sounds like you aren't checking any bags).

Attitudes like this are what *actually* create genocide. No, it's not evil. People are evil. People suck. If you feel the need to hate anything hate people and their baser impulses. But some fucking book? No. 

I've read the Quran. Frankly, there's nothing spectacularly evil or good about it. It is entirely up to the reader what they get out of it. It contains some of the most beautiful passages I've ever read and others that aren't, to put it lightly. But ""evil""? No. If you know the history and context it's not evil at all. But people have a habit of taking simple things and making them horrific. I doubt when Karl Marx called religion the opiate of the masses he had this kind of shit in mind. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Red_Terror

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge

&gt;You cannot cherry pick good parts of the Quran and be blind to the evil parts.

No. But if you understand the context and intent of the ""bad parts"" then it makes a lot more sense. Whether you want to go through the effort of trying to make a speech given about a battle that happened more then a thousand years ago applicable to your life is something else. 

I've met enough Muslims in my life to know they aren't any more or less evil then any other group of people. Atheists included.

While I have always been pro-choice (and continue to be), I also believe that the distinction between a 1 month fetus and a 1 day old baby is incredibly arbitrary. Where to put that strike thru the grey? I don't think it is possible. I could not imagine making that kind of decision.
 
I wish the effort consumed in arguing about pro-choice/pro-life would instead be directed to education and contraception. Something like a male pill would be great.  Policies that would make the probability of a mother having to make that impossible choice less likely.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","In that case I wouldn't feel too bad. Especially if he has depression issues and it's swinging into that time of year for him, this is not surprising behavior. He needs to get help for that, or work much harder on it if he already is getting help and is still having issues he is unable to identify and cope with. If he is working well on it, good! It may just take time to see results.

Honestly, since I started my new job I have fallen asleep on my boyfriend *even while interested in sex*. I've only been there three weeks, but I get tired much, much earlier than I used to, and it comes on very strong and very fast. I feel awful that I end up too tired to have sex, or to reciprocate oral, but he has been understanding so far (as much as I can tell, anyway- he hasn't complained at all.)

So, that is to say, he may not be disinterested in you... he may actually just be tired. It may be depression or stress or something else you have mentioned in comments, or maybe something you haven't.

A suggestion I would have is to work out a system, even if silly, that would indicate to you that he would be receptive of you so you can initiate without him feeling borne down upon. Maybe it's something like walking around with no pants on or having a word or a phrase, anything. It should probably not be very sexual so it's not pressuring and it kind of 'breaks the ice' so to speak.

I would also explain to him, if you haven't already, that the physical connection is not all you are missing, and that his rejections are not just about the sex- you feel a lack of emotional connection, intimacy, and you need that from him. Even if you are having incredibly sexy cuddling that ends up with falling asleep and not actual sex, having that connection may help with what you are craving.","1349050971"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Hi, I'm a 31 year old man from the UK.

At the age of 18 when I went to uni I weighed 9 1/2 stone (133 pounds / 60kg). I'm 5'10.5"" (1.76m roughly). I had been a little bit ill, plus I'd had a very physical summer job.

At uni, my self-control failed a little. When I left uni I was about 14 stone (196 pounds / 89kg). Since then my weight has fluctuated up and down quite a bit. Last year I got married in April. From January onwards I set myself a goal to lose some weight (I didn't want a double-chin in my wedding pics!). I got myself down from 16st 3lbs (227lbs / 102kg) to 14st 6lbs (202lbs / 92kg) in about three months (from January onwards).

I know 22lbs/10kg doesn't seem like much, but I had a wonderful moment about two weeks before the wedding when some friends I hadn't seen for a while commented how much weight I had lost around my face. That was about a year and a half ago.

I'm now hovering around the 16st mark again. I have dipped down below once or twice but I'll be honest, I'm struggling.

Originally I lost the weight by altering my portion sizes (I used a smaller plate rather than a full size dinner plate), making sure I had home prepared food all week, and rewarding myself with something unhealthy on the Friday evening. I know it's not the healthiest option but I've never been a big fan of lunch, so instead of taking along a pack of crisps and a chocolate bar, I took an apple instead. I monitored my weight using an app on my phone (Weightbot). I felt really good about myself.

I know that a lot of the weight loss was because I had something to look forward to. I think some of the subsequent weight gain has been due to a couple of issues in my life - right after we got married my wife had health issues that knocked her sideways, although they were resolved. My job was becoming very difficult - a line manager who seemed to make it his mission to destroy me etc. (I've moved jobs now, to far better place in the same sector working slightly less hours for slightly more money, so that source of stress has gone!). I think I'm recognising the comfort eating patterns settling in again - we have been trying for a baby since last November but after nothing happening my wife was recently diagnosed with polycystic ovaries, so we're having to wait for the medication to do its job. :(

Anyway, I have resolved to try and lose at least 8lbs this month - my feeling is that there are a few things going on in my life that are out of my control - this isn't, so I must take charge of it. I am not the most active of people - I'm a teacher, and I'm normally so tired at the end of the day I can barely stay awake to mark books and plan lessons.

I have changed my diet recently to include more fresh organic fruit and veg. I am reducing portion sizes again, and I'm generally trying to be a bit more active - whether this means busting out the WiiFit, or going for a walk in the evening, I don't know, it'll be whatever I have time for.

So, that's me. I'm very bad at sticking to goals - an arbitrary goal of 8lbs by the end of this month feels a bit vague for me, so I figure that by turning it into a recurring goal, I can force myself to look good in Christmas pictures. There's the goal! That would be 20lbs by Christmas - I know it should be more, but I'm realistic about the effect the Christmas period has.

I hope that wasn't too wordy - it felt good to get some of that off my chest.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I could have sworn that I was told when I was a kid that lightning connects mid-air.. as in, that the lightning came up a little ways into the sky from the ground first. 

It didn't seem like that at all here. Does anyone else remember being taught that?

***Edit*** I was curious so I did some looking around. [Here's a site](http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/faq/faq_ltg.php) that says pretty much exactly what I was getting at:

""Does lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?""

""The answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.""


It still didn't seem to occur the way they suggest here. Maybe it wasn't slowed down enough? Or are they full of bullshit?","1349050978"
"ouya","t5_2uhbj","* 1) Games are designed for phones, so will look crap on HDTV - This is it's own platform, and it just takes some more effort for developers to improve polygon counts, texture resolution, etc, if he's talking about hard numbers, but mainly this follows onto my next point:

* 2) Developers are the ones that determine whether a game looks good or bad, despite hardware limitations, artists are the ones that make fantastic characters and charming environments with whatever hardware restraints they face.  You have good artists and bad artists.

* 3) It won't make a big impact on the Big 3 initially, but that doesn't invalidate it's existence.  It doesn't have to, it has it's own market segment, and the 60,000 people that pre-ordered the console (including you) are a testament to this market.

* 4) Yet again, dependant on developers.  As on iOS, Android and all consoles to date, you have about 80% bad developers, 20% good developers (the 80/20 rule also works so well in other situations :D).  Make your purchasing decisions as you would any other platform.

* 5) Just like any games platform to date, there are always a few exclusive titles that justify buying a console, where designers focus on delivering a solid experience to one piece of hardware, while many choose to be multi-platform in order to increase sales.

1.  I think some Southern accents are absolutely beautiful, but there are some that are really grating.  The difference between a ""pretty"" Southern accent and an ugly one, for me, is whether or not the person uses proper grammar.  Note that many (most?) of the ""Southerners"" you see on movies and TV are not from the South, and fake Southern accents tend to be *really* irritating to me; I'm not sure if non-Southerners recognize that these accents are fake, so sometimes I think that people dislike ""Southern"" accents that aren't really Southern to begin with.  (Rick Grimes on ""The Walking Dead"" is awful, for example, even though I really like the show in general.)  The ""strength"" of my accent is probably about a 7 out of 10; in other words, people notice immediately that I'm Southern when I speak.
2.  Regarding Southern stereotypes, I feel the same way most people probably feel about stereotypes of their own background:  mostly harmless, sometimes frustrating, sometimes funny.  I don't like people assuming I'm racist or uneducated (who would?!?), but I don't mind if they assume I like fried food and country music.  
3.  My opinion of ""The North"" is basically neutral, although I do think it is *much* different from the South in cultural terms.  In the South, most people are either white (northern European ancestry), black (west African ancestry), or sometimes Hispanic (mostly Mexican, some Guatemalan).  In the Northern or Western US, there is much more variety of cultures: Asian, larger Hispanic populations, southern and eastern Europe, Scandinavian, Caribbean, Indian, Middle Eastern, etc.  In my experience this seems to lead to more ""fractured"" communities; in other words, cultural differences are more *visible* because of people's appearance.  Northerners definitely talk faster than Southerners, which can be a little jarring when you're used to talking slowly like we do here. :)  Also when I lived in Manhattan (New York City), I found it kind of draining to go through a whole day without any social interaction with strangers.  (See #5 for more detail.)  I do find that I'm somewhat defensive/sensitive if I'm the only Southerner in a group, and I will often tone down the strength of my Southern accent or communicate in writing if possible.  
4.  If I had one meal left, I would choose fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, pink-eyed purple hull peas with fat back [pork fat], fried corn, squash casserole, sliced tomatoes, and cornbread.  I also *love* country ham and biscuits with red-eye gravy.  Note that I grew up on a farm where most of these foods were available fresh in the summer and canned or frozen to eat year-round, so a lot of these might be considered ""old-fashioned"" these days.  
5.  The best aspect of the South is the warmth and friendliness of her people.  In an average day it's not at all unusual for me to have conversations with people I meet in line at the grocery store, people I see walking their dogs, people at the next table in a restaurant, etc.  I'm not likely to become best friends with any of them, but I think it's really nice to have lots of little friendly interactions throughout the day.  (I think this trait is part of what leads to the ""loud American"" stereotype, so I *do not* do this when I'm outside the US, or really when I'm outside the South.)

Wouldn't you say there is still a before and an after for one character, the most important character, in Madoka Magica? I guess we could argue that the show subverts the before vs after narrative by withholding it for one character, but even for her, we can see how the magic changed her. The outcome might not have been affected each time, but certainly *she* was affected.

I quite agree with his third point. Though it is true that the most popular works are important in defining a genre, you can't be both typical and different from the majority.","1349050983"

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","Draw the free-body diagram of the airplane (rear view). You will find:

* Weight of the airplane, straight downward
* Lift force of the plane, down-right at an angle, **θ**

The angle of the lift force lets us know that the horizontal component of the lift force is the centripetal force of the airplane, keeping it in a circular looping motion.

    F: lift force
    θ: banking angle of the airplane, clockwise from vertical
    W: weight of the airplane
    v: velocity of the airplane
    m = 9010 kg
    R = 8.67 miles = 13953.01 meters
    T = 0.115 hours = 414 seconds
    g = 9.81 m/s^2
    Fy = F*cos(θ)
    Fx = F*sin(θ)
    W = m*g
    v = 2*pi*R/T    (velocity = distance/time)

As the airplane is in level flight,

    ΣFy = 0 = Fy - W

    &gt; Fy = m*g

    F_cent = m*v^2/R = Fx
    Fx = m*(2*pi*R/T)^2 / R

    &gt; Fx = 4*pi^2*m*R/(T^2)

The magnitude of the lift force is

    F = sqrt(Fx^2 + Fy^2)

    &gt;&gt; F = ?

The angle of the banking will be

    θ = atan(Fx/Fy)

In a Chat/MMO environment, I can do whatever I want without facing the consequences because I will probably never see those *names* again - which of course also holds true in an urban environment, but there, I gotta have the courage to say what I mean into the other's FACE - which might result in a bitch slap.

Even in the case of сегодня, it's actually a combination of the two words сей and день, both in the genitive case... сего/дня. If you've had a look at the Родительный case, this will hopefully make a little bit of sense. So it literally means 'of this day'. сей is archaic(old, not used anymore), but maybe knowing where it comes from helps a bit.

As with most of these things, you will develop an intuition for it very quickly. Like I said, look out for those two endings/combinations of letters, it usually indicates that a word is in its родительный form.

This means that once a person becomes a tenant, if they have a pet even though the lease says pets are not allowed, the landlord cannot evict the tenant just for having the pet.  However, the Landlord can apply to the Board to evict a tenant if the pet is causing a problem.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt; I understand that when using lens a DX (crop sensor) camera, the focal length of the lens has to be multiplied by 1.5 to get the ""true"" focal length.

okay, wait. let's stop this one right here. that's not the ""true"" focal length. the *true* focal length is whatever is says on the lens. always. for *every* SLR lens, ever.

multiplying by 1.5 will give you the 35mm/FX equivalent angle of view. so your 35mm lens on your DX camera will be similar to a 50mm lens on an FX camera. **this is only useful if you're comparing to 35mm/FX** as a point of reference. never shot 35mm film or FX? **forget about this entirely**. it's not useful to you, unless someone is giving you a lens recommendation based on the 35mm angle of view.

&gt; Is there a difference in true focal length between a DX specific 35mm lens, and a FX 35mm lens?

no. focal length is focal length is focal length. a 50mm lens is *always* 50mm; it just has a different *angle of view* (how much it shows in the frame) based on how big the frame physically is. that's the thing that's changing (the size of your sensor) not the lens.

don't feel that this is a stupid question. it's not; this is a genuinely confusing issue, and i really wish people would stop using the ""crop factor"" stuff for newbies. it just confuses people. it was useful when the digital newbies were all former film pros, and the camera companies were trying to sell them on (cheaper to manufacture) crop sensor DSLRs. but if all you've ever used is crop sensors (or smaller) it's not really relevant information.","1349051013"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Sentamu is fairly socially conservative (no to gay marriage and wants women bishops to not interfere in certain aspects of their dioceses if their congregations don't want them to), while Welby is against gay marriage and in favour of women bishops - but in the interests of consensus wants to find a way to overcome the objections of those who truly conscientiously object to them. James is the most socially liberal of the three; he also opposes gay marriage but is fully in favour of women bishops.

In terms of the management of the Church, Sentamu is a bit of an authoritarian and doesn't brook dissent, Welby has at least managed outside organisations before (oil industry) and James is a long-standing competent manager but lacking in charisma.

Out of the three, I think I'd want Graham James, but he only just edged out Welby as the more inspiring candidate if only because a well-run and beefed up Lambeth Palace could stand up to Church House a little more.

* Ulfric is a hypocrite.  He blackmails a Talos worshipper using his worship of Talos.

* The entire reason for the Stormcloak rebellion is ridiculous.  Yes, the White Gold Concordat sucks, but it was necessary.  And, if you look at Whiterun, you see that Talos worship is openly permitted.  Ulfric made an issue out of nothing.
* Ulfric is not dragonborn and learned the Thu'um from the Greybeards.  They explicitly state that ONLY the dragonborn is allowed to use the Voice in battle or for violent reasons.  Ulfric not only used it to kill High King Torygg, he also used it to retake Markarth.  You know, the battle where afterwards he killed every Breton indiscriminately.  
* If you meet Torygg in Sovngarde, he implies that Ulfric isn't going to make it.  

Honestly, though, I would side with the Stormcloaks at least once if it didn't mean betraying Balgruuf.  Can't do it.  Wrong.  Wrongwrongwrong.  ","1349051027"

"snowboarding","t5_2qi0t","Don't listen to anybody telling you to get a specific brand or model of boot. The only good boots are the ones that fit YOU the best. You can only find this out by going to a shop and trying everything they have. If nothing seems to fit well, go to a different shop and repeat. Given your budget, if you follow this advice you WILL spend more on boots than you expected. But you will also thank yourself for doing so in the long run.

As long as the board is not grossly over or undersized for your weight and doesn't fall apart in a couple of runs, you will be fine regardless of what you get. You can also skimp out on bindings a bit. Just make sure they fit your boots and don't create any weird pressure points.

It was a very very good period but i fell again for the same trap of life...  I also thought of suicide thingys, Never that much but I was imagining me dying before a train or other stuff. Love kept me up, love from my parents/family friends etc... The problem was, I never allowed happiness to come at me. I didn't talk about feelings, I had thought I had knowledge that others didnt have(conspiricy theories, religions etc)  and that made me very depressed. Now I live my life full of happiness because I met new people. And with these people I build up a friendship where I can be truly myself.

I honestly don't understand why admins complain about Exchange. Granted I've been using it for many years (really since it was first released) but I've brought other admins up to speed on it without any problems. In the 16 years I've been managing Exchange systems I have never once lost any data even though I've gone through several disaster situations. I currently personally manage over 30 Exchange servers and they're no more difficult to maintain than any other server side application. I also have clients using hosted Exchange (Intermedia and GoDaddy) as well as Google Apps; the Exchange users are happier overall than are the Google Apps folks.

In my experience Exchange, like any other sophisticated server application, requires a reasonable investment in training and on the job learning to become proficient in - but again, no more effort than other server apps.

And as to Public Folders being discontinued, I would note that it is trivial to set up a shared mailbox and give users rights to it, then treat that shared mailbox as the public folder system for the group.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","You make good points, but I disagree with you on this one:

&gt;The risk involved in using a versatile weapon, and there is risk, is that there ARE weapons that clearly outmatch you at every range.

which is a point I made earlier. Yes there ARE weapons that clearly outmatch you at any range, but none of them do it at a significantly better rate (exception being sniper rifles). I get the point that versatility is a viable play style but I think it would make more sense to make a weapon 'decent' across the board rather than 'pretty damn good/excellent.' 

To further illustrate my point I would say if we assign a 10 scale to CQ/M/L to an M16A3 vs AEK for example, the AEK would be 9/9/6 respectively but the M16 would be something like 8/8/8, now if it was more of a 7/7/7  or maybe an 8/8/7 that maybe would maintain versatility while at the same time give the weapon a bit of a higher skill ceiling. In that case then there would definitely be a risk to using a versatile weapons without making them useless. 

That's the point im trying to make really. I think DICE took a good step with m16a3 previous patch, they just need a teeny bit more and this weapon shouldn't be much of an issue. 

The rest of the points I agree with you for the most part. I just would like to see the M16A3 and M416 used less so there would be more variety in the assault class is all. ","1349051044"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","What country do you live in? There is a problem among many Muslims living in Muslim nations and ethnic ghettoes in Western nations. I think the problem is insecurity on all levels, especially on a personal one. I want to try to understand this from a behavioural point of view, not that I'm an expert or anything. Someone more educated than I may contrive a better elucidation on the matter. But I do think it is important to understand societies on that level if we're serious about making a positive difference. 


The most basic and primal directive of humans is survivability. If that is threatened, people feel insecure. Therefore, they will act in ways to remove that source of insecurity from their lives. In order to remove those threats, our brain prepares us physically (symptoms typical of aggression) to combat the threat or to escape from it. The magnitude of the response is typically dependent upon the perceived magnitude of the threat. And I think perceptions is an important factor since in a more complex world, threats are often neither immediate, foreseeable or understandable. Therefore, our interpretation of what may constitute a threat to our survivability has merely increased in complexity. This is why, according to Professor Taylor (article from Psychology Today), a reaction that served us well as prehistoric humans does not work now. The increased complexity of human life makes acts of aggression irrelevant since they don't really address the issue nor is it beneficial in such a social and interdependent world that values highly the rule of law. And we see this in the Muslim world. How absurd and illogical it is to riot through your own streets burning things because of a video on the internet, attacking others who have nothing to do with anything. However, if we look at the Muslim world, there is a significant problem with the lack of education, poverty, and instability. For example, Afghanistan hasn't seen stability for over thirty years. There is a constant state of war and violence, and no infrastructure or jobs or a real future for the youth except for the truly gifted. And so I think that, ultimately because of the socio-political climate, people are extremely insecure on a deeply subconscious level, which extends to all aspects of their lives. Because they are so insecure, they tend to interpret things that we would see as insignificant as presenting a deep threat (such as immature insults to their religion). Therefore, their reaction to these perceived threats will likely be a reference to our most primal reactions, which is aggression. While in that state people are unable or rather are unwilling to recognize nuances, and so we see aggression being inflicted upon ""Americans"" because of what one American did. I'm sure a pretext for these burnings is in response to the Buddhist violence against the Rohingya. However, humans often feel it necessary to justify acts that are really for no other purpose but to address their own sense of insecurity, and so we see vague and irrational references to religion, honour, injustice and so on. 


And I'll give one example of the behaviour of Muslims in better times. During 13th to 16th centuries, the courts of the Umayyad caliphs at Damascus and of the Abbasids at Baghdad were the theatres of learned disputations between Jews, Christians and Muslims. Public debates would take place over a number of polemical and apologetic topics, such as whether or not the Prophet Muhammad was really indeed a Prophet or not. On which religion had the most correct conception of God, who Jesus really was, and so on. Christians and Jews publicly debated these sensitive topics and published books on why Muhammad was not really a true Prophet. But these were celebrated features of the empire where violence was not expected towards those who wrote such things. During those times, Muslims by no means were insecure. We see that they were educated and lived in a thriving environment. I think that modern day Turkey is another example.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Let's explore this further. How far does personal freedom go, if you say it stops at suicide? I have the freedom to not work, correct? Of course, if I don't work, then I can't afford food. If I can't afford food, I will eventually starve, unless of course I beg or go to a soup kitchen. Then again, I also have the freedom to not go to a soup kitchen and not beg. I could sit in an alley and not eat and slowly wate away, which is a slow, horrible suicide.

If I so choose, I can take every choice to not live, or to live in such a way that it is effectively a slow suicide. Of course we could then commit that person and have him live on the governments dollar, but I contend that this is a complete waste of money if he has no desire to be here.

As you said, depression can be treated. However, it's not always successful. Did you know treating depression only has an 80 percent success rate? What if someones depression is existential and not chemical? The idea that every suicidal person can be ""fixed"" is naive.

As we've established, I have the freedom to do everything up to the point of suicide.  Why is the act of suicide, then, excluded?","1349051047"

That's exactly it. If it doesn't have a good AOSP build of the latest version of Android, I'm not interested. I don't care how many stupid, slightly-different stock-deodexed-themed-modified-ExTrA-sWaG versions of the stock ROM there are for the phone.

If it's not CM or AOKP, frankly, it's probably a waste of time. 

Lots of ROMs does not mean anything good, it just means lots of devs are putting in lots of work to make the situation barely any better for the phone owners.

What I found was a dupe bug... and it worked on currency as well as items.  In EQ1 money was a physical object.  It sat in your inventory, and had weight.  I could double a stack of money every 3 minutes.

I was at the dupe location, and every 3 minutes would make a stack of plat that was nearly the max weight you could carry (which put me 2x overweight).  My wife would stand next to me with her char... take the 2nd stack from me, cast SOW on herself.. and walk very slowly to the bank.. deposit the plat.  Ironically it was my wife's account that got caught, because she had stacks and stacks of plat in the bank.

After being banned.. we started new accounts, and never duped that quantity of money again... what we did was trade rare items instead.  Get one Short Sword of the Ykesha... and in 3 minutes I would have 2.  3 minutes later I would have 4.  After another 3 minutes 8.... Doubling like this made it very, very easy to have unlimited money and items.  We didn't get caught for 6 months just doing items... and then one day the servers went down, and came up two days later with the exploit fixed.

In the case of WoW (the only MMO I've played significantly) the factions were there so we could have consistent PvP. Trying to conjure up deus ex machina reasons for them fighting is ridiculous, the world has been threatened with destruction a dozen times within the game world's decade, resolution of which requires frequent cooperation between the factions (storywise not gamewise). EVE gets it right from what I've heard. I think for the most part they have a place in MMO's, but it really just seems to be a tool for developers to create story reasons for conflict, and to drive tensions between players to accentuate that.","1349051051"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I've seen this number thrown around a few times, along with 25% and 50%, although usually it's just the proportion of homeless youth that are LGBT, with an assumption being that the number was high due to youth who were kicked out or found living at home unbearable because of their parents'  homophobic abuse.

In terms of academic work, one paper I could find was [this 2011](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300155) which looked at Massachusetts high school students (sort of a funny demographic to look at since one would assume that you'd miss a lot of homeless youth by only counting the ones going to school, although the ones at school are certainly easier to count):
""Approximately 25% of lesbian and gay adolescents and 15% of bisexuals reported homelessness compared with just 3% of the exclusively heterosexual adolescents. More than one third of the students who were homeless reported a minority sexual orientation or were unsure of their sexual orientation. Nearly 20% of the homeless youths in this study identified themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Clearly, these youths were grossly overrepresented among the homeless, because less than 5% of the sample identified themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.""

[Another paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1088-145X.2005.00003.x/abstract) on the subject, from 2005, looked only at homeless youth:
""More heterosexual participants (31.4%; n= 81) indicated that they were homeless because of their parents’ disapproval of their drug/alcohol use than did bisexual (26.8%; n= 22) or gay and lesbian participants (6.3%; n= 4), χ2(2) = 16.29, p&lt;0.001. More gay and lesbian participants (73%; n= 46) indicated they were homeless because of their parents’ disapproval of their sexual orientation than did bisexual participants (25.6%; n= 21), χ2(1) = 32.21, p&lt;0.001. Heterosexual youth were not included in this particular analysis as it can be assumed that parents would not disapprove of their sexual orientation.""

That's absolutely not true for the women in my area. I can't be myself AND be accepted. I'm very comfortable talking about anything, even on a first date. So as soon as I mention sex (one of the top 3 things couples fight about, so I'm looking for compatibility for something long-term) the girl assumes I ONLY want sex, forgetting everything I just told her, because she has been conditioned by other guys who actually ARE players. 

Some people would call that moving too fast. I call it poor communication, and lack of maturity. **I believe mature adults can talk about anything on a first date without jumping to conclusions.** I OCCASIONALLY, like once a year, find someone who understands my need to talk about the top things couples fight about. But it's rare. And that's frustrating. 

It's frustrating that I can't be myself, because people make incorrect assumptions about me.

It however doesn't have it's own school district and splits between Renton and Issaquah. The Issaquah houses are over 800k, then Renton houses can easily be had for 400-700k. They've all dropped over 100k in value in the last 4 years and are newer than what you'd get in Bellevue for the same money. On 180 to 300k it's doable as long as you don't go buy the biggest house on the golf course without a down payment.

You might want to look into the Newport Hills area of Bellevue. The houses are older. North of Newcastle Way is Newport Hills, south is Newcastle. The southern half of it uses all the Newcastle facilities, doctors, grocery stores, YMCA, etc, but gets to be in the Bellevue school district. 

My husband and I both used to work downtown  but we chose Newcastle because of the easy commute downtown. The only better commute was from Enatai. I worked 9-6 and could leave my house at 8:30 and pull into my office garage before 9am and only occasionally hit traffic. Otherwise I took an 8:20 bus from a park &amp; ride right off 405 that got me downtown around 8:50. None of the buses that come through Newcastle-&gt;downtown (114 or 111) go north of Olive so you'd need to transfer for the last bit which would add time. Of course the earlier buses get a little slower. It's also a last stop before downtown so it can get crowded.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","I come from a small town in Tennessee. I am enrolled in a university in NY and am currently spending a semester in LA. This will be a rant, and I apologize.

1. Southern accents are not as common as people think. You are less likely to run into them with younger crowds, urban environments, and areas with better education. That said, I have a strange relationship with the accent. I love hearing a light southern accent, because it reminds me of home. I judge people with heavy accents (I wish I didn't). I emulate a southern accent sometimes when I want to make people outside of the region uncomfortable. Also the accent you hear in movies and shows is hardly ever accurate.

2. The stereotypes generally make me feel insulted, but I can't deny that there is some truth to them. I know plenty of people who fit the stereotype, but they are also the minority of people I know in the south. It is greatly disheartening when people assume the stereotype of me when they learn where I am from, and it hurts even more when they assume it of my friends and family back home. People assume I come from a conservative background, and that I am graced to go to a liberal school up north. Reality: my highschool was more progressive and diverse than my college. My grandparents are almost certainly more liberal than theirs. I would also like to say that growing up being subjected to the southern stereotype in the media made me feel ashamed of who I was because of where I was from. I felt like I was automatically the enemy (at worst) or the idiot (still bad) or the one-in-a-million-break-the-stereotype-for-laughs (at best). I'm not quite over that yet.

3. I like the north, otherwise I wouldn't go to school there. However the north is not as progressive as the locals like to think. They do not have nearly as much room to judge as they think, and I do not appreciate having me and mine looked down upon. There are other cities in the world beside New York City, and just because places that are not on the east coast are different, does not make them worse. Also being from the east coast does not make you superior.

On a planet with an unstable 'wobble' which ranges in amount of tilt over a quick time scale^1 combined with a eccentric elliptical orbit which also is unstable^2, an relatively unpredictable seasonal dynamic could occur. While it is highly unlikely for a system such as this to occur, it is not impossible. Relatively small instabilities could cause a large change in the perception of seasons.

And yea, I know GRRM said it was magic, but my brain cannot accept it flatly. 

1. The [tilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Earth.27s_seasons) of the earth is why the seasons occur. It has to do with the amount of incoming solar radiation ([insolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation)) per unit area. The earth is actually closer to the sun when the northern hemisphere is in winter. Think, this is why extreme northern latitudes have all day sun in summer and very little sun in winter. Also with an unstable axial tilt, the closer to vertical the faster it might rotate, the further away from vertical the slower it might rotate, meaning the seasonality of the planet would not be stable. The earth does this,([see](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Long_term)) but minimally and over a geological time scale.

2. An [elliptical orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit#Events_in_the_orbit) would determine the severity of seasons. For instance if one hemisphere were on the far end of the orbit, (the farthest away from the star) while simultaneously pointing away from its star the winter would be quite cold. If this coincided with an especially obtuse angle and a particularly stretched out cycle of orbit, it would be a long dark winter indeed. Earth's orbit is elliptical as well. 

TL;DR the earth does this just in a really long time scale

You probably don't need a cron job unless generating the data is very expensive.

If you don't have a good blitz, then don't even try to blitz. Play max coverage with 3 or fewer blitzing. When you see a screen, if you can't get to it yourself, then press B/circle to click onto the nearest defender and run in between the QB and WR/RB [to intercept it](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v130/PatsARckStrToo/kstarr_h_GIFSoupcom1.gif).

(690 wasn't an option as I want to use only one card for some competitive games due to less input lag). The 4GB is a precaution as a lot of people are saying they are passing 2GB, and it wouldn't be nice to get this build and have it bottleneck due to not getting the 4GB ones. I know getting the 4GB doesn't fix every issue as that's not the only factor, but it's still better than 2GB ram. Thanks for the response!","1349051086"

Here is a poem that helps me. A flight of whimsy giving hope whether or not you believe in an afterlife. (And truly, I believe that our loved ones *do* have souls, and somehow, some way, I will see them again...)



*Rainbow Bridge* 

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. 

When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. 
There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. 
There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. 

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. 
The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. 

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. 

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. 

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Hey, this was my idea too, hatched just last Monday.

I was thinking about how offended I feel every time some twat asks if we should have anti-blasphemy laws.  I can scarcely think of a more offensive set of words than that question.

Then I was thinking about how us atheists are left out in the cold, simply because we don't arbitrarily make shit up to get offended about like religious people do.  Then I thought, well, if the religions can do it, if they can just make shit up and get laws made to protect their feelings, then why not us atheists?

So, I co-propose a church of atheists, which takes profound ""spiritual"" offense at any suggestion or support of anti-blasphemy laws.  We can take people to court using those laws, claiming quite honestly that such vile remarks are profoundly offensive to our deepest beliefs.

Next, I want atheist prisoners to have access to the internet and porn, equal to how religious prisoners have access to their ""holy"" books.  And I want unfettered freedom with regards to drugs, prostitution, and all other manner of so-called ""vice"", because those things are sacred tenets of my freedom of religion.

I can't agree with you more that Murray Gold has done beautiful, wonderful things with the music of Doctor Who. While people can and do argue over which actors on the show have the best range, I think it's very safe to say that Murray Gold can compose for all the emotional registers the show hits. Whether the script calls for wistful, whimsical, frantic, or anything else, he's able to deliver.

Special mention of The Doctor's Theme (and thank you, jimmysilverrims, for adding the links! Definitely helped me remember the titles-to-tunes correspondence in a few cases) - it is definitely the most memorable piece of music from the first season and on into the RTD era, for me. You described it as ""sad but so mysterious and wonderful,"" and I think that's exactly right. For me, it always signaled a moment of sudden calm or introspection, if that makes sense, the moments when everything is about to go critically right or wrong, but there's the decency to back off and give the scene its breathing room, rather than smother it with overly-excited music. That's a very poor way of explaining my feelings towards the piece, but it's all true.

That said, I want to offer a shout-out to one more piece: [The Next Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v1gWnpIHe4) (apologies for the poor sound quality; I wasn't able to find a better version with a quick YouTube search). It's the music that plays in the last minute of the End of Time Part Two, for Matt Smith's first scene. It's irrepressibly bouncy and exciting, ushering in the Eleventh so well. It's jarring in the wake of Ten's regeneration just moments ago, but it very much gives the sense of moving forward, on to something new, no looking back. There were tears at Ten's departure, but I couldn't do anything but smile at the music and energy this last scene brought.

And something else that I think is clever, around 0:39 in ""The Next Doctor"" (above), when the strings start kicking into the upward scales - going back and re-listening to this piece, you can hear, faintly, some foreshadowings of ""I Am the Doctor."" It's got the same things-are-about-to-get-exciting swell. I don't think there's an actual musical motif repeated the way that ""I Am the Doctor"" and ""The Sun's Gone Wibbly,"" for example, share, but they're stylistically similar enough that it makes me giddy going back and listening to it anew.","1349051107"

A while ago she said im friendzoned because she has a bf not because she would be against dating me, i think i can live better not knowing what the fuck that meant isntead of trying to force something with a taken girl. funny stuff though. 

im off the hook. If she wants to talk she can msg me, if she wants to invite me over she can. I dont care anymore. If I assume she doesnt like me, never did, never will as both a friend and a possible relationship, its probably easier to deal with anything that will happen.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","appreciate the response, lets see where I can get in at it...

The major response that is given to moral relativity (not necessarily what I am advocating, but the response is pretty much the same) is that if we accept this the consequences (or some potential ones) are too vile to accept, thus morals cannot be relative; or something akin to this. I must say that in my view the defense begs the question and is just trite.

It begs the question, it seems to me, because it states that an action is morally abhorrent, thus it cannot be moral. But this seems an extremely weak argument. Id say it is trite for similar reasons. ""I cannot accept action A as moral thus it is moral"". But if morality is relative then you are not required to think someones else's actions are moral for them to be, and likewise you do not need to regard someone as acting ""good"" for them to be.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Wireless good upload speed? Is that before or after you take into account it is a shared medium, any interference and signal loss? As for cable they offer 1 megabit upload on their 100 mbit connections. While they could change the ratios this would significantly decrease the download speeds.  Read up on it. As for twisted pair copper how many places actually have access to that? There are millions of people on RIMS and what about all those people on pair gain? Also how many places do you actually think have access to multiple copper pairs to take advantage of the VDSL2 technology?  I would say not bloody many.

Cool so when do you expect we will break the speed of light? Also the NBN is using Fibre technology why would i reference to fibre?

Also not only that when do you think we will be able to send communications faster than the speed of light and at a price point that will be able to be delivered to everyone's house? Remember you actually have to build the devices that will have to push that signal out as well at some kind of reasonable price point in the next 50 years. We are lucky that light is easy to manipulate but something faster than it, think that will be as easy?

Also for copper or wireless to compete with fibre you would actually have to completely disregard physics. Don't believe me look at the electromagnetic spectrum. 

They recently broke the petabit speed on fibre which even if we say the average connection is 10 Mbit (it's alot less than that) it is 100,000,000 times faster than that. They can also improve on that speed as well they are nowhere near the limits of fibre.

We are talking about infrastructure here, if they need to add roads or railway's they don't do CBA's.  There are plenty of unknowns in this is as well. How can you accurately predict what effect say 97% of Australia suddenly having access to foxtel and IPTV would have in Australia?  Or  97% of businesses having access to offsite realtime backups?  What about Australia having the infrastructure to support large scale data farms? How much money is that worth?

I tell you what please tell me how you could get  CBA done on the opportunity loss of those three things(and there are plenty more) which are guaranteed to have some impact on Australia. How much of an opportunity loss will there be if we don't jump on this technology now?  The internet has only been in our way of life for the last 20 years and now it is critical infrastructure for all businesses. Dismissing the benefits of a speed increase is just naive.

However the NBN will pay for itself. So saying it's going to cost 40 billion is a bit disingenuous. People keep clamoring at the CBA yet ignore this fact completely. They have a business case and have projections on when it will pay for itself and given the very conservative figures they used on the plans and what the actual take up rate of the higher speed plans are it looks like it will be paid for alot earlier.

You can reconnect [the same way you would normally look for any other wireless connection], but for security reasons, I do recommend turning the encryption back on when you're done. Also why I recommend doing this when no one else would be online. If that opportunity doesn't arrive, and you live at home, it would be best to ask permission. The only thing you risk here is a stern talking to as nothing done here will break anything.

If you'd like to change the encryption:

* Use your browser to go to 192.168.0.1 (type this into the URL bar)[if this doesn't work, open up command prompt (Windows Key+R and type cmd, then hit enter) and type 'ipconfig' (without the quotes) and use the IP address labled ""Default Gateway"")
* You'll be presented with a login page. Log into your router (look up the default credentials for your router by Googling the router make and model)
* Navigate the web interface to something on the page that would imply Wireless Settings
* From here it's just remembering the page/your original password [a screenshot might be useful here] and making the appropriate changes to turn off the encryption. Which is usually a drop-down menu. NOTE: You should know what the current password is before you make changes so you can re-enter it when you change it back.
* Hit Apply or Save or the button on the page that would imply it would make the necessary changes.

To go back to your original settings:

* Go back to the Wireless Settings page and simply change the settings back to the way they were when you first arrived at that part of the interface.","1349051127"

The only thing you've responded to is my assertion that the ""spliff"" terminology is a matter of regional slang. I've never heard anyone say that a spliff is anything other than tobacco + weed, besides you. That being said, its SLANG, and so the point is MOOT. No one can be right in this regard, as these things vary.

If I asked my friends if smoking ""tobacco spliffs"" in America is abnormal, they'd probably turn their red-eyed faces toward me and ask, ""What do you mean? I JUST smoked one.""

In fact, my friend just rolled one up. And we's about to go smoke it. I don't know if you're wrong or right, but I don't think you have ANY evidence to back up your point. And remember, personal experience =/= empirical evidence. You're touting your opinions like they're proven facts, when I know at least 40 people who would disagree with you.

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","I'll comment using a throwaway account. I've met Joe (the submitter) and was the person in charge of the program mentioned in the article until about two months ago. I don't agree with the way that this article presents the program.

A couple of things that commenters keep harping on in the was the expense of 25k to get only 32 people signed up. First and foremost, not all of that money was spent in 2011, with almost half being rolled into this year's efforts. In addition, these specific types of cards are not linked financially to the user in any way. Because of this, we made the decision to work with a few key housing partners to closely determine quality applicants. Part of the money was set aside to serve as replacement funds for any lost/stolen/damaged bicycle should it come to that. If you didn't know, a B-cycle costs $1,080 for Denver B-cycle to replace (there is no profit on users charged for lost or stolen bikes). And if you think that's expensive, please feel free to go purchase any bicycle that you believe might be able to withstand 3 years of multiple rides per day by the general public and try it out. They wouldn't last.

 It was indeed a single person working on this program (me) for the majority of it. By the way, this pilot was geared at identifying why these communities don't utilize the bicycle itself, not just signing as many people as possible up for the program. Despite that, as of my last count, we had signed up over 70 people and the vast majority of the new signups we using the bikes multiple times per week. We ran multiple focus groups, did safety trainings, included a helmet for the first 70 registrants if they wanted one (some did not against my advice) and showed the sign ups how to ride the bikes safety. This was all done in addition to other full-time job responsibilities while working at Denver B-cycle.

I personally think this article does the pilot low income program a tremendous disservice. I know that Denver B-cycle would love to have stations located in all neighborhoods, including those representing a diverse socioeconomic group, but the reality is that running this program is expensive. Denver B-cycle does not receive local tax funding to sustain the operation of the program, and as such they need to make ends meet by placing stations where they will be used as frequently as possible regardless of the sex, income or race of the rider. Furthermore, I think that dedicating an article strictly to a lone dissenting voice in city council is, frankly, a waste of the journalistic abilities of the author and simply serves to muckrake on a hot button topic the Post knows will draw page views and comments. No offense to you, Joe, I know you're a stand up gentleman.

I should mention that the opinions above are strictly mine and do not reflect those of Denver B-cycle, Denver Bike Sharing, or any current or past employees other than myself.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It would still take more power to pump the water into the reservoir than you would gain from letting it back out through the turbine. Most ""perpetual motion"" machines (actually, ""over unity"" would be a better term), just obfuscate the conversion process so there is ambiguity in the understanding, then it works the ambiguity angle to provide infinite energy. People love using magnets for this because they're so counter-intuitive.

[Here's an example of pumped-storage hydroelectricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity), and it's apparently 70-80% according to wikipedia, which I think is a very excellent efficiency.

The way I always think of it is that the universe is pretty old; like *really* old. If energy exists in a heightened state (low entropy) and is able to be harvested, then it's highly likely that random chance would have made it happen by now, and *something* would be utilizing it.

"cats","t5_2qhta","From the site:

My silly, fluffy cat Gonzo, who turns four in a couple of weeks, is having bladder problems caused by urethral issues. Lemme put it this way: cats have small urethrae. Apparently Gonzo just has too small a penis. Insult to injury.

He got lethargic, wouldn't eat or drink, and wouldn't respond to our calls or prodding on Friday. He wouldn't eat crappy bodega cat treats! That's how I knew something was up. We brought him to the vet and they had to take him into the ICU (or the equivalent for non-human animals, whatever).

Gonz has been in the hospital since Friday morning, when they first noticed the obstruction in his urethra. The little guy has a heart murmur too, so they had to check that out before they could sedate him and put in a catheter. That got sorted out, in went the catheter, out came the angry growling. We expected him to get better and be able to pee on his own today, but that just didn't happen. Technically the catheter would have been pulled out by now anyway, but, er, Gonzo decided he'd had enough, gotten out of the cone of shame, and pulled out the catheter himself. He's a bamf. The blockage returned within hours, and the catheter went back in. 

On the morning of October 1st (so, tomorrow morning), Gonzo is having an operation  so that he can pee on his own and not ruin his liver, kidneys, and urinary system. It's a serious, expensive surgery (a perineal urethrostomy) but blockages are essentially an ongoing disease that cannot otherwise be fixed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think part of it might be, such as in OP's situation, affected by how your life was threatened. If it was something of your own doing that almost killed you then it might have an impact, but if it was just pure luck that the event even occurred, then I would think it would have no impact. It could also just depend on your outlook on life in general. Life and death can be viewed differently by everyone. What I mean is that thinking death isn't a big deal, and that it will happen when it happens, and yet cherishing life might not be an outlook everyone has. You could think that way, but I might not cherish life while still thinking death is not a big deal. I think there's a ton of factors that weigh into whether or not a near-death experience might affect us in any way.","1349051142"

Figure out how often he needs to go in the pen and take him a bit more often than that.  Don't give him the opportunity to need to go and not ask to go out.  Also, ring the bell yourself when you take him out even if he didn't ask.  

That said, I don't think that having him in the pen for the day is that bad.  It looks fine for his size.  Just make sure that he is getting attention etc and all that stuff you already know.

I was taking a nap and I was in that weird limbo state, you know when you're half asleep and half awake. Well, in my dream I was laying in my bed with my eyes closed when my kitten hops on my bed and starts playing with my hair. Next thing he starts to crawl on my head and suddenly mounts my head right on top of my ear and proceeds to hump and bust a load into my ear canal, before I could react he (or maybe my older male cat) does the same thing in the other ear. I get up and tried to sprint to the bathroom but the kittens microwaved mayo made me feel drunk/high. Kind of like the feeling of a high dose of DXM. When I finally get to the bathroom I'm panicking about what I'm going to tell my doctor/ whoever takes me to the doctor. I woke up right after that and shook as violently as I could and find my kitten staring at me from across the room...

A friend of mine, who went to college about 4 years before I did, came home to visit and told me all about this club he'd gotten into called ""The Society for Creative Anachronism"".  Basically, they're live action role players who dress up in medieval battle gear and beat the hell out of each other with padded weapons.  There are rules, refs, scores, etc.  He was showing me all of his armor and weapons and I, being the precocious little prick that I was, said, ""Well, why are we talking about this?  Why don't we just put this shit on and beat the hell out of each other?""  So we did.  He was a bigger man than me and his helmet was fitted to his (melon-sized) head.  At one point he jabbed me in the forehead, the helmet kicked back and the inner framework hit me in the eyebrow.  I thought nothing of it.  Later, we took off our helmets to get a breather.  He looked at me and said, ""Oh man"".  He wiped my brow with his hand and showed it to me.  It was as if he'd put his hand in a bucket of red paint.  He said, ""You need to go and get stitches.""  I said, ""Neh.  I'll be fine.""  And I have the scar to this day.  Not a romantic story but there it is. ","1349051151"

We do have to do it every day, which sucks, but you have a much larger area that takes longer and probably takes more effort.  Female grooming involves WAY more shit and hard stuff than I ever had to deal with.  I was just trying to compare face-shaving with leg-shaving.  I'd much rather shave my face once a day than do all that other crazy stuff that is expected of women.  But take my word for it that scraping the hair off one of the most sensitive patches of skin every morning sucks.  If you fuck it up, you break out with acne, razor burn, or go into work with band-aids plastered everywhere.  Not good.

So maybe the actual SoL wasn't moving to the WQ, because people are always looking at it.  But instead, since anything that holds the image of an Angel is an Angel, the fact that Garner and then Rory looked at the pic of the SoL in the lift gave it the opportunity to come out of the pic and grow to full-size - taller than the WQ building - a bit of the way out, then shake the ground while walking over in position to attack the specific person who saw the pic in the lift.

"freeflight","t5_2v02s","Everything you have said is true. And I hope you make smarter decisions, too. 

One of the greatest takeaways from this experience for me is how foolish it is to trust oneself in these kinds of situations - our minds are really not good at objective analyses. Lessons have to be relearned and strengthened continuously. It's not enough to learn them once, and then call yourself capable or smart. I went through the same training as you are going through; I have likely read the same books you've read (and more); and I have likely watched the same famous crash videos as you have (and more). I have watched friends get injured. I have vowed to be the kind of pilot that never has to throw his reserve in 20 years of flying. I have promised to be a safe, cautious pilot (and others have trusted me as so). I've said no sitting on launch many times (last weekend was the latest one, in fact). I've told older pilots who were encouraging me to fly in unsafe conditions to fuck off. I read the safety reports. I try to keep myself humble.

But I still fucked up.

When becoming a pilot, you have to realize that no matter how much training you have, no matter how much you think you know, or how smart you think you are, you are very very fallible. You **will** make mistakes. Adhere to operating limitations, organizations' safety regulations, and the advice of those more experienced than you (though not too much on that last one), and when you make mistakes, the consequences will likely be minimal. Remove as much subjectivity from your decision making as possible.

I'm glad it seems so simple in your mind. Because really, it is. I fucked up. I was stupid. I still can't quite get my mind around how I came to be so stupid. It's amazing how stupidity sneaks up on really ""smart,"" capable, well-trained people. 

So stay humble, and keep things simple. Thanks for your thoughts.","1349051157"
"confession","t5_2qo2a","It's funny how you state in the opening paragraphs of your Confession that you don't associate with predominate African American stereotypes in white culture (continues to read...)

In the fourth paragraph you speak about experiencing discrimination because of the colour of your skin. If this relates to you hating being black, it would make sense to hate those who seek to oppress you. You hating yourself is probably an outcome they want. (Continues to read...)

You engage in racist arguments when you say a majority of black people are ghetto. I think your basing this off of limited world experiences and the fact that these views are reinforced by racists whom you are surrounded by, many of whom you may call your friends! (continues to read....)

Your sexual frustration due to the fact you like a particular subculture seems really trivial. If you're young, you'll probably find women who appreciate and love you for who you are. Wanting people to like you on mass leads to problems.

To sum up - It seems like you're a self-hating black person. But why? W.E.B. Du Bois spoke about something called Double Consciousness in the beginning of the 20th century in which Black people view themselves in the prism of the dominant culture regardless of who they may be as individuals or who they truly are as a group. Rejecting yourself leads to even more problems because people will still treat you differently, discriminate against you due to the fact you are still black!

You need to truly examine whom you'd like to be and break free of stereotypes and make sure that you as a person are not merely Black but whomever you truly are.

Obviously you're better off if you're building Phage or something else late game oriented. But what is the point of sitting on some gold while doing no damage and dieing quickly? Double Dorans is also good on a Nocturne that gets behind.

HoG is good as well, but never get it past 15 minutes.

"hardware","t5_2qh18","Somehow my message disspeared. Anyways the i7-960(and other LGA1366 CPUs) are still a power house. You really don't need to overclock it. Overclocking can be done for many reasons. Bragging rights, better number crunching, photo editing, and such. I mean if you had a CPU like the Q6600 or Phenom II X4, then yes, overclocking can appeal to you as they do show gains.

TLDR- Overclocking won't be a big appeal for you yet as the i7-960 is still a excellent powerhouse of a CPU. It smashes any games with ease. Feel free to do it for fun.

As what you said temperature doesn't matter. A processor at 20C,40C, and 60C will perform the same. CPUs have a thermal limit where then its performance decreases because it underclocks itself to prevent harm( 100C for example).","1349051165"

To add, I dug Burning Rubber by Charles Jennings.  It's a fairly compact revision of F1 from the beginning through to the 2000's.  Lots of cool and interesting facts and stories.
The Grand Proxy Saboteurs by Jowls Saward was an interesting read.  It details the lives of F1 drivers turned spies during WWII.  Not so much Formula 1 but interesting none the less.  
Finally, The Lost Generation by David Tremayne.  Which tells the short lived stories of Roger Williamson, Tony Brise and Tom Pryce.  Whilst at the same time giving a rundown of safety in F1 and how it improved.  I really enjoyed this book, it's a pretty sad tale and extremely tragic.  It could be my pick of the lot.

I would never want to part with either; but if you put a gun to my head and made me pick, I would give up the Radias. The Phatty changed the tone of my music for the better. (and to me it also has the appeal of a 'pick up and just play' synth because of the keyboard)

EDIT: I noticed you were thinking of trading in a Slim Phatty for the OP-1. I have no real experience with it, but I feel you might be happier with the Radias.

There are rumors of Spotify making an web app, which I would like to see.  There are many times when that is a useful option.  Rdio does still have that.

It also seems when people like to music, Spotify is a much popular choice.  For example, there was a post on reddit asking for people's all time favorite songs.  Someone went through every post, made a Spotify playlist and posted a link.  I don't remember seeing a link for Rdio.  Stuff like that has value to me.

My favorite OP: [Air - ""Tori no Uta""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npnqMotgqdg)

Original comment follows:
---

When it comes to OPs/EDs, I usually focus on the music. The ones that first came to mind that haven't been mentioned already:


Cutest OP: 
[Shinryaku! Ika Musume OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sFp4tJR5jQ) 

Cutest OP 2 (because Japan can't just have one Cutest anything): [Lucky Star OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJXi-FU7sA)

Most fun OP: [Wagnaria!! - OP 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJjT50rRfok)

Best OP rerecorded in English: [Rurouni Kenshin OP 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZMmIRzIzo4)

Best OP that is story relevant and, sadly, only used in one episode: [Arakawa Under the Bridge OP 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TogXa0h5Dys)

OP that is 10 times better than its anime: [Yokuwakaru Gendai Maho OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ziuEJIWfi0)
(You can watch the actual OP on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/yokuwakaru-gendai-maho/episode-1-hello-world-531480) but I couldn't find it on Youtube.)

There's one particular opening that I can't quite remember... I'll add it if I remember.

ENDINGS!

Classiest ED: [Neon Genesis Evangelion ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW1PBoLCz3g)

Most deservedly popular ED: [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya ED 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhq4BGDAESY)

Most consistently good endings: [Inuyasha ALL EDs (first one linked)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijpOmkrGAI)

I don't remember nearly as many endings. Most of them are trash and/or I skip them when watching series.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","&gt;Do you guys think that it's possible for every verb form in Japanese to be equivocal in at least some respects to other languages, or even reasonable to expect it?

No and no.

&gt;how to classify Japanese verb declension?

I didn't know what the word ""declension"" means, but Wikipedia tells me it's the singular/plural difference (with additional differences), meaning that Japanese wouldn't have it.

In my own personal notes, I just refer to all forms by an English initial followed by their actual form.   Dictionary form is Vる. Potential form is Vれる. て-form is Vて.  Past tense is Vた. Volitional form is Vよう. ます stem is V~~ます~~.  Past tense い-adj are いAかった. Present tense い-adj are いAい. A な-adj (with no trailing な) is なA.  A な-adj with trailing な is なAな.

In this way you don't have to worry about the technical differences between a ""gerund"" and an ""infinitive"" just to learn a grammar pattern.  Additionally, the system is incredibly intuitive and anybody who sees one immediately knows what form I am talking about, regardless of if they are used to the technical linguistic names for the forms in English or the technical linguistic names for the forms in Japanese, or if they are used to calling the forms あ形、い形、et cetera.  It also resolves confusion if someone says something like ""丁寧形"".  Does that mean 食べます, お食べです, or 頂く, or 召し上がる? This system can only possibly cause confusion when using things like Vよう for う-verbs, and then only for people who are not familiar with the system.","1349051190"

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","I have gotten into opera fairly recently.  I can tell you a few things to help.  Read the plot synopsis before you go in.  The pacing and style are not very good for simply getting a story across.  It is designed to be the combination of music, singing, story, and show as a whole, so do not worry about spoilers.  Definitely read the synopsis before you go.  

Make certain you do not start with a daunting opera (like Die Walkure).  Try to get an idea of the running time of an opera before you go in; no need to be surprised after you buy the ticket.  Something that is 3 hours or less is a good start, and they will have intermissions spread out on long shows to help.

[I would recommend looking here](http://www.fathomevents.com/performingarts/series/themetopera.aspx).  I watch the fathom events broadcasts of the Met.  I like having the subtitles there on the screen and it is always a beautiful show.  On Oct 13th Donizetti's L'Elisir d' Amour will be playing.  One of the 1st operas I really enjoyed was Don Pasquale (very similar to L'Elisir) and starring almost the same people as this performance.  You might see if a theatre near you is playing it.  I think it is a good entrance to opera myself, and I highly recommend checking it out if you can.  If nothing else see if you like it.

Finally, one thing I have noticed for myself is that it is better that I do not speak the language.  Many operas have the dialogue spread out, repeated, and slow since it is in singing form.  Most of the English operas I have seen felt dreadfully slow, but that does not happen as much when I do not speak the language.  I am happy to have the time to read the subtitles and just enjoy the sound.  It is easier to enjoy the singing when you are not distracted by understanding the words.","1349051200"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;You clearly know very little about Soviet history -- it didn't precede them as you suggest.

No need to be a dick.  I was referring to the Tukhachevsky circle, it seems you were referring to the later and broader purges of the officer corp. I thought you were referring to the same thing given the discussion about Stalinist views of Nazi infiltration and it's effect on the general level of paranoia, because that event was the watershed for the foreign influence worries. I apologize for misreading you, but I don't think that means I ""know very little about Soviet history"", sorry.

What Stalin thought about Trotsky and what Trotsky actually did are two very different things.  That Trotsky was a Jew and openly hated fascism doesn't change what Stalin thought Trotsky was capable of, nor does it change the intelligence reports, on record in Moscow, that show the Soviets thought people close to Trotsky were meeting with German intelligence. 

&gt;And you haven't cited a single academic who supports your views...

And you cite works in all your reddit comments? Whatever. On the particular point about Stalinist beliefs about Nazis and Trotskyists, see Thurston, [""Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934-1941""](http://www.amazon.com/Life-Terror-Stalins-Russia-1934-1941/dp/0300074425).

&gt;they have provided a Marxist analysis of the social roots of the terror as stemming from the determination of a privellaged bureaucracy to maintain its political power

An analysis I personally think is wrong, but I don't want to get into that as it's a neverending debate. I also think the political commitments of Trotskyism can lead to (but do not necessarily lead to) some bad conclusions about parts of socialist history.

I, however, feel there's a whole load of irony when redditors become enraged when Islamic leaders call for blasphemy laws to be implemented in the west, only to comment about how the laws should be changed in those islamic countries. 

I'm not saying we can't say ""hey, that's awful, you shouldn't do it!"" (re: genital albation, sexist practices, etc), I'm saying that we should at least try and not come off as a terrible hypocrites as we do.  

On the subject of blasphemy laws... well, it's hard not to feel that calling for their abolition is an attempt to push the western perceptions of ""free speech"" (hell, the American version of it!) to people who don't share those ideas. I think that, just like you can't ""inject"" democracy, you can't set up a liberal*-influenced legal frame in a place that is closer to the european middle ages in terms of ideology and expect it to work.

-don't be afraid to be aggressive as hell, this is how i plan Janna flash ulting a carry is one of the greatest feelings
-when getting your gp10s it very important to choose whether you are going to be aggressive then get the Hog first or more passive then get the philo first

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","In Detroit, argueably one of the most dangerous cities in the country, the rate of rape is 0.57 in a thousand, and that number is over the course of a lifetime. Colleges, with a 1 in 4 rape rate would be 500 out of 2000 over the course of an average of four years. Detroit would be 1 out of 2000 over an average lifetime. 

If we want to know the increased percentage chance of a woman getting raped in college as opposed to a lifetime in detroit, we need to calculate college out to a lifetime. Right now, 4 years in college equals 500 X, or 50,000% more likely to get raped than a lifetime in Detroit. However, 4 years isn't a lifetime. If we say that for 50 years of her life a woman has the possibility of getting raped, that is 12.5 X more than 4 years. 500 x 12.5 = 6,250.

In purely mathematical terms, a woman is 6,250 X, or 625,000% more likely to be raped in college than living in Detroit, argueably the most dangerous city in the US.

Of course I'm using the 1 in 4 gospel of feminism number to do my calculations. The reality number will reflect reality. ","1349051211"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","This may sound crazy. Repurpose cheap bottom coil cartomizers. I saw this mentioned either here or on ECF, tried it and it matches your specifications for minor occasional testing use perfectly.

The cartos that came with my original ecig weren't boge-style vertical coil cartos (the coil runs up the middle of the polyfill) but were some other brand of horizontal bottom-coil cartos (coil with a wick runs horizontally across the bottom of the polyfill). If you take out the polyfill and the center tube thing then you're left with a 510 carto that has a little coil with a wick that holds 2 drops of  liquid, I drip one drop down each side attempting to hit the ends of the wick.  3 drops will probably flood it.

It is perfect for tasting. One or two puffs to make sure it's primed, three or four good full hits, a couple more dainty puffs to finish the remaining liquid and avoid a mouthfull of dry burn atomizer and on to next flavor.

I tried a plain 510 atomizer and found it a pain to deal with. I have a Phoenix for the 7ish drop sessions, those piddly cheap assed ripped up bottom coil cartos are my goto for flavor testing. I'm still hanging on to the 4 cartos left from that ecig to use when the current one finally fails.

Search around for bottom coil cartomizers, buy a box of 5 for $5-7 bucks or something and don't fret about finding some expensive made for constant dripping atty.","1349051212"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","According to this government website 

http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/chicken_from_farm_to_table/index.asp

&gt;with regard to beef, hormones may be used to promote efficient growth.
&gt;FSIS randomly samples cattle at slaughter and tests for residues. Data
&gt;from this Monitoring Plan have shown a very low percentage of residue
&gt;violations. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone (three natural
&gt;hormones), and zeranol and trenbolone acetate (two synthetic hormones)
&gt;may be used as an implant on the animal's ear. The hormone is time
&gt;released, and is effective for 90 to 120 days. In addition,
&gt;melengesterol acetate, which can be used to suppress estrus, or improve
&gt;weight gain and feed efficiency, is approved for use as a feed additive.
&gt;Not all combinations of hormones are approved for use in all classes of
&gt;cattle. Hormones are approved for specific classes of animals only, and
&gt;cannot be used in non-approved classes.


reason why hormones cannot be used in poultry:

&gt;Hormones are not used in poultry or in other meat animals because
&gt;hormones are not effective during the brief time these animals are being
&gt;raised to maturity.

However

&gt;Antibiotics may be used to prevent disease and increase feed efficiency. Before the bird can be slaughtered, a ""withdrawal"" period is required from the time antibiotics are administered. This ensures that no residues are present in the bird's system. FSIS randomly samples poultry at slaughter and tests for residues. Data from this monitoring program have shown a very low percentage of residue violations. 
 
About hogs: 

http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Pork_from_Farm_to_Table/index.asp#2

&gt;Antibiotics may be given to prevent or treat disease in hogs. A ""withdrawal"" period is required from the time antibiotics are administered until it is legal to slaughter the animal. This is so residues can exit the animal's system and won't be in the meat. 

&gt;FSIS randomly samples pork at slaughter and tests for residues. Data from this monitoring program have shown a &gt;very low percentage of residue violations. 

&gt;No hormones are used in the raising of hogs. ","1349051220"

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","This submission has been automatically removed by the AutoModerator Bot.

Listentothis follows [strict submission guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q0x6q/meta_the_listentothis_rule_review_a_restatement/) decided by the community. If you don't feel like reading this entire post, then take a look at the titles of the submissions in listentothis right now and ask yourself what you did differently.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] *anything*
* You *must* include the artist, the name of the track or album, and at least one genre tag.
* You *must* use a delimiter such as - or 'by' between the artist and the track name.
* There are no exceptions even if this is your own music or a friend's band.
* If this music is *NEW,* *LIVE,* or *RARE* please include those tags in your title.
* Try to use [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/), [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/), [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/), &amp; [Grooveshark.](http://listen.grooveshark.com/)
* Do not spam your music blog. Link *directly* to media. 
* Leave your opinions and links to your blog in the comments if you like.
* Gushing about the artist or begging for attention *WILL* get you downvoted.

Delete your submission and try again. If your new title matches the rules it will be auto-approved by this bot within ten minutes. If your title does follow these rules and this was still blocked, double check that you didn't make a self-post! This happens often particularly with new submitters. You can submit a link, or submit a text post (self post), but not both. If you saw this message in your inbox, then this is the mistake you made. Pay closer attention to the submission screen.

If that wasn't the problem, then there was a problem with the genre tags you used - either there weren't any, they were too vague, they appeared somewhere other than at the *end* of your submission title, or you used tags this bot doesn't recognize yet. Read on.

---

This bot will not honor these genre tags *on their own:*

* indie alternative remix mashup cover soundtrack score singer songwriter band

If your music is 'indie' then it is actually 'indie rock', 'indie pop', 'indie folk', or 'indie electronic.' Indie by itself tells us nothing useful about the sound. Tags like indie and alternative are ignored for vagueness and won't get a submission through on their own. Meaningful tags are *essential* for scrapers syndicating our content, and for priming the reddit search engine. 

The list of valid genre tags is below. Partial matches are allowed. For example, when you see 'rock' below, it will match post-rock, rockabilly, rock'n'roll, and progrock. We aren't checking to make sure your tags are correct. We're just checking to make sure that meaningful tags are present. If you can think of any tags that are not on the list below but should be, please message the moderators of this subreddit and they will have them added to the list.

The *NEW* *LIVE* *RARE* tags are not parsed by this bot. They are for the human moderators, to help new, live, and rare music survive in spite of the rules against popular music.

Hence, the problem...making bureaucratic hurdles the priority, NOT  the application of healthcare.  Do patients share some of the blame?  I'm sure some do, but consider the ""hoops"" they're asked to jump through to receive the healthcare they need.  That ""process"" is an impediment/barrier, NOT a means by which to deliver quality healthcare in a timely fashion.  Most efficiency experts would agree. 

It's time to make the delivery of quality healthcare the industry's priority.  This legislation is clearly a step in the right direction.  I realize this problem stems from hospital administrators and insurance bureaucrats, but it's unacceptable nonetheless.  There's no excuse for the present levels of bureaucracy and poor customer service in many areas of healthcare.  There are much better ways to deliver healthcare in the country and those options should be pursued even if it means stepping on more than a few bureaucratic toes.","1349051232"

If I have a i7 960 3.2ghz and its 40 C vs a i7 960 3.2ghz that is 20 C
Then the cooler one is going to process faster. That is a basic principle.

You could also think of it this way. Planting twelve planting-size cloves now will yield you, at the very least, 48 planting-size cloves next October. So buying two seed bulbs is probably about the same as buying cheap bulbils or trying to get garlic from seed.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","It's funny that you tend to accuse people of ignorance right before you make such a blatant display of it. Let me just go through, point by point, on how you are wrong.

1. The oil embargo did cause the economic problems in the US, but it was because the US supported Israel, so it was due to the U.S. being too assertive, if anything. Now, when Reagan took office, the economy began, as I've said before, a natural recovery from the recession, with it's yet unheard of ""stagflation"", boosted by fallingl oil prices. Stagflation was important because it was used by Reagan and prominent Neoliberal economists to challenge and overturn the ""Keynesian"" economic policies that were dominant until then around the globe, and start to deregulate. Which helped lead to the situation we now find ourselves in, with record high income inequality and a financial system hurtling towards another collapse.

2. The Iran-Contra affair had little to do with the hostages, although that is how it began. But even if it did, who gives expensive military weapons to terrorists for five people? That is ridiculous. And how was it not a voluntary sale, no one forced Reagan to break both international and US laws. Anyways, the trade was primarily used as a way to fund the Contras and get around the Boland Amendment, which is why Contra appears pretty prominently in the name. 

3. If you know anything about the Cold War in central america, or the Cold War in general, you'd know that, contrary to what many in the US believed, the communist countries of the world were not one solid bloc, and the President and other higher ups knew that. The Sandanistas were simply a socialist leaning group that had risen up in response to the Somoza dictatorship. Once they had taken control of the nation, they proceeded to take help from any nation that offered, including Cuba. Reagan, the senile lunatic that he was, saw this as a Soviet attempt to set up shop in Central America, and started to fund the Contras. Now note, the real bad part about this wasn't that he was violating the sovereignty of another nation, that was common practice during the Cold War, but that he sent advisers to train the already brutal Contras to be *more* brutal, encouraging them to use tactics that would make the Taliban flinch. In other words, he supported terrorism.

4. And there's that trademark racism. Yes lets bring bacck apartheid, and while we're at it, how about slavery too? FYI, South Africa has the highest GDP per capita in Africa, including the Arab and Berber north.

I really don't know why all of this is news to you, you literally could have spent like five minutes on wikipedia to get the gist of it, although it is more complex.","1349051234"

"neuro","t5_2qu9b","Not necessarily.  Some people report changes in libido, some don't.  There are a lot of ways that SSRIs could potentially affect libido.

However, one almost guaranteed effect of SSRIs is it becomes more difficult to achieve orgasm.  Although possibly related for some people, this is not the same thing as a decreased libido, or sex drive.  While I haven't read this specifically anywhere, I am fairly certain that this side effect is directly due to higher synaptic concentrations of serotonin, not any type of long term adaptation that takes place.  I'm fairly certain of this because most patients report that this side effect begins immediately after starting an SSRI, long before the antidepressant effects begin.  There is also an SSRI with a very short half-life (Dapoxetine) that is marketed for premature ejaculation in some European markets.  The idea is that it makes it more difficult for men to achieve ejaculation for a few hours after administration, yet it doesn't leave serotonin levels elevated for long enough to cause any type of long term adaptation.","1349051246"

"shittyadvice","t5_2rch1","The idea of saving money is when you make more then you spend.  The obvious answer is to just spend as much as you always have, but greatly increase the amount you make.  I like to phrase it with the formula: Savings = income^3 - spending^2.  

So, if you spend $300 a week, but suddenly are making $5,000 a week, you are saving $9,710,000 per week!

To accomplish this I would suggest things like selling your organs on the black market and getting involved in human trafficking.  Selling cocaine is a sure fire way to do this too.  It helps if you tell all your friends about what you are doing to get more interest in your services.","1349051254"

An last of all, contradicting everything you suggested previously C) delete Facebook and run from his problem. 

Ok, lawyer no... but support system yes. This is where Op comes in. One good friend is better than 10 shitty ones and you can't tell me otherwise. There is no new to bring a lawyer into this unless the acts of bullying were incredibly malicious and harmful to the boy. Fucking getting a swirly for example. Physical contact of some sort. However emotional damage can be worse but it doesn't seem that he's incredibly emotionally perturbed at this stage of the bullying.

Workout? Really? The media must have spoon fed you as a child. There is no reason to unnecessarily workout for intimidation factor. Sure it helps in your mind because you must think brawn over brains win. In which case your dead fucking wrong. Everything around you suggests ""workout and be strong so you can fuck women and intimidate other males."" Ok if you enjoy living with the mind set of a silverback gorilla fine. Go ahead but you won't get far when some guy spikes your muscle milk with ricin. Like the dumb fucking meathead ape you are you'll drink up and eventually cease to be.(yes the ricin is inspired by breaking bad). There is no reason for a 8-12 year old to have to workout in an effort to not be bullied. Third if all deleting Facebook won't help. If anything that eliminates his chances of friendship further. Delete the people he friends that continue bullying him yes. Go private. Be cautious. Just don't delete yourself and think ok now I don't exist there so it will stop. Maybe he's an introvert and gets a long better dealing with a digital life rather than a physical one. He can clearly branch off through Facebook and create outlets for his creativity and intuition as far as film making goes. I'm in no way saying I'm 100% right but your advice was bad and you should feel bad. ","1349051257"

No, I don't make an exception for rape, the baby didn't asked to be conceived by rape, and killing the baby won't make the rape vanish. Incest, again like rape I don't make an exception, also the % of pregnancies from rape and incest make up somewhere along 2% of total abortions. You do understand that if a woman goes into labor and there are complications that the doctors will save the mother and if the baby dies then so be it, by the way, you do understand that every pregnancy has some risk involved right? 

My word, severe disabilities? You must look at down syndrome children and think how the mother should have aborted them.

Anyway, I'm driving north, going to turn west at the intersection. The light change from solid green to a green arrow, while the southbound traffic is shown a red light.

I'm in the middle yellow lane with maybe 4 cars in front of me in line to turn left. One of the southbound drivers enters the middle yellow lane on the north side of the intersection. (There is no reason for any southbound traffic to be there, since they can't turn to their left (east).) As we're all turning from my lane, there is one car left in front of me (we have that green arrow and we're all going) and the driver from the oncoming traffic decides to cut the car in front of me off and come onto the south side of the intersection. This driver is essentially intentionally ""running"" a red light from the yellow middle lane [to get around traffic on the north side of the intersection] while we've had a green arrow for 3 or 4 seconds, and almost causes an accident.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","First off, never let nocturne top lane instead of jungle. 

Second, Teemo is not a good AD carry.

Anyway, on to real advice. There are generally three types of lane comps bottom in the current meta. There is Poke, Kill, and Sustain. Champions like Leona and Blitzcrank have zero sustain or poke, and are only good at setting up kills for their carry. This makes any lane with them a kill lane. Other compositions make more sense in poke, with Carries like Ezreal or Caitlyn, or supports like Janna. Sustain requires a healer support like Soraka, Taric, or Sona.

Kill lanes beat sustain lanes. Sustain lanes beat Poke lanes. Poke lanes beat kill lanes. 

Kill lanes are weak vs poke lanes, because most of the time, the enemy killers will be low enough to not want to engage in a fight. Sustainers beat pokes, because poke's can rarely deal enough damage to break even against the heals. Kill lanes beat sustain lanes because once a fight is initiated, and a heal cooldown is burned, one of the enemies will probably be dead before the heals are ready again.

OS X is shiny and pretty and all, but underneath the skin, it's essentially a Unix system. In fact, Apple uses the 'X' in 'OS X' to emphasize the relatedness between OS X and UNIX.

This means that at any point in time, on a Mac, you can open a command prompt and run Unix commands. You can install tons of Unix-based tools right on your Mac, and you can do just about anything you want.

This is *not* something you can do easily on a Windows machine. You can install Cygwin and run Unix stuff, but it's a giant hassle.

I have my development environments synchronized between my Macbook, my Windows PC (with Cygwin), and my Linux server box. They are all using the same shell profiles, and I can SSH into each machine from any of the other machines.

I really think Sullivan is scared of being ridiculed so he's calling safe plays that defenses can easily defend and make us go three and out. Blount needs to play more. He broke bigger runs today than Martin has and he can push a pile. 

Idk man. I just really think its the play calling. We have SO MUCH TALENT on offense. Our line is solid. Our backs have great attributes. Freeman has a big arm. This play calling and the fact that Schiano has stressed and stressed ball security. It looks like its caused freeman to just constantly throw to the checkdown in fear of what could happen of he doesn't. 

They need to let him loose. He's a big guy. He doesn't need to slide. He can run. Stop trying to force him to sit in the pocket and not give him the chance to make plays.

"MaxMSP","t5_2s9jm","FM is awesome. It creates a really rich sound, really fast. I would definitely play with it with a spectrograph so you can see the overtones (or non-harmonic tones) being produced with different settings. The basic principle is to take a frequency and multiply it by another frequency. If the two are harmonically related, you get a harmonic spectrum of some sort. If not, you get a more ""dissonant"" (but still equally valid) spectrum. I believe taking a frequency and multiplying by itself is how you get ring modulation, but I'm not sure.

There's a wonderful [youtube tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgeTHuDSgC0) that I'm sure would transfer to Max pretty well. I would love to try it with a saw wave instead of a sine as the carrier. I bet it'd be awesome.

I just made a basic ""wave-shaping"" patch where I take the signal, x, and take f(x)=(sqrt(100x))/200 as the output. I had to, to get the negative side as real values, multiply the signal by -1, do the transformation, then re-multiply by -1 and add that to the original signal. It really didn't come out sounding as impressive as I'd hoped with a saw wave input, but it added a lot of edge to a sine input. I wish PD had a triangle~ to test it with, too, as the wave shape would look exactly like the sqrt curve on a graph. 

I don't feel like they were that complex - it just looks complex because of all the sends/receives everywhere, and the setting of defaults. I also throw~ and catch~ the signal around. Basically, the signal goes from the mic to the delay-units to the reverb, out the speakers.","1349051307"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;why is the principle justified, but an alternative principle like ""all other things being equal, the explanation that is most coherent with scripture is the best one"" is unjustified?

That is perfectly fine principle to apply if you assume that scripture is valid and need not be questioned. If you are actually looking for an explanation of reality, it would not seem very useful at all. The principle is justified because it is useful and often works. As I pointed out, it is not a strict law of logic that you must apply to all things. It's justified because it is useful.

&gt;How about ""epistemological from which atheism can be deduced as a logical result""?

Still doesn't make any sense. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how we come by it. Atheism is the lack of belief in a god. The only knowledge involved is that I know what I do and do not believe. I'm unclear as to what epistemology you might be referencing here unless you mean the kind where you look for explanation that are supported by evidence and observation.


Is accepting things as true without evidence any kind of epistemological approach? I'm not sure what you are comparing it to.

But the club Dj's were amazed with it. It was an instant hit, and would become the standard for many years to come, till this day. Disco Icon Mel Cheren (later West End Records) had a crucial role pushing the idea while he was working for Scepter Records at the time, and they finally agreed to try it.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","You're on the right track. But remember that in most cases that we see ""from concentrate"" and ""not from concentrate"" deals with the water.

Lets say you had a small pool with toys in it. Lets say you want to move that pool. It's going to be hard. So let's drain the water. The toys are still in there. Once you move the pool and re-add the water, that's like ""from concentrate"" because it leaves the toys in there and you now have the water again. In this case you might have more or less water.

Now if you had just left the water in the pool and moved it. It would be harder but now you can say it was ""not from concentrate"". Assuming you didn't lose any water or added anything along the way, it's the same.

That is pretty much the premise of concentrate as we usually see it. Removal of the water and then re-adding it back later. Both ""from concentrate"" and ""not from concentrate"" can still have other processed things added. This is why it is confusing because people assume/think ""not from concentrate"" means it is straight up original/natural.","1349051329"

We were walking out of a warehouse and Chuck handed me a rather large box to carry.  I was surprised to find it empty and made comment about the customer being unhappy recieving an empty box.  He responded that there was no way he was actually going to give the customer what he ordered.  In the dream, I knew what that was, but it's not something I know now.  I smiled and nodded at him, agreeing that it would create a bad situation.  

We then walked to the customer's house to deliver the box.  When the customer found the box was empty, he was furious and pulled a knife on Chuck, managing to cut his back before Chuck took him out.  I made comment about the wound, which Chuck allowed me to look at.  It wasn't bad and had already stopped bleeding, so he placed his arm around my shoulder and we walked off together.

Why would I dream this just two nights after he raped me?","1349051330"

That is, assuming we didn't duplicate his work to discover the theory of relativity ourselves. So Occam's often leads to the wrong conclusions. You just end up with more wrong conclusions by dispensing with ontological parsimony.

As for a contemporary example, we might reject string theory for providing no testable predictions yet, and thus having no way of being substantiated by the standards of science. We could easily accept string theory if we wanted, as the math checks out, but coherency alone is just not sufficient to validate a theory if we adopt Occam's.","1349051331"

The only reason I know how to network is because I took a year off from school and obtained a few internships in New York. I'm currently back in school in Chicago for my bachelors.

&gt; It taught me nothing of the business end. That I had to learn from co-workers and clients. 

I think this is strictly based on a mutual respect/trust thing? Because every so often, the companies in your area changes their standards and only the people who are directly connected know exactly what's going on. Plus, no one wants to take the responsibility to share that info unless they believe you're a prospective individual.

Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but this is what I've grown to believe. And trust me, being a student, I wish they were more aware of industry standards and whatnot.

Also, try to get ahold of a copy of ""Jobs for Philosophers"" to get a realistic feel for job prospects.

The beginning sales numbers were relatively good in the current market, but that's all."" Yet their sales have been better this year than they have in the past TEN with the old dc universe.

""Now that the shiny new has worn off, and those new readers haven't shown up in nearly enough numbers, what does DC have?"" Great ongoing stories like Batman, Swamp Thing, Animal Man, Justice League, and more. Better artists and a fresh look that appeals to old readers(who aren't complainy asswhipes) and new readers alike. Sales that top what they have been for ten years. An abundance of new readers. Freedom from old books that weren't working. Freedom to drop old and tired stories like Lois and Clark and start with something new and better. Freedom to write better origin stories. Freedom to add new powers to characters that have been around forever. 

What did the old DCU have? If it was so great, where were their big supporters who loved them? Where were THESE sales? What was drawing in new readers? What was adding new changes? If the old DCU was so great, it was working out, drawing in new readers, having steady supporters(again, even then old comic fans bitched about something) then there wouldn't have BEEN a new 52. The new 52 is better in every way. If you don't like it, then why are you still bitching about it? It has been a year, a successful one, with well over six months more of continuation.

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","If we estimate the average episode is 45 minutes long (25 minutes for the animated series):

TOS = 79 x 45 = 3555 minutes = 59 hours

TAS = 22 x 25 = 550 minutes = 9 hours

TNG = 178 x 45 = 8010 minutes = 134 hours

DS9 = 176 x 45 = 7920 minutes = 132 hours

VOY = 172 x 45 = 7740 minutes = 129 hours

ENT = 98 x 45 = 4410 minutes = 74 hours

TOTAL = 537 hours (or 559 hours if you also include feature films).

This means if you had no life and watched Trek for 10 hours a day you could do it all in less than two months. If you decided you wanted a bit of a life but would still watch three hours a day you could do it in six months. If you set yourself the goal of watching two episodes per day you could do it in a year. If you watched just one episode per week it would be a 15 year project (and in all likelihood there would be at least another Trek series in existence by that point, to mention nothing of other feature films).","1349051343"

So when they saw the impact this game had on the crowd they started shitting out great patches working on the game like hell. 
I hope they got their lesson that Diablo has a huge and devoted fanbase and that they will look to mend whatever issues this game has in future expansions and patches.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Well I want to see society progress and I care about the public good.  My business is cash only and yet I still end up paying around a 25% tax (single making 75k/yr) which is significantly higher than selfish bastards like Romney.  

Assuming you frequent reddit which your profile seems to indicate you will notice that many people actually like the public programs that the government helps fund.  Projects like NASA and inventions like the internet exist thanks to people paying their taxes.  Your safety and ability to drive to work on a road without getting shot is also thanks to people paying taxes.

If everyone paid the same taxes that Romney pays the government would be in much deeper debt than it currently is.  Yet Romney **STILL** thinks he is paying too much.  Does he want me to pay more or does he want to increase the national debt?  Either way I will lose because either inflation will devalue what I make or I will have to pay more in taxes to fund his greed.

Jealousy has nothing to do with my feelings towards people like Romney.  I am however angry that people like him shit on the system that helped make them as rich as they are by giving almost nothing back to it and leading it towards destruction.  A destruction that they will not be a part of because they diversified their investments into various other currency and commodity stocks.  People like him sacrifice people below himself in order to maintain their position of power.  They make it harder for others to gain the same amount of capital so that they cannot compete against him.  They just collect dividends without having to even work or for that matter wake up in the morning.

The rich pat each other's backs at the expense of the less wealthy by manipulating the minds of the poor and uneducated. Numbers do not lie, the tax rates that the rich are paying are the clearest indicators that they want nothing more than to ensure that the system works not for all but for them and them alone.  They make their money in the US and then do not care about the country or its people in the least.  They outsource jobs and dodge taxes by stowing them away in Switzerland and the Isle of Man all while gaining the benefits that other people's taxes grant them like law enforcement, military security, roads, and more.  (They hate public healthcare because it is something that does not benefit them.)

I do not care that he makes more, I care that he does not contribute a fair amount and I think his his salary indicates that he will be fine even if he has to pay a 90% tax where as I would be far from fine paying a rate like that.  If anything switch out tax rates, I am sure he would be furious having to pay such a high tax rate he might even yell ""Socialism"" out the window of his private jet.","1349051350"

And in any event, your post implied that the word ""theory"" implied that it was somehow uncertain or under doubt in the scientific community. That is not in any way true. Theories are the meat of science, they're the most important thing in science--they're coherent, well-supported models of reality that match all available evidence.

If youre poor because the government has an education system that doesn't make enough money to buy proper textbooks so you waster 12 years learning nothing and have a shitty outlook on your future and your family is poor on top of that and you can't afford a good college and violence is everywhere on your block and you try to get a min wage job but don't make enough money working full time so that's why your poor then yes that kind of thing sucks and is bad and If this country wasn't so shitty we could have programs set up to help these people. Starting with better education. And those people deserve a welfare check to help them get up and running. But if you have 3 kids and waste all your money on drugs and clothes and don't know what consequences are. Then you don't deserve one. Both are poverty but one is based on choices and one is based on our government. And this isn't strawmam argument because both those scenarios happen everyday. We have to create a better way to gice people our money who actually deserve, and( yes those 3 kids should be in foster)We have to start letting the people decide for themselves in a better way. We aren't stupid. We know what we need. Yes you couldn't start this whole tax thing tomorrow but if we have a good base and teach our kids how to spend money, how to budget, and teach them the things that the gov does and how it works then it is possible and should be what we do.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","A friend and I did the following: 

4 Gallons of cider. We raised the Original Gravity to 1.065 by adding honey.  One pound of honey raises the specific gravity ~.01 for every four gallons of cider it is added to.  We added 3-4 pounds of honey, added to a gallon or so of heated cider to make sure it dissolved. 

We also had to fix the pH to get to about 4. You can use a number of things to do this, but common ones are Lactic acid to make it more acidic or calcium carbonate to make it more basic.

We added a Pilsener Enzyme to help break down some of the unfermentable sugars.

We used a champagne yeast and fermented it at about 65 degrees F for a month. A prior run that another friend did used ale yeast, and it also came out well. Before we bottled it we added about one liter of water and 90 grams of cornstarch for carbonation.


It came out spectacularly well. The only issue is that after a month of bottle conditioning we started to pop bottles. Refrigerated those we couldn't drink quickly enough. ","1349051369"

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","Mathematically it's possible to get to a 3.0 but it will be hard. Basically you have to take the same or more credit hours than your last year in the next 3 years and almost get a 3.3 for all of them. Now depending on which classes you did bad in you might be better off (or worse) than you think. A lot of graduate programs only care about your major gpa, so if you bombed on gen ed classes and did ok on your real major classes then you have a shot. And since you're only starting your sophomore year I'll assume you haven't done too many computer engineering classes at this point. Make sure you do well in the important classes (as well as the non important ones) and stick with it. If you enjoy it then you'll find a way to finish. I started out my freshman year with a 2.75 and climbed to a 3.2 overall with around a 3.4 in my major.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Yes. He talked about both sexual ethics and violence, but I'd bet that he spent more time talking about violence/anger/retaliation than about sexual ethics. (I've never actually counted the number of verses he talked about each, however.)

If you want a good glimpse of the basics of Jesus' teachings, check out the [Sermon on the Mount](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5-7&amp;version=NIV), from Matthew 5-7. That will give you a good idea of Jesus' main ethical teachings. He talks about adultery and lust in the SotM, but the passage in which they are found (basically, all of ch. 5) is building toward this:

&gt;You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

The high point of this passage is the command to ""be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."" How is the Father perfect? By loving indiscriminately. He is good to all people, no matter whether the person is deserving or not. So as important as it was for Jesus to talk about adultery and lust earlier, the *highest* priority in this passage is to communicate that his disciples ought to shower love on everyone - on their friends, on their fellow countrymen, on their family, on their enemies, on foreigners, and on the wicked. The main concern at the end of the passage is the reversal of ""eye for an eye"" in favor of radical forgiveness and love - which is inherently nonviolent.

This is just a few chapters from one of the four gospels, but I think it illustrates Jesus' overall concerns. Of course he taught strict sexual ethics; you'd have to be a fool to say otherwise. But I don't think that you can support from Scripture that he was more concerned about sexual ethics than the ethics of nonviolence.","1349051370"

And [here's the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) about brain structure that causes transexualism.

You can't tell from the gif since it's not the whole field, and also only a 3 second clip, but the form going into the bolos and coming out are the same: the brass is all in one line at the front. She made the correct decision to move to her place within the form; there's not really much 'covering up' you can do about falling, other than getting up and back into the form. Her staying where she was would do more damage to the ensuing sets coming out of the bolos. Instead she moved into the form to prepare for the next set and didn't drop a beat from there.

"askseddit","t5_2s7xh","*I very rarely smile, my face is naturally very serious and it makes me quite self conscious especially when others bring it up light heartedly.*

I'm similar, my default look is probably best described as stern. I've learned to become more expressive non-verbally, quite simply it's something that takes practice. It's weird if your face isn't congruous with your actions and what you say, so definitely work on making them synchronize. This isn't a mental barrier, you just need to learn how to be expressive with your face.

*I rarely am in the mood to dance, despite enjoying music and atmosphere, I often feel angry with myself for not being one of the fun guys on the dance floor, instead I often feel stupid and self conscious.*

I'm bad at dancing too, but so are 90% of the people there (and here, I'd wager). Learn through doing, or if it's that big of a deal to you sign up for dance classes somewhere.

*I am often not in the mood for conversation with strangers, I am fairly confident talking to people I have never met, but when I am not in the mood I feel resentful that I am in this situation and get lost in my thoughts, wondering if they should be making more of an effort to talk to me.*

I don't really understand this one. It seems like your main issue is outcome dependence, but I might just be misunderstanding you. Learn to have fun talking to people - people, not girls -  and you will become much better at it and want to do it more. The vast majority of what we use for seduction works for non-sexual/romantic purposes as well. It comes naturally when you're dealing with a male friend or a female you're not interested in.

*I often feel like I don't want to put effort into social interaction as I will look stupid if the other person doesn't reciprocate.*

Again, outcome dependence. If they don't want to talk to you, **** them. Find someone who does. If you're friendly, and they can't be bothered to spend however many minutes of their lives chatting with you, are they really the type of person you want to be involved with? ","1349051377"

Astrid returns as the messenger of a disappointed Father, sent to aid in the reconstruction of the once-great Brotherhood. The story line revolves around missions that seek to increase the brotherhoods sphere of influence by founding new sanctuaries and seeking the best murderers and spies in Skyrim.

I'm thinking it'd be best if this was done with perhaps a journey to another land(s). Open up some areas in neighboring countries and have specific quests for those people there. Basically you'd go around and collect these elite killers and help each of them found their own sanctuaries.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","haywire and Joeynoh are both correct. These sites will be using mod_rewrite to redirect the url through one unique starting point (index.php for example). 

When an article  is created the name of the article is ""sluggified"" and that slug is stored along with the rest of the data in the database. 

So, I create the article with title ""Great Article On Slugs"" which is stored in the database with the title ""Great Article On Slugs"" and the slug ""great-article-on-slugs"".

An URL such as: http://www.mysite.com/article/great-article-on-slugs
gets forwarded through your centralized access point (index.php).

So, your request is sent through index.php to some kind of router. Which says ""Hey, I recognise that URL, that's going to the ArticleController and it will be using the getArticle($slug) method, which  queries the article table for the slug ""great-article-on-slugs"" and voila, you've got your data.

StackOverflow probably queries on the ID however. Check this URL:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4945630/routing-in-symfony2
Stackoverflow router knows that theres an article with ID 494563, which it queries for. It throws the slug in there for readability.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","If you're just getting into game development it might be a good idea to learn how to use an engine like Unity or UDK.

It's also a good way to find out which area you want to focus on in game dev (scripting, graphics, gameplay etc.) since most in depth books will only talk about one discipline. 

If you really want a book, however, the only one I can recommend (since it's the only one I have) is [Game Coding Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Coding-Complete-Fourth-McShaffry/dp/1133776574).

"UofArizona","t5_2s58b","Look arizona is in the middle of playing the toughest schedule in the country right now. If you've watched those games, we've actually played very well. Our Defense does not in fact suck, they are ok or average. We just played 2 very strong offensive teams. Also we need more consistency and red zone execution from our offense. Yeah that game sucked, and was one we really needed to win. But we are still in it. On the road vs Stanford which is a game we are more then capable of winning. Then we host Washington and USC, both of those games are tough also but winnable. Our season does get a little easier in the end. Utah and CU look pretty week and ASU and UCLA are average. The pac 12 is by far the deepest league in the nation right now so no game is a push-over, but I predict us ending the season ranked with a potential shot at the pac12 title game.","1349051382"

I wasn't able to anyway...but it gets into space....pretty much like SpaceShipTwo does(virgin galactic's ship/plane thing) then goes back into atmosphere. On this flight I entered too fast and most of the parachutes ripped off. still landed good with the 2 that stayed on. 

It's fully stock and I didn't use mechjeb or any other mods/parts. 

I'm working on one now that can get into orbit but I need to do a complete redesign, I think.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;If you admit that you can be wrong, but believe in objective morality, then what's to say you're not wrong about that?

This doesn't make any sense. Everyone makes mistakes, but that doesn't mean that you should not believe anything they say. That's where evidence comes in to back the claim, like the evidence I provided in my previous replies.

&gt;It is therefore impossible to determine whether making the act is the only way to save lives.

In some situations this is correct. That doesn't mean the morality is wrong, it means we simply don't have the information we need to judge the scenario. Morality is the filter your feed information into. If the required information is not present, it cannot be filtered.

&gt;If the NAZIs had won, who is to say what our culture would deem as moral and immoral.

I've already said that my definition specifically *does not rely* on opinion. They may deem it moral but that does not make it moral. They would just be using the word wrong.

&gt;Let's say I push you. I had no real reason to push you, so Is that immoral of me to do? If so, why is it immoral for me to do it, but not immoral for someone in another society where pushing is accepted, and possibly celebrated.

Only if it caused me to suffer in any way and there were no mitigating factors. If I didn't come to harm it's not immoral. If I came to harm **but** it was to save me from being hit by a car (for instance) it would be moral.

There's no 'how much pain' to it. **Any amount**, if inflicted for no reason, since it increases suffering.

&gt;What if I punch you, stab you, etc. You can't argue that morals differ for different people just because of context, then argue that the social context doesn't make a difference and there are things that are always immoral.

**I'm not arguing that there are things that are always immoral. I'm also not arguing that they differ for different people. Quite the opposite.** Opinions don't change morality, and you would judge based on a increase or decrease in a) lives lost  and b) suffering. Lives take priority of course, as a primary goal of evolution.

&gt;Basically, no matter where you draw the line, the line you draw is subjective. You have no basis to draw this line upon except your own opinions of reality.

The line is drawn starting at 0 (the default). If the net suffering and lives lost are both 0, the act is **morally neutral**. Tip it either way, and it's moral/immoral. This doesn't require a subjective line to be drawn. If you shifted the scale so that morally neutral was 1 life lost, **that** would be subjective.","1349051393"

If they had the same mindset as Alexander, they could certainly have taken most of the world, but they had no desire to!

Go read a book on the Ming isolation policies, the Mongol factor, and the influence of Confuscianism ideology on China's trade during the period instead of making shit up.

&gt;Well, again those are post-renaissance empires. Also, Europe didn't have wandering groups in the 1700s because Europe is small as shit compared to nearly everywhere else in the world.

So? So what? I'm not saying Europe was more developed beacuse European peoples are better, of course it's due to fucking social determinism, but it dosen't change the fucking fact now does it?

&gt;It doesn't represent the land mass of that continent because Africa is MASSIVE! Europe is a tiny speck comparatively, so representing the land mass of that region would be much less difficult.

I said Egypt was a highly developed and fascinating culture, but that it does not go as far as to represent civilization for the most part of Africa. Your counter agrument does not respond to mine, and ignores the part about Egypt going to shit 2600 years ago.

&gt;And the guy who thinks it's fair to judge empires based on their geographic area is a genius.

Firstly, I sustain that Empires sixe and contact with other ones is in fact a big fucking factor in meassuring development. Second I claim to be no genius, in fact I'm not terribly versed in these topics, but you my friend should go read a fucking book.","1349051396"

This means really intense 90 minutes in every game and that doesn't mean chasing the ball; it means to give little space to the player that will have the ball; it means intense pressure to force the mistake.

All football requires knee movements. But that's not what I meant: I meant that the style Barca plays is more inductive to get more muscular and cartilage injuries. Specially, when these guys are playing 60+ games per season.

I use Cinema 4D, Syntheyes, After Effects &amp; Endorphin.

My workflow is Syntheyes for matchmoving, Endorphin for animation of a biped, Cinema 4D for rigging lighting &amp; rendering.  I'd do multipass and bring it into After Effects for color grading if need be.

For lighting, I shoot a '12 inch reflective ball in HDR, in the exact spot where the 3d element will be in and use it for global illumination. However, moving forward I will be experimenting with an an iPhone app called Photosynth for global reflections and possible illumination (although it cant do HDR). I've also discovered that I can get away with using the first frame of the backplate for illumination and reflections, it's what I did with the Iron Baby in the linked video.  You can see the boxes behind him reflecting on his head.

If you were to start learning today, I'd say follow your curiosity.  What aspect appeals most to you. If its matchmoving find a good matchmoving program, some people perfer PFTrack.  Learn it like the back of your hand.  Then find some tutorials for Cinema4D, I use Greyscalegorilla.  If also suggest fimiliarizing yourself with After Effects and composting concepts.","1349051410"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Depends on what you want. C++ is, in general, faster but also more error prone (particularly for a less-experienced developer). C++ also has very sophisticated, robust graphics libraries (e.g., OpenGL and DirectX) and a huge community, but it's also less portable (code will need to be rewritten for other platforms). 

Java is easier to write less error-prone code (no manual memory management, fewer idiosyncrasies, etc), it's more portable (your code only depends on there being a JVM implementation on the target platform), but the graphics libraries are far less robust (there are OpenGL wrapper libraries but they aren't as fully-featured AFAIK) and the community is much smaller.","1349051416"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I don't really care if telling the truth sounds offensive to anyone.  It sounds harsh to say certain things, but in some cases that's just because reality is harsh.  

The reason overpopulation has gotten so out of control is that we seem to think that producing more food is an end.  Specifically in the US, we had a chair of the Department of Agriculture in the 1970s who made this the new strategic directive for farming: subsidies and other regulations would be designed to push yield over all else.  Yields go up every year.  That food has to go somewhere.  Does it feed the hungry?  Some of it.  But at a macro-scale, it feeds the population boom.  Because animals are made out of food, population cannot boom without enough food to support the population.  This is true of any animal population, the dial that you can use to control a biological population is food supply.  Given a certain supply of food, and given enough time, a population will settle on the amount of food that will sustain it.  It will fluctuate around a mean, but ultimately stabilizes (aside from drought and other factors).  

The reason that we have so many billions of people in the third world is because there's been available enough food to sustain that population.  The problem is America has been exporting surpluses that create overpopulation in other countries.  There is not enough ""teach a man to fish"" and entirely too much dependency.

As to data, [here](http://thesocietypages.org/graphicsociology/2010/05/10/food-production-increases-world-hunger-also-increases/) is a table of population versus food growth.  Note that the trendline for food production has a higher slope than that of population.  Thinking strictly in terms of biomass, means that either more food is made available to the hungry, to other animals or destroyed (plausible, and a lot of that goes on), that people are fatter (this is certainly the case), that there are new people, or all of the above (hint: it's that last option). The second piece of evidence you requested is [here](http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm).  If the second graph is correct then I'll have to admit that my statement wasn't true (I had not checked in a long time but you can see the trend that I was talking about up to 2009), that every year there are more starving people.  As a percentage of the population, it's actually probably going down according to the graph.  But I still maintain that we produce enough food to feed the world, and that that has never happened, but that world population increase HAS happened every year.

Finally, my point regarding growth is that the way we practice agriculture is designed to convert as much of the biosphere into food for our species as possible.  This may sound ridiculous, but think about how we regulate our environments.  Our system is predicated on grains, which are easy to store.  So, ever since we figured out we could stave off famine with grains and granaries, we've been able to beat a negative feedback control that all other species, even our own, had always been subject to, famine, be it climatological or biological in origin.  Since our species was not (or was less) susceptible to nature's control, our population grew, which necessitated more land under cultivation to feed that population.  Having broken loose from nature's negative feedback controls, we now found ourselves dragged on by a positive feedback loop: no famine, more people, need more land under cultivation, more people, ad infinitum.  This is what I meant by a system focused on growth and little else.

My solution (and I am no expert) would be to try to wean us incrementally from the system we have in place and to return to as much local sustainable, regional communities and economies as possible.  People in Edinburgh wouldn't be able to ear asparagus imported from South America in the middle of winter, for example.  In practical terms I won't pretend to know how to get there, but I do feel it's important to do so.","1349051416"

I realize that a lot of the iPad games are cheap short time wasters compared to expensive games on dedicated consoles, but the 3DS has the short burst kind of games too. I think that most of the games I listed are at least as good as, if not better, than most of the indie games I've seen on the eShop. I think that since the iPad (or iPhone or Android phones) aren't dedicated gaming devices they get held to a double standard. People will mock them for having short simple time wasting type games (Angry Bird, Fruit Ninja, etc), but at the same time will say not to expect a full fledged home console experience on the 3DS or Vita. Personally, I like both, but there just haven't been many games for the 3DS that I've felt like I HAD to have. ","1349051419"

It's an erotica novel in which the main character lacks agency, and particularly, it has attempted to write off the abusive aspects as being simply what comes with the territory in a BDSM relationship. BDSM relationship aren't inherently abusive at all--the community stresses safe, healthy relationships based off of clear communication, in which both parties involved are happily consenting. Since the subculture is already fairly marginalized by most of society, it's pretty sad that people have only begun to openly discuss it in conjunction with a book that completely mischaracterizes it.

Speedy edit because I thought of more things to say: In Harry Potter, abusive relationships are shown: namely, the way the Durselys treat Harry. And the Durselys are absolutely villified for it. Trust me, if the Dursley were treated as model parents by the book, and if Harry happily skipped into the kitchen, eager for his emotional abuse, people would be complaining about it. At least, I would be.","1349051423"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Unfortunately, you probably overpaid for your dog.  If you just wanted a pure breed (although I advise against it for all the medical problems and ""inbreeding"" that is prevalent with pure breed dogs)  then you could pay around $100 for a good pure breed German Shepherd without registration papers.

Dogs, like any other animal, are priced according to their pedigree.  If the parents are grand champions, or if even one parent is a grand champion German Shepherd, then the price will be high because of the potential for winning show awards.  But if they are just your run-of-the-mill pure breed dog, then you are paying for the inherited traits, and not for the show quality.

In Texas you can get just about any pure breed you want for around $100 to $200.  If you want papers with the dog, it may go up to $350 or $500 for rarer breeds.  Only animals with a championship lineage would go for more than that, and the $1000 dogs are handled by brokers that can give you several generations of history, DNA tests, Hip displaysia and other genetic testing, and guarantee the dog's pedigree in writing.

I'm sorry you paid so much for this dog, but in the future please remember that all the little pure-breed puppies that have a crooked tail, are too dark or too light, have an unusual mark on their leg, or just don't look right end up in rescue shelters.  They are just a pure as your $750 dog, they just aren't the ""show dog"" that breeders want.","1349051425"

As you admitted, even the number was just an ""absolute guess"".

I'm not responsible for giving you the exact wording of how your post should have read. I don't see the real value of what you're trying to tell the community here, I just wanted to point out that if you feel you need to share this, there are more respectful and thoughtful ways of doing so.

Your relationship must be pretty special if you used the time you got to talk to each other to ask about whether or not you're cheating. It is my personal opinion that couples that need to talk about whether or not they are cheating on each other and how they feel about cheating already have a problem. Look around in this subreddit and read about what most SO tell each other when they have the chance to talk. Read about how they think for weeks about what to say to support their man/woman, when they finally get the chance.

Your ignorance is showing. The second picture of the queens of Islaam, the Muslim women in niqaab, was most likely taken in Saudi Arabia or another Sunni country.

Iraanian Shee'ah do not wear the full covering in that manner.

It may seem like a trivial point, but these small things show that you dont even know what you are arguing against.

**Second of all:**

Who are you to imply that the second picture is anything negative? These women, these Muslim sisters, for whom I would kiss the ground they walk on, cover themselves because they know they are beautiful and they know that they are priceless.

Not everyone deserves to stare and ogle at them. Only their husbands. Islaam came to liberate women and it indeed gives them their rights, just as it gives men their rights.

This may seem crazy to you that women have rights in Islaam, but it is a fact and if you are willing to learn, me and others can inform you.

**Thirdly:**

Our honourable women should never be on the defensive about why they are who they are, rather it is YOUR women who should be answering for their actions! Why is it acceptable to walk around half naked and call men ""perverts"" when they stare at you? It is a FACT that women use makeup, tight clothes etc to attract men. If this was not the case, then why dont your women put on makeup and do their hair and wear such clothes on days when they dont leave the house?

Your women go out with full makeup and revealing their curves and whatnot, yet when they come home to their husband, they take off their makeup, dress into pajamas and put little effort into themselves.

For Muslim women it is the opposite, they HIDE their assets and beauty when they are outside, because not everyone is worthy to view them, but when they are home, they beautify themselves and wear the best makeup and wear the best dresses for their husbands.

Now you tell me, how do you justify women walking in the street half naked? Do you want your daughter to see the topless woman on the billboard and taker her as a role model?

Do Queens of Western countries dress in yoga pants and tank tops? No! Why? Because it is not the fitting attire for a queen, the Queens are supposed to have some honour and dignity.

And I swear by Allaah, all Muslim women who cover are Queens to us!","1349051428"

the evo chamber takes 37.5 seconds to finish. due to lack of creep under it, it only has around 650 hp instead of the normal 750. 
because of the cannon dealing 600hp during the buildtime of the evo, it will not last longer than 41 seconds (including buildtime).
if you are lucky, you can catch a probe with the brutelings, cancel at the last second and scout, or steal a gas. i once saw a player cancelling at the last second and building another hatch, but i doubt, that its useful.

It seems like theyre factoring in time on the clock wayyyyy too much, perhaps. 

Washington had a 12% higher win probability when they were on on the TB 45, than when they were on the TB 41 on the next play?  When the only need a field goal?  What?

A lot of these advanced football metrics need to go through a lot of tuning to start being indicative of whats going on on the field, theyre way behind baseball (who has its own problem but is much more fleshed out and benefits from having a giant sample sized compared to the NFL)

"mycomments37","t5_2sh7q","&gt; You said you weren't arguing against it. You took several hours of arguing to say you would be willing to argue for it.

**Incorrect.**  I've said weeks/months? ago that I support trans surgery, even publicly funded if it's affordable.  I said this on reddit several times a while back.  In other words: **you simply failed at reading comprehension-** you *assumed* my position because you *failed* to understand my post.  


I recommend you slow down when reading and use more time trying to understand other people's points.

&gt; you're equating it to ""a bunch of white guys pretending to have racial identity disorder."" 

Incorrect- my point wasn't that the two are equal, but that both are physically not measurable (like diagnosed with a physical tool) and **therefore** humans must subjectively decide which is real or not real *in their opinion.*  


I mean, if another person claims their brain somehow forced their unusual behavior/desires (with no physical experimentation to prove their claim) then the rest of us must simply decide whether we trust them or not. 


Logically, this is part of why trans-behaviors should not be labeled as a disorder/illness- if we label it that (purely based on human trust/communication) then we start a pattern of declaring behaviors ""illnesses/disorders"" based purely on trust/communication.   

Therefore, the point of my asking ""Where does this end?"" was this: the results (of declaring behaviors as illnesses) are subjective &amp; arbitrary, and the result of such labeling is that a glorified opinion bureaucracy (eg, the A.P.A.) could simply vote on which claims they believe or don't believe.


And I don't want that system: I don't believe someone's ability to get trans surgery (or anything else) should hinge on the opinions of [non-scientific bureaucrats.](http://themilitant.org/soft-science.php)

&gt; I'll make no apology for [attacking] people who equate trans issues with faked problems.

I wasn't- you either failed to read, or failed to logically comprehend my arguments.  I suspect you're far too intellectually weak to admit you failed in such a way, &amp; therefore you won't apologize.  (Same old reddit. . . )

&gt;January 22, 2027: Dr. Hagiru Sato and his team of scientists from Japan, America, Canada, and Britain begin work on a matter-energy transference machine.   

&gt;February 11th, 2033: First machine is tested successfully after over a hundred failed tests. Controversy over the destructive nature of the technology ignites.

&gt;July 18th, 2033: A catastrophic incident with an energy-matter machine destroys the city of Hiroshima, in devastation not seen since the atomic bombs were dropped nearly 90 years prior. Japanese government officials move to ban work on this technology, though Western powers urge them to allow it, despite the mishap.

&gt;April 22, 2035: First sighting of infected idividuals. Most are animals, some humans are also shown to be susceptible to infection. Most seen around the ruins of Hiroshima, which had not been rebuilt.

&gt;May 13th, 2035: Northern Japan is split off from its southern half as a nation-wide quarantine is enacted. Anarchy soon spreads through the infected regions. 15% of humans exposed to the disease are immune and show no side effects. 84.9% are affected fatally by the disease, which causes cancerous growths. 0.1% of those exposed are shown to successfully mutate. The ""virus"" is found to be a spreadable corruption of genetic material, which causes rapid mutations in infected individuals. All large animal life is soon infected.

&gt;January 1, 2040: 98% of all animals in Japan are wiped out; ecosystems ruled entirely by infected individuals.

&gt;May 8th, 2048: Japanese Defense Force engages infected individuals to preserve quarantine. Co-ordinated attacks by infected humans and animals are seen. High levels of intelligence confirmed.

&gt;May 10th: They fail, and the nation of Japan ceases to exist.

&gt;October 13: The United States Carrier George W. Bush is attacked and sunk by an unknown force. Later revealed to be a co-ordinated assault by the infected. Use of atomic weapons to destroy all life on Japan considered, but denied.

&gt;February 12, 2052: Remaining inhabitants of Japan have appeared, by outward observers, to have begun adopting the infected into their religions. Part of this religion is a total-weapons ban, and the banning of violence against infected individuals. This is surprisingly effective at ceasing conflict with infected individuals.

&gt;April 2, 2055: Infected seen to have spread to North America. Military preparedness results in a far more contained infection. Hundreds of thousands in the United States, Canada, and Mexico die.

&gt;March 11, 2061: The United States Army begins experimenting with the combat prowess of infected animals, who are shown to have a friendly connection to humans who treat them well, much like dogs. Initial tests exceed expectations. Later that same year, China, Russia, Vietnam, and N. Korea react by signing the Kommu Pact, ensuring protection against the now utterly overpowered West.

&gt;July 2, 2063: The Kommu alliance declares war on the United States. Infected used to great effect.

&gt;November 9, 2066: The war ends. Communist states are dissolved, China and Russia (and all of Asia) are now under the jurisdiction of the NATO.

&gt;December 25th, 2072: The now divided regions that were once Japan begin to open up to the outside world. Mostly through scientific trade-off.

&gt;February 1, 2081: Japanese scientists sneak into heavily infected Brazil. They recover the DNA of one of the individuals believed to be one of the first infected.
Beliefs are that the infected are actually the next phase in evolution, and to find one of the originals would better help their understanding. There are many tried and failed cloning attempts, before a final experiment is successful. The result of this experiment, capable of self-induced energy-matter transference, is responsible for the death of dozens before escaping.

&gt;May 22, 2081: Ash Ketchum turns 10 years old, and sets out on a quest to capture some of the strongest mutant animals known to man.","1349051452"

I hope to demostrare so in the coming weeks, good Lord willing and the crick dont rise even more...


I'll began with some links to which I'll refer again, most links lead to much more information:


 First, [wiki, though I'm anchoring to a most illuminating, little known, piece of trivia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Hassam#The_Flag_series):

* *Being an avid Francophile, of English ancestry, and strongly anti-Germany, Hassam enthusiastically backed the Allied cause and the protection of French culture. The Hassams joined with other artists in the war relief effort from nearly the beginning of the conflict in 1914, when most Americans as well as President Woodrow Wilson were decidedly isolationist. Hassam even considered volunteering to record the war in Europe, but the government would not approve the trip. He was even arrested (and quickly released) for innocently sketching naval maneuvers along the city’s rivers. In addition to the time he gave to many committees, several of his flag pictures were contributed to the war relief in exchange for Liberty Bonds.[50] Although he had great hopes that the entire series would sell as a war memorial set (for $100,000), the pictures were sold individually after several group exhibitions, the last at the Corcoran Gallery in 1922.*

**Plese read the entire wiki as it is unusually well-written**, and not by me...


* *Childe Hassam(October 17, 1859 – August 27, 1935) was a prominent and prolific American Impressionist painter, noted for his urban and coastal scenes. Along with Mary Cassatt and John Henry Twachtman, Hassam was instrumental in promulgating Impressionism to American collectors, dealers, and the museums. He produced over 3,000 oil paintings, watercolors, etchings, and lithographs in his career, and was a founding member of The Ten, an influential group of American artists of the early 20th century. His most famous works are the ""Flag"" oil paintings, completed during World War I.*

[Childe Hassam - American Impressionist painter](http://www.childehassam.org/)


* *Childe Hassam (1859–1935), a pioneer of American Impressionism and perhaps its most devoted, prolific, and successful practitioner, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts (now part of Boston), into a family descended from settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Equally adept at capturing the excitement of modern cities and the charms of country retreats, Hassam (properly pronounced HASS-am) became the foremost chronicler of New York City at the turn of the century. In our day, he is perhaps best known for his depictions of flag-draped Fifth Avenue during World War I (67.187.127). His finest works manifest his brilliant handling of color and light and reflect his credo (stated in 1892) that ""the man who will go down to posterity is the man who paints his own time and the scenes of every-day life around him.""*

[ The Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/hass/hd_hass.htm)

* *Acknowledged as the leading exponent of Impression in America, Frederick Childe Hassam, was born in 1859 at his family home on Olney Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts. Though an outlying suburb of Boston (incorporated into the city proper in 1870) , Dorchester still retained the character of a small New England country town, with green open spaces and old frame houses set on the low hills overlooking Dorchester Bay. It was here that Hassam recalled spending an idyllic youth, filled with the boyish camaraderie of baseball and rugby games, of clandestine boxing matches, and the pleasures of summer swimming, which became a lifelong passion. Frederick Fitch Hassam, the artist's father, earned his living in Boston as a cutlery merchant, and claimed descent from a long line of New Englanders, as did his wife, Rosa Hawthorne, a native of rural Maine. Childe maintained that the family name was a corruption of the old English surname Horsham, though by an alternative account it was originally Hassan.* 

[Hiesinger, Ulrich W. Childe Hassam: American Impressionist. New York: Prestel-Verlag, 1994.](http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=32)

* *Hassam is perhaps best known as the founder of [The Ten] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_American_Painters), a group of American painters, many of whom had studied in Paris, who banded together in 1897 to show their work after deciding that the Society of American Painters was too conservative. Upon his death in 1935, Hassam bequeathed the complete contents of his studio (nearly 450 paintings, pastels, and decorative panels) to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York. According to Hassam’s wishes, the collection was sold at auction and the proceeds used to purchase contemporary art for American museums.*

[ Florence Griswold Museum](http://www.florencegriswoldmuseum.org/learning/foxchase/html/childe_hassam.php)

* *In 1883 Hassam traveled to Great Britain, Holland, Spain, and Italy, where he produced a large number of watercolors that were exhibited at the Williams and Everett Gallery in Boston later that year. Once home, in 1884, Hassam married Kathleen Maude Doane and lived in Boston until the spring of 1886, when the couple left for Europe. In Paris, Hassam studied figure painting with Lucien Dorcet, Gustave Boulanger, and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre at the Académie Julian, and exhibited his work at the Salons of 1887 and 1888. In 1889 the Hassams returned to the United States and settled in New York. Hassam subsequently assisted in founding the New York Watercolor Club and joined the Pastel Society of New York. He also began to exhibit with the Society of American Artists. In 1897 he was a founder of [The Ten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_American_Painters).*
