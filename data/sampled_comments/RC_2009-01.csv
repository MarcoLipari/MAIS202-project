"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Yes, I know that prices being set by sellers who are guided by costs of production *does* unsettle many Austrians.

In all honesty, I think it may be a small over-reaction to the objective value ideas believed by Marx and some of the classicals before him (whose labor theory of value appeared to lay the groundwork to Marx's exploitation theory).

While supply and demand are the *ultimate* determinants of price, the fact the producers of manufactured goods follow profits forces me to accept that costs are more of a determinant in prices than most people realize.  

For example, it is tempting to say that the price of a GM car is determined solely by the supply and demand for GM cars.  In this respect, one is led to think that the final buyers solely determine the price by their subjective valuations.

But this ignores the role of the producer.  Producers will simply not produce GM cars priced at $10,000 say, if it means they have to suffer losses.  The consumer could theoretically want to pay no more than $10,000 for the GM car, and any price above that they will not pay.  But I always try to remain in the Aristotelian framework that says the only reality is that which exists and is real.  A consumer who wants to pay no more than $10,000 doesn't mean the price for GM cars is $10,000.  

In order for a price to be a price, money has to actually change hands.  GM producers will not be willing to accept $10,000 per car if it means they have to suffer losses, or earn below market profits.  Therefore, even though the consumers *want* to pay $10,000 each for a certain supply of cars, they will end up not being able to buy any GM car at all.  Since no GM cars are being produced, there are no prices.  Since there are no prices, it means the consumer really isn't the direct determinant of what the price is.  If they were, then GM producers would have to produce cars at a loss, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only way GM cars can be produced, such that a price for GM cars actually exists, is if the price set by the sellers of GM cars is *at least as big as the costs, plus the going rate of profit*.  Since the rate of profit *tends* to be the same for car manufacturing (in a free market, without tariffs, subsidies, etc), it must mean that the costs of producing cars is the *proximate* determinant of price.

The Reisman article you linked to, and the authors cited therein, especially Bohm-Bawerk, in all honesty pretty much sums up my sources for costs of production.

You are absolutely right that many Austrians are wary of getting into the cost of production framework.  Again, my best guess for why is that they don't want to give any credibility at all to objective value, because the whole Austrian theory is based on subjective valuation, and so a path towards objective value seems to be a return to the exploitation framework.

If I could add to your comment regarding hours in the day, I think to myself that I can have a longer life if I study history.  History of ideas, events, economic thought, etc.  It makes me feel like I have lived a long life.  I think education is the path to immortality.

Oh, I just remembered, there is an interesting story about objective value (costs of production), and subjective value (marginal utility):  Mises and Ayn Rand, during a social gathering, were arguing over whether value was objective or subjective.  Others present at the gathering were amazed at how intense the conversation became, with Mises stressing subjectivity, and Rand stressing objectivity.  I will try to find a reference for you.","1230768235"

"travel","t5_2qh41","My wife and I [traveled around the world](http://spothopping.com/about) recently, and I was asked how we afforded it. [Here's what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7igry/welcome_mike_aka_raldi_to_team_reddit/c06qx9t):

----

Traveling is only as expensive as you make it. 

Hilary and I saved up for most of our late 20s, living in a 400-square-foot apartment and, significantly, having a tiny City Hall wedding instead of a giant extravaganza. This allowed us to splurge here and there (renting cars, staying in hotels with air conditioning, visiting first-world countries)

However, even if you only have, say, $5000 -- which you will if you skip the big wedding -- you can still do some really fantastic and life-changing travel. For example, flights from New York to Bangkok are currently around $1300 round-trip. Alternately, you can get to Kunming, China for $1100.. or India for $900. Once you get there, the other $3700+ will last months. And, of course, once you get to the other side of the world, you can take short, cheap, local flights; Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang is just $129, and the cultures are like night and day. Train rides within a country cost even less.

If you go with a buddy, or better yet, a significant other, costs will drop by almost half, since you'll be sharing rental cars, rooms, books, hired guides, etc. Really everything except food and admission.

The real extravagant cost of a trip like this is time: You simply can't do it without quitting your job.

I think that, as people start getting married and having babies later and later in life, it's going to be fairly normal to leave one's job and travel for a few months as part of that transition. Especially if you're already moving to another city anyway.

And don't worry, you can always get another job. Even in this economy.

And you know what? Even if I hadn't been able to, even if it had taken me a year to find work, I wouldn't have regretted a thing. Not for a second.

The police is not the only agent of force that may defend against robbery -- you or a private security force may too.  And there is nothing wrong with using force to defend private property.

I do agree that the police are immoral, but not for the reason stated above; rather, it is because the police puts you in jail if you do not give your pound of flesh to the government.  So, as you can see, it is *people in government* who rob you and jail you, not ""capital"".

No.  But who puts them in prison?  ""Capitalism"" or *government agents*?

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;Unlike C#, you almost never need to manually wire event handlers in VB.

It's not just about event handlers.  More and more it's about delegates.  You don't tend to do a lot with anon-delegates and lambdas in VB.NET because the implementation still sucks (you are limited to one-liners even with the new Function statement.)  This really sucks when you need to reduce a collection.  For example, you have a list of names and you need to get a smaller list with all names that start with ""I.""  In VB.NET, you're using a loop, and conditional statements, etc.  In C#, this is a one-liner.

With that said, WithEvents is awesome in VB.NET especially when you realize everything that it does (e.g. when you alter the variable, it unbinds the handlers from the old object, and then rebinds them to the new object.)

&gt;DirectCast is a different beast entirely, and not one I approve of. (I don't approve of C#'s casting syntax either, they both suck in my opinion.)

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt;We have no viable solutions because the waste is radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years...

It does not have to be. The long-lived isotopes are transuranics - actinide elements in the bottom row of the periodic table, past uranium. These are extremely heavy nuclei, and will fission; they can be **destroyed** in a nuclear reactor with fast neutrons (""fast reactor""). The remainder of the waste is short-lived fission products, which can decay to natural ore levels within two centuries.

This is very feasible:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_cycle#Minor_actinides_recycling

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste#Transmutation

The point is that, when you destroy the actinides, what's left is either *reasonably* short-lived and can be easily stored, or long-lived enough that its radioactivity is negligibly low. 

&gt;You also have a risk of nuclear explosions ie Chernobyl.

Chernobyl was not a nuclear explosion, it was a meltdown which resulted in a steam explosion (excessive heat caused steam to expand and rupture the pressure vessel). The energy involved was far less than a nuclear weapon: the disaster was more like a dirty bomb - the effects were from the explosive dispersion of very radioactive fission products. The power surge which caused the meltdown cannot occur in most kinds of nuclear reactors: it is basically a design flaw in the RBMK reactor, which is unstable in that way.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Great post, I agree with most of it (and I'm a prof, which becomes relevant below).

The problem is that there is a circular problem with the definition of best here. Only an extremely arrogant person would assume that the system that picked them picked the best. No, the system picked the people it picked, and we TRIED to make a test that picked the 'best' whatever the hell that means. 

Most professors have no training in test design, have never spent time looking at breadth measures of excellence, and have limited experience outside of academia, because they went from ugrad to grad to postdoc to prof as quickly as possible. So their definition of 'best' is bizarre and their knowledge of the context of broad knowledge is limited to non-existent. 

Profs pick test questions that they would excel at, pick the best students to be their grad students, and the cycle repeats.

Who is to say that the 'best' student isn't a C student:

1) Didn't give a shit about the stupid artificial assignment given in class, was busy doing dev work for her startup...

2) Doesn't worship the sub-sub-discipline that the prof is the worlds expert at, thinks it worth knowing something about, but not enough to get an A, especially since

3) In a lot of cases really good, critical thinking students recognize that for most profs getting an A means agreeing with them.

I've struggled with this for years. I assume I'm one of the worst at this (I'm in no position to judge myself the exception) so I've done the following:

a) reduce the significance of tests; use projects instead; have these projects wherever possible come from outside sources

b) have all major work that I find contentious read by another reader, someone at arms length. In some courses I have all work read by a second reader. 

c) have students do some of the marking - especially for presentations - and provide feedback to each other.

I also interview a few of the top and bottom students in each class once they've graduated (so they can speak their mind). Most of the points above came from those discussions. Painful at times but ... 

I really worry that the best student, the one with the critical difference, will end up with a C in my or some other course and so not end up in grad school, and not end up being the person to really make a difference. 

Anyway, I agree with your points but I really worry about the circularity of our system of determining excellence and entitlement to be a prof.

low light levels we are using just our rods and making black and white detections. M42 is one of the only nebulae with
high enough surface brightness to stimulate at least some people’s cone cells (this varies greatly from person to
person).""

&gt; Morris was hardly the only Israeli liberal dispirited by Arafat’s behavior in 2000 and the suicide bombs and re-occupations that followed; nor was he alone in his gloom after September 11th. But his new language came as a shock. He described the Arab world as “barbarian,” and said that the Israeli massacres committed in 1947-48 were “peanuts” compared with those in Bosnia. Then, there was his call to build “something like a cage” for the Palestinians: “I know that sounds terrible. It is really cruel. But there is no other choice. There is a wild animal that has to be locked up in one way or another.” Upon reflection, even Morris was appalled by those words and later apologized.

&gt; During an arrest, a police officer needs to act like an authority figure.

There is a difference between authoritarianism and authority. As I've said before: The righteous are granted authority. The wrongful assume it. And assumed authority isn't true authority at all. A proper authority figure would not behave like that, and wouldn't need to -- in fact, it would be counterproductive. [Alternative approaches exist](http://garda.ie/faq.html#G4), and I have witnessed them in action e.g. in Ireland. They're quite efficient, and avoid what you describe as ""arrest mode"", even when arresting someone.

At this point, one side needs to step back and stop shooting. In all my years of this shit, I have seen these constants:

2. Israel blows the fuck out of anyone in the vicinity.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt; You're still supposed to use names that are strings in some encoding.

Says you.

Care to back that up?

&gt; I tried strace -ff on my text editor. Almost all the files were dynamically linked libraries. That means the path comes from a config file saying where my libraries are (a directory named lib) and a name chosen by the library authors.

That's not exactly what's happening. The dynamic linker is *searching* for libraries where it takes path-stems and attaches some other path-stem. This is a purely binary operation- the system does not decode the characters used in the ""configuration file"" according to any locale or character-set; it doesn't care at all if the paths are even valid for the filesystem they're being used on.

The operating system (well, dynamic loader in this case) simply treats them as byte-arrays because *there is no benefit whatsoever in treating them as strings*, and there's a significant cost: Transcoding all of those strings back and forth for no reason at all.

That's exactly what Mono and Python and Java and Perl and Haskell are doing, of course: They're transcoding something that makes no sense to transcode, and when they have a coding error, they waste time, and lose data.

For what? Why exactly is this valuable? All so that the error can be detected in `os.readdir()` instead of `print()`?

A ""pathname"" data type which transcodes *when the decoded result is needed* makes far more sense to me.

&gt; I don't see what you're trying to prove with your discussion of sort order and syntax.

That files are a special case, and not mere ""strings"", nor some special kind of ""string"" (which I'm using interchangeably with ""character-array"").

Treating them as strings is what causes the problem, and there's no clear gain. There is however, a very big cost: anywhere from data corruption or data loss at worst, to unexpected (or unhandled) exceptional cases.","1230769563"

"science","t5_mouw","Another explanation of these data is found in Barlow, Sakheim, and Beck's ( 1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. It is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. Because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men. Furthermore, it would indicate that a response to homosexual stimuli is a function of the threat condition rather than sexual arousal per se. Whereas difficulties of objectively evaluating psychoanalytic hypotheses are well-documented, these approaches would predict that sexual arousal is an intrinsic response to homosexual stimuli, whereas Barlow's (1986 ) theory would predict that sexual arousal to homosexual stimuli by homophobic individuals is a function of anxiety. These competing potions can and should be evaluated by future research.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here's mine..it'll probably be longer than I (or you) want:

In Feb I was told by the man I've been in a relationship for over 20 years that he wanted out (17 of those married). I was hurt, angry, the whole bit, and didn't really believe him. Then little things fell into place, and for the first time ever, it occurred to me to check our phone records. That's when I found what I never wanted to see. He had caught up with old family friends...one in particular. I got some emails sent to me through someone at his work, which confirmed my worst fears. They were having an emotional affair, which to me was worse than just plain fucking for the sake of being horny. Everything I saw made me feel raw.... my life, as he told her, laid out for someone else who never should have known. 

I lost my mind. I ended up checking myself into a mental hospital. I couldn't go home, so I went to a friend's house. That friend is 20+ years older than me, and since I didn't have the money to pay rent, I paid with sex instead. I felt like a total whore.

When I could no longer take it, I came home. By that time, a couple of my kids hated me---still not sure why, but they had no problems with calling me every name you could think of...and telling me they wished I had killed myself, and offering to get a rope to help me hang. 

A few months later, he went to visit her halfway across the country. I was hurt and pissed, so a few wks later, I went back east to visit my best friend and let off some steam. I had no intention of doing anything ""wrong"" there, but we basically spent 2 wks drunk off our asses. In those 2 wks I managed to sleep with at least 3 people that I remember--one of them being a lesbian encounter. Before that trip, I'd only slept with 2 people in my life. I also think I was raped, but can't prove it. I just know I woke up with bruises in places I'd never had them before...and hurt in places I shouldn't have. I felt sick. Still do.

Through all of this, I'm still crazy in love with the one man who hurt me more than anyone in this lifetime could have. I've had a lot of shit go down in my life...including being raped several times when I was a kid, by a family member. But HE can still get to me like no one else ever has. ","1230769780"

I've had this bookmarked for months, and they almost ALWAYS move in lock-step since the crash started. I agree, heavy market manipulation, and I think a lot of the gains the market makes after it falls are reflecting the drop in the value of the dollar - if the companies are still worth about the same across the board, the markets indexes will move upwards in lock-step as they keep their same valuation with regards to a lower dollar - lower dollar with set valuation leads to a rise in dollar value for the companies. Dollar drops by 1.5%, indexes rise by 1.5% to keep valuations steady.

I'm not sure we have a problem with too much central planing.

&gt; taxes like income taxes do greatly hurt the working poor.

Again, I disagree with this statement. The working poor pay a smaller percentage of their income to income taxes then a wealthy person. We have a progressive income tax in the US. 

However, most sales taxes in the US are regressive. Meaning a working poor person will pay a larger percentage of their income on sales tax then a wealthy person will. (One way around this problem is to exempt necessary items from sales tax, but that is another discussion.)

There are problems with the US tax system. But I don't think our income tax is one of them.

If you really wanted to look at a tax that hurts the poor, look at social security tax. It takes a big chunk of the average persons income, and once you've made over $102,000 this year you don't have to pay any social security tax for the rest of the year. Talk about regressive!","1230770021"

"comics","t5_2qh0s","Well, when I parse that in my head, I read: 

'omfg you didn'

oh, a single quote, the single quote block is now terminated. Then later, I encounter another single quote which would start a new single quote block that never actually ends (and prevents the topmost double quote block from ending).

There are several solutions for this problem  of single quotes being ambiguous:

* Stop using single quotes for quotations and only use them as apostrophes.

* Stop using single quotes as apostrophes and find another glyph to represent them. (Or stop using contractions and possessives altogether)

* Escape the single quotes.

""I was talking to this guy, right; He was like, 'omfg you didn\'t put me in single quotes, did you?'""

That makes perfect sense to me.

&gt;whats happening now in our society is this: [secularization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularization) I havent been to church in years myself. My concern is for the kids, and society as a whole. Society is straying further from basic principals. I believe single parents, kids having kids, and homosexuality are leading factors in the degradation of our society. I was born in the early 70's. I grew up in a time when kids didnt bring guns to school and shoot everyone, and all the other nonsense that is going on with our younger generation these days. all these are contributing factors in the decline and degradation of society as a whole. To allow ""out of the norm"" breeds more ""out of the norm"". You call it progress, I call it a bunch of people who cant accept rules that were handed down from generations past. The further we stray from these basic ""rules"" and ideologies, the further society will stray from basic moral principals. People are trying to raise their kids in this mess. They see marriage of gays as another milestone further away from a healthy society, in which their kids must grow up and live. Ps. You should tell your wife you're gay.

In regards to your childish PS note telling me to tell my wife that I'm gay, I need to ask you this: standing up for the freedoms and equality of everyone makes me gay?  I personally feel that people of all ages, backgrounds, skin tones, sexes, and sexual orientations should have equal rights and treatment, and that somehow makes me gay?  Your statements are only proving you're a close-minded bigot.  Different sexual orientations are nothing new, as homosexuality was around even before the days of Greece.  It's obviously a part of humanity, and just because you disagree with that fact does not make you right above everyone else.

And you're concern is for the children?  You're still a close-minded bigot.  There has never been any evidence suggesting that the degradation of our society is directly linked to homosexuality, single-parent families, etc.  Let's just say that there are case studies that state otherwise.  We can easily argue right back against it.  Was there mass chaos in our society back in WWII, when mothers were forced to raise their children alone because their husband's had died in the war?  Nope, just the same routine problems society faces.  Homosexuality was a closed topic back in the early part of the 20th century, but it was slowly emerging.  Just because it wasn't a frequently as discussed topic today as it was back then, doesn't undermine the fact that there were homosexuals.  So according to your pathetic, childish argument, the frequency of people admitting they're gay is contributing to the downfall of our country?  By that logic, children admitting that they want to be astronauts or firemen would contribute to the fixing of our nation's problems.

And that's why you're clearly wrong.  People admitting who they are isn't doing the damage, as there is no substantial connection.  Instead, maybe we should actually blame the *real* problems?  For example, we have corrupt politicians taking bribes to alter laws.  Our laws, every year, keep compounding on top of one another, making the law difficult and confusing.  That's why our forefathers had the simple style of government: so that things would run and be handled more easily and efficiently.  Also, let's not forget the pressures our schools and system put on our youth, or the fact that our schools only function as well as the amount of funding they get [i.e., poor neighborhoods receive little].  You need to stop blaming homosexuality as some sort of ""megasource"" of problems and face up to the fact that there are other factors at play.

And where in our Constitution does it state we're supposed to stick to these ""basic rules"" and ""idealogies"" you seem to make mention of?  You're definitely wrong, as the Treaty Of Tripoli, specifically Article 11, states that there is a separation of church and state in our government.  So you're wrong, there was no religious foundation from our nation that we're straying away from.  And even more importantly, is that religion does not equate to level of morality.  Child molestation has been documented from the Catholic Church in this nation for well over 100 years.  And that's just one example...

You have no evidence supporting your argument, and there's plenty of evidence and strong argument against it.  Stop criticizing the things you have a prejudice for, and maybe focus more on the *ACTUAL* problems contributing the downfall of our civilizations.  Not everything in the world is the way you perceive it.","1230770202"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","The only one worth a damn (In my humble but informed opinion) is a polarizing filter, for a reason you didn't mention - they eliminate reflections and glare. If you're shooting anything shiny, a polarizing filter is necessary.

A word of warning though to be very careful if using one with a zoom lens. With many of the low end ones, the front end (where the filter is) will twist as you zoom in and out. As polarizing filters are dependent on orientation, it will need to be continually readjusted. If all you're doing is shooting landscapes and want a bright blue sky though, skip the polarizing filter and do it in Photoshop.

In general I say stay away from filters - with the exception of the reflection killing feature noted above, the effects can be duplicated in Photoshop and filters in general can lower the image quality.

The only other one that's conceivably useful is a ND filter, but that's only for the very special case of getting long exposures in broad daylight. ","1230770417"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt; Some tools provide -0 option to end file name with zero byte to workaround space-in-file-name issue.

    find . -type f -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 -i mv {} ~/Documents/.

is the pedagogical example, of what you're talking about. It works this way because xargs splits on whitespace by default.

However, xargs most certainly supports names with spaces - you can use `-d` to specify any delimiter you like, it's only that using spaces by default is convenient.

See, most unix tools don't parse their arguments, but rely on the shell to do it for them. xargs is a rare exception, but it still supports filenames with spaces.

So no, I expressly reject this as evidence that ""many unix tools can't even handle spaces in filenames properly"" as it's clear xargs *can* handle spaces, but by default, for conveniences' sake, it does not.

An example of a unix tool that could not handle spaces in filenames would be something that parses its argument directly, or that reads the files its interested in from a configuration file- and most unix tools have terse inputs, and no configuration files, so I think I'm safe in expecting a tool to be rare.

By the way, most of these cases are usually unnecessary:

    find . -type f -name '*.txt' -exec mv {} ~/Documents/. \;


&gt; Kernel cannot handle #! line if there is a space in the program name. 

That's a strange corner case, but I'll accept it. Are you proposing optimizing for this case? Do you think it satisfies statictype's statement of ""many unix tools""?","1230770500"

"reddit.com","t5_6","In a World that is constantly evolving to a “green consciousness,” and the preservation of our national resources, a company called CardWerkz is endeavoring to do its small part.

It is estimated that over 2 million businesses are started each year, and the one constant that is included in every startup business guide is the need for business cards. Business cards have long since been the long standing staple of conducting a successful business, but the majority of these cards are either lost or discarded.

One solution offered by CardWerkz is instead of business cards, how about business texting. It is estimated that 98% of all Americans above the age of 18 own a cell phone. And, wouldn’t it be nice if a business person could have a conversation that went like this, “Instead of me giving you my business card, how about I give you my business text card number and you can have my business contact information instantly texted to you.”

With the “Go Green” concept being a major part of the everyday business scene the fact that a company is offering a way for businesses to cut their business cost, and not trees makes CardWerkz a company to investigate when an entrepreneur is thinking about starting a new business venture.

For more information on the services offered by this company, visit their website at: http://cardwerkz.com

""The Speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the Vice President and before the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.[1] Unlike the Speaker of the British House of Commons the Speaker of the House does not normally personally preside over debates, instead delegating the duty to other members of Congress of the same political party.

The Israeli declaration of independence ""was followed by an invasion of the new state by troops from Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, starting the 1948 Arab-Israeli War"". The conflict wasn't over. It had been ongoing. No Arab nations ever signed any treaty legitimizing their sovereignty like what was done with America.

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt;Renewable makes more sense and wind cost much less than nuclear per kilowatt.

Only if you compare nameplate power capacity, *maybe*, which is meaningless since wind has a third the capacity factor of nuclear.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Typical_capacity_factors

E.g.:

$4.03B for new 1.0 gigawatt wind farm:

http://uk.reuters.com/article/behindTheScenes/idUKTRE4BI1V120081219

$5.1B for new 1.65 gigawatt nuclear reactor:

http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/17/europe/energy.php

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant

But adjust for capacity factor: the reactor will average some 1.4 GWe, whereas the wind farm will average 0.4 GWe at most. So in this comparison, the wind farm is about three times more expensive in construction cost.

As for amortized lifespan costs, see for yourself:

I did a (very brief) experiment for fun in 95 or 96 where a friend and I were discussing how primitive a bot we could get away with and still get people holding conversations.

The first experiment just repeated a single line over and over. The longest ""conversation"" we recorded was at least 15 minutes of some guy getting more and more agitated because he thought the bot was doing it to annoy him. The bot just passively responded to messages to it - it would not initiate anything.

The second just repeated 3-4 messages in sequence, regardless what the other party said and then started over. Most people who messaged it kept ""talking"" until they had been through a couple of repetitions.

The third attempt used 4 sequences of 3-4 messages. It would pick a sequence at random and then follow the sequence. I think we might have added a handful of ""trigger words"" that would cause it to reset and pick a specific sequence too. That was enough to get a lot of people to hold long conversations, and then get increasingly agitated when they noticed the bot asked the same questions over and over.

I think users might be somewhat more sophisticated now, but not much... Something somewhat dynamic would likely still fool a lot of people for a long time...

And now in sounds like you're talking about the whole scenario.  The highlighted quotes all came from after they decided he was arrested and in cuffs.  That's why I was talking about arrest mode.  Once they've decided you're going to be arrested, there's no point in trying to talk your way out of it or get into a legal debate.  You will be arrested.

How would the following situation go down in Ireland? I'm really interested.  Not trying to argue here.

Someone gets drunk and goes crazy at a pub.  The police get called.  They show up.  He's swinging a pool cue around.  He puts the pool cue down, but won't leave with them.  He's screaming about how he didn't realize that it's a crime to have a few pints.  That the cops are wankers.

Maybe the whole scenario isn't plausible so far.  But if it is...

Do they pass him handcuffs and ask him to put them on and wait it out? Or do they eventually step in and throw him down on the pool table? Say something along the lines of YOU DO NOT CALL THE POLICE WANKERS! with or without the FUCK? Or somewhere in between?

I imagine they're going to have some version of 'arrest mode', although it may not be as aggressive as it is here in the US.","1230771064"

No, he isn't. He's wearing a T-shirt. A perfectly legal T-shirt you can buy in stores.

He'd have been impersonating a police officer if he tried to pass himself off as a police officer through his words and actions, but since the police obviously had no evidence he was doing so -- he ultimately wasn't charged with it -- it's safe to assume he was just a dude wearing a shirt.

Which is legal.

&gt; It is improbable that the wealth created by government spending will fully compensate for the wealth destroyed by the taxes imposed to pay for that spending. It is not a simple question, as so often supposed, of taking something out of the nation’s right-hand pocket to put into its left-hand pocket. The government spenders tell us, for example, that if the national income is $1,500 billion then federal taxes of $360 billion a year would mean that only 24 percent of the national income is being transferred from private purposes to public purposes.[1] This is to talk as if the country were the same sort of unit of pooled resources as a huge corporation, and as if all that were involved were a mere bookkeeping transaction. The government spenders forget that they are taking the money from A in order to pay it to B. Or rather, they know this very well but while they dilate upon all the benefits of the process to B, and all the wonderful things he will have which he would not have had if the money had not been transferred to him, they forget the effects of the transaction on A. B is seen; A is forgotten.

&gt; In our modern world there is never the same percentage of income tax levied on everybody. The great burden of income taxes is imposed on a minor percentage of the nation’s income; and these income taxes have to be supplemented by taxes of other kinds. These taxes inevitably affect the actions and incentives of those from whom they are taken. When a corporation loses a hundred cents of every dollar it loses, and is permitted to keep only fifty-two cents of every dollar it gains, and when it cannot adequately offset its years of losses against its years of gains, its policies are affected. It does not expand its operations, or it expands only those attended with a minimum of risk. People who recognize this situation are deterred from starting new enterprises. Thus old employers do not give more employment, or not as much more as they might have; and others decide not to become employers at all. Improved machinery and better-equipped factories come into existence much more slowly than they otherwise would. The result in the long run is that consumers are prevented from getting better and cheaper products to the extent that they otherwise would, and that real wages are held down, compared with what they might have been.","1230771383"

I'm not sure If I like it postfix like that though.  In your example, it moves the caller away from the called method...I think I like it better flipped around:

And all of this is counter-productive. She can no longer enjoy a fulfilling sexual relationship with anyone (a loss for her), while whoever she ends up marrying *will* still desire this, and if she can't provide it, will end up going somewhere else.

places there do brew their own beer (For Tuber up above) 
Take a look up in wrigleyville, if sportbars are your kind of thing-- avoid places like the cubby bear.  If you like jazz clubs, check out off fullerton (admittedly it has been almost a decade since I lived in this part of town but there were 3-4 blues/jazz clubs in the area that were a blast)
On sunday nights, go to the green mill and listen to poetry. 
In all of my travels, chicago is the only place where it was always easy for me to meet insanely friendly and interesting people everywhere.  Screw your coworkers.  Avoid Wicker Park, hell avoid the loop.  
the L&amp;L on belmonte is an interesting bar.  There are a few other bars on the west side of the El that can provide a good time.   Just avoid anywhere with a line or people grinding on a dance floor and you'll have a blast.  
Also, alternative nighttime activities--  look at improve groups (Second City, Improv Olympics) Steppenwolf theater also does some cheap theater productions (and then there are a number of bars where young patrons go afterwards to drink and socialize)

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; And in every society in history their explicit purpose has been to enforce the property relations attendant to class distinctions.

Actually, no.  Their ostensible purpose is to preserve the peace.  The real purpose, however, is to crush those who oppose the regime, capitalist, dictatorial, feudal, communist, you name it.  Of course, once in a while, police actually solve property crimes, and this is a GOOD thing, but only coincidental.

Anyway, the discussion about police is tangential.  The AGENT of violence is the policeman, and we agree on that.  And the AGENTS behind that violence are the stakeholders in GOVERNMENT.  In a capitalist society, there are unscrupulous businessmen who leverage that violence.  In a communist society, there are unscrupulous comrades who do the same.  In a feudal society, there are unscrupulous lords who do the same.  

But the problem is NOT the economic system, the problem is the common element here: **government**.  Eliminate government, let people organize themselves according to their wish and protectors compete in a market of security, and you've eliminated the oppressors' handiest tool.

Sure, in anarchism, the oppressors may hire one of those security companies, but at least it will COST them.  And you may also defend yourself by hiring defense too.  Try doing that against the government now, you'll be put in rapeland right away.

I'm bothered by your discourse though.  You make capital and private property sound like it's a bad thing, yet your proposed solution calls for EVEN MORE centralization of power and violent intervention, which actually PRESERVES the status quo in terms of capital.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Coal power is the biggest problem facing our planet today. 

It is the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change.


&gt;Our society must begin phasing out coal use until and unless the carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored. 


&gt;Continuing to build coal-fired power plants without carbon capture will lock in future climate disaster


&gt;Coal reserves contain much more carbon than do oil and natural gas reserves, and it is
impractical to capture CO2 emissions from the tailpipes of vehicles. Nor is there any prospect that Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and other major oil-producers will decide to leave their oil in the ground. 

&gt;Thus unavoidable CO2 emissions from oil and gas in the next few decades will take atmospheric CO2 amounts close to, if not beyond, the level needed to cause
dangerous climate change. The only practical way to prevent CO2 levels from going far into the dangerous range, with disastrous effects for humanity and other inhabitants of the planet, is to phase out use of coal except at power plants where the CO2 is captured and sequestered.

&gt;The United States is responsible for more than three times as much of the excess CO2 in the air than any other country. The United States and Europe together are responsible for well over half of the increase from the pre-industrial CO2 amount (280 ppm, ppm = parts per million) to the present-day CO2 amount (about 385 ppm). 



&gt;The United States will continue to be most
responsible for the human-made CO2 increase for the next few decades, even though China’s
ongoing emissions will exceed those of the United States.

It means some homophobes may also exhibit arousal at a higher rate than non-homophobes. This could be due to many different factors, not all of which entail a homosexual tendency in the homophobe.

this does dovetail with the higher than expected tendency for conservative politicians who push anti-gay legislation to be closeted gays, but that's a separate issue. I would posit that has more to do with feelings of shame and guilt fighting with their conservative political beliefs, but again, that's just conjecture.

3) Don't call it a 'study'. It *is* a study. It might be flawed, but call it out on its methodological problems, don't claim it's bad because of the uni it emerged from. The Townhall article you linked to above is about an administrative issue related to a Christian organisation - a completely separate part of the university to whichever school did the research.

It's like saying Steve Jobs is an asshole because the guy who served you at the Apple Store was a prick.

A hunter sees a bear off in the distance, carefully aims and fires. He sees the bear go down and when he gets to the location where he saw it he sees nothing. 

Suddenly there is a tap on his shoulder. He turns and it's the bear. ""Did you just shoot at me?"" says the bear. ""Umm well not really, I was aiming for something else"" says the nervous hunter. The bear tells the hunter, ""suck my dick!"" Not wanting to get shreaded by the bear, he complies. 

The humiliated hunter goes to a gun shop and asks for a 12 guage shot gun and dear slug ammo. He returns to the area of his previous encounter and spots what looks like the same bear. He aims carefully and squeezes off a round. 

It appears that he did the job this time and he confidently strolls over to the location to find that again the bear is not where it should be. The tap on the shoulder happens again and it's the bear. ""You just shot at me again, didn't you?"" ""ummm na na na no"" says the nervous hunter. 

""Yes you did"" says the bear, ""pull your pants down and bend over that log"" says the bear. The man having no other choice complies and recieves his humiliating punishment. The hunter goes to the gun shop again and asks the storekeeper for the biggest baddest gun they have. 

He leaves with a new elephant gun and heads for the location of the previous incidents determined to take care of this bear once and for all. He sees the bear again off in the distance and aims very carefully, holds his breath and squeezes the trigger. Quite sure he made his mark this time, the hunter arrives at the location of his aiming point only to find that the bear is again not where it should have fallen. 

He gets the tap on the shoulder he knows is coming and turns to face his quarry. The bear says, ""you don't come here to hunt do you?""","1230771896"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;Their essential features and not some laundry list of the markets they've destroyed are what matter.

This assumes there is an ""essential"" feature of a state, that one can pare down ""the state"" into easily digestible bits and serialized into formal arguments while still usefully representing reality.  It also assumes that ""the state"" has only one definition that is relevant to our discussion, contrary to seemingly copious evidence to the contrary.  There are many reasons I might disagree with these assertions given the fluid nature of language and the multi-faced nature of state institutions.  An example of the later would be the problems presented to your position by the fact that states do not always have a complete monopoly on the ""legitimate"" use of force, yet are still considered and still claim to be states.  An example of the former would be that 100 years ago nobody would even think to consider themselves both a capitalist and an anarchist, but their use and understanding of common words changed, thus I get to talk to you on the anarchism reddit.

&gt;Try to be an adult

I'll accept your attempts to belligerently condescend to me when you accept that you are a loony asshole.

&gt;A) orient on arguments, rather than people

I consider people and the arguments they give to be part of a whole performance, rather than individual pieces to be sawed off and given out like a child cut in half for two competing mothers.  Still, if you are so strongly attached to the tradition of Plato et al. I would suggest you send a message to this chap:

&gt;Either **you're serious and can do this**, or can at least accept a 'no' from someone who has done this, **or you aren't serious and aren't worth more of my time.**

Turns out the individual giving the argument is important to you, as well.

&gt;don't be surprised when your hostile advances are simply reciprocated.

Of course, it was I and not you who began the hostility.  Your evidence and the relevance of this?  Who knows.  Perhaps you ignore your own behavior by holding tight to a meaningless ""non-initiation of force"" principle.","1230772449"

There are all types of things we are discovering every day.

The most significant thing I have found for the existence of aliens is a gentleman called Alex Collier who claims to be a contactee from the Andromeda galaxy.

Do a google on him and watch his movies.
While i totally disagree with the majority of what he says, i can't get past a few things that are strikingly accurate.

In 1994 he provided a hypothesis that the universe consists of 12 density's. In 2006 String Theory Theorists came to the conclusion that mathematically there are 12 densities.

Can log4j decode Exceptions and extract all their info instead of just the basic message an stack trace?

&gt; One can of course do this with numerous scientific examples, showing, for example, how the issue of sin and judgment is relevant to geology and fossil evidence; how the Fall of man, with the subsequent Curse on creation, makes sense of the evidence of harmful mutations, violence, and death; or how the original “kinds” of animals gave rise to the wide variety of animals we see today.

I think the Pharyngula piece did a good job of tearing the linked article apart.  I just wanted to comment on the use of the terms ""Evolutionist"", and ""Darwinist"".

The terms were almost certainly coined to imply that evolution is just another form of faith.  Thus an ""evolutionist"" is someone who ""believes in evolution.""  I see these terms as intentional, underhanded, jabs.  Rather than harmless reflections of a fundamentally different thought process.

But for the purpose of rational discussion (unless the Creationists are intentionally trying to avoid such) these terms are completely counterproductive.  As soon as they appear, it immediately precludes any chance of a satisfactory conclusion being reached.

On a somewhat amusing side note, you can always spot the Creationists in any forum (even when they are posing as something else) by their use of these terms.","1230772600"

in addition, the israeli people, the jewish national fund, the baron edmond de rothschild and various other organizations have been buying land from arabs is israel since 1920s. nothing was ""stolen"". other lands were conquered during the first wars in israel.


regarding us resolutions - until this day, 10,046 kassam rockets have fallen on israeli territory (empty fields, roads, schools, homes, etc). if the un had condemned the palestinians for every rocket attack, things would look differently. also, until this day, the palestinians have committed 144 terroristic acts (mostly suicide attacks), wounding 8,341 and killing 1,176 people. those terror attacks were *not* condemned.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","I found a very insightful analysis in the NY Times from Dec. 19 that validates what you said in certain respects, libs0n. I'm reposting the article here in its entirety because I really think it explains things as objectively as possible given the emotionally charged nature of the conflict. I hope my fellow redditors will take a moment to read it and better appreciate the grievances of both sides. 

&gt; JERUSALEM — Rockets are flying from Gaza into southern Israeli communities again. Israeli warplanes are firing missiles back, and Israel is closing the crossings through which food and fuel are supplied. The United Nations agency that feeds Palestinian refugees in Gaza says its stocks of flour are exhausted.

&gt; In other words, the six-month truce that Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian leaders of Gaza, agreed to on June 19 is over. On Friday, Hamas officially declared in a statement that the ceasefire had expired, saying the truce would not be renewed because Israel was failing to fulfill its “fundamental conditions and obligations.” The end of the truce was greeted by relative calm, with only a scattering of rocket attacks and no major Israeli military activity. Officials and analysts on both sides say that things are likely to deteriorate further in the short term, but that both sides need the truce, so they will probably grope their way back to it. The question is how soon and after how much suffering.

&gt; Israel and Hamas accuse each other of bad faith and of violations of the Egyptian-mediated accord, and each side has a point. Rockets from Gaza never stopped entirely during the truce, and Israel never allowed a major renewed flow of goods into Gaza, crippling its economy. This is at least partly because the agreement had no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanism; neither side wanted to grant the legitimacy to the other that such a document would imply.

&gt; “I think it is going to get a lot worse before it gets better,” remarked Robert A. Pastor, who has been traveling in the region with former President Jimmy Carter, meeting with Hamas and other officials. “It did lead to a significant reduction in the number of rockets fired at Israel until November, but the truce had less impact on the goods going in. One hopes both sides learn lessons and agree on a text and publicize it.”

&gt; There seems little likelihood of that happening soon. Hamas considers Israel an illegitimate state and is doctrinally committed to its destruction, while Israel views Hamas as a terrorist group that must be dismantled. Yet each needs the other to hold its fire. That is why negotiations over another truce have started, again through Egypt.

&gt; Hamas officials say it was their understanding at the time that two weeks after the June 19 accord took effect Israel would open the crossings and allow the transfer of goods that had been banned or restricted after June 2007, when Hamas waged a violent takeover of Gaza.

&gt; Their job, the Hamas officials said, was to stop the rocket attacks on Israel not only from its own armed groups, but also from others based in Gaza, including Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. 

&gt; It took some days, but they were largely successful. Hamas imposed its will and even imprisoned some of those who were firing rockets. Israeli and United Nations figures show that while more than 300 rockets were fired into Israel in May, 10 to 20 were fired in July, depending on who was counting and whether mortar rounds were included. In August, 10 to 30 were fired, and in September, 5 to 10.

&gt; But the goods shipments, while up some 25 to 30 percent and including a mix of more items, never began to approach what Hamas thought it was going to get: a return to the 500 to 600 truckloads delivered daily before the closing, including appliances, construction materials and other goods essential for life beyond mere survival. Instead, the number of trucks increased to around 90 from around 70.

&gt; Israeli officials acknowledged that transferring previously banned goods had been the plan, but said that there was no specific date for the increase and that it was to happen in steps. But the rockets never fully stopped.

&gt; “The Palestinians wanted to have one or two rockets a week to keep our people in tension and still tell people inside Gaza, ‘See, we continue to fight and we continue to bring in goods,’” said Shlomo Dror, chief spokesman for Israel’s Defense Ministry. “The moment we fail to react to one rocket we encourage them. Our only choice was to close the crossings when rockets came in.”

&gt; In addition, Israeli forces continued to attack Hamas and other militants in the West Bank, prompting Palestinian militants in Gaza to fire rockets. The Israeli military also found several dozen improvised explosive devices used against its vehicles on the Gaza border and about a dozen cases of sniper fire from Gaza directed at its forces.

&gt; While this back-and-forth did not topple the agreement, Israel’s decision in early November to destroy a tunnel Hamas had been digging near the border drove the cycle of violence to a much higher level. Israel says the tunnel could have been dug only for the purpose of trying to seize a soldier, like Cpl. Gilad Shalit, the Israeli held by Hamas for the past two and a half years. Israel’s attack on the tunnel killed six Hamas militants, and each side has stepped up attacks since.

&gt; Israel was actually hoping that the agreement would lead to progress on Corporal Shalit’s release, or at least to increased information on his condition or negotiations over an exchange for him. But Hamas said the Shalit case was entirely separate from the accord, just as Israel had rejected the request by Hamas to have the truce suspend attacks on its men in the West Bank. There, too, Hamas had hopes that the accord would create some changes that did not take place.

&gt; Israel’s focus on Corporal Shalit and Hamas’s focus on the West Bank are examples of why the agreement, without a text or enforcement mechanism, has been so problematic, with each side relying on its own desires rather than on mutually agreed steps. But given each side’s refusal to acknowledge the other’s legitimacy, another such accord of winks and nods seems the likely outcome of any coming negotiations.

Coulter on the other hand is more in line with I would say President Andrew Jackson and the guy most of Reddit used to support before the drank the koolaid, Ron Paul.

""A wise and frugal government, which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor and bread it has earned - this is the sum of good government.""
 
Thomas Jefferson 

Here is a good one given media is the subject.

""Advertisements contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper.""

Thomas Jefferson 

“The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.”


Thomas Jefferson 

 ""A government big enough to supply you with everything you need, is a government big enough to take away everything that you have.""


Thomas Jefferson 

Here is a hell of a list of his quotes you will find they all back up Ron Paul and are pretty much the polar opposite of Obama's view. It is funny how many on Reddit supported Ron Paul and then changed over to everything the man stands against in those for which Obama does stand for.
Fucking Amazing I am Agnostic but used to think anyway, ""How could anybody be fooled by an anti Christ wouldn't they know he was evil and not in their best interest. After this election though as long as he has proper funding and some good catch phrases he is in!

I don't think I was at an advantage, I jsut think I had a bias. I picked up functional lisp easily. It was the first programming language that made sense.

Coal power is the biggest problem facing our planet today. 

It is the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change.


&gt;Our society must begin phasing out coal use until and unless the carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored. 


&gt;Continuing to build coal-fired power plants without carbon capture will lock in future climate disaster


&gt;Coal reserves contain much more carbon than do oil and natural gas reserves, and it is
impractical to capture CO2 emissions from the tailpipes of vehicles. Nor is there any prospect that Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and other major oil-producers will decide to leave their oil in the ground. 

&gt;Thus unavoidable CO2 emissions from oil and gas in the next few decades will take atmospheric CO2 amounts close to, if not beyond, the level needed to cause
dangerous climate change. The only practical way to prevent CO2 levels from going far into the dangerous range, with disastrous effects for humanity and other inhabitants of the planet, is to phase out use of coal except at power plants where the CO2 is captured and sequestered.

&gt;The United States is responsible for more than three times as much of the excess CO2 in the air than any other country. The United States and Europe together are responsible for well over half of the increase from the pre-industrial CO2 amount (280 ppm, ppm = parts per million) to the present-day CO2 amount (about 385 ppm). 



&gt;The United States will continue to be most
responsible for the human-made CO2 increase for the next few decades, even though China’s
ongoing emissions will exceed those of the United States.

So the fact that the majority of police action is undertaken to protect and enforce property relations (as evidenced by the fact that the majority of prisoners are imprisoned for property crimes) is utterly accidental?

&gt;In a capitalist society, there are unscrupulous businessmen who leverage that violence. In a communist society, there are unscrupulous comrades who do the same. In a feudal society, there are unscrupulous lords who do the same.

Agreed, with a caveat that I will address later in this post.

&gt;Sure, in anarchism...

But the wealthy would hire more numerous and better trained security forces right? Sort of like uber-pinkertons.

&gt;I'm bothered by your discourse though...

I guess I should be clearer - I am adamantly opposed to Stalinism. I am a Trotskyite, but as has been said ""we have no new revelation"". I see myself  and my branch of the splintered left, as representing Marx's original ideas.

In the main, the discussion revolves around the role of the unions *vis-a-vis* the government. I believe the government should be a tool solely for coordinating production schedules. Beyond that I think the unions must remain autonomous and democratic with unlimited recall of all representatives at all levels of government.

I would say that the central tenet of Marxism is to bring Democracy to economic decisions, thereby ultimately freeing mankind.

I don't know why so many people have trouble with it, but I'd be curious to know what sort of understanding of the underlying processes they have. By the time I happened across recursion, I'd already learned some assembly and had a good understanding of the mechanics of function calls, so I could easily understand the physical process of recursion. In comparison, if someone thinks of functions as some sort of machine rather than a series of instructions, or doesn't understand how calling and returning from functions actually works, I could see them having trouble understanding recursion.","1230773566"

In sum, it seems like input costs for manufactured goods might be price *affective* but not price *determinative*.

I think a few points are worth mentioning:

*  In your GM example, doesn't it make sense that supply and demand determines price and the entrepreneurs successfully predicted future preferences when they undertook the production process?  Had they incorrectly predicted that people would pay production costs + profit they would have never initially sold any cars or quickly gone out of business.  Such an example seems to show that productions costs would certainly show a strong *correlation* with price but not necessarily mean they *caused* that price.
*  What about when companies produce certain goods at a loss in order to maximize profits with another good?  For instance, if McDonalds produced Big Macs for $1.05 but found that they could get more people into the store if they charged $1.00, they might do this to get people to buy complimentary goods that are more profitable.  For instance, it only costs FF companies about 15-20 cents for drinks but they can charge up to $1.50.  Thus, it makes sense to sell Big Macs for a loss (so long as doing so increases demand) since most everyone buys a drink with them; you've lost 5 cents on the burgers but gain $1.25 or so on the drinks.  Further, ad campaigns suggest this as well; companies will take a loss on a certain item to get people in the store hoping that their subjective valuations change upon seeing better, more expensive items.  Pricing items in such a manner again suggests supply and demand determines price; people value getting a drink with their burger and thus, the companies can price the two together for more than they could individually.  If cost of production played that much of a role in price, it seems like you'd never see a situation in which something was produced at a loss.
*  You're right about the Aristotalian point and I couldn't agree more.
*  I think you could see *intertemporal* production at a loss though probably not for very long.
* Lastly, I have to think about this some more because it's very interesting.  But right now, I'm going to go drink an alarming number of beers since it's the holidays.

Also, I'd love to check out that Mises/Rand article if you find it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I'm not sure what guns have to do with anything.

The absence of guns means that ordinary Gardai don't have deadly force at their fingertips. This makes a huge difference and necessitates an entirely different approach to the whole policing thing, including how Gardai need to work to become authority figures (they can't just rule by fear), how they arrest people (not just with brute force), and how they generally conduct themselves (attempt to de-escalate as opposed to escalate, authoritative rather than authoritarian). I'm not trying to view the Gardai through rose-tinted glasses, but they're better than what you describe.

The first time ever I've witnessed an arrest in Ireland was the apprehension of a drunk and disorderly person on a bus. This was an at least middle-aged gentleman, probably even over 45. I don't remember him getting on, but I remember his behaviour deteriorating sharply. IIRC he drank on the bus, which the driver saw and told him to refrain from, he then started forming little projectiles from spittle and paper flicking them at a young woman, and started talking to himself, drinking again, all of which again got the driver's attention, who eventually realized that the gentleman was not going to stop, and thus at the next stop asked the man to get off, which the latter refused. So he called the cops. The Gardai did not barge in in high-adrenaline fashion with sirens blaring. It was just that a handful of officers showed up and calmly boarded the bus, and just walked over so the man could see all of them, but they didn't block or grab, they just stood back there for a minute or so and then calmly asked the gentleman if he didn't want to come with him; they'd eventually get him some place where he could get medical help as well. Well, what do you know, within a minute the man had calmly walked off with the Gardai and the bus continued on its journey. 

Later arrests I've personally witnessed (and could tell you about if requested) were a bit more spectacular, but none of these involved deliberate escalation or threats from the side of the Gardai. I have however witnessed Gardai face an animated and impolite verbal charge, and remain calm and collected and just generally wait it out and remain calm and collected and objective and polite in their replies. Again, I'm not trying to put An Garda Siochana on some pedestal, but those were my personal firsthand observations.","1230773623"

Even if Obama makes it a public works priority like he says he will, it'll likely still be another 5 years before 80% of US homes have access to cheap 150mbps fiber optic broadband. And that's being optimistic.

So yeah, private industry likely could have sorted it out eventually. I'm not arguing they can't do *something* in the long run. But in the long run, we're all dead. A 10-15 year lag behind other major nations is a serious embarrassment.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Ok, so for some reason our conversation yesterday brought some doubt in my mind.  I went to go talk to my father about this and he says I'm absolutely right except for one thing:

If I pay you for something in gold, what is subject to capital gains tax is the difference in the dollar price of gold from the time I acquired it to the time we exchanged, not the full value of the gold.  So if the dollar lost 10% of its value and went from $1000 an ounce to $1100, I would have to pay $15 in tax per ounce of gold that I traded with you.

This may seem trivial, but since you are being taxed on the dollar's decreasing value primarily (gold has a relatively constant value), which by the way is the same thing they do for your house so if your house is worth $1M more because of the dollar's depreciation, you owe the government $150K, and also because currencies change hands many many times a year, the capital gains tax makes it impossible for gold or any other asset to compete as a currency against the dollar.

I'm convinced I'm right about this and I've given you the best explanation I can, so unless you've got a clarification question I'd like to leave this here.

Oh, and he also says that the settling of debts refers to both short term and long term debts.  So that means that yes, it refers to what we would classically call a debt like a mortgage, but it also includes simple purchases.  In the eyes of the law, you are paying a debt when you purchase something from a store, etc.  I'm not referencing this for you, take it or leave it.

One part of the process is determining what the true root is.  It is possible that the alcohol and pron are just continuing manifestations, but the real issue is deeper - such as self-esteem, abuse or some traumatic event.  
One part is accepting where you are at.  Guilt is a rubber band.  It can push you back to where you were.  As you learn to face yourself without judgment everything starts to open up.
Forgive yourself if you slip.  For some it is part of the process.

Even when you do these things you still have to address the acts themselves.  Stalk yourself-meaning get to know your own habits.  Your bad habits need all their parts to function.  If you pass by a liquor store every day to get your alcohol, stop going that way.  Stop carrying money,  stop hanging with friends in liquor-fueled situations.  Get a porn blocker if need be.

Conversely start better habits.  Something physical, something mental, and something for your spirit (spiritual-but not necessarily religous)

Ask friends for help.  True friends love to help.  

Keep seeing yourself after you pass the obstacle, not trying to overcome it.  Focus on the success, not the struggle.

Most of all find your center.  It is where your will comes from.  Cultivate will and this all comes a little easier.

Good luck to you.  I wish I had more than words to offer you.

one more thing: going cold turkey on alcohol can be too stressful to your system if you are very dependent on it.  You may have to slowly withdrawl

&gt;Cars. Let’s keep those cars on the road - because the weight of vehicles driving over metal plates could be used to generate electricity. 

Merely an indirection of whatever is powering the cars in the first place.

&gt;Food. It’s no small potatoes in terms of energy. With a couple of electrodes and a little high school physics, you can generate a current. It’s pitifully small, but it’s there. Are food batteries round the corner? 

The energy input of a potato batteries is not the electrolyte (the potato), but the electrodes which undergo redox chemistry (the copper wire &amp; zinc nail) - that's the ""fuel"". The electrolyte solution is only a transport medium for the ions to travel through. The original energy source is whatever is used to reduce metallic copper/zinc (or whatever cathode/anode you use) from their natural oxidation states in ores.

Again, this is just an indirect use of some other energy source, whatever the copper refinery is running off of.

&gt;Gray Water. Flush a toilet, run a faucet…turn a turbine and charge a battery. Hydroelectricity in the home.

A pitcher could have a nice BAA, and give up homers with men on base or walk more guys, and vice versa. It all shows up in the ERA though.

At any rate, under normal circumstances, I could see Mussina and Burnett matchup up as comparable pitchers, but there are far too many other factors going into it that suggests that Burnett won't put up Mussina-like numbers next season. He's a classic ""walk-year"" pitcher and as I listed before, Mussina has been the only big-name pitcher that was unaffected after he became a Yankee.

I think if CC and Burnett can stay on their career course, sure, the Yankees will have a much improved rotation. But history tells us that that it's very improbable that that's going to happen.","1230774036"

That is one way to characterize states.  It is not the only way, nor is it even the most widespread characterization.  It certainly does not justify your essentialist position on the matter.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; So the fact that the majority of police action is undertaken to protect and enforce property relations (as evidenced by the fact that the majority of prisoners are imprisoned for property crimes) is utterly accidental?

*No, man*.  Twelve million inmates for property crimes (I looked it up!) is *PEANUTS* compared to a *hundred and fifty million* taxpayers.  The taxman is only the taxman because *it has the guns*.  Protection of private property and prevention of violent crime (neither of which are strong suits of the police) are merely justifications.

&gt; But the wealthy would hire more numerous and better trained security forces right? Sort of like uber-pinkertons.

Of course, that is very likely.  But the converse is true: they would have to devote proportionally much more of their resources to get protection.  Which is exactly the opposite of what happens now -- overwhelmingly the rich pay very little taxes (""good"" accountants, you know) and get much more attention from law enforcement.

&gt; I am a Trotskyite, but as has been said ""we have no new revelation"". I see myself and my branch of the splintered left, as representing Marx's original ideas.

Oh.  So you're actually IN FAVOR of more government violence.  That about clears it up for me!

&gt; I believe the government should be a tool solely for coordinating production schedules.

Hold on there, you're denying two hundred years of economics.  Now, I have my reservations about economics, but how does the government know how much to produce of everything *in the absence of prices*?  More importantly, what happens if the government says I have to make 20000 pairs of shoes but I want to make 40000?  Am I going to be put in jail for that?  Most importantly of all, *from whom does this government you talk about derive the authority to tell me what to do?*

Let me repeat the question, because it's very important: *From whom does this government you talk about derive the authority to cause me physical pain?*  Initiating violence against me (or against you) is completely against the non-aggression principle, which is a valid moral theory.  Taking my stuff without my permission is also immoral.  So how do you plan to make your system work without the initiation of violence?  If you can't, then it's obvious that your system is impracticably immoral, so why do you defend it?

&gt; I would say that the central tenet of Marxism is to bring Democracy to economic decisions, thereby ultimately freeing mankind.

We already visited the fact that Democracy is a sham, and it's also worthwhile to mention, now that we're at this topic, that a country's economy is simply too complex for someone -- regardless of how arrogant he is -- to determine by democratic decision.

    The Oslo Accords, officially called the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements or Declaration of Principles (DOP) was a milestone in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was the first direct, face-to-face agreement between Israel and political representatives of Palestinians. It was the first time that some Palestinian factions publicly acknowledged Israel's right to exist. It was intended to be a framework for the future relations between Israel and the anticipated Palestinian state, when all outstanding final status issues between the two states would be addressed and resolved in one agreement.

    The Accords were finalized in Oslo, Norway on 20 August 1993, and subsequently officially signed at a public ceremony in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993, with Yasser Arafat signing for the Palestine Liberation Organization and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signing for the State of Israel. It was witnessed by Warren Christopher for the United States and Andrei Kozyrev for Russia, in the presence of US President Bill Clinton.

    The Oslo Accords were a framework for the future relations between the two parties. The Accords provided for the creation of a Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority would have responsibility for the administration of the territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the Israel Defence Forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

    It was anticipated that this arrangement would last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no later than May 1996). Permanent issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders were deliberately left to be decided at a later stage. Interim self-government was to be granted by Israel in phases.

    Support for the Accords, of the concessions made and the process were not free from criticism. The repeated public posturing of all sides has discredited the process, not to mention putting into question the possibility of achieving peace, at least in the short-term. The momentum towards peaceful relations between Israel and the Palestinians as demonstrated by the signing of the Oslo Accords has been seriously jolted by the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000.

    Further strain was put on the process after Hamas won 2006 Palestinian elections. Although offering Israel a number of longterm ceasefires and accepting the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, Hamas has repeatedly refused to officially recognise Israel,[1] to renounce violent resistance, or accept some agreements previously made by the Palestinian Authority, claiming it is being held to an unfair standard and points out the fact that Israel has not recognized a Palestinian state, renounced violence or lived up to all pledges it has made during previous negotiations. Hamas has always renounced the Oslo Accords.

Microsoft is so much bigger than Apple, obviously it will have more setbacks. That's what happens when you try to do a million things at once, some of them fail and some of them succeed. That is the nature of business.

Your assertion that *""MS can't execute""* is 100% ignorant. Microsoft has produced some of the most amazing work, but maybe you don't notice because much of it is geared towards **businesses, developers, and gamers** - demographics which Apple chooses to ignore.

While Microsoft is busy *driving* the software industry, Apple simply polishes and refines software *for their own hardware*.

Think for a moment about who makes the developer tools, languages like c#, APIs like DirectX, Point-of-sale machines, databases, office tools, internet software, cloud computing technology, email, messaging, multi-purposes operating system**s**, online advertising, game consoles, *games*... the list goes on.

**Microsoft is so big you don't even have a fucking clue about all the things it succeeds in and how many amazingly helpful things they do**.

Apple has an imac, ipod, itunes, and iphone. That's it. They also have clever and trendy marketing.

Their products are very attractive to a lot of people, but they are also completely closed platforms with limited potential and limited appeal to those with diverse needs.

What better way to ensure a mass market for your product than to combine it with an occasion of celebration? The tradition was started by a corporation in the early 20th century as a marketing strategy, and is now so ingrained in public minds that it's now considered the norm.

None of us (especially those of us who have purchased diamonds) like to admit that we've all been part of this marketing ploy, but to suggest that diamonds are the symbol most apt for engagements/weddings is a bit unrealistic. 

Personally, I blame Shakespeare for writing in the concept of trading materialism as a romantic promise in the Merchant of Venice (one of the earliest mentions of a ring given as a promise of marriage). The irony, of course, is that it's suggested that Shakespeare was poking fun at the rich for attaching the concept of loyalty and eternity to a highly materialistic object, and we've since lost sight of the irony to take it as fact.

All things they can get much more cheaply from elsewhere, and not have to offend the most powerful military force in the world. The manufacturing base is still there. The ability to get loans is still there, and will continue to be unless and until the global economy collapsed. There are dozens of methods by which the states could be brought back into line without fighting; buy foodstuffs from third-world farmers who can't compete now but who could produce much more if they didn't have to compete with US farm tariffs, then use bombs to starve the states into submission, a la Sherman, for example. Food isn't as rare as you seem to think it is; it only seems so because we've set up our economy to make life easier for a bunch of corporate farmers.

Actually, no they weren't. There's absolutely no way that the British would have cared enough to carry out a blockade against the US. Not with their colony in India coming online.

An expensive blockade would never have had the support needed in Parliament, not with the anti-slavery sentiment (the British Navy did most of the work of ending the slave trade after slavery was outlawed), the pro-union sentiment of the merchant class, who had most of the power and who were strongly connected to the North, and the desires of the British East India Company to avoid having to continue to compete with plantation owners. The will wasn't even really there to take on the US blockade even before September; if it had been there would have been more support while the South was piling up victory after victory. 

You also need to check the aftermath of the Civil War if you think it ended with the assimilation of Confederate leaders. For twelve years after the war was over, the Northern Army carried out a largely peaceful occupation of the Southern states. They were well on their way to being integrated when political disagreements that had nothing to do with the war forced the Republican party to make a deal in order to retain the Presidency, the largest point of which was the withdrawal of troops from the south, which led to the segregation laws and reinstatement of Confederate laws, along with the growth of that ""lost cause"" bullshit that we only managed to excise a few decades ago. :S They were defeated in the same manner by which we defeated the Germans after WWII. We just didn't carry it all the way out.

Turtledove is a good storyteller, but his works on the Civil War aren't as compelling as they seem to be on their face. The situation he describes could indeed have ended with his predicted victory for the Confederacy, but only if things had gone absolutely along the lines that he put forward. But since the South was at such a disadvantage, geopolitically, economically, and even socially, they would have needed things to go absolutely perfectly in order to have a chance. It was a little like someone giving you a pair of dice and telling you to hit seven 200 times in a row to win; sure it's possible, but it only takes one screw-up to lose. As was shown in September.","1230774606"

"religion","t5_2qh39","&gt;In the context I provided, it is a concession that our knowledge of nature is incomplete. 

Completely agree, witness our very very limited perceptive power of our five senses, for example.

&gt;What may seem ""beyond nature"" to some now may be understood as natural in the future. 

Very true, what God may seem to be ""beyond reason"" to atheists now may be understood as natural and reasonable in the future.

&gt;This is in contrast to claiming that something is absolutely supernatural, as many do with their concepts of god.

Agree as well, what may seem ""absolutely supernatural"" now actually could be understood as part of nature, and NOTHING supernatural or defying physics at all... An analogy, I have saved an insect like moth who was trapped in a heated light source. To the moth's mind (if there is one), I might appear to him like a God who possess supernatural power, my power is 'supernatural' only in relative to his own limited world view and perceptive ability. But in fact, this is nothing more than the law of nature, this is a limitation of the moth's mind and perception that led him to believe this is something supernatural (or that I am God)... In the same way, I believe that what many people believe to be supernatural power is in fact very natural, even for the 'God'...

"math","t5_2qh0n","Well, they're defined in terms of collections of some sort, but different treatments use different sorts of collections.

My typical approach when being formal is to take the objects and arrows to be classes (that is, predicates on sets) initially, and when the class of arrows between any two objects is a set, the category is locally small, and if the class of objects is as well, the category is a small category.

This doesn't quite work out perfectly, as you still don't get a category of all categories (but you do get a category of all small categories). That can be fixed, but it takes a bit of additional formalism.

You still get, for instance, a category of all (set) monoids in this way. It doesn't include the proper class of all monoids however.

As for defining a category completely independently of sets, I'm sure it's doable, and I know that some people like it as an approach to formalising mathematics, but an axiomatic description which actually works properly is likely to be at least as complex as a set theory.","1230775232"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There's actually a company that make cultured diamonds that are so close to mined diamonds that they had to do something so that professionals could tell the difference. Cultured diamonds are now lasered with a microscopic serial number and this mark is used to give two otherwise identical diamonds different prices.

If you can't convince a girl that one of these diamonds is a blood diamond then it's your own fault. You just need to practice keeping a straight face while lying. There's nothing wrong with the diamond.

Usually I just give a girl a diamond without saying where it came from. If they ask, I always tell the full truth. If she doesn't want a diamond because it wasn't mined then there's probably a lot of other things about her I won't like.

Oh and here's a quote from a random website in case you think I'm making this up:

&gt; In order to avoid confusion and increase legitimacy, the companies producing the cultured diamonds are taking measures to mark their diamonds. For example, they might laser inscribe them or add trace impurities. Otherwise, diamond buyers would not be able to tell if the diamond they are buying originated from a natural mine or from a machine. A natural diamond might command a premium due to its ostensible rarity and the expense of mining it. An unscrupulous seller might pass off a far less expensive cultured diamond as a real diamond. Whatever risk the buyers perceived would directly translate into lower prices for real diamonds. Some buyers may not even care about the origin.

I'm not saying America is secular. It is plagued by religion; but from design and implementation perspective it is certainly nowhere near Israel in terms of being a religious state. Israeli government spends a large chunk of its budget on sponsoring lives and studies of thousands of religious students who do not in any way contribute to society other than, well, spiritually. In fact, Israel does it so much that even Scientology managed to get a cut.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","sorry, but this is a fool's errand.  Atheists need to start focusing on stuff that matters, not these ritualistic nitpicks.

I agree that in a perfect world, we wouldn't have Presidents swearing in on a Bible, In God We Trust etc., but that won't happen as long as 80% of the voting public identifies itself as Christian.  Add to that the fact that a good proportion of them are fundamentalist; they care the most, and no one is willing to anger them.  The non-evangelistic Christians might sort of weakly agree that it's a bit unfair to atheists and others, but they're not going to make a big case of it for fear of being called anti-God.

What atheism needs to do is to make its case that you can have a moral, orderly society, with a sense of ethics and responsibility, without resorting to ancient myths.  Many, I think most, religious folks believe that without God, you would have chaos and anarchy.  That is the meme that keeps even relatively rational people tied to the mast of religion.  Break that down, and you start to break the hold religion has on their minds.

BOOTS!

Know the schedule of the trash pickup.. an emptier dumpster is easier to sort through then a full one.  
Start in one corner and dig down, then move in a circle moving stuff onto the previous area, so you dont have to throw stuff out.  

Since you'll be in the dumpster for this, a team of 3 is best, one to search and pass the food to the 2nd person, and they pass it to a runner who carries it to the vehicle.  

Of course bleach wash unopened packages, and discard opend ones.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I have always been a geek. Ever since I remember I have just felt comfortable around a computer, and playing SPEED RACER on Windows95 is one of my fondest memories of childhood. 

I'm a teenager now, and I'm lucky enough to go to a highschool where everybody minds their own business and the content of your character is the deciding factor in how many friends you have. I like to think of myself as a nice guy, and yet I really have to try and keep myself from being an asshole. This asshole-ness of mine doesn't really seem to be me. I like to be nice, and I hate being a jerk, but it just comes out too easily sometimes. Furthermore I have this feeling about myself that I am totally superior to all of my peers. I can not find one person that is better or equal to me, which bothers me because even with my closest friends I don't feel ""at home"". Additionally this also happens with any girls I meet. I have no problem meeting girls and being social around them, but I haven't found any that I felt I could really click with. That is until a couple of months ago I found a very pretty and smart girl who I connected with instantly. We had long talks over MSN and we texted a lot. We also hung out together a few times and it went really well every time, she even gave me a really tight hug once (sounds like nothing but it was really connecting). So then I told her how I felt and she didn't really say anything. I think she is more confused than anything, however I may also be wrong about that. The communication between us hasn't stopped one bit, however she does ask me now and then about the status of my feelings, to which she is fairly supportive of, and she hasn't said ""no"". I do realize she probable just wants to stay friends and nothing more, which is part of the reason I'm depressed.

Furthermore, I have no clue as to what I want to do with my future. At first I wanted to do something in the business field because of the promises of a good $100 000 salary, but after finding a part time job and getting some cash to buy a few video games, I realize that I don't care much for material objects. I also thought of how completely stupid the idea sitting in an office doing mindless work or even ordering around zombies if I ever obtain a position of power sounds. I don't really know what I want to do with my life anymore. I'm getting pretty interested in science now that I have an awesome science teacher who has really peaked my interest in Nuclear Fusion and physics. I don't know how get started or where to begin or what to study.

So basically I'm confused as to where my future lies and I really don't want to become a mindless zomebie. I also am worried that girls will always just be ""friends"" with me and nothing more. Ahh, typing this out put it all in perspective for me. Any advice will be greatly appreciated though.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","My lawyer girlfriend says I'm a good fake lawyer. 

In this particular case, they may be charging with murder because ""the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart"" (Idaho Statutes 18-4002). In actual English, that formula means that someone acts with extreme indifference to human life. To prove him guilty, they must show that the accused or a reasonable person would know the kids were at great risk of death and that he just sent them off anyway. I have to imagine only a jury could decide that question. 

One question I had was whether neglect is ""active"" enough to count as causing death for purposes of murder. Apparently it is for children, because parents have a legal duty of care. An example murder conviction on this basis was for the [death of Brandy Simpkins](http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/113601795.html?dids=113601795:113601795&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+29%2C+1990&amp;author=M.+Dion+Thompson&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Parents+get+prison+for+letting+child+die+of+hunger%2C+thirst&amp;pqatl=google), who died after her parents left her alone without food or water for 5 days.

Another possibility is that the charge is under the ""felony murder rule"", under which any death caused by the commission of a felony is murder. That rule isn't listed specifically in the Idaho statutes, but I think committing a felony is considered ""implied malice""/""depraved heart"" in the old-school formulation. In this case, the felony is Idaho Statutes 18-1501, where anyone ""under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, ... willfully
causes or permits the person or health of such child to be injured"" is guilty of injury to a child and can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.","1230776101"

The Speaker determines who in her party sits on committees and chairs them, generally following seniority among the members.  The committee chairs deal with the debates on the floor.  

The speaker has procedural duties have to do with gaveling sessions in and out, deciding what comes to the floor from various committees.  

She (and all her predecessors) appoint committee chairmen (always from the party that holds a majority), besides respecting seniority, based on who supported her in her rise within the party committee system, and supports those who help keep her and her party in power.  

Very altruistic, the good of the country, forward looking.

Exactly. It's the biggest software company in the *entire world*, and they let such a common test go past them? Elementary testing involves testing extremities/border conditions and middle-range data. Once that passes you test arbitrary data. This is indeed a massive blunder on Microsoft's part to fail to test the border condition of Dec 31 on a leap year, let alone other dates which might have special bit patterns in their internal representation. Reminds me of that [MS Excel bug](http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2007/09/25/calculation-issue-update.aspx) not too long ago which also revolved around the FP representation of an extremely common border value (65536).

I have moderate gynecomastia, and I've had it since I was an adolescent. 

Most guys get them by having an excess of testosterone, which metabolizes to estrogen. If you can't excrete the estrogen fast enough, it accumulates.

Smoking pot doesn't help, and I smoked a LOT of pot(though I started smoking after I already had them) as a teenager.

One in three guys will get them as a teenager, and most guys will see them diminish to something that would more appropriately be called ""outie nipples"".

Of those guys for whom they remain after adolescence, they will vary in size from ""outie nipple"" to ""man boob"".

**The only way to get rid of them, if they remain after adolescence, is surgery.**

I've heard that some guys who use steroids get them, but I don't know, since I've never done them. But, I believe it, because acne and man-boobs go hand-in-hand, and both are side effects of steroids, and steroids are androgens, and I know that I was insanely horny as an adolescent, well beyond what is normal, which is also a side-effect of androgens.

Anyway, surgery is the only thing that will get rid of them in an adult male, so don't give any traffic to some asshole blogger with nothing, or worse: lies to say about a situation that can be very uncomfortable and embarrassing. 

If you have gynecomastia, see a plastic surgeon, they can get rid of it for under two grand. I looked into it when I was 30ish. I decided not to bother. I am 45. But, like I said, I have it moderately, like you can't even tell it when I am cold.","1230776557"

One time in Eastern Washington in a supermarket I mentioned that I was a Jew and an old lady started yelling at me calling me ""a spawn of Satan"". The rest of the place started giving me dirty looks and I left as quickly as possible.

Another time in Eastern Washington one of my friends parents started yelling at me telling me I was going to hell when I mentioned that I played ad&amp;d. I was 10 or 11 at the time. Amazingly they still let me hang around their kid as long as we didn't do any ""witchcraft"".

In Western Washington (normally not a ""red"" part of the country at all"") my parent's car had it's darwin fish ripped off in a church parking lot and whomever did it left a note on the windshield mentioning that jesus will save our souls if we believe, otherwise we'll burn in hell.

Another time I was walking down the street in Seattle Washington and had to get past a group of protesters with signs that said, among other things, ""Jesus Saves"" (they were counter protesting an anti-prop 8 march). They tried very hard to ask me if I was a Christian.","1230776742"

That is, eighty or so were innocent bystanders. A small price to pay for a chance to a decent life, a couple of Tel Aviv suicide bombing's worth.

Edit: I realise this is cynical and maybe even dishonest. The death toll will rise, perhaps even significantly when the ground invasion begins. If Hamas has a shed of empathy for their citizens, it would be wise of them to find a loophole and weasel their way out of their ideology. It's sad that we had to bully them to do this.

&gt; In other words: Don't make waves, if someone in a position of authority wants to do something, let it happen without so much as complaining.

First of all, yes, that's how things work on the international level. No one has ever demanded to return the land they lost in a war of agression fueled by racism. That would be like Germany demanding reparations from Russia. Losers get to suffer from their defeat, but even then, without Hamas, without radical islamism, without Iranian backbone, but most importantly with awe of the arab world if this operation succeeds and Hamas militancy is toppled, ""palestinian"" arabs have a real good prospect of getting their own, free state. Do not dismiss this lightly: jewish people had their greatest moment of euphoria when Israel was recognized by the world, the extent of which is impossible to describe in words. We are not stupid and we're not evil and collectively we know we can not take away such a moment from arabs too, no matter how religious kooks try to capsize it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The mandate from the FCC that ""equal time for opposing viewpoints"" be presented made the networks tow a more moderate position and carefully delineate editorial and news reporting.

According to the WP:Fairness Doctrine article:

&gt;It should not be confused, but often is, with the Equal Time rule. The Fairness Doctrine deals with matters of public importance, and has no specific equal-time requirement; the Equal Time rule only deals with political candidates.

[end]

&gt;This is the reason why the conservatives are so dead set against the Fairness Doctrine -- since they're in bed with the big corporations, it's good business for the conservative, big-business agenda to be steamrolled in the media.

I'd say that most TV stations I see have a liberal bent, and most talk radio a conservative bent.  I don't really have a problem with that much, though -- if someone wants slanted media, they're going to get it.

There's a definite line between the government deciding what's good for people to watch and mandating it and the government preventing lock-out of particular views.

As I understand it, the SCOTUS basis for allowing the Fairness Doctrine was *specifically* in areas where stations were limited, it was possible for someone who owned all stations to lock out particular viewpoints.  It wasn't that people weren't watching what was best for them, and that that situation needed to be corrected.

IMHO, today, the Internet, increased population funding many, many channels, and the relative cheapness of various forms of media pretty much cover the problems that the FD was introduced to handle.","1230777218"

Secondly, you equate Native American with the Arabs and the Israelis with European settlers. That is all ass-backwards because there were *no* Muslims before their prophet  was born (ca 570 AD), while Jews had lived in the area which is now Israel for over 4000 years. The Muslims came second so it would be more correct to call them the invaders.

Finally, you make the mistake of thinking the Palestinans and the Jews are separate races or people. They are in fact all Semites:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semite#Ancient_Semitic_peoples

and the ancestors of the vast majority of the Palestinians would have been either Jewish or Christain before the birth  of Islam.

If Obama chooses to express that statement by swearing his oath in a way that is meaningful to him, demonstrates HIS resolve -- isn't that really the point?  Isn't that what freedom is about -- political, religious, and intellectual freedom?  

No one is requiring you to do the swearing of the oath of office -- although it would be nice if you did in whatever way is meaningful to you -- we kind of need people to recommit themselves to representative democracy right about now.

It seems like it's akin to so many other issues.  Against abortion?  Don't have one!  Against swearing on a bible (or religious document of your choice)? Swear on a platypus! I don't care!!!  What matters is that your word means something, that you stand for something, that you have some shred of conscience.

It seems to me that everyone is out to win the argument, to argue it until everyone gives into whatever point of view you hold.  Isn't being American more about having the right to have an opinion and ALLOWING others to have their own?

I don't see how religious demonstrations that are meaningful to President Obama are injuring you, or causing you harm.  If the religious demonstration of taking the oath of office in this form bothers you -- DON'T WATCH THE INAUGURATION, DON'T GO TO THE INAUGURATION.  

I mean, am I missing something here?  If I am (beyond the hissy fit of separation of church and state -- I mean our money says In God We Trust!!) please explain what intricate part of the problem I'm overlooking.

I guess the long and the short of it is this for me:  Inauguration Day -- it's not all about you.  It's not all about me either.  It's about our President SWEARING his/her oath to lead us as best she or he can, and that oath is taken in a way that carries meaning to him or her.

If you get everything online or from DVD, though, you may be better off with something like [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) (which runs on more platforms but IMO is not quite as stable, nor does it have DVR functionality).","1230777331"

Yeah, A big garden for the kitchen, raise your own chickens for meat and eggs, goats and maybe a few dairy cows. No sense raising cattle for beef down there, as beef is really cheap and high-quality.

Mendoza, Argentina has developed a good reputation for growing certain grapes. Chile, also. And, even more recently, Uruguay. 

So, you go down there with an modest investment, you set up a situation for yourself, you hire one or two good guys .. and life could be pretty-kinda okay, at least maybe not-so-bad. And it's self-sustaining, if you set it up properly.

EDIT: but wait a minute! Who says you're invited, once I get my little chunk of paradise for myself?!?!?!? You'd better be pretty cool, if you want to hang out. Play an instrument or be good in the kitchen.

EDIT II: I'm not the only guy thinking about this. In fact, there are some areas around Mendoza that have gotten over-commercialized, similar to ""golf communities"" in the USA. You buy a patio home by a communal vineyard, and you get the right to go in while they actually make the wine, and each homeowner gets a few cases of the finished product. Not for me! I want 40-100 acres of the real thing. I will be happy to make a modest living, producing a genuine, well-crafted product.


Did I mention that, after grapes for wine, *olives* are the number two product of that region in Argentina? I think of it as a way to live like I was in Spain or Italy, but for 1/4 the cost to buy in. That's what I'm dreaming of.","1230777369"

"math","t5_2qh0n","There are 5 different permutations which are applied for each letter:

* The plugboard (or Steckerbrett)
* The right rotor
* The middle rotor
* The left rotor
* The reflector

The first permutation is the plugboard is similar to an old fashioned operator switchboard where the machine operator can plug cables that connect one letter to another.  The configuration of the plugboard is part of the key.  This component is in the bottom right of the flash simulator.

For example, you could connect a cable between C and H which would mean that C maps to H and H maps to C.  Notice that this permutation is self inverting.

The next 3 permutations are the rotors.  There are three of them and the output from each one is the input to the next one.  The alignment of the rotors changes with each letter and this change is analogous to how an odometer works:  The right rotor advances for every letter, the middle rotor advances for every 26 letters and the left rotor advances for every 26 * 26 letters.

Each rotor is hardwired with a specific permutation.  The electrical design of the machine requires that no letter can map to itself so strictly speaking these are *derangements* not permutations.

The three rotors are at the top of the simulator.

After the three rotors, the next step is the reflector.  Like the plugboard, the reflector must be a permutation which is it's own inverse.  This means that if A maps to B then B must map to A.  The reflector is the disk in the bottom left of the simulator.

After entering the reflector, the rotors are traversed again in reverse order.  The effect of this is to apply the inverse of each rotor permutation.  

So suppose we assign the following notation to each permutation:

* **S** Plugboard
* **T** Reflector
* **R1** Left Rotor
* **R2** Middle Rotor
* **R3** Right Rotor
* **R1' R2' R3'** Inverse permutations of the three rotors.

The complete permutation for a single letter is the product of all of the following permutations:

**S R3' R2' R1' T R1 R2 R3 S**

and you apply them from right to left.

I adhere to Buddhist ethics, which are are predicated on Buddhist philosophy.  Buddhist ethics are very rigorous and logically consistent.  Even before I was a Buddhist I adhered to the model of virtue ethics, so Buddhist ethics really clicked for me.  But the definitions and axioms that are the basis of Buddhist thought that are not going to be immediately acceptable to a person educated into the typical worldview of contemporary western thought - outside the question of their truth, they are simply outside of the typical way of thinking.  For example, the principle of anatman, ""no self,"" is something you can argue about philosophically, but it's not something that can be proven through an empirical scientific experiment.

I don't remember people swooning over Pelosi, I remember people thinking she'd be effective.  I don't remember people liking her, I remember people thinking she'd be powerful (which she has proven to be), drawing power away from the President (which he's dissipated as though on an endless drinking bender).  

Her majority will be stronger, for which she bears some responsibility, and her agenda will be more closely matched by the incoming president.  

Certainly she's been complicit in the disasters of the Bush administration, but if she's been consolidating power for more than the exercise of consolidating power, this is her time.  

I don't think she misjudged how much America wanted Pelosi to stand up to Bush the way Gingrich misjudged how much America wanted Gingrich to stand up to Clinton.  I think, frankly, if she looked like she was undermining the President, instead of letting him hang himself, she'd have been pilloried even more than she has been.  The low ratings of Congress certainly have to do with the fact that she didn't stand up to Bush more forcefully, but having her be the face of tearing him down, instead of his own, I think was probably right.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","The ceasefire was shakey at best, when all things are considered you couldn't really hold it against either side for a few isolated shots being fired. There were still instances of the IDF firing across the border (two farmers were injured once) and various people in Hamas would 'retaliate'  but overall there was no sustained effort by either side.

What can't be forgiven however is the IDF breaking the ceasefire on November 4th, moving into the Gaza strip, this act of provocation got Hamas to fire rockets into Israel. So Israel used those attacks to justify an illegal (text-book definition of a war crime) blockade on the Gaza strip and justify the military operation which has thusfar killed over 300 innocent men women and children. I know people justify the IDFs little incursion during the ceasefire because apparently Hamas was building a tunnel. Two issues with this: Building a tunnel does not break a ceasefire, the other is to this day there is ZERO proof that there ever was a tunnel. We just have to take the word of the IDF and they have every reason to cover up the fact they broke the ceasefire agreement.

I'm not saying Hamas would have acted differently had it been in the dominant position, but the IDF has been the prime provocateur here.","1230777657"

However I always found it not entirely stable, and there where bits about the window manager I didn't like as much as I liked (important productivity) bits of KWin, so I'd always disable it after a while.

Now KWin in KDE 4 has its own built in compositing methods/effects, things feel much more integrated for me. I can shut off the effects I don't want, and keep the elements I still like better in plain-old KWin (such as the standard KDE alt-tab task switcher, which is brilliantly efficient for the way I use it). 

The compositing window manager in KDE4 doesn't have all the effects of Beryl, and so isn't *quite* as fun; but reading the article linked here I am wondering if Compiz Fusion may have fizzled due to being just a window manager which perhaps core developers have lost interest and/or focus in for various reasons, where KWin's compositing support feels more deeply integrated into the desktop environment as a whole.

At some stage, ones questions the recipee and the church cannot answer these questions, therefore it fears them.

For most people there is no alternative then but to turn to agnosticism in the best case (they feel God must exist but he is unknowable since everything that the church says about him feels wrong) or atheism (if they have been hurt enough).

I would not be surprised if they kill civilians just to get more money from the US.

&gt;Israel atleast tries to minimize the damage

No it doesn't. 

Remember this is a country which uses food as a weapon. If it cared about civilians it would not have cut off food supplies as well as fuel and medicines.

&gt;amas rockets target civilians in particular - they are unguided and fired at Israeli population centers.

Killed nobody.

&gt;Taking about using food as a weapon - the propellant in the Hamas home made rockets is made from Sugar and Fertilizer. 

I understand this is something jews say to themselves to justify using food as a weapon.

&gt;There are no deaths from starvation in Gaza or the West Bank, 

This is not because israel isn't attempting to starve them. This is despite the fact that israel is trying to starve them.

By the same logic I could say hamas hasn't killed any israeli in the last year.

Other things? Well, I find I'm going to be tired regardless of what I do, as I don't usually get much REM sleep when I'm drunk. To get over the tiredness in the morning associated with this, I find caffeine helps. If I was dehydrated, it would be a bad idea; but remember, I'm usually drinking a shitload of fluid before I go to bed.

Finally, when I wake up, even if I feel like I'm going to vomit, I try and eat some simple carbs, to get my blood sugar back up to the point where I'm not hypoglycemic anymore.

I don't get headaches, so I never have a need to take tylenol or something like that.

So yeah, I find that covers most of my bases:

# 1) gatorade, the night of, for dehydration

# 2) caffeine, to cancel out the fact that alcohol inhibits REM sleep

# 3) simple carbs, to cancel out the fact that you'll be moderately hypoglycemic the morning after drinking.

This is what works for me, but I'm sure everyone will have something a little different.

I really don't know if I'm atheist or not: I think the Christian God is just a mask, just like Buddha is a mask and Shiva is a mask. Behind all these is....*something*. 

I believe in the...whatever-it-is behind those masks. You can see through chinks in all those masks, and all the chinks line up in certain places, so even with all masks on the true form is still visible...and for that form, that truth, I have tremendous humility and awe. 

Because I have that respect for what's behind the mask, I respect the mask. So I don't know if I'm an athiest. I do believe in a singularity, but I also believe in the validity of all the masks of God. 

In the end I think the things that get in the way of accepting other views are largely psychological. I found Carl Jung's work to tie in nicely with the reasons why people just will not listen to viewpoints that offend their sense of identity. It's very stupid, but the rejection isn't personal: when our 'hated enemy' (atheists, Christians, whatever) is met fairly face-to-face, they're often judged to be good people who mean well.

So there it is: *most people mean well*. The extreme rejections of the Christian-mocking atheist and the oppressive Church father are the problem, and both these guys would be horrified to know how alike they are. They'd probably become violent toward whatever messenger hands them that letter.

It isn't an **ideology**: it's a **type of guy**. A certain type of guy wants the world to be just as he wants it and will not compromise, and everyone who disagrees with him is stupid at best and usually actively vile. The thing is just not to be that type of guy.","1230779008"

Besides, the economic sciences will never have the same accuracy of the physical sciences because they are based on concious actions and not behaviour at the atomic and quantum level-- but that's another discussion.  

Anyway, have you actually read any Austrian Economics or are you just lumping it together with Anarcho-Capitalism, Classical Economics, Neo-Classical Economics, Libertarianism, Objectivism and all the other right of center stuff?  The Austrian Economists are almost a category all on their own because they didn't just copy someone else and make little tweaks-- they tried to rediscover economics from first principles (apriori).

If you scroll down to the bottom here 

http://mises.org/humanaction/chap24sec3.asp0


&gt;The classical economists' teachings concerning the harmony of the rightly understood interests were defective in so far as they failed to recognize the fact that the democratic process of the market is not perfect, because in some instances of minor importance, even in the unhampered market economy, monopoly prices may appear. But much more conspicuous was their failure to recognize that and why no socialist system can be considered as a system of society's economic organization. They based the doctrine of the harmony of interests upon the erroneous assumption that there are no exceptions to the rule that the owners of the means of production are forced by the market process to employ their property according to the wishes of the consumers. Today this theorem must be based on the knowledge that no economic calculation is feasible under socialism.

That's just a paragraph for brevity but if you read a bit you'll see that Mises bashes the classical economists for failing to admit, that in some limited instances, monopoly prices are possible and the market needs some regulation but this must be understood within the context of all the flaws of nationalization and flawed regulation that are put forth in encyclopedic fashion throughout Human Action.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work at a place with public time-rental computers, so I saw this behavior all the time.  Worse than the double-clicking on everything was the double-clicking on literally *everything*.

Some users apparently won't spare a single braincycle to even hazard a guess at what any icons or widgets might do, or even which one might do the thing they want.  They just (sequentially or quasi-randomly) double-click each vaguely clickable-looking thing they can find, and then Undo (the Undo is one of the few things they do learn) if that didn't do what they wanted, until they happen to click on the thing that does what they wanted in the first place.  They may have learned the hard way what NOT to click blindly, which is how they wind up with eleventy-dozen windows open at once, having developed a behaviorally-conditioned aversion to clicking anything with an **X** on it if they don't want to lose all their work.

For these users, every GUI might as well be a panel full of unlabeled buttons and one big red Undo button, and they just keep alternating between them until they get their desired result.  They would probably be better served by having just two buttons, the big red Undo button and a ""do something"" button that cycles thru a sequential or random sequence of actions.  Getting a computer to do what they want is like operating a slot machine to them; they just keep trying until they get lucky.","1230779243"

But in my puny american hating brain, it seems to me that Nixon's policies created fantastic and myriad detrimental effects. The more he meddled with prices, the wierd and more myriad the effects. 

The democrats think governments can run economies pretty well. I think they are wrong. Republicans say they don't think governments can run economies well but obviously they agree with the democrats. Their actions have expanded government intervention enourmously - far more than the democrats have been able to do in decades.

I know its unpatriotic, but I really think government is stilll trying to figure out which end of the economy the water goes in and where the weazels come out. And I think they may have the wrong idea entirely. Best if they don't get near the economy at all. l

So not surprising that when the UFO craze took off at the end of the 40s, it got linked to the semi secret German war efforts.
You almost never see any mention of the WW2 German high tech stuff in any Hollywood movies, even the tank tech is simplified to the common types. Media people and script writers are lazy and resort to kiddie books for research material.

[Ames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames,_Iowa) is a liberal college town. The population is about 50'000 and it's regularly on those lists of the best places to live in the US.

The [Quad Cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-Cities) is a collection of cities on the Iowa/Illinois border. Collectively the area has a population of 380'000, but there are sort of 'suburb' towns like [Silvis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvis,_Illinois) (pop. 7000) and [Le Claire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Claire,_Iowa) (pop. 3000) that you might find interesting. Le Claire is super beautiful, but it may not have all the amenities you want (it's really small so for some things you would need to go to Bettendorf, which is close by, but probably not close enough that you'd want to walk or bike it). Quad Cities isn't quite as liberal as Ames but it's not like full of red-necks or anything.

Most other Iowa towns in the 10'000 to 30'000 population range outside of the big metro areas are going to be small, moderate, and bike-friendly actually, as long as you keep away from the southern border and the north-central area. [Indianola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianola,_Iowa), [Clinton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton,_Iowa), [Muscatine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscatine), &amp;c.

In Illinois it can be more tricky, the down-state area gets pretty conservative in some places. [Fulton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton,_Illinois) and [Savanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna,_Illinois) are both small and moderate, but due to their size you might be in a similar situation to Le Claire where you'd have to go out of town to get certain things. [Urbana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbana,_Illinois) is on the bigger side of the population range (38'000) but it's also a bike-friendly liberal college town.

All those places except the really small ones have public transportation also, although it's obviously not as good as a Chicago or New York.","1230779674"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","This guy forgets one piece of information.  Lets say you're playing Super Mario Bros.  You get to world 8-3 and lose all of your lives.  Now you have to go back to the beginning of the game and get there again.  That sounds bad because you're not able to work on getting through 8-3 until you go back through all of the levels, but in the process of going through all of the other levels you are still improving your skills.  You're learning the sizes of the hitboxes, the enemy patterns, the sensitivity of the controls and although you're not necessarily progressing forward, you are learning to play.  For me Prince of Persia was horribly boring.  I had no incentive to not fail and I found myself not trying on half of the jumps and actually being held back by that.  Only when I realized I was just attempting the same jump over and over again and snapped out of my trance for a moment I was able to actually progress forward by concentrating.  That's what the threat of death in games does, is it forces you to stay active and plan your moves.  In Bioshock with the vita-chambers turned on I would just randomly fire at a big daddy without thinking about what I was doing.  I'd get mauled, respawn, run into the room, fire off a couple shots, die, and repeat.  When they were turned off I planned my moves, I found locations I could set a trap or two and made sure I had enough ammo before I attempted to fight.

And if their villages and property weren't destroyed and they hadn't been expelled from their homeland, they probably wouldn't be launching rockets back at the people that they consider occupiers.

Right now, the situation is fairly close to what Israel wants.  Palestinians have no effective power to retaliate, other Arab countries have been trounced twice with more-advanced military hardware, Israel claims (and probably *de-facto* owns and will keep) Jerusalem, Israel's lands are much greater than the initial division proposals included, Israel has a nuclear arsenal and no Arab nations do, excess Arab population has been dumped into occupied lands and then separated from Israel (thus eliminating the problem of Arab votes) and Israel has the choice land.

There are things that they might also want -- no opposition at all, all the lands that originally belonged to the ancient kingdom of Israel, and no water obligations to the Palestinian reservations that have been created, but by-and-large, they're not far off the best that they could hope for.

Palestinians have birth rate, some very meager weaponry, a fraction of the land that they once lived on, and overwhelming poverty.

Israel's primary goal would simply be to get Palestinians to accept the status quo -- that would be a pretty solid outcome for Israel.","1230779733"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt;I'm not aware of any unix tools that cannot handle spaces in filenames properly

Yeah, actually, I'm wrong on that one. The shell is where the problem is and even that is not a big problem anymore.

&gt;I'd think Windows programmers would be wary of such garbage; There are a number of files and directories that can be created that both Explorer and cmd.exe make impossible to delete

Well yes, there are all sorts of OS-specific rules there. You can't have a colon in file names, you can't name your file COM1 or whatever. But most of the time, you don't really have to deal these distictions.

&gt;This optimizes for an uncommon case (printing file names, and reading filenames in an unusual coding) instead of for the common case: Program wants to perform some operation on a bunch of files in a directory.

Well, I'm referring to a special-case library here to handle unix filesystems as bytes. So by definition, its optimized for the uncommon case.

&gt;Of course, making the problem more visible makes more people aware of it, and thusly, helps more people avoid it.

There's certainly some merit in that argument. By extension, the correct thing to do is keep unicode handling the way it works in Python 2.x, ie, let the programmer explicitly deal with it. 

Personally, in this case of character encodings, I prefer a leaky abstraction to no abstraction.

&gt; you make the mistake of thinking the Palestinans and the Jews are separate races or people. They are in fact all Semites

It seems like giving me ""a link for Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century"" is kind of like *you* ""making the mistake of thinking the Palestinans and the Jews are separate races or people"", not me. The truth is, *they* think of themselves as different races or people, Semitic as they both are. I guarantee both sides would deny that they are related to each other, so what it comes down to is just a battle of two different religious groups, which makes sticking up for either side rather pointless. They're both religious fanatics who depend on faith instead of reason and that goes to explain why they're so completely dysfunctional.

And, if they're both the same ethnic group and most of the Jews left after the Romans conquered Israel... they're fighting themselves. Only, most of the ones that stuck around converted to Islam, so they see them as a different ethnic group (which is half-true because the Jews that left in the Diaspora undoubtedly bred with the Europeans and the Jews that stayed undoubtedly bred with the Persians). So, basically, it just goes back to religion, and yes, I agree, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is like two children fighting over who gets to live in their dead parents house. It's fucking retarded.

Lots of [the Palestinians were actually Zoroastrians before they converted to Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_conquest_of_Persia) (a very tragic event, if you ask me, because Zoroastrianism was a much more sane religion). 

Basically, at this point, what we need to be doing is trying to guarantee that each side is treated equally. That's obviously not happening due to Christianity's influence on American foreign policy regarding Israel, but hopefully one day Israelis and Palestinians can unite once more under a common philosophy; and I personally hope that philosophy is atheism.","1230780023"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The tradition was started by a corporation in the early 20th century as a marketing strategy, and is now so ingrained in public minds that it's now considered the norm. 

The diamond tradition, yes. Not the ring. It is simply an augmentation on that.

&gt;I blame Shakespeare for writing in the concept of trading materialism as a romantic promise in the Merchant of Venice (one of the earliest mentions of a ring given as a promise of marriage).

We have *much* older material evidence of jewelry being given as dowry, certainly with the implication of seduction and, later, fidelity.

&gt;I'm curious what our current generation marketing executives are trying to instill into our society as ""tradition"" for us to pass down to our children and grandchildren.

There are plenty in the current generation. Children *must* have computers (10 years old tradition), teens *must* have cell phones (5-10 years old depending on region in the US). Adults *must* drive cars (40-50 year tradition).

As for fashion, there are reasons why trends that start as fads survive. Simply put, diamonds are beautiful stones that look good in any cut. Other stones do not. Diamonds are also excellent for women because their colorless shine can go with any choice of outfit - emeralds and pearls do not.

Personally, I don't prefer diamonds, but I have a pair of .4c studs to wear for special occasions. I prefer the more obscure gems because *anybody* can buy a diamond these days. I can take my dog's ashes to a lab and have them MAKE a diamond out of them. It's too easy, too common. As you reference, pre-De Beers, they were practically worthless in the gem trade. I wouldn't mind seeing a return to that, however, I understand the current cultural value of it.

I'm unconvinced -- why, then, would we even have a Supreme Court? 

Because that is to a least some extent what they do--they resolve such discrepancies in interpretations of the law by provincial courts of appeal, etc. The local courts mostly follow eachother but are not mandated to, afaik(although vertical stare decisis is a must).

A cursory google seems to confirm my position; horizontal stare decisis at the provincial court level isn't mandatory(although, it may be suggested, but it is controversial how far it needs to be held to(?))

&gt; If the decision of a court is not acceptable, it can be appealed. Each province or territory has appeal courts that may affirm or reverse the trial judge after hearing arguments from lawyers. Trial judges have to follow decisions made by appeal court judges in the same province or territory. Since 1949, the final court of appeal in Canada has been the Supreme Court of Canada, which sits in Ottawa.
( [source](http://www.mta.ca/about_canada/law/index.htm) )

...no mention of horizontal stare decisis, and in general there is no results for horizontal stare decisis on google at all for canada. I'd pull something from my law book but it is extremely outdated so would be all but useless anyway.

**edit** [another overview of stare decisis in Canada](http://www.legalresearch.org/docs/perell.html) 
&gt; ""while decisions of co-ordinate courts are not binding, these decisions are highly persuasive.""  

There needs to be a strong reason why a provincial court would diverge from the findings of other provincial courts, and the court *cannot* diverge from the findings of the Supreme court, but it can be done otherwise.  And marijuana prohibition is filled with such strong reasons, hysterical or otherwise.

Skimming through CanLII there's quite a few cases which contain persuasive arguments that the courts *should* follow horizontal stare decisis in regards to their case, but it looks like there isn't a uniformity in whether this is followed, and a lot hinges on whether or not the Court had a strong enough reason to diverge from previous findings on a horizontal (or even equal?) level ( R. v. Butchko, 2004 SKQB 140 (CanLII) )","1230780571"

The air wouldn't be unbreathable on the whole surface of the Earth for long, if at all (otherwise all land mammals would have become extinct by the previous eruptions): we have dust and gas masks which can help quite efficiently there.  Nor is the bunker going to be buried under much rock if you put it in Asia or something.  No, the nasty part is the ash which tends to linger in the upper stratosphere and blocks the sunlight out, causing a short (but harsh) ice age.  When you come out, the climate should have returned to normal, the acid rains should have stopped, and you can grow things again.  I'm not saying it would be pleasant, it would certainly be post-apocalyptic, but I think it's the best strategy to survive this (if you think you can do better, please suggest).

Since these byte-arrays are shown to the user and are, in fact, the *only* way a user has for identifying a given file, then there is most certainly a huge benefit in treating them as user-readable strings.

If you want to argue that its ok for file names and paths to be some opaque data type (that are just historically treated as strings for convenience), then there also has to be some 'friendly' way for users to identify these files that doesn't involve recognizing arbitrary bytes. Currently, the internal representation and the representation exposed to the user are the same. That's how its been in (almost?) every major desktop OS. 

Claiming that this is the wrong way to handle paths is to basically ignore the reality of how people use file systems.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","I think the problem with the article is identifying hipsters as the inheritors of the counterculture tradition.  It's always been the case that the majority of people were doing the period-equivalent of picking up expensive vintage crap.

It seems to me that young people today are more engaged with the problems of the world and how they might be fixed than any time since the 1960s, at least.  And in terms of originality and creativity and the generation of new art and culture, more is happening now than ever before.

For the first time in a long time, the counterculture is, rather than outright rejecting the past, claiming it for their own and remaking anew.  Taking up bricks for building rather than rocks for throwing.  Challenging the system without challenging the need for a system.

If advertising and some other culture industries seem to be producing mere derivatives and unoriginal rehashes of the past, it may be because they are now just trying to catch up and adapt to a more pluralistic cultural landscape where they have less influence in shaping culture than they used to.

I'd never heard of vecteezy or fffound, but looking through those sites I note the impressive diversity of aesthetic styles represented.  Many, yes, are clearly based on styles of the past or are from the past, but there is a lot of past to draw from.  And a lot of that was never mainstream until now, even though the originators of many of those styles were producing much better stuff than what was mainstream in their times.

One obvious thread is that line art styles are ascendant.  But that's hardly a singularity, given the diversity of styles.  It seems that the world of design is just now coming around to the fact that the most significant and influential design work of the mid-20th century had little to do with the traditional art world: comics, music, and sub-literary genres of fiction were the sources of the lasting visual styles, rather than the pop art and other Modern Art styles that dominated in painting and other high-culture visual arts.","1230780857"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;It's all because programmers are antisocial pricks who can't seem to cooperate on anything, and end up re-creating solved problems over and over.

Uhm, no. We programmers use frameworks, libraries and similar stuff all the time. Sure, there are some, who don't research if their problem is already solved. Those tend to reinvent the wheel. 

Somtetimes you have to figure if writing a function is cheaper than licensing a library. Sometimes a specialized function is much smaller and faster than a library function. Sometimes it's not feasible to use standardized libraries, especially for embedded systems like the zune.

&gt;There needs to be a higher order of development, where people MUST use existing techniques, and stop making shit from scratch. 

And who is to say ""Integer handling can only be done this way""? One of the first lessons you learn as a cross-platform developer is: Never assume a [int|char|long|...] has a given size. Never assume, your function calls succeed. Apart from the basics your programming language grants, you're on your own and every target platform imposes different limitations. 

&gt;Builders and architects don't throw out their schooling every time they set out to build a structure. They are taught and use their skills and techniques properly.

Builders and architects always start with a shovel and levelling terrain. That's exactly, what programmers do. Setting up a basic envirnment on a known level. Both use existing primitive techniques ( brick on mortar / integers and operators) to set up a comlicated structure catering to the need of humans. Builders and Architect sometimes make mistakes and a building collapses or a bridge doesn't survive the earthquake it was built for. A programmer forgetting to filter input and allowing a XSS attack is like an architect specifying a back door without a lock. Apart from the analogy, don't assume architects and builders work flawless on smaller levels. I can tell you a couple of first hand experiences where both made horrible mistakes.

&gt;Doctors don't just make up procedures every day.

But they do. They have a basic concept (Treat this bacteria infection with this antibiotic) but the individual outcome differs. Doctors who take their job seriously will give you a highy individualized treatment. If doctors' procedures were perfect and wouldn't need to change, we wouldn't have people dying from wrong diagnostics or wrong treatment. 

Programmers is made from people. People make mistakes.

Seeking a sexual tyrannosaur for a romp in the park - w4m
Date: 2008-10-12, 3:14PM PDT


I am a very career-focused, attractive, 5'9, 120lb woman who is seeking a man who is willing to fulfill my ultimate sexual fantasy. I am an executive with a very successful corporation that keeps me very busy and I sometimes have difficulty finding men who share similar interests to my own in the bedroom.

Nothing turns me on more then Jurassic Park themed role play. You must be the animatronic dinosaur, and I must be the helpless child (Tim or Lex) stuck in the park at your mercy.

You will growl mechanically into my ear and stare threateningly. I will feign panic and search for the flash light in the back seat of the visitor jeep. You will sniff at the window slowly and then release a robotic roar into the night air. I scream for Alan Grant, but your over sized robot jaws come crashing down through the overhead window, pinning me to the floor.

I cannot stress this enough however, you must play as a ROBOTIC dinosaur. This is very specific, my interest lie entirely in animatronic dinosaurs, not real ones. I thought I should mention this as there have been unfortunate miscommunications in the past, leading to performances that have left me without an orgasm.

Other situations could include you being the dilophasaurus and spitting in my face and then going for my jugular. Or you could be the ill and moaning triceratops, and I would be Ellie Sadler, digging through your stool to find the source of the ailment. More or less any scene from the film involving a mechanical dinosaur interacting with a human will do fine.

I don't like wasting my time, so make sure you do your homework and watch the film and make sure you can fully embrace the mindset of an animatronic dinosaur. I am an incredibly sexual person and I would make it a blockbuster night that you would never forget.

I would argue that it's well on its way.

&gt; The poster above me is already declaring how anyone working for the government isn't human any longer and so it's okay to kill them. I think a lot of people get swept up into this silly revolutionary fantasy and turn to violence, because actually trying to fix the problem through peaceful means is harder and not as cool as just shooting people.

I don't claim to speak for the above poster. I don't quite get what you're getting from his comment, but whatever. The issue I'm talking about here is the idea that private bill collectors, with the blessing of the government, can break into your house, take your shit, and use force if necessary. I'm sorry, but if I wake up / come home and find you in my house, taking my shit, you're gonna a crowbar to your face. I'm not going to have a chat with you to determine whether your papers are in order.

People for some reason take offense to this, and claim that robbery doesn't warrant killing someone. I'm sorry? You broke in to *my* home, started taking *my* shit, and I'm just supposed to shut up, call the police once they leave, and leave a police report they'll do nothing with?

In retrospect, my comment was probably confusing. I was mixing my rant about ""if you're in my house, you're dead"" with a rant about ""this law is mind-blowingly bad."" I wasn't advocating shooting government officials to protest this law. I was defending the position of weapon-owning citizens to defend themselves, their family, and their property.

I am by no means an expert.  
I understand that per the Federal GCA an SBR has an attach point, but a friend of mine bought an Uzi that was originally sold in Kentucky (I think).  He transferred the gun to Virginia (where he lives) legally.  It did not have an attach point, but I KNOW it was registered as an SBR.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt; Well yes, there are all sorts of OS-specific rules there. You can't have a colon in file names, you can't name your file COM1 or whatever. But most of the time, you don't really have to deal these distictions.

I wasn't talking about this. The filesystem calls like `CreateFile` have fewer restrictions than programs like Explorer and cmd.exe do.

Because every program parses filenames themselves, *and because the rules for parsing filesystems are so complicated*, programmers often get them wrong. This of course, breeds problems.

&gt; Personally, in this case of character encodings, I prefer a leaky abstraction to no abstraction.

The only reason I could imagine people would prefer strings to a path-name object (that perhaps implements the string interfaces) is that they don't understand the cost of doing so, or underestimate the cost of path-name objects.

I'm a big proponent of robust programming, and so I like libraries and languages that encourage it. [As I discovered elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7mlgf/one_of_python_3s_fundamental_problems_on_unix/7vo3), this change makes robust programming almost impossible in Python: The thing that works on Windows *doesn'*t work on Linux, and there's no reason for it!

If I want to write a routine to find a string in a bunch of files matching `/^some_key\s*=\s*(.*)/` I'd love to do something like this:

    for x in os.listdir('.'):
        for y in file(x):
            if match(y): ...

but I can't do that! On *windows*, I need to use:

    for x in os.listdir(u'.'):

and on *unix*, I need to do:

    for x in os.listdir(b'.'):

otherwise I can get an unexpected exception, or lost data.

To insulate myself from this ugliness, I can encapsulate it. I can write an iterable, say, `dirfiles()` or whatever, that goes through the necessary contortions.

The *problem* is that *every python programmer* has to go through these contortions, or their program is flat *wrong*.

Are they going to go through the contortions? Correctly? Every time?

What can we possibly be gaining by having `os.listdir()` return strings, that it is worth *this*?","1230781430"

If you are really so unwilling to click the link, let me give you a quick summary of article method of proving the existence of God and Islam: if the Quran wasn't divine, scientific accuracies written in it that were not scientifically discovered hundreds of years later had to be guessed. The probability of accurately guessing each scientific fact in the Quran was then calculated. It is then left up to the reader to decide whether the slim chance of guessing every scientific fact was pure luck or if the Quran is divine. If the reader chooses the latter, he would have accepted both the existence of God and the that Islam is true.

Frank stated in 2003, ""The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.""[33] Frank stated that the bill would potentially ""[weaken] the bargaining power of poorer families and their ability to get affordable housing"".[33]""

I've only had that happen a handful of times but one person in particular completely shifted my perspective (I tell a lot of stories and include a fair amount of history in my lectures, the student really liked this because it established context.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It is interesting to see that nobody wants to develop Compiz, but everyone and their brother is writing their own tiling window manager (awesome, stumpwm, xmonad, dwm, the one by that crazy guy, ...).

I almost think desktop GUIs went down the wrong road many years ago, starting with mice and overlapping windows.  I can imagine a developer one day developing a cool hack that let windows overlap.  He showed it to the product manager.  ""Wow, that is so cool.""  A few years later, manually-managed overlapping windows on a single desktop were the norm, not because they were a good idea, but because they were cool and made for a nice marketing bullet point.  (Remember, you are selling desktop OSes to people that haven't used them; so pretty and cool wins more customers than ugly and usable.)

Now we've realized that this model sucks, and it's much better to let the computer manage windows and to switch between them with a quick keystroke.  Not very nice looking, but very efficient and productive.  It took 20 years to start undoing the ""cool"", and people today still insist on pretty.

The same goes for mice.  A mouse is great for picking exactly one pixel among the 2.3 million on your screen.  It's not particularly well-suited for anything else, though, unless you like getting an RSI and having your typing slowed down by context-switching between ""my right hand is typing"" and ""my right hand is mousing"".  So again, something that someone thought was cool is gradually being replaced by the ""old way"".

It is nice to see that we are able to get off the wrong road, though.  I know that since switching to xmonad computing has been more relaxing (less clutter) and productive for me.

(FWIW, I also haven't had a mouse connected to my computer for a few weeks.  You need special software for this to work, like Xmonad, Conkeror, and Emacs.  Things like OO.org don't work too well.  But it is really great to never need the mouse -- typing commands has made me better at typing, being better at typing has made programming less stressful; and everything feels properly integrated now.  My fingers can make the computer do what I want much faster than the mouse ever could.)","1230782128"

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","Wow, Big Pharma will love this article.  

&gt;There is only one kind of medicine we can trust: science-based medicine.  

Unfortunately, the science of pharmacology has been co-opted by Big Pharma.  Many pharmaceuticals are approved only to come into controversy later when people start dying from them or experiencing other major side effects.  It is also in the interest of Big Pharma to confine the sale of medicine to patented drugs.

&gt;There is only medicine that has been proven to work and medicine that hasn't. If science showed that an ""alternative"" treatment really worked, it would be promptly and enthusiastically incorporated into standard medical practice and would no longer be considered ""alternative.""  

Why? Herbal remedies are still considered alternative - despite some scientific validation, but you won't find many GPs recommending them over Pfizer's latest drug.  Big Pharma certainly won't be enthusiastic about competing with non-patented remedies.  

What does it mean to say ""medicine that has been proven to work""?  Does it mean there should be some beneficial effects in 95% of patients?  Does it mean there should be fewer than 1% fatalities or major side effects?  Few medicines, if any, deliver precisely the same result for everybody.  

&gt;Today we can buy a Digoxin pill with a precise dose instead of crushing a foxglove leaf and taking potluck.  

So instead of using something freely available, we can now pay Big Pharma for a slightly modified, patented version of the same thing.  Next step, ban the foxglove.  Big Pharma hates competition from nature.","1230782313"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Hi LaurieCheers, HNY :-) AND some more feedback!:

1. how do you write a function with 2 arguments? (the online tutorial ends at Section 5).  I used `[ arg1, arg2 ]`

2. How do you combine two lists?  I used `[ each(a), each(b) ]`

3. ""it"" is confusing when you have nested function definitions.  I guess named arguments fixes this (they just don't seem to be working for me in this version).

With the parser of SWYM, a couple of things made it difficult to find syntax errors:

1. forgetting a "";"" (which is esp easy to do after a ""}"") cases a ""...waiting..."" message.  It's hard to find where the problem is (or even that it is a syntax error, and not a runtime error in the code you're compiling).

2. forgetting a ""]"" has a similar effect.  It seems to interpret the remainder of the program as a giant list - maybe that's syntactically legimate?  Anyway, i would be helpful to signal that an unclosed ""[]"" is the problem; and even better to say where the start of it was (tho for nested ""[]"", it's impossible to know which one was supposed to match, unless the language has syntax that is not permitted in a list - and it's in the right place).

Anyway, I did it! :D  I must be progressing in my understanding of the parser combinator style of regexp engine, if I can implement it in an entirely new language off the top of my head. :-)

My feeling is that it is possible to write this regexp engine very simply and elegantly with the ideas you have for SWYM.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt; Since these byte-arrays are shown to the user and are, in fact, the only way a user has for identifying a given file, then there is most certainly a huge benefit in treating them as user-readable strings.

I disagree. There's benefit in having names that are easy to type- hence terminal users tend to create files without spaces in them (and ? and other metacharacters), but I think it's a mistake to confuse the two problems.

My terminal will decode utf-8 glyphs just fine when I `cat unicodefile.txt` - but `cat` doesn't need to know about unicode- or character sets, or anything else like that in order to accomplish that. It would actually be a mistake to teach `cat` about character sets because people use `cat` for things *besides* looking at the output with human eyes.

Filenames are similar. Just because we sometimes look at filenames, and sometimes need to type them, doesn't mean that programs need to go through the contortions and the time of decoding them, just to recode them again when opening the file.

&gt; then there also has to be some 'friendly' way for users to identify these files that doesn't involve recognizing arbitrary bytes

Agreed. Having `print()` (or ""stringify"") do the encoding is a good way to do it. That way, if you actually *look* at the filename, you have to deal with the coding issue, but you don't have to deal with codings if you don't.

&gt; Currently, the internal representation and the representation exposed to the user are the same

But that's a bug, because they're not the same. The internal representation is a byte-string, but the external representation might be unicode, or might be something else. The latter, you can guess on, but if you guess wrong, it doesn't cause any problems except if the user tries to type the filename back in.

And that, is what wildcards are *for*.

&gt; That's how its been in (almost?) every major desktop OS.

I'm not aware of any operating systems that do this. Microsoft Windows has two sets of apis for dealing with ANSI and Unicode strings. It also has 8.3 filenames and LFN filenames. The pathname as displaed may be `C:\Foo.txt` but internally it is `\\?\c:\Foo.txt` (I think).

GNOME does the decoding right at the end, and any coding errors get replaced with ""?"" (or something else- sometimes hex-strings), but if you double-click on a filename, it still uses the internal (byte) name.

HFS+ systems (MacOSX) use PBGetCatInfo to convert a directory index into a filename.","1230782425"

For that reason, Prussia's lack of a navy --and it wasn't even a real state, but rather a collection of principalities, so talk of a ""navy"" is a bit absurd in the first place-- was not relevant.  What Prussia had that the Americans needed was expertise in contemporary tactics and training.  I give you Von Steuben and others by way of example.   

As for the French revolution happening only a few years later, so too did the Spanish Armament.  Not only that, the French revolution was hardly a boon to England in that it brought Buonaparte to power and if that wasn't a direct threat to English power and even sovereignty, than what was?  

Ultimately my point was that the Americans knew that England was only one of handful of European powers, all of them more or less mutually opposed, and that they could count on the other powers doing everything they could to fuck the British.  Which they did.  

I then argue that the situation in Gaza is not analogous inasmuch as the major powers of today, are not even remotely interested in thwarting Israeli designs, and instead, seem content to bluster without real action, or in the case of the US, to actually *aid* Israel.

It was amazing to see first hand just how clueless (and unappreciative) end users are.  I engineered the shit out of that program so that it could handle every payment/financial situation that I could foresee.  Originally the client didn't even think they would need to be able to handle late payments at all because ""that never happens.""

Long story short - the clients don't know shit and can't tell a good program/developer from a bad one.  Also, no matter how intuitive you make something they will find a way to complicate it.  What this all means is that every piece of software has to be custom tailored because that's what the customer wants.  I create simple business apps most of the time, but it's worth it to start from scratch because if you try and deviate a little from the original spec in order to use someone else's time-tested code there is a good chance that the client will bitch and just go with a cheaper alternative.","1230782610"

It can happen for lots of reasons; problems in fsck, or malicious (or stupid) users, encoded filenames, sfs data symlinks, and so on.

I typically use random filenames (using 8-bit set) for temporary files because it reduces the chances for collision. Basically, I use a contortion like this:

Things *will* get better.  There is such great beauty in the world, in nature, in humanity, and in yourself.  You see it now through a veil of sadness, but that's okay.  Your sadness should not take away from its beauty, but, in some quiet way, add to the whole of it.  Sorrow, even depression, is a natural part of life.  Sometimes it's overwhelming, and it can be terrible--but it will fade again, and you will emerge yourself once more, better for the experiences that you have had.

You will not be sad forever.  Happiness and light will come again--they must.

The problem is that the Quran does not make any prediction that weren't made by the greeks and previous civilizations at least a 1000 year before Islam. It just copies those. Actually it even copies the mistakes in these earlier theories (which is a nice evidence that those ""predictions"" were just copies). I know muslims say that the prophet didn't know about those, but then how did he copy the exact same mistakes??? I remember at school, when the teacher find two exact copies of an exam with the same mistakes in them, the student usually gets a bad grade.

I'm sometimes struck by how differently this matter is approached than the Turkish approach to foreigners living in *their* land, some of which land the Turks had taken off Greeks by force centuries before. 

A few decades before Israel was set up as a country, Greeks and Armenians were shipped out of Turkey in the hundreds of thousands, to create a truly *Turkish*, pure Turkey. 400,000 Turks were also moved from Greece to Turkey. 

What's so incredibly different is that in the case of Turkey, multiple generations of Greeks and Armenians were evicted from their familial homelands forever, and were taken into neighbouring Greece, Macedonia, etc. Most of these lost everything they had and were forced to start again in a new land.

In the case of Israel (and this is not a comment on the right or wrong of creating an Israeli state in the first place), Palestinian refugees were not similarly welcomed, and instead seem to have become a political football to be preserved in perpetuity. Edit: wait a moment, [refugees are still being held in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria?](http://www.mideastweb.org/refugees1.htm). The Greek and Armenian refugees certainly had it better than that.  

At the same time, [Jewish refugees from Arab lands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands) were being forced out in ever greater numbers, made to abandon Jewish property in Arab countries estimated at $300 billion (today's value), totaling over 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the State of Israel). Gives cause to wonder who got that land...

Hammas is committed to there being no Israel, we know that, which is another factor. One wonders what other Arab states feel similarly.

An example:  in Durango, Colorado, a gas station raised prices by a couple of pennies.  Because of the way traffic flows through the city, people are inclined to stop by the same gas station to or from work when they need gas, and couple of pennies difference wasn't worth the effort of going somewhere else.

Other gas station owners saw this and one by one decided to raise their prices too.  They all saw that their business remained constant, so one among this group decided to raise prices again, and the rest eventually followed.  This continued until the price of gas within Durango was more than 30 cents higher than the price of gas elsewhere in Colorado (including gas prices at stations just outside the city).

Citizens eventually noticed that gas prices were significantly higher within Durango than outside of Durango and cried foul.  The government got involved and investigated the gas station owners for price-fixing.  However, the investigation revealed exactly what I described here:  there was no active collusion on the part of the station owners.  It all started when one enterprising owner raised his prices a little and noticed that his business didn't drop off, and everything else followed from there.

From the outside it appeared that there was a local cartel in play, and that's certainly what the effect was.  There was, however, no collusion between gas station owners.","1230783840"

I stopped reading after this statement. The author obviously doesn't know anything about Keynesian economics (or does, but decided to use a straw-man in their argument). 

Keynesian economics doesn't state that governments should always be in deficit, or shouldn't care about spending more than they earn, but instead use a budget deficit to stimulate the economy during economic downturns. During normal years, the government should aim for budget surpluses to slow the economy if it is overheating, and to pay off debt gained during the last downturn.

The problem with the US balance wasn't caused by having deficits during downturns, it was caused by having deficits when the economy was running smoothly. Excessive amounts of money being spent on the military, and low tax rates for the wealthy are the problem, not Keynes.","1230783843"

The man was surprised that the Buddha could not help him in this regard, but he told the Buddha about another problem; he thought to himself that the Buddha should at least be able to help him with that problem. But the Buddha told him ""I cannot help you with that problem either.""

The man started to get impatient. He said: ""How can it be that you are the perfectly Enlightened Buddha, when you can’t even help people get rid of their problems?"" The Buddha answered: ""You will always have 83 problems in your life. Sometimes a problem will go, but then another problem will come. I cannot help you with that.""

The baffled man asked the Buddha: ""But, what can you help me with, then?"" The Buddha replied: ""I can help you get rid of your 84th problem."" The man asked: ""But what is my 84th problem?"" The Buddha replied: ""That you want to get rid of your 83 problems.""

I wouldn't even have given them the time of day before (I'm a Brit living in Japan, and had no previous interest, or even any real knowledge of the country scene outside of a vague awareness of Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson).  When the whole Bush thing blew up, I started to take an interest in them but still didn't listen to their music.  When they received 5 Grammys for their 'post-Bush-incident-reaction-album' (Taking the Long Way) it piqued my interest enough to check it out and I found it to be very much to my taste and bought it along with a couple of their back catalogue releases.

The documentary about the whole thing (""Shut up and Sing"") is worth a watch.  I felt they came across as pretty decent women.  They might not be doing as well as they were before (2 million sales for the most recent album, compared to 10 million for the previous one) but I don't think they're losing much sleep over it.

I'm slightly surprised, if you're correct, is that with the subsequent sea-change of opinion in the US about Bush, that country radio still won't play their stuff.  But I have a sneaking suspicion that the section of the population that are the most hardcore audience for country radio, probably have another preset on the dial for Rush Limbaugh and correlate closely with the bizarre 20 or so percent of the population that still actually believes Bush is a doing a good job.

I am sure you can take the relativity of it all and talk about the galaxy hurling through the universe, but it is inconsequential to the argument at hand.  The difference between December 31, 2008 and Jan 1 2009 is a unit of time we recognize as a year.  If you are one to believe that time, space and matter exist... you can certainly recognize that it is not artificial, but a human recognition of matter existing at specific spaces unique to a specific time.  Now, the starting point of the cycle is a man made designation of whose epicenter was 2009 years ago.

So, I guess you are correct that the new year is 'artificial' if you have a tough time with time, space &amp; matter or if you have difficulty recognizing a beginning and end for a cycle that is constant (or relatively so).

That's another way of saying that the judge pulled this ruling out of her ass.  There was no law allowing homosexuals to marry so she created one out of whole cloth because she wanted one.  She is an activist judge and she should be removed and imprisoned immediately.

&gt; Hence, the mountain of cases which, put together, make the Massachusetts case.

Again, the facts simply don't bear that out.  There was no previous ruling allowing homosexual marriage.  There is nothing in your ""mountain of cases"" that open up marriage to homosexuals.  Nothing.  Period.

&gt; You find a bunch of cases with individual holdings and put them together to come up with a new holding

But you need to put them together in a way that they make sense.  She did not.

&gt; If your version of the law were true, it would not be possible for African Americans to vote because such a rule didn't exist at the founding.

That's a long-winded way of saying that ""laws change"".  But they are supposed to change *for a good reason*.  African Americans being denied their right to vote *is* an obvious civil rights violation.  On the other hand, there is no reason at all to change marriage - the very bedrock of society.

Yay for economic illiteracy!

Repeat after me: taxing corporations is a pointless, stupid and counterproductive way to actually tax its consumers, employees and stockholders.

The US has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, the ideal would be to abolish it altogether, but at the very least the US needs to catch up with countries like Ireland if it wants to remain minimally competitive and not drive all business to countries with less irrational tax policies.

And that is on top of all the other problems others have pointed out, like corporate income != profits, and that corporations should not be in the 'generosity' business (and when they do, they usually have ulterior and rather dark reasons, a honest corporation should concentrate on providing the best value to its stockholders, and if somebody wants to have that corporation 'donate' to charity, they can buy stock and give their dividends (or the stock itself) to whatever charity they like).","1230784464"

Historically the earliest anarchists followed a socialist way of thinking in opposition to capitalism, though this socialism should now be confused with Marxism and the many forms of authoritarian socialism that we now associate with the word. The anarchist socialism followed a free association of people model, with the underlying principle being against hierarchy(hence the word an-archy) in all forms, that is no more man being a master over man, which would still exist quite fully in a capitalist system. When labeling yourself an anarchist in many European countries was outlawed, the term libertarian was coined as a work around, and it wasn't until much later that the terms anarchist and libertarian were co-opted by small government capitalists, mostly in the United States.

The transient event ""quakes"" are one thing, but it's the background noise that's really interesting, since it indicates ongoing activity like magma movement, or hydrothermal pressure buildup (which is likely considering that area has quite a number of hydrothermal craters).

2. It is illegal to sell analogs of illegal drugs in the US (Federal Analog Act/Operation Web Tryp)

3. They also have a website called buydmt.com. DMT is scheduled in canada so it aint something the canadian government is going to let people sell willy nilly. 

4.They are using Western Union which can't be traced

You are not going to be buying synthesised research chemicals unless you have a REAL scientific reason/study for it and are requesting from a Lab or a University.

If you want to waste your money give it to me! I am a broke ass computer programmer who is studying to become an ethnobotanist.

Functional programming is hard.  It's closer to mathematics than what most people think of as ""programming"".  Students who already grasp theorem proving will find it natural and beautiful.

One thing that always trips me up is that functional solutions tend to be inefficient, which just feels very wrong to me - I've actually been able to find a functional solution several times by asking myself ""what's the least efficient way to do this?"" Or course, it isn't actually wrong, because a correct but inefficient solution helps my understanding, and can lead to an efficient solution.

"technology","t5_2qh16","This I must comment on.

The whole Prius causes more pollution to build and operate thing is utter and complete hogwash and was shown to be such within a week or two of that initial article back in '07.

I don't know where to begin with the ""Top Gear"" ""test"".

In no particular order:

The Prius is not designed to be a race car or even a track car.

The M3 does not get 19mpg putting around town let alone at track speed.

They never mention what track they are ""racing"" on, different tracks have different demands of a car or motorcycle.  Not saying the Prius would ever come close to beating the M3 in lap times but again it's not designed to be a race car.  Perhaps a better ""test"" on their ""track"" would have been to put one gallon of gas in each car and see which made it the farthest.

Oh before I forget, Jeremy Clarkson is a buffoon who has never raced anything in his life and can't turn decent lap times to save his life.(This is a general comment about him with nothing to do with this particular review)

If Jeremy had done even a half ass job as a journalist he would have known that the seat fabric is post consumer recycled as is virtually all the plastic in the interior.

He didn't get ""75mpg in his VW Diesel on the same trip"" vs 45mpg in the Prius.

The Prius does not have two engines, it has a gasoline engine and an electric motor.

The Prius' engine is running on an Atkinson cycle which is more efficient but gives up power compared to the Otto cycle.

While we're on efficiency, driving your car, truck, motorcycle or anything else with an internal combustion engine, around trying to keep the rpm as low as possible is not how you get the most efficiency out of the engine.
Doing this will give you around 20% or so efficiency. 

Internal combustion engines are always at their greatest efficiency when the venturi(s) are full open.  For Otto cycle engines that's about 28-30% for Atkinson cycle engines that's about 32-37%.  This is why the Prius spins its engine's rpms very high even when accelerating slowly.  It then takes the excess energy and charges the battery.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","Allow me to demystify.

I was working in an office job in Japan during the advent of the ""wa-puro"" (word processor) and the ""pas-kon"" (personal computer).

At this time, most people in the workforce, and a growing number of students, were using a keyboard for writing rather than writing by hand.

Keyboarding kanji (at least the systems I'm familiar with) usually meant inputting phonetics through a keyboard, and then choosing from a shortlist of probable matches.

The problem, as you may have already guessed, is akin to the problem created by spell-check software for English: orthography is moved from active to passive recall.

Japanese people increasingly recognized the correct characters, when called up on a screen, but couldn't necessarily write them freehand.

The fogeys in my office were alarmed about it, and rightly so.

The article you linked to might be written tongue-in-cheek--I couldn't get past the screaming xenophobia and orientalism to read that closely.  (My criticism is pointed at the article, not at you.)

But the bottom line is, hooked on phonics won't get you through faking the ""spelling"" of a Chinese character, but I can just as easily imagine three Ph.D students at Harvard forgetting the correct spelling of an obscure word they have little occasion to write down, while retaining the ability to read, recognize and understand the word.

&gt;The M3 does not get 19mpg putting around town let alone at track speed.
&gt;They never mention what track they are ""racing"" on, different tracks have different demands of a car or motorcycle. Not saying the Prius would ever come close to beating the M3 in lap times but again it's not designed to be a race car. Perhaps a better ""test"" on their ""track"" would have been to put one gallon of gas in each car and see which made it the farthest.

Well that was their point, that the way of driving makes a huge difference in whether something is actually economical. 

One would presume they're testing both cars around their racetrack, as they're always doing.  

I'm sure Clarkson appreciates your affection :)

How can anyone really complain about a system when a police officer makes a questionable arrest and the arrestee not only avoids charges but also is free to sue the officer?

Keep in mind that police officers are not attorneys.  While it is probably the wrong interpretation, it is not completely crazy to think someone wearing a ""police"" shirt is posing as a policeman.

If the police were clearly in the wrong, the guy will prevail in court and the whole thing will probably be well worth it.

Keep in mind our constitutional system is a balance between effective law enforcement and citizen's rights.  It would be impossible to develop a system that works where the occasional wrongful arrest never happens.

Let's not blow up when an officer makes a somewhat bone headed mistake.  Let's save our venom for the all too often times they make lethal mistakes.  Oh, and save a little venom for the lawmakers who have waged a decades long war against poor people under the guise of a ""drug war.""","1230787486"

For a few people, the answer to that is genuinely ""yes"".  For them, social class does not exist.  More power to 'em.

However, most of us feel more comfortable with people that share the same basic background, life experiences, and cultural values as ourselves.  For us, social class is very real.

Among my college classmates were Heidi Fleiss's (the Hollywood madame) nephew, Kohl's (the department store) grandson, Mead's (the Trapper-Keeper/Notebook company) son, and John Glenn's grandson (who was my freshman roommate, incidentally).  Some of these guys were douchebags and some were very nice people, but I didn't hang around much with any of them - I just felt I had nothing in common with them.  There were also inner-city kids who grew up in the projects and got in on full scholarship, and I didn't feel I had anything in common with them either.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The need to report is all apart of having a government job. Mind you I'm doing stellar at work. My depression, as both you and I have diagonalised, has only affected my personal life. Clearly for legal reasons they couldn't dismiss me explicitly for therapy, but if layoffs happen, combined with the fact that I've got pretty low seniority, I can't imagine it reflecting well on me. It is both covered by my insurance, and if it were not I don't imagine I'd have any real issue paying out of pocket for therapy. The main stumbling block is the need to report.

I know the following is going to sound like a bunch of excuses, and rationalizing is a trick done by the depressed so take it as you will.

Part of the reason for the isolation is simple lack of convenience. A while back I moved away from the city I grew up in, where my family is, and where my friends are. Sure it's just 20-30 miles out, but this requires a great deal of planing. The sad fact is that plans tend to fall apart last minute, to make anything happen. So what I'm doing instead is trying to make new 'temporary' friends. I've started to take social classes after work were I can meet new people (and with any luck some eligible women). The hardest part is pushing my self to sign up.

I'm not sure the binging is directly related to the possible depression. It may have more to do with the fact that I've gone on a diet of sorts. The cravings for such foods did not exist prior to the diet. Along with the diet I've begun exercising about 40 minutes a day, which really helps. Overall I think I've become physically healthier, though I've got a bit to go.

As of last week, when I came the concious opinion that I might in fact be depressed, I've started some research into over the counter remedies. I've started taking St Johns Wort, with luck it should start to take hold in two to three more weeks.

I appreciate you sympathy, and I too hope I can take the steps needed to get better. I know even just posting the above has helped me put some things in to prospective.","1230787554"

It was with a certain pleasure that I was able to write in the affidavit that, 'no, it was not negligent- I damn well meant to shoot Stevens.' The suit never made it to court as the insurance company for the range, which was named in the suit as well, offered Stevens a 'one time only, no negotiation, offer of $5000' which he took and signed off on any rights to future action. This really REALLY did not sit well with me and the others involved. But the lawyer for the insurance company explained it like this; ' what if he (Stevens) gets a sympathetic court and jury? You (me and the others) could lose your business, your house, everything. So if I could make this whole thing go away for $5000 and didn't do it, I wouldn't be doing my job.' Still bugs me.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I've mostly given up on discussions about religion on reddit because there is so little 'good faith' in the discussion itself - by which I mean actually anticipating a rational and reasonable response from those who disagree with you and therefore working with their arguments (critically but pleasantly) rather than pouncing on errant wording or building strawmen. 

Also, I'm on holiday :)
But for some reason I didn't want to let this thread pass, this challenge as it were, because I know that no one will have a sufficient best case for you. I just want to try and explain why.

First, since Descartes time the idea of a mathematical-style proof of God has been mulled, but the limits of knowledge make the attempt misguided. Mind you, these limits of knowledge apply both ways: Hume argues strongly that scientific knowledge is equally unprovable.

But you didn't say 'prove God' you said 'best case for God', so thats a good start :).
I will speak of the Judeao-Christian God. 

The Christian God is (by creed) a Trinity, meaning threefold in nature. The theological implication of this is that God is in relation to Himself - the Christian God is one of relationships. In Eden, God is spoken of as walking with the first man and woman - being personally accessible to them, and open to relationship. After Eden the relationship is strained, but when Jesus (one aspect of the Trinity) appears as flesh, God is re-openning the relationship in the only way possible (for God to encounter sinful man in any other guise would mean death for the man). And his death is specifically to enable relationship to exist betwen God and man once again.

So, the following criticisms are easily leveled at what I've said so far:
*the Trinity is a doctrinal fudge for having three and one God simultaneously
*God didn't create the world, so anything in Genesis is moot
*the historical Jesus didn't exist as portrayed in the bible, so anything in the Gospels is moot
*humankind isn't inherently sinful ('sin' is a religious concept not applicable)
*there's no God anyway, so what purpose would there be in having a relationship with Him?

All of which is fair enough, and I'm sure you can think of plenty more even better.

The point is that the Christian God throughout the bible is a God of relationships, not one of ritual and dogma. Its unfortunate that these have taken over the church, but the foundation of the church was not from the Pope but from the death of Christ which specifically enables any person at all to prayer to God, ie open a relationship with Him.

This is the reason why people who have faith tend to recount personal experiences (miracles, feelings, or what have you) as the foundation or start of their faith: the theology of the Christian God is one who had personal relationships with people, not one who appears before the entire world in order to prove that He exists. Every account in the bible itself of God performing miracles is one in which only the faithful see God for who he is.

The simple criticism here is that the people were deluded, mistaken or seeing what they wanted to see. Granted, a fair cop.

So here it is, the best case I have, which I call the Star Wars defence of God's potential existence.
In Return of the Jedi, as Lando approaches the death star, they can't get a reading on the force field, ""up or down"". Lando suddenly realises that this means that the Empire knows that they are coming, and are blocking the scanners.

If the Christian God exists, then he is 'blocking the scanners'. This God is supposed to be powerful, so certainly if He exists He is capable of doing this. That is why we don't see conclusive evidence of God's existence: He is hiding Himself from us [the reason given in the bible is that if he revealed himself his glory would kill us].  But He does reveal himself to those who wish a relationship with Him, because he is a God of relationships above all things (as mentioned earlier). So, to see if God exists, try to genuinely have a relationship with him.

Now, I know this argument doesn't work on atheists, because I know some smart atheists and they aren't looking for this sort of answer. And I acknowledge that the reason they give is sound: many religions, etc make grand claims and first require your commitment, and a sane person can't just go and give each one a fair try when there's no hard evidence for any of them. To which the only reply is that the hard evidence is in the followers, except that if you are in the US you are probably not at all impressed with the so-called followers of Christ there (as I am not). But one day perhaps you'll meet a genuine follower and be tempted to ask them about their relationship with God. 

Or perhaps you are (and will always be) far more impressed with the atheists that you know, in which case I can offer nothing more: you win. 

Whichever is the case, I hope you have a happy and fulfilling 2009.

PS I speak only for myself, not for any other Christians, or any other religions.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I've read your link and it does bring up some good points. However, I would like to respond to its criticisms. I've divided it into sections mirroring the article.

Creation of the Earth: 

The word day in Arabic is Yaum, which can also mean a period of time. When it said that God created the heavens and the Earth in 6 Days, the word days does not specifically mean 6 days constituting 24 hours, 1000 years or 50000 years, but 6 unspecified periods of time. The defined length of a day in the Quran some have seen to be contradicting one another, but if one uses the other definition of the arabic word Day which means a period of time, I believe that it will be clear that there is no contradiction. I found this [link](http://www.islam-australia.iinet.net.au/faqs/the_quran.html#A%20particular%20verse%20of%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20says%20that%20one%20day%20in%20the%20sight%20of%20Allah%20is%20equal%20to%201000%20years.%20In%20another%20verse%20of%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20it%20says%20that%20one%20day%20is%20equal%20to%2050,000%20years.%20Isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20Qur%E2%80%99an%20contradicting%20itself) which pretty much explains what I've said

Embryology:

In this section, there were two verses of the Quran mentioned. The first one's apparent inaccuracy is that living tissue forms first followed by bone, whereas the verse says it happens the other way around. But if you notice the verse, the order of creation was:

lump-&gt;bone-&gt;flesh

That lump is flesh. In my copy of the English interpretation of the Quran, it in fact says ""little lump of flesh"". If we however you don't want to concede this point, the next step would be to start learning Arabic as the Quran can not be translated into English without losing something in translation.

As for the other verse, which states man is created from fluid gushing from between the backbone and ribs. I'm having a bit of trouble with it. Biology was never my strong suit so I'll try to get back to you later.

**UPDATE**

I found this [link](http://www.islamicvoice.com/january.97/scie.htm#CREA) speaking of the verse concerning the backbone and ribs. I found some relevant pages to support the earlier link since the author didn't provide references. [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle#Embryonic) [2](http://www.netterimages.com/images/vpv/000/000/005/5106-0550x0475.jpg) [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system)

Scientific Absurdities in the Qur'an and Hadith: 

This whole section of your linked article seems to be forgetting one thing, that we're talking about God here. God, by definition, can do anything. Forget about the 'absurdities' presented, in the Day of Judgment, it is said that one's own body parts would be a witness against him. 

God, by definition, is the creator, and just like the creator of a xbox game, he can make tree talk without giving it all the physical body parts that we require to talk.

May I ask though did the Greeks also predict that moon did not have its own light? The article you linked attempted to speaks of **some** but not **all** scientific facts in the Quran. If you are satisfied with my responses above (excluding the one which I could not address currently) how about you answer my original question to you about the probability of all the facts in the Quran was man made?

If however you don't find my responses satisfactory, lets continue the conversation. It's been a while since I had an intelligent debate on reddit and I hope your enjoying this conversation as much as I am. :)","1230788384"

"programming","t5_2fwo","No, they didn't mean if (days &gt;= 366). The problem is that it never escapes the loop, not the math inside it.

Your code tries to roll over to 2009 a day early. On December 31, 2008, it is day 366 and year 2008. We enter the while loop, subtract 366, and increment year. Thus we get day 0 and year 2009. The issue is that you (and Freescale) didn't adjust the loop condition for the leap year.

Since this code is evidently using a 1-based day count, it might crash later on from getting day = 0. That, or it would call December 31, 2008 January 0, 2009 or some such silliness.","1230788385"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","They're could be devaluing votes that appear not to be legitimate-- like people clearing their cache + cookies then voting again. I DID warn you guys multiple times that continuing to force this issue through rallying the troops online would just lead to them either hiding those submissions or halting the social voting system experiment altogether.

They're probably using some algorithm that automatically devalues or counteracts certain votes-- Reddit has that for things like people going through and downvoting someone's last 20 submissions in a row. Maybe they're using something similar for people who go through and vote for every marijuana question.

As I've said every time I see a thread like this: Don't get angry because the President-elect isn't willing to sacrifice his political career in an ill-fated attempt to force marijuana legalization when most of the House and Senate oppose it. Don't expect change to come from the top on this issue. Act locally.

Write a Letter to the Editor. Hell, write one every week. Write to your City Council member. Get on the mailing list of the local political party branch of your choice and attend their fundraisers in order to present candidates with  factual information on drug policy reform and ask them to personally commit to supporting decriminalization of marijuana. If they make that commitment, try to reward them with a donation or volunteer hours, if you can afford it.

Also, I made a Reddit, http://www.reddit.com/r/actlocally to discuss this type of action specifically. I welcome anyone to join me there in strategizing about effective local actions to create change from the bottom up.

Lastly, as I've said before, you'd all do well to remember how it turned out when Bill Clinton, newly elected, tried to unilaterally overturn the ban on gays and lesbians in the military, without the support of the House, Senate, or the military itself. Not only did the military simply refuse to implement his order, the backlash led to DoMA.","1230788408"

So I was stashing a few bucks here and there instead of putting it in the register, then the manager comes in and takes a plastic cup and I notice him marking a number on this clipboard and I ask, ""What's that for?""  He says, ""Oh we have a strict inventory on cups.""  I was like Oh Fuck... so during my break I went around and gathered a bunch of empty cups strewn all over the park, threw them in the bucket of ice where the keg was and gave them a quick dunk and stacked them up next to the regular cups.

This is way off.  To start, I'll take it on faith that the site is a scam (it's the safest assumption), and the guy above you said that 5meoDMT isn't DMT and you wouldn't want it anyway.  But about your points...

&gt;Shitty web design (if they can synth chems they can sure as hell pay for a good web designer/programmer)

Even if it was real, it's not a full-fledged business, it's a guy making stuff in his bathtub and selling it. Grey/black market sellers probably *could* afford a better web design, but they rarely bother.  Scams which are more dependent on creating a trustworthy impression, which won't have the benefit of word-of-mouth from other customers, will have more incentive to spend money on a nice website.


&gt;It is illegal to sell analogs of illegal drugs in the US (Federal Analog Act/Operation Web Tryp)  

Yes, it's illegal to sell it here.  He's not a registered corporation, he's not going through customs; the laws of the receiving country mean jack shit to him.  He sends the stuff with a fake return address from a drop box.  The customer takes the risk of having the package intercepted and having to answer for it; it doesn't trace back to the guy who sent it, barring a sting operation.  People successfully sell illegal substances in small packages, through overseas mail, for years in spite of that risk.


&gt;They also have a website called buydmt.com. DMT is scheduled in canada so it aint something the canadian government is going to let people sell willy nilly.  

Their [faq](http://buy5meodmt.com/faq.htm) page draws a distinction between DMT and 5meoDMT, and says the latter is not controlled in Canada.  He's not selling this as a recognized business.  According to whois.net, his server is located in the Netherlands.  You send money to the WU name he gives, he drops an envelope in the mail to the address you provide.


&gt;They are using Western Union which can't be traced  

The untraceable part is exactly why people selling illegal stuff use Western Union.  Yes, it's perfect for scammers for the same reason; ideally there's a chain of trust and you only go to places which have been recommended by trusted peers who've used it before, and have a means of testing what you're getting.  Even then, the sellers sometimes send out legit goods during an introductory phase, then scam the next few waves of customers until everyone catches on.. it happens in over the counter markets too, though less frequently.  Point being, both scammers and legit sellers equally use WU.  


I know nothing about the site, and would assume it's a scam until you know somebody who's used it, tested whatever they received, and can verify it's legitimate.. but the things you listed are by no means proof that it's a scam, in fact they're typical of how legitimate operations like this work.","1230788572"

How many more innocent men women and children must be killed before the IDF should beheld accountable to its 'mistakes'?

I can't directly speak for the alcohol side of things, but I can touch on the pornography (er... pun not completely intended).

I mentioned earlier that
&gt; ... At one point I would enjoy masturbating to [pornography], now doing so is like a chore. Even though pornography has more of a hold on me now than it ever did, it is something I need, not something I'm particularly aroused by.

I started viewing pornography at maybe 13 years of age, right around the time the internet was becoming more popular, but also when you actually had to actively search for it, ie over 10 years ago. At the time a low resolution hint of a breast was the most spectacular thing in the world. As time went on so did my need to find harder and harder things. I started at rather tame R rated soft core and have advanced to the level where my preference is more towards hardcore scenes with multiple women servicing a single man or other orgy type scenes. In all honesty I think I'd have no interest in doing such things in real life.

I am an virgin in my twentys, though I can't say that has any explicit play in this. I'm also one of those guys that respects women. I know that's an odd concept when paired with porn, but the sad fact is I don't really see those actors as real women. I don't sexually fantasize about women I meet or even see in everyday life. Porn has become so prevalent I can't even remember the last time I had a sexual dream that did not involve me watching an imaginary porn. Likewise the whole cuckold fantasy in real life is not one I'd have interest in.

I've tried making it more difficult for me to access my stash. In one instance I had kept it all on an external hard drive which I encrypted with an insanely long random password and kept on the other side of my house. All that ended up happing is I ended up quickly memorizing the password and getting a bit of exerciser when retrieving the drive. Assuming I could bring my self to format the drive, big assumption, porn is so prevalent it would not be difficult for find alternate sources.

So far this addiction has not affected my everyday life, I tend to only fall back to it when I have excess time on my hands and nothing on my mind. Oddly enough, on the rare occasions when I've been out dating there actually has been a buffer zone a week on either end where I did not look at porn, nor had much of an interest in doing so.

Going beyond those recommendations, I'd like to turn your attention to a humble artist known as 'Moebius' or Jean Giraud. Check out the 'Arzach' series of graphic novels.

"actlocally","t5_2qqlu","A particularly effective way to act locally to create change is to speak personally to local candidates and elected officials regarding an issue important to you. I have been doing this since I was six years old. Here are my tips. Please share yours.

* Get on the mailing list of your county party of choice, so that you'll receive event announcements.
* Go to fundraisers and pony up the admission fee without complaint. At the local level you'll likely spend $50 or less per event, and for your money you'll get the opportunity to speak personally with people whose actions can directly impact your life in either a positive or a negative way.
* Go to events with a list of expected attendees to whom you'd like to speak. After greeting the host and grabbing a drink or some snacks, start making the rounds and seeking out the people on your list. Don't be surprised if many no-show or if surprise guests appear.
* Speak politely and respectfully to the politicians on your list. You are representing your movement, and if the person you're speaking to is a new candidate, you might even be the first activist on your particular issue whom they've met. If you come off as aggressive, rude, or ignorant, they'll assume everyone with the same opinion is similarly unpleasant.
* Follow this formula: Congratulate, Thank, Ask, Thank. Congratulate them for a recent accomplishment, thank them for the opportunity to speak with them, and ask for something specific, then thank them again. For example, ""Congressman Jones! Congratulations on your re-election. I'm so glad you came. Thanks for being so accessible to your constituents. I admit I came with something of an agenda-- but we probably all did, right? I'd like to give you this literature on hemp farming, which could generate millions of dollars in tax revenue in these troubled economic times, were the current ban lifted. Will you commit to reading this information personally? Thank you, sir! I appreciate your time. Good luck in Washington!""
* If possible, bring a friend and ask permission to have the friend take a photo of you with the most visible official you speak with. It's great for activist organizations' websites.
* Reward politicians who listen to you with a donation and/or volunteer time, if you're able. It further reinforces the impression that activists on your issue are valuable allies.
* Keep at it. Even if you're brushed off at first, when it becomes clear you're a fixture in the party, you'll get more respect.","1230789089"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The Fairness Doctrine does give ""equal time"" in a slightly different manner.  If the station engages in editorial and you have a differing opinion you can petition the station to have your viewpoint heard.  If they refuse, they can potentially lose their broadcast license.

&gt;I'd say that most TV stations I see have a liberal bent, and most talk radio a conservative bent. I don't really have a problem with that much, though -- if someone wants slanted media, they're going to get it.

With all due respect, that's BULLSHIT.  What people think is ""liberal"" these days is in actuality slightly right wing.  I mean, people call the New York Times liberal - that's fucking nuts.  What people consider uber-liberal is actually moderate.  There is virtually no real liberal presence on television.

So-called ""liberal"" stations like NPR are not liberal - they're moderate-to-conservative.  Liberal pundits on mainstream tv are basically neutered partisan Uncle Toms like Alan Colms.  Air America is a bit left of center.  LinkTV (Democracy Now) is probably the closest to liberal that you can find regularly on television and that network is only on satellite in the upper echelon of channels. Ironically, LinkTV is probably ultimately moderate but it picks stories that are of interest to the liberal, anti-conservative establishment.

A good example of a true liberal program is Freethought Radio, hosted by the FFRF (Freedom From Religion Foundation) - that's an atheist program that also espouses a lot of feminist ideals.  That's what is basically liberal.  The problem is the conservatives attack anything that's not hard-core right-wing, to the point where people think moderate is liberal.  It's called ""moving the scale"".

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; I believe that it will be clear that there is no contradiction

The Quran clearly says 6 days, it seems like muslims are trying to invent whatever excuse to explain that mistake. Just admit it, plus it's clear to any outsider that this is a copy of the old testament talking of the seven days, or is it just another coincidence of a copy?

&gt; If we however you don't want to concede this point, the next step would be to start learning Arabic as the Quran can not be translated into English without losing something in translation.

I've asked my syrian friend and he confirmed what the article says so...

&gt; that we're talking about God here. God, by definition, can do anything.

There! You have the faith coming in. There are no proofs or evidence that God exists or did create, so in the end you have to believe in it with no proof, ie with faith. I'm showing you many contradiction s and absurdities and all you can say is: ""but god is magic, he can do everything he wants"", well that argument doesn't fly scientifically. This is pure faith (belief with no evidence).

&gt; May I ask though did the Greeks also predict that moon did not have its own light? 

Yes they did:
http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/markworth/notes/Greeknotes1.htm

""The Moon is a dark body - we see reflected light from the Sun.""

&gt; how about you answer my original question to you about the probability of all the facts in the Quran was man made?

All the scientific claims in the Quran were man made because they existed way before the Quran did, and they contain the same mistakes. The rest of the claims are super natural such as the prophet going to the sky on a flying horse etc, and they require pure faith.

By the way, I enjoy this conversation too :) (I'm going to sleep for now though, that'll give you some time to answer :p)

Now I'm the type of person, especially early in the morning, who is kind of caught up in my own thoughts and somewhat oblivious to what's going on around me.  Anyhow I realize one morning that every time I pass by this girl she flashes me a big smile, so I'm like what the hell maybe I should smile back.  I don't know if not smiling back at her for however many days I was oblivious made me seem dark and mysterious , or just an asshole.  I guess it's a fine line.

Mainly because just recently a friend who is bipolar went off her meds.

Karen(not her real name) then went into a manic phase, extremely manic.  Events took place over a week that I will not mention here that caused family and friends to do an intervention. We tried to get her to go back for inpatient treatment.  She refused.

She threatened to commit suicide and climbed up on top of the roof of the 2 story home where she was living and threatened to jump.  This is in front of about 20 witnesses, including neighbors that were now coming over.

The police were called and responded very quickly but by the time they arrived Karen had climbed down.  The police took statements and even heard her say she was going to kill herself if anyone tried to take her to the hospital.
They left saying there was nothing they could do.

Paramedics were then called and she threatened the same thing and they left, again nothing they could do.

We had to trick her into getting in a car with us telling her we were going out for dinner.  When she realized we were at the hospital she tried to run but one of the people with us convinced her that he was visiting a sick family member.

We got her to the psych ward and even with all of us there giving them statements as well they weren't going to take her until she said the magic words.  ""Yes I've thought about suicide.  I was just thinking about it earlier.""

They finally took her in.

Now- if there were some way to port all of those notebooks to maxima fairly seemlessly, and some interface which was similar(ish) to Mathematica for maxima -- even if the interface was limited, then I'd be able to make that transition. Until then, I'll just second the notion -- if you're going to mess around with a CAS, use Maxima/some other free alternative (Sage was mentioned). It's way cheaper. :) ","1230790321"

"depression","t5_2qqqf","*There are no true ""tricks"" to get around this problem of yours.  This is something that every person faces.*

I hope that you can find your own way through the advice that I'm giving you.

1) This actually what a lot of people go through.  Sure, it's annoying, but it gets easier as you get older.  With myself, I only became a much more sociable person after I lost several people who I was close to, and closed everyone else out for a very long time (two or three years).  It was only after that point that I started to understand how short life really is, and that (I know this line is cheesy, and used far too much, but) I shouldn't particularly care what others think of me, as long as I'm doing something that I like to do.

You can choose to do what makes everyone else happy, and serve their needs, or you can break away from what others expect you to do and say, make a lasting impression on people around you and be comfortable with who you are.  Just don't waste any more time doing things that don't bring you happiness.

2) Try to avoid self-help books.  They are, for the most part, complete horseshit.  Treat, and speak to people the way you imagine that people want to be treated.  If that fails, no great loss.  Try again with them; if they tune you out completely, start new with someone else.  

3) Do not expect to have any particularly meaningful (or even exciting) relationships in High School.  I'm sure that *some* people do, and have tons of fun, love each other well into their late 80's, etc. etc.  Not everyone is that lucky.

4) A general guide on how to loosen up around strangers: The best things that I've found that will help myself become more sociable with people is this: Realize that many, *many* people that you meet throughout your life will have exactly the same anxieties that you do.  You are not special.  You are not some several broken freak or mentally defective in some way.  You posses the same basic abilities that every other person has who chooses to put themselves out there regardless of the ""consequences"".  The only difference between the two of you is that you are still worried about the results.

Give into your worst social scenarios, and you'll find out that things wont be nearly as bad as you imagine them to  be.

5) Make a point to (almost) **never** focus on negative parts of your life, body, personality, past/present/future relationships, etc.

The *only* things it will do to conversations is this: annoy anyone who has to listen to it for hours on end, get really tedious *really* quickly, and make it incredibly difficult/awkward to have an interesting conversation someone as a result.  I'm sure if you think hard enough, you can think of at least two or *three* people who will do this to themselves on a daily basis.

If people are completely uninterested in what you are saying, just say something stupid or interesting (it can literally be the first thing that comes to your mind, or something as trivial as satiating that you don't think that they are interested in what you're talking about. *example(s): ""Purple monkey dishwasher!!"" ""If you have a sex change from a man to a woman, then have sex with a women, does that make you straight or gay?"", ""[If you could choose invisibility or flight, which would you choose, and why?](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=178)"", ""Some times I get so angry I could...I COULD JUST PUNCH A BABY!"", ""Why do we put on such a strong face and make busy work for ourselves as a distraction from what life fully has to offer us?  Are we all so incredibly terrified of what lies beyond this life that we can't even bother to face reality while we have the chance?"").  If you can get a laugh out of them, a response or at least an odd stare, you'll know that they are at least partly paying attention to what you are saying.

**tl;dr** Do not expect things that you desire to be easily attainable.  If you do not set, and work hard towards personal goals, you should not be surprised at your results.","1230790554"

2. `[each(a), each(b)]` works fine. Or you can define `::concat = { [.each.each] }` to combine any number of lists.

3. If it helps, you can refer to the outermost `it` as `this`. But yes, it's a bit confusing without named arguments.

4. Waiting... means the Javascript halted with an error. (Or your code is still running. I'm not sure how to tell the difference.)

That functionality only makes sense if you are dumping way too much garbage to the logs in the first place.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Cute question. Firstly, I think it's not really about falling in love properly. We tend to romantically idealise the object of our desire, and have fallen in love with the idea or image rather than the ""warts and all"" person themselves. When you really love someone (a real-world person!) we love them *in spite* of their failings, but in our unrequited soppiness, the person we are admiring assumes perfect status. Obviously, that person isn't possible in reality.

Now, we are geared up to be pretty well monogamous (I know, this is a big topic!) and while we love someone we don't look for others, so, I tend to think we do it in order to mentally avoid a real relationship.  I'm not saying there is a single reason for this - there are probably many (fear of being hurt, self-image, all the usual ones!). While our heart is given (safely) to an unattainable person, we are free from the need to find another one. I'm not saying this is a conscious thing at all, more a subconscious coping mechanism.

Nor does it really matter, in the end, whether some of that aid is used to buy products from US companies, because the people who need it are still getting help regardless of the source.

The simple reality is that the US gives vast sums of money to foreign nations with no obligation and no real expectation of immediate returns, if any at all, and you'd have to be wearing anti-US blinders if you honestly can't see that.","1230791426"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The place we were shilling for was (Name Withheld) Hot Springs, which I think has a golf course, or is next to a golf course. Anyway it's in Western Nevada and as far as I know doesn't have gambling or prostitution. If they had any kind of gambling on the premises they would have mentioned that in the brochures. Keep in mind that in Nevada, even gas stations, supermarkets and your neighborhood bar have slot machines and video poker. I'm not what sure you do to get a gaming license in Nevada, but it can't be very hard.

Anyway before the place was a time share, they used to shoot porno movies there. This was in the the 80's. I'm kind of surprised they built anything where the hot springs are a major selling point, because the only time I hear about hot springs in Nevada is when somebody falls into one and dies a horrible, scalded death. The resort obviously had the non-lethal kind.

Anyway, all the office furniture and equipment was used, and then vandalized. The night shift (they'd call people right up until 9 pm, the latest allowed by law) was mostly teenagers and single moms, the former who thought it was totally awesome to write on the cubicle walls and carve things into the desks. There were enough headsets for each employee, but you'd want to get there 10 or so minutes early to get one that still had all the pieces and wasn't held together with tape. A headset phone is not as useful if you have to physically hold it in place with one hand. I worked the day shift, with other tragically-underemployed twentysomethings. A couple people were big meth fans, one guy kept trying to sell people stuff stolen from peoples' cars (CD wallets and such), there was a failed car salesman, and a 24-year-old woman with multiple DUIs. One time the police showed up to work and arrested a guy, I'm not sure what for. Another lady quit in a screaming rage, then spent half the day watching the office from her car parked across the street. She didn't do anything else, tho.

I was actually sort of good at it. During my first three weeks where your quota (6 sales a week) doesn't count, I exceeded the quota. It's really a numbers game, you hope that anyone who's not interested will immediately hang up on you and not be a real sarcastic smartass about hanging up on you. No one was really funny, except an East Indian guy who said that he'd ""hang me (by my) neck,"" which was silly because of the accent and the unusually-specific threat. Most of the people who wanted to give us money were old, kind of ""slow"" or both.

The newspaper ad promised ""as much as"" $15 an hour for this, when it was actually minimum wage +commission. The $15 figure was very theoretical, and you were paid $10 a sale up to 12 sales, at which point it went up to $20. My job was to get turnovers -- find people interested enough to talk to a closer. Of course I was only paid for sales. The closers I remember was the drunk lady and the failed car salesman.

I quit after six months, partially because people I'd call on the phone would mistake my voice for a robot's.","1230791962"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I've spent much of the last twenty years being furious with Congress, and usually find it incomprehensible why politically expedient and right don't overlap more, but neither do I think doing the right thing is rewarded by the American people nearly often enough.  The Republicans picked up seats in 2002 for ALL the wrong reasons, and reelected (or at least did not sufficiently repudiate) Bush in 2004 when he'd put into place all the disasters that have made his second term one of chickens coming home to roost.  

I believe in self-government because generally I believe people deserve what they've voted for.  

Look, in 2002, the Democrats taunted the President for opposing a Department of Homeland Security, which looked to me like a really stupid gambit that Democrats should not be behind (it looked stupid, inefficient, and to me like putting Barny Fife in charge of sniffing out terrorists), even for the expedient of taunting the President as soft on terrorism.  He managed to get the Republican majority to strip out collective bargaining rights of federal workers, got Democrats to vote against it, which ended up costing them seats.  It's still one of the worst pieces of legislation, a department--180,000 workers--with only one real function, to restructure itself.  

It might have been much more expedient to start impeachment hearings if Gingrich's handiwork hadn't shown it to be a detraction, not just from the President's agenda, but from governing altogether.  Yes, I think impeachable offenses have been committed, but I like the idea of the prosecutors using the small fry to get the big fish, like they do in drug kingpin and mafia prosecutions.

I know that it doesn't fly scientifically, but you can't deny that's what the word God means (at least to Muslims).

I assure you that I have tried my level best to keep this conversation based on facts and logic and leave faith at the door. I don't think using the definition of what God can do was wrong when trying to prove the concept of God. To give an analogy, how can I prove to you that a pen I hold in my hand is a pen if you do not know what the definition of a pen is?

&gt;plus it's clear to any outsider that this is a copy of the old testament talking of the seven days, or is it just another coincidence of a copy?

As for the similarity between the old testament and the Quran, we Muslims believe God has sent down scriptures before the Quran, such as the old and new testaments. However, our belief is that they have been corrupted by having man adding, editing and deleting parts of it. This is obvious with today's bible with its countless revisions. We believe in the many parts of the old and new testament since they are also part of the Quran and Islam.

I'm sensing that you haven't found my answers to the article you provided satisfactory. If you haven't, let me know. I thought I provided good enough answers. At the end of the day, a Muslim attempting to prove Islam as the truth is simply supposed to pass on the message. It's up to you to accept it as the truth. The Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) didn't convince everyone in his life time to become a Muslim and he (in Islamic belief) split the moon in front of a large group of people.

"funny","t5_2qh33","""Our rights are being infringed! This is just like 1984!""

No, it's not. Those who've actually read *and comprehended* 1984 know that it's a horrifying vision of an ultra-totalitarian society, where every aspect of life is controlled by the state. No one has any privacy, and all of society is designed to oppress the populace and make overthrow of the state impossible. Orwell is vague on how this occurs; in the book, he handwaves this away by giving the state the power and motivation to alter history as it sees fit, and putting in a little bit about ""revolution"".

""But this is how it happens! The state takes away rights when no one is looking, and then you've got nothing left!""

I disagree, and apparently so does Orwell. That's not how 1984 went. Take it up with him, I've got bigger fish to fry.

1984 is a book about freedom, and the terrifying tools of oppression available to an all-powerful government. Only a fool would see it as a prediction; it's a warning, a reminder that liberty is something that needs to be protected. Take Orwell's warning to heart, oppose the expansion of government power, and whenever possible disperse power from central government to local government, or even the people.

Whatever you do, don't claim that we face ""1984 all over again"". It makes you look silly in front of people who know better.

The settlers' actions are extreme, but they donot reflect the views of most Jews here, legal action is taken against them when proper evidence exists. 
Regarding the blocking of aid and food - this is only done for the purpose of prevent smuggling of more material helpfull to Hamas (such as weapons, communication equipment, night vision equipment or anything of value that can be sold in Gaza to rase funds). There is aid and food comming into Gaza from Israel after proper inspection takes place. I find it perfectly reasonable to prevent boats from aproaching Gaza which are impossible to properly inspect. There is no starvation in Gaza - the diet is not varied but they are not starving.
Regarding the economy in Gaza - in the past, about 30 thousand Palestinians worked in the Israeli settlements inside Gaza but those were vacated in 2005, currently no Palestinians workers are allowed to enter Israel from Gaza due to security issue (You can't tell who is a Hamas terrorist and who is not). I understand that there is no economy in Gaza but I fail to see what Israel can do about it under these conditions. In the past, before 1995, many workers were allowed into Israel but that was reduced to zero due to terrorist atacks inside Israel and on the border crossings. It's a chicken and egg problem.

You are really quite naive if you think this is done with no thought of returns, returns that are not so much for the US, but for the 10s of thousands of players that compete to control how and where this 'aid' is spent.

Also, again, you really must look at the details not simply the titles that were chosen or categories that the gov't thought it best to place the spending under.  There are intricate and interesting stories behind every dollar spent on foreign aid, such as a company in Houston that got a Representative a lease in Hawaii in exchange for the enforcement of 'free trade' in a country so that the Houston company could now bypass restrictions on foreign corporations owning mines, all under the heading of 'economic development'.

If you don't want to include references to God in the Pledge of Allegiance, on our currency, etc. -- then just don't say it (or as you have chosen to do -- use it, good on ya for holding to your beliefs.)  But the declaration of the choice to be American and the exchange of money for goods are still in place for a reason.  You have chosen to modify their meaning for yourself and how they impact the way you interact with society.  Everyone else has that right too.  

But it's like traffic lights -- we all have to agree on some common meanings in order for us all to coexist -- so we agree that Red means stop, Green means go and Yellow is still kind of up in the air. But what if Red is personally offensive to me?  What if Red is the lynch pin, in my books, to the total destruction of our society.  I have to decide whether I can abide by the majority opinion or if I need to move to another society where they don't have traffic lights.

BTW -- In God We Trust first appeared on coins in the late 1800s here in the US.

There are consequences to our choices.  I don't understand what the consequence is to our society as a whole if I choose to give my word by swearing an oath on a bible because I am a Christian.  What is the consequence of this that is so damaging to our society?  You don't have to do it against your will.  If you're elected President, you can swear on a Magic 8 Ball if you want to -- procedures can be changed.  I'm not saying it would be easy.  But I think if you were elected President, people would know you're a Magic 8 Ball lover before you take office so it's not like you'd be tossing in the Magic 8 Ball out of left field. 

I'm not saying that the separation of church and state is not valuable -- I should have written that better -- because our country was established to ensure the freedom to practice the religion of your choice (in the limited sense of that at the time -- but that's a whole other Reddit.)But the separation of church and state was to guarantee no injury, no prejudice, and no limitation of the basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights because of your belief system.  

The ""hissy fit"" of it all these days is trying to apply a principle far beyond the spirit of the thing.  

IMO, the people that wrote the doctrines that created this country would be baffled by what we have done with their creative writing.  Like it or not, the concept of God was interwoven into the establishment of this country.  I think it speaks great volumes that we continue to evolve and include more and more points of view into the ""mainstream"" and give those who hold them the same protections under our laws.  

I also think that's why so many of us have been discouraged by the NeoCon movement in this country, the discrimination inherent in things like Prop 8, and our government's validation of Gitmo/suspension of habeus corpus/use of torture.  These are not ""American"" values.

The freedom to take an oath of office in a way that is meaningful to you -- that is an American value I think. The concept of swearing your oath and giving your word, integrity, doing the right thing because it's the right thing not because it lines your pockets -- those are all concepts fading away in our social fabric.

I'm curious -- do you celebrate Thanksgiving?  Not as a religious holiday but as a day of gratitude?  We have ritual in our lives and we have the freedom to adapt them or ignore them.  But you do have that freedom in this country.  If you want to turn your back on Rick Warren with me during the ritual of inaugurating a President, you have the freedom to do that without fear of being killed, imprisoned, or being ostracized from society.

It seems to me that the whole concept of swearing someone into office -- the ritual of it-- is really what is caustic to you.  For people of conscience though -- it's pretty dang difficult to stand there in front of the world and swear an oath and not feel the weight of that commitment.  I think that's part of why we have rituals too -- it keeps us honest...at least some of us.","1230792727"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The investment banks aren't sitting on the money...

...they're dumping every last penny into CDO payments to keep from having those blow up in their faces (notice how you haven't been reading about any recent write downs on CDOs), because that takes out not only the investment banks, but the bond insurers and eventually all consumer credit debt that exists in the United States of America.  I think their plan involves getting the housing market to bottom out (good luck with that one), moving as many properties out of foreclosure as possible and then terminating the CDOs with early buy out payments in the event that the uncharted territory of loan forests consisting primarily of rebrought foreclosed properties doesn't hold up and implodes (yet again) the same way subprimes did.

The commercial paper desks, which were the investment banks' bread and butter before they decided to get creative with the real estate market aren't comming back.  Unfortunately, IPOs, which are underwritten by investment banks, and vast swaths of various stock markets, that are held by investment banks are also being used as a piggy bank (which is the number one reason the stock markets have been down... investment banks selling off stocks to cover ""other things"")... but hey, when times are tough investment banks will fsck your pension in a heart beat to keep their game going.

Giving money to consumers is probably the stupidest thing that you could do because all they're going to do with it is pay down their consumer debt or try to keep their overvalued house.

Small businesses are just fscked.  Best you can do is relocate all of the large corporate tax breaks directly to small business.  I hope small businesses have been prudent with their money, because those that haven't aren't going to be around in two years time.","1230792982"

"programming","t5_2fwo","""Impersonate"" is the wrong word. An Erlang node is simply a program that implements the Erlang distributed protocol. This _is_ an Erlang-protocol node.

This also implies that there is no reason that you could not use this to hook up two Haskell nodes over the Erlang protocol without any actual Erlang runtime to be seen. 

So, voila. Haskell now has semi-primitive distribution capabilities. One possibly strategy Haskell could pursue now is to cozy up to Erlang for a while, implement bridges to all their best stuff (OTP supervision trees, Mnesia), incrementally replace it with new Haskell equivalents, then sidle away into the distance laughing maniacally.

As to weather I think a pornography addiction will eventually affect my so called everyday life, I'd hope not. It is hard to say however, if you asked me years ago I never would have thought I'd have any such addiction at all. My theory is, though this may simply be a claimed crutch of someone with an addiction, that if I ever get in to a healthy stable relationship the addiction may fall to the way side. Though, I can't help but to wonder if this addiction is actually getting in the way of such a relationship from happing. It may be very possibly that by satisfying certain physical urges by myself I'm not out there looking for the emotional support I'm really in the need of, and trying to overcompensate with the pornography and masturbation. It is clear however that pornography is not filling the void, rather widening it.

Any attempt I've made in the short term to resist it has seemed to be successful, however thus far I always seem to fall back on it eventually. Because it has not directly affected my every day I have not had much of a reason to give it strong resistance. There is no doubt that there is a strong biochemical effect with each release, and though it's effect has lessened due to constant exposure, I think it would be no different than the effect of some other synthetic drug on the nervous system. The trick is just figuring out how to counter act it or replace it with something else. The want for natural endorphins is a strong desire.

So far the most I've been able to do about it is keep busy with other things, but that's hard to do when you live alone and have no one to keep you honest. I think even just talking about it here on reddit may lead me to the path I want to take. Just typing it up gives me time to put things into perspective.

For most things I'd say talking about it with friends and family would be a big help, but there is no doubt that the topic of a pornography addiction is rather humiliating. The sad fact is I don't think any such people would believe I'm capable of such a problem. Outward appearances make it out as if I'm a emotionally stable 'almost perfect' type of guy. Heck, I'm the person my friends talk to about their problems, they come to me for advice, not the other way around.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You are right and there are two things to take into consideration here.  The first is that American culture, by definition, values expenditures at the individual level --whether it be for charity or otherwise-- over expenditures on a governmental level.  More so than any other industrialized nation, the US as a whole distrusts its government's ability to spend charitable money wisely.  I don't say that this is a good or a bad thing, I simply observe that it is so.   

The second point to make is that the US spends more on military expenditures than all other industrialized nations combined.  One can make of that what they will, but the fact is, that since the US is acting as a sort of global policeman, all the other industrialized nations are not obliged to spend accordingly.  This means that they have, not necessarily *more* to give, but rather, a bit more lee-way.  In all fairness I think it ought to be taken into consideration before we issue blanket condemnations of what we imagine the US is or is not.  

The dirty truth is that US military power is *exactly* what keeps the global trade system functioning.  It's a role that the US inherited from the Royal Navy after WWII, and one that is, at least on Reddit, a largely thankless task.  You take away US military power, and who will fill the vacuum?  The EU?  Cut me a husk.

I do not argue that there isn't a better more equitable way to maintain international trade.  I argue simply that it cannot be done without sacrificing the facile European conceit to the effect that Americans are somehow more barbaric than their European counterparts.  A conceit that is, after all, built upon the luxury of not having to man and equip a legitimate military.   ","1230794214"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Linux Sucks:
My experiences with Ubuntu

Ubuntu is eye-catching. Whoever buys Vista because of the looks is absolutely retarded. Linux offers you freedom, to do whatever the hell you want. And by that I mean whatever the hell.

I could customize literally anything I wanted. And I didn't have to use the Terminal to do that either. Whenever I think of Windows, I just initiate the Desktop Cube and just drool over it. 

Now, Windows has a lot of its share (maybe even all of it) for two reasons: Work and Play.

For work there's MS OFFICE. Now, MS OFFICE has been around for more than a decade and the latest version (MS OFFICE 2007) is terrible. I've done a very small course on it, and it's absolutely impractical to use it most of the time. So, a while back, I switched to OpenOffice and I loved it. I loved it so much that I'm writing this in Ubuntu's OpenOffice Word Processor.

Secondly there's play: All games are made for Windows. But when I saw GTA: Vice City work well in Wine, I saw the fall of Microsoft.

I recognize the infinite potential in Linux. But fact is that it only has 0.93% market share (I shouldn't use that term since it's not being sold but I want to show its popularitly). It's less than one percent of the share. 

There's a reason for that

I know, many if not all of you will yell out “n00b” or whatever in your god damned 1337.  But frankly, I don't care, and I'm here to tell you why you're wrong and Linux sucks.

When I first downloaded Ubuntu 8.04, I thought I would be free of all my problems and the computer would be so easy to use. I was wrong. 

My first problem began with the lack of Internet. I used sudo pppoeconf and everything. But still at the end, it said that my username and password was incorrect. For a YEAR (yes, a YEAR) I waited for a solution and didn't find anything in the forums. Later, I realized that I had to click on that little network icon in the top panel! 

When I resolved that Ubuntu 8.1 had arrived. So I switched. Then came the trouble with the display drivers. They weren't installed automatically when I had to reinstall it (I'd installed it in the wrong drive). So, the hunt began to MANUALLY install them. I used the commands outside the GUI which did at last resolve the problem. With windows, it would have done it itself!

Then finally came the problem with music players. There is not one, NOT ONE music player that is as user-friendly as iTunes. Not amarok, not banshee and certainly not rhythmbox. Creating and editing playlists is so hard it gives me a headache.

I tried to use iTunes with Wine, but it was so slow, it was embarrassing. 

That's not all. There have been times when it loads Ubuntu 1.x. And I don't know why.

If you want to find out for yourself why Linux, try changing a wallpaper (permanently).

In conclusion, My experience with Linux overall has been neutral. Frankly there is no difference between Windows XP and Ubuntu, except the latter is not at all user friendly


No good photo manager, no good music player. I know it'll take time getting used to. But so far, I've had less problems with XP. 
I'm still keeping Ubuntu, because there are somethings, like the freedom it offers, the graphics, and the relative ease to use in some cases.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; If you justify violence in the name of self defense

I am opposed to the recent attacks carried out by factions on both sides, but I do indeed believe violent self-defense is justified.

The reason is that my definition of self-defense is different from the actions carried out by both sides.  If you or someone else is in immediate danger of death or injury, then I would support your actions to prevent that.  However, if there is no immediate danger, then I would not support any violent actions on your part - in fact, I would support anybody who wants to prevent your violence.

For example, if a fighter jet is on its way to bomb your village, then I would encourage you to shoot it out of the sky.  If someone is about to fire mortars into your city, then I would encourage you to prevent that using force if necessary.

However, if violent acts are only being planned or prepared for, then I would only support the capture of those doing the planning and preparation.

Of course, those doing the planning and preparation may be well protected.  What then?  Then show up with weapons - if the people on guard make any threatening moves, then self-defense is justified.  If the guards just let you waltz in, then fine, simply capture those doing the planning and preparing and no one has to be hurt.","1230794871"

I understand your point and sure it seems valid, but the reason why it's not is this; the American revolutionaries knew that they could count on the fact that many --not just one-- of the world's powers would actively take their side and would act behind the scenes to sabotage British efforts on their own behalf.  This is emphatically not the case with Hamas and Gaza and if you think it is, you are badly confused.  

Name me a single great power that is trying actively and openly to stop Israel and US support for its actions.  

You can't, because there are none.

I don't disagree that they've been spineless and infuriating, complicit in allowing Bush to perpetuate chaos, but they also proved how effective that was by winning more seats in Congress than the Republicans.  

The only democrat who wasn't returned was the one who used his Congressional staff money pay off his mistress.  That was not a winning strategy.  

How much independence of thought is required to see that their strategy won, and how would someone on the sidelines prove to you that he's exercising that independent, critical thinking?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The secular humanist perspective is that morals are a natural occurrence - something that all humans (and most social animals) are born with regardless of which moral system we eventually choose to adopt. (There's a lot of good evidence backing this up.)

Choosing a moral system is like picking out clothes. Wearing new clothes doesn't really change anything about you, it's just a superficial expression of your ideas about what looks good. So people who believe that adopting some new system or other can give them a new moral outlook are either confused or deceiving themselves, because if they weren't already in sync with the system's principles they wouldn't have adopted it in the first place. I'm guessing you believe something similar since you're a nihilist.

Anyway, my point is that secular humanism isn't exactly a moral system. It doesn't make any firm assertions about what's right and wrong, only that right and wrong exist, that they're discoverable and that they do not have transcendental origins.

Secular humanism is kind of weird in this way. Most moral system DO claim to be transcendental, and they make all kinds of assertions about right and wrong. But the truth is that we're all in the same boat no matter who we turn to for moral guidance - yourself, god, your priest, your pet turtle, whatever - the ultimate moral responsibility can only lie in your own brain.

what do you expect Palestinians to do?

Israel came and stole their land, built upon it, moved Israeli's in as ""settlers"", then put up a huge wall isolating the Palestinians from the Israeli's. Then put the lands Palestinians did have under military occupation. They have hardly any food, have no hope as the rest of the world won't step in to do anything, and so have used their only source of protest.

Its funny to think that the world was in uproar when Jews were being killed by the Nazi's. Now the Jews that have survived (Mainly Zionist's) and are in control are performing the same despicable acts against the Palestinian people and the world doesn't say shit.

If the Israeli's want Hamas to stop firing rockets at them, why not simply remove them from Military Occupation and provide the aid and food they desperately need. 

They would definitely improve their chances of catching Hamas militants attempting to fire rockets within Gaza, then just bombing the fuck out of it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","this is the date calculation code from a Zune, the Freescale part of it at least.

consider:

* days = 366
* IsLeapYear returns true

nothing will change in the loop. it's an infinite loop now.

this code will make problems on every last day of a leap year, assuming their leap year function doesn't have errors too.

this code will continue functioning on the 1st of the following year though, so all the Zunes have an expected max. uptime of 99.91%

i'm not sure what would happen though if the Zune is already running since i've heard that this code runs on startup. question is: does it *only* run on startup?","1230796795"

It also depends on the nature of what it is that you want to improve. If it is something physical like your body - yes it can. If it is something psychological then yes that can too. But both require work. If it it something external from yourself, like a relationship or a situation, then that is hard to say because things which are external to you are out of your control. You do not have as strong of an ability to change them. And so, sometimes, you have to learn to bear these things which you can not change.

"food","t5_2qh55","I had done some research beforehand on heart health and pomegranates. Glad to see there are other benefits as well. I believe the juice has to be raw, though, to benefit your cardiovascular system.

On another note, one of my favorite pomegranate stories is of Percephone, daughter of Zues and Demeter. Hades found her beautiful and dragged her to his underworld. There, he offered her a feast, but she knew that if she ate food in the underworld, she would have to stay there forever. She only ate seven pomegranate seeds. Her mother, goddess of the harvest, bargained her for daughter's return. But because of those seven pomegranate seeds, Percephone had to live a few months of the year in the underworld. During those months, her mother would not allow anything to grow, and that's why we have winter. 

One of the most beautiful pieces of artwork I've ever seen depicts a scene from this story. It's called the Rape of Proserpine and it was sculpted by Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini in 1621-22. It depicts Pluto (the Roman name for Hades) taking Proserpine (the Roman name for Percephone) to his underworld. The sculpture is in the Galleria Borghese in Rome.","1230797506"

In fact, since Alt + left arrow and Alt + right arrow have always worked as shortcuts for the back and forward buttons, there were several times I tried Alt + up arrow in XP without even thinking about it, only to be disappointed. I guess my mind had just mapped ""Alt + arrow goes that direction."" Then one day I happened to try Alt + up arrow in Vista, and it worked!","1230797616"

If the Palestinian situation were to get resolved, the Arab states would lose a huge ammunition against Israel.

When it comes to it, I'm not sure who's actually on the side of ordinary Palestinians.  
Israel as a whole clearly doesn't mind them living in deplorable conditions, and the neighboring states need them to stay as a splinter in Israel's ass (and by proxy in the US at well.)

Note that a good chunk of the aid given by neighboring countries is channeled through organizations like Hamas. So the same folks that are egging on Israel are also providing social services. From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#Provision_of_social_welfare_and_education):

&gt; The group devotes much of its estimated $70 million annual budget to an extensive social services network, running many relief and education programs, and funds schools, orphanages, mosques, healthcare clinics, soup kitchens, and sports leagues.

The only way this could get any more ironic would be for Israel itself to provide relief aid to the Palestinians they bombed.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","What a lovely combination of condescension and lack of insight! Firstly: I am aware that the term ""magic negro"" is *racial* - I didn't need a Wikipedia page to figure that out. I never indicated that the term wasn't racial in my comment - I said that I had thought people were just using it as a ""nondescript racial jibe of some sort"". As the Wikipedia page (did you even read it?) explains, it is much more than this.

Given the term's historical meaning, using it (as opposed to some other straight-up racial slur) on Obama is actually an indictment of Obama's white supporters, as far as I can see. One can invoke the term ""magic negro"" with Obama to imply that his white supporters actually see him this way - as an individual black man here to help get the white people out of trouble, an exceptional (though still servile) member of the group of Africans rather than a representative of Africans as a whole. The implication here would be that Obama's white supporters are racist too, and are using the ""magic negro"" archetype to get around their (I should say *our* since I myself am a white Obama supporter) innate distrust of black people. Obviously, the term still sounds pretty insulting toward Obama himself, but I've been trying to figure out why or how Newspaper columnists and media pundits have been getting away with the use of the term. Maybe the historical basis for the term is their justification - that they're actually trying to point out hypocrisy in Obama's white supporters.

Is this how the people who have been bandying the term about have meant it? I have no idea. I suspect most people who are using the term are racist idiots who have no idea what it actually apparently means, and are simply using it as a slur.

Secondly: I am aware that all words, aside from those that are made up on the spot (as **Kanin** points out), have some historical basis *of some kind*. Pointing this out is meaningless, unless you assume (and it looks like you did) that I'm an idiot who believes that if a term was used in the past, it is somehow magically acceptable. I do not. You would also have to have completely glossed over the actual meaning of the term, which seems like a stupid thing to do given this comment thread. Next time, try phrasing your post in a less condescending way, since the person you're attempting to school may not be as stupid as you've assumed - especially if you haven't taken the time to actually acquaint yourself with what that person is talking about.","1230798106"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Utter non-sense. If you get busted for drinking and driving, do the bartenders who made it easy to get drinks and the dealerships who made it easy to buy a car get the blame? No. Banks were caught up in a prisoners dilemma of monster proportions and as a collective failed to see where their actions were taking them.

We're not talking about whether or not banks made mistakes in this crisis. Banks definitely did make mistakes, but I was simply stating the *free market* was not to blame for this crisis because our economy is not even close to a free market. It is heavily regulated and we have a central bank that controls the money supply.

&gt;Again, government subsidies and the FM's may have made it easier for banks to make poor business decisions (a necessary condition) but is not a sufficient condition.

Again, I agree that banks made some mistakes. What I was referring to was the free market's blame in this matter, which as stated, the free market is not to blame.

&gt;This ultimately boils down to a large conglomeration of businesses who didn't have the foresight to see how their collective action would play out.

This is definitely true and I whole-heartedly agree with this statement. I am saying that the main reason behind these businesses making such colossal errors is interference with the free market as seen in the Fed's expansion of the money supply, and government regulation of the financial industries. 

The main point I'm trying to get across is this. You cannot take our current economic system with all its regulation and interference from the Federal Reserve, a system far far removed from the free market, and then when our system has a major problem like this latest crisis, blame the free market. While I might not necessarily agree, you can blame the banks, the CDS's, the CEO's or whoever, but the one thing you absolutely cannot blame is the free market because it had no part in this.","1230798426"

Everything was measured around an army that could enforce the Roman mono-culture. In the end the Roman Empire was to large to maintain and homogeneity and crumbled back into the old sub-cultures. Same thing goes for the middle east, South America, Russia, Caucasus and the far-east… 
Empires grow, they create a common culture over the existing sub-cultures, they fall apart and break into feudal territories with variations in language, religion and other cultural traits that would have survived the old empire.
Europe is still mired in its old history with prejudice, old gripes and bad blood among the various ethnicities.

Yes, it may be true that ""... men ... earn money ... for status, and not for consumption."" But that would be because men are being assholes. If it is true that ""...being more aggressive, more ambitious, more authoritative, more psychopathic, less caring of others are 'qualities' that are sought in CEOs.."" then we have to stop doing that. We have to stop seeking and rewarding those qualities.

At the end of this quote, he is making a value judgment based on what he thinks the would ought to be.  The fact is, CEO's get the job because they produce results.  Any deviation in that is due to ignorance of how to gauge one's potential to produce results, or what results you want produced (profit, if you are sane).

The article is filled with moral judgments, ""We *should* pay women just as much because they have babies and that's real hard"".  This sort of statements makes no sense to make on any scientific basis.  This isn't a science article, this is an editorial that mentions scientifically founded facts.  It's high time we learn the difference.

Also, the author keeps comparing us to other animals, he didn't even mention primordial homo sapien society, such as the ones preserved in the aborigines, or the tribes mentioned in the ""Science of Good and Evil"" by Michael Shermer, where he describes the field research of tribal societies; rape and male dominance were the absolute norm.

Like them, you see Palestinians not like people like yourself but like something subhuman you don't even need to consider.  You'll make up and believe any propaganda to that effect.

If anything the Economist article, which is good, proves my points. Did you read the whole article. Your selective quote is not what it's about.

Palestinian is not a race and neither is Jewish. Racist means that you hate some other group not for what they have done but for what they are. Just like anti-Semitism does not mean that you hate all Semitic people.

Have you ever read history? Do you understand that you've been fed propaganda for so long you can't think straight. Like racists in South Africa you can't accept the truth. 

You're a sad person. You know nothing and go here and spread lies. You hate these people you've never met, yet you want them dead and gone more than anything else.

If you had read the article, this is some of what it said. 

""And yet Israel should not be surprised by the torrent of indignation it has aroused from around the world. This is not just because people seldom back the side with the F-16s. In general, a war must pass three tests to be justified. A country must first have exhausted all other means of defending itself. The attack should be proportionate to the objective. And it must stand a reasonable chance of achieving its goal. On all three of these tests Israel is on shakier ground than it cares to admit.

""It is true that Israel has put up with the rockets from Gaza for a long time. But it may have been able to stop the rockets another way. For it is not quite true that Israel’s only demand in respect of Gaza has been for quiet along the border. Israel has also been trying to undermine Hamas by clamping an economic blockade on Gaza, while boosting the economy of the West Bank, where the Palestinians’ more pliant secular movement, Fatah, holds sway. Even during the now-lapsed truce, Israel prevented all but a trickle of humanitarian aid from entering the strip. So although Israel was provoked, Hamas can claim that it was provoked too. If Israel had ended the blockade, Hamas may have renewed the truce. Indeed, on one reading of its motives, Hamas resumed fire to force Israel into a new truce on terms that would include opening the border.

""On proportionality, the numbers speak for themselves—up to a point. After the first three days, some 350 Palestinians had been killed and only four Israelis. Neither common sense nor the laws of war require Israel to deviate from the usual rule, which is to kill as many enemies as you can and avoid casualties on your own side. Hamas was foolish to pick this uneven fight. But of the Palestinian dead, several score were civilians, and many others were policemen rather than combatants. Although both Western armies and their foes have killed far more civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq, Israel’s interest should be to minimise the killing. The Palestinians it is bombing today will be its neighbours for ever.

""This last point speaks to the test of effectiveness. Israel said at first that, much as it would like to topple Hamas, its present operation has the more limited aim of “changing reality” so that Hamas stops firing across the border. But as Israel learnt in Lebanon in 2006, this is far from easy. As with Hizbullah, Hamas’s “resistance” to Israel has made it popular and delivered it to power. It is most unlikely to bend the knee. Like Hizbullah, it will probably prefer to keep on firing no matter how hard it is hit, daring Israel to send its ground forces into a messy street fight in Gaza’s congested cities and refugee camps.""

**Bingo!**

You got it. Early investors got their ""principal"" investments paid back to them as ""earnings"" (at 11%, anyone who had ""invested"" for say 8 years ALREADY got all their money ""refunded"" back to them) -- the problem is they *thought* those were earnings, and they *thought* they still had principal ""invested"" but at some point in time, there was no ""there"" there anymore.

Madoff almost certainly did NOT really ""lose"" the full $50 Billion. What he did was -- over the years -- siphon off a small portion of that (maybe a total of a billion or two? who knows?) to ""pay"" himself, his family, and/or other people in collusion with him -- the rest of it was already paid out to his early investors (who then went and spent it -- or even MORE foolishly ""reinvested it with Madoff again"" -- because they thought it was ""earnings"" rather than a withdrawal of principal.)

""the greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.
The chances, the changes are all yours to make.
The mold of your life is in your hands to break.

The greatest adventure is there if you're bold.
Let go of the moment that life makes you hold.
To measure the meaning can make you delay;
It's time you stop thinkin' and wasting the day.

The man who's a dreamer and never takes leave
Who thinks of a world that is just make-believe
Will never know passion, will never know pain.
Who sits by the window will one day see rain.

The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.
The chances, the changes are all yours to make.

It looks almost the same except smaller. That is were all the nerve endings are and were she gets her orgasm from; She can't feel anything up her vagina for the most part. 

Women, this means if you are having trouble having orgasm during penetrative sex you should think about this and work out the mechanics of stimulating your clit by yourself while he enjoys pounding you. You might want to try some kegels so strengthen those muscles. Look up tantra. This might help both of you.

A small penis can be an advantage. I don't tare my boyfriend's asshole nearly as much as those men who have normal or larger then normal penises. You might find it easier to convince your girlfriend to try anal with you because you have such a small cock.

My penis is so small that I have renamed it a clitoris and renamed my asshole my vagina to go along with that. It's fun and as they say, it's not what you got, it's how you use it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","If anything, I tend to find that blacks are more racist than whites if, for no other reason, than they have a fairly convenient distraction to hide behind (the misconception that calling a black person racist makes the person who made the accusation a racist).

This is almost why you *never* see civil suites brought against hiring managers for firing non-minorities and/or hiring an inordinate number of minorities (in fact, this is unstated corporate policy in some places due to the fact that minorities can usually be hired more cheaply).  My advice to companies is that they *always* document a hiring manager's decision with official organizational correspondence.  That way, when the civil courts wise up and start auditing company hiring practices to document a trend, some minority racist hiring manager's decision process doesn't become the head of HR or the CEO's problem.

My tendency these days is to treat all minorities as though they have a higher prevalence of bias (and this extends well beyond the definition of ""minority"" by skin color or other outward physical characteristic... I also include class, sexual orientation and many other qualifications in my own personal definition of ""minority""... so think twice before you judge me).

They publish as much as they can because it is one of the only metrics used by non-academics to rate academic performance.

Oh and there's no need to ""scare quote"" 'human rights'. Unlike some mythical right to freedom of religion, human rights DO exist. For instance, one of them is freedom FROM others' religions.

Finally, it doesn't matter what fucking idiocy you're talking about. Even as a matter of law, the so-called right to ""freedom of religion"" cannot ever be a right because it is inconsistent self-contradictory self-annihilating gibberish. It is FUCKING NONSENSE. As I already stated.

Just because the law talks about something called an invisible pink unicorns doesn't mean the fuckers exist. Doesn't mean they CAN exist. Even if you get courts and court-idiots to go along with thhe pretense that it does.

Something that can never be universalized CANNOT BE A RIGHT. Because, and you're gonna have to take my word for it here, **THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A RIGHT**. And irrationality, insanity, stupidity, so on and so forth, cannot be universalized. They can only be privileged.

Insane idiots pretending that their privilege to insane idiocy is a right doesn't make it so. All it does is it proves they're insane idiots.

If an inmate wondered aloud ""what is the point of the exercise?"", guards replaced the rocks with shit, beat the living daylights out of the inmate, and made him continue the pointless ritual.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","This person is right on some issues, and severely wrong on many other issues. 

&gt;Deflation, not inflation, will become evident well beyond housing.

The thing is, there is always a period of deflation before more, and bigger inflation, it is the natural flow of savings to spending and then a massive movement to spend once again that pushes the savings rate down and floods the market with cash again. True deflation will continue for a while, but not for long.

&gt;The Dollar will not collapse.

Also wrong, the dollar won't collapse per se, but will see a major decline in it's value due to massive amounts of more borrowing and spending. 

&gt;China will have its first large-scale rumbling of civil unrest as a consequence of collapsing export demand and thus employment.

Ugh, I hate it when people say such stupid things. China has TRILLIONS IN CURRENCY reseveres, they have surpluses, they have money, assets, investments and cash. Their export only decreased by 2-4% while imports decreased by 7%. They are going through a correction, not a collapse, and the fact that the rest of the world is also in worse shape is complete bullshit. Europe has handled itself much better in terms of borrowing money, spending and debt. The only reason why they are in trouble is because of the reaction to America, it is a shock, a crisis due to the weakening US economy, but not because they are in the shitter. It takes time, but it will become apparent that they are in a better shape than we are. ","1230801056"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I believe that you're asking us to compare and contrast morality between secular humanism and nihilism.  I had to go to wikipedia, so I thought I'd include those links.

**[Secular Humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism)**
&gt;Secular humanism is a humanist philosophy that upholds reason, ethics and justice, and specifically rejects the supernatural and the spiritual as the basis of moral reflection and decision-making. Like other types of humanism, secular humanism is a life stance that focuses on the way human beings can lead good, happy and functional lives.

**[Nihilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)**
&gt;Nihilism is a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Nihilists generally assert that objective morality does not exist, so subsequently there is no objective moral value with which to logically prefer one action over another. Nihilists who argue that there is no objective morality may claim that existence has no intrinsic higher meaning or goal. They may also claim that there is no reasonable proof or argument for the existence of a higher ruler or creator, or posit that even if higher rulers or creators exist, humanity has no moral obligation to worship them.

Simply stated, I reject the claim that existence is without value, because I value my life and the lives of those I love.  Whether this has value beyond that which is a human being is irrelevant, as I am and always will be a human.  It is through this perceived reality that I must interact with others regardless of its verity.

With that said, as a humanist, morality is a code of conduct between people, animals, and the environment, that minimizes suffering.  I approach this by balancing Kantian Ethics (the concept of a categorical imperative) with utilitarianism, where one attempts to take action to do the greatest good.  It can simply be described as straight forward principled fairness.

Perhaps you can explain to me more about nihilism.  How does one function if there is no way to logically prefer one action over another?","1230801769"

While the use of the terms genocide and holocaust to describe 55 deaths seems over the top, the pictures appear to be legitimate, non-photoshopped and reflect a grim reality on the ground.

You could still argue about what those pictures mean. Those are all men in their prime. Are they Hamas militants, aka intended targets of Israel, or were they ""in the way"" ?

The text that goes along with the pictures claims that 45 out of 55 victims where civilians. It's hard to trust that figure considering the source, but it's certainly plausible.

Keep in mind that showing the other side still wouldn't really take the edge out, since Hamas is not nearly as good as the Isreali Army at killing people quickly.

For a Christian being an atheist means you are going to hell and you are going to receive the worst possible punishment possible. For them to allow this to be acceptable on the national stage would put them in jeopardy because they'd be seen by their God as condoning this lack of belief. Therefore they will be as irrational as possible about defending these positions. Far more so than people were about race.

The more aggressive the action the more scared they become and likely to escalate the retaliation. I think the only way to reach our goals of separate church and state is to eliminate irrational thought processes. To do that it takes education and gentle persuasion. Don't come off as aggressive, just ask questions that get them thinking. Gradually more and more people will realize the error in their beliefs and will support freedom from religion.

&gt;Kent E. Hovind (born January 15, 1953) is an American Young Earth creationist and conspiracy theorist currently serving time in a federal prison for tax-related crimes. He is famous for creation science seminars that aim to convince listeners to reject modern theories of evolution, geophysics and cosmology in favor of biblical creation. Hovind's views are criticized by the scientific community and some fellow young Earth creationist organizations like Answers in Genesis.

&gt;Hovind established the Creation Science Evangelism ministry in 1989 and, before his incarceration, frequently argued for Young Earth creationism in his talks at private schools and churches, at debates, and on radio and television broadcasts.

&gt;Since January 2007 Hovind has been serving a ten-year term in the Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield in Edgefield, South Carolina, for 58 tax offenses, obstructing federal agents and related charge.

Israel should be careful, they're playing with fire and in this case they got seared pretty badly.

It's already open fact, israel has 5200 children in its prisoners, Israel has imposed an illegal blockade on the Gaza strip, Israel broke the ceasefire agreement on November 4th and provoked hamas into retaliating.

Facts are not on Israels side and the only way they can get any sympathy from people is by exploiting what they don't know and refusing to prove what they know is false. They just ask us to take their word for it.

If we took their word for it we wouldn't know they killed 8 civilians, we would have thought they killed ten members of Hamas.

Talk about biased.

I'm not misleading anyone, the facts are out there: IDF releases video claiming victory over Hamas, Human Rights group investigates and finds no such thing happened. Only justification you have is that it might have all been a setup by Hamas, yet you acnnot prove this. We must take your word that Hamas managed to do what is logistically a very difficult thing to do.

You sound as crazy as those Hammas supporters who claim Mossad is the one firing rockets at Israel from the Gaza strip. Sure, you can believe it yourself but most sane people won't.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;  Ok, I'm not going to argue with your figure, but is it is it not also a weapon of oppression of men?

Interesting question.  On one hand, no. Men aren't targeted for rape because they're men.  They're targeted for rape because there are no women in the prison to be raped instead.

And on the other hand, yes. Definitely.  Because the men who rape and the ones who are their victims is largely decided on how much they comply with the rigid macho sex role....  similar to how boys are called fag or sissy for not complying as children.

And certainly gay men and men who show more fragility are targeting for all types of violence outside of jail as well. (Traditional feminism adds these oppressions to the set of ""sexism"".)

Men's rape is largely a hidden issue, because men are  much less likely to report rape as well.

Back to the prison thing, I'm of the belief that prison rape makes prison ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.  I think it's long overdue that we completely revamp the whole shebang, and start really working on rehabilitation, even from childhood.... We really suck at not helping kids and they grow into adults who hurt people   :-(

By the way, in case that's aimed at me, you might be right that I've not acknowledged his pain....   I'll have to cognate on that. I don't wish to add to men's oppression in any sense. I could try to justify it but I actually trust your thinking pretty well.  

On the other hand, thinking about it, my first response was a bit of empathy for the guy but it quickly turned to the thought that I don't care to get emotionally tied up with some jackasses in the paper.  Fuckers were drunk, who knows what the fuck went on?   

(I don't really like drunks....  I really don't....)

I also know a fair number of assholes (both genders) who believe that they are entitled to sex on demand....   I'm finding that I'm not easily dismissing my first scenario:  he demanded, she reacted at some point.  Her response, if that's what it was, was wildly excessive.  If it wasn't in response, it was simply criminally insane.)

Anyhow, if it's any condolence, I am glad he hit her (hard) in the head, she certainly deserved that. I'm also glad he wasn't charged for it.

This guy likes to give himself tons credit for predicting so many completely obvious things. Anyone paying attention, and not one of the idiots on TV, was predicting the same things even more accurately. Hell, even my record for predictions for 2008 was more accurate than this guys. 

A recession? We were already in one - I don't care what the government numbers or official reports were: everyone paying attention already knew. The *depression* many were calling for was much more accurate (like last years recession wasn't yet recognized the second great depression isn't yet recognized either -  but it's already here). 

No hyperinflation? Unless you have absolutely zero understanding of the idea of a credit crunch you knew there wouldn't be hyper inflation yet. I don't know anyone who was predicting it for 2008, but anyone who did was just being stupid. 

""Government will meddle""? What kind of prediction is that? My prediction for 2009 is the world isn't going to spontaneously combust - anyone wanna take bets?

Housing prices will not turn? Talk about understatement of the year. This guy was sure smart to realize the beginning of a depression, when home values were already ridiculously high, wasn't going to cause housing prices to go up.

This guy obviously put a lot of time and thought into his post and he makes some valid points, but he's pumping himself up way too much. This was flat out annoying to read (the 30 different fonts didn't help). 

&gt;We will see either a Treasury Market selloff or worse, severe instability in the dollar at some point in 2009.

It's funny that he'd make the ""severe instability in the dollar"" argument right before going on to basically suggest you keep all your money in dollars. 

&gt;Now they're calling the dollar's strength a ""Bear market rally.""

No. It wasn't a ""bear market rally"" it was a credit crisis. Common sense will tell you that no credit + falling asset prices = extremely high short term demand for money. It was completely predictable, and very different from an ordinary bear market rally. 

And ""the dollars strength""? Really? [Maybe he was hibernating all last month](http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_dx)? He seems to have completely missed/ignored the whole quantitative easing thing, but that's not even what is really important to this issue.

The important part which everyone on both sides of the argument like to ignore is the DEMAND for money, not just the supply. Forget the supply. Forget interest rates. Forget quantitative easing. Forget printing presses. The supply of dollars is controlled and easily manipulated. The important factor everyone ignores is the *demand* for those dollars. It doesn't matter if interest rates are 30%, or if the money supply shrinks 50%, if no one wants the currency. Short term cash requirements and selling have driven the dollar up - there is absolutely no fundamental reasons for it to be up beyond that. It wont last forever. The real question is will the fall flatten out or cause a scare and start a spiral effect. 

The banks are absolutely not going to lend even less than they are today. They, and everyone else, are hording dollar reserves to the best of their abilities. We already saw and passed that climax in November. These deflationists are late to the game and already missed the trade. 

Anyway I'm tired and going to bed soooo

&lt;/rant&gt;

edit - will the dollar collapse and precious metals prices skyrocket next year, maybe not.. but I wouldn't want to bet all my money that it wont happen! Remember to hedge, if this crisis ends the way it looks like it's going to all of your savings could be completely erased.

This guy claimed the American consumer was in good shape in 2006 (http://musings.denninger.net/archives/113-Is-Americas-Purchasing-Power-REALLY-In-The-Toilet.html) while the subprime crisis was building up BECAUSE the American consumer was not in good shape. They were actually hyper leveraging their well. 
He started writing these gloom and doom articles in 2007, when it was obvious (OK, not obvious to all, but obvious) the trend was down.
I particularly dislike his political views, but he could be still right in economics. However, he got early wind of the down trend and he is a trend follower (note his use moving average crossovers to project future trends).

It is possible from a very conservative point of view to agree with his view of the economy, however, the economy (productivity, industrial output, etc.) has not changed essentially from 2006 to now, and in 2006 he thought the American consumer was better of than in the past. So why start worrying now about the economy? Debt and leverage are a fundamental element of the world economy. So if we forget about ""real money"" and ultra-conservative monetary points of view, the only problem left is how to re-start the leveraging machine.

Obama's economic plan of financing ""road work"" will put money on the American consumer's pocket, which in turn will move into the economic machine. 

Kudos to the guy for catching up wind of the downtrend early on. However, the real alarm bell should have been sound in the summer of 2005 (December 2007 was way down into the problem). Today, he is predicting more of the same as if we were not going to have a new administration within a month!

He was right once because he wrote just one article, it may look like a 100% hit rate, but that discounts the future.

"religion","t5_2qh39","I will note again, I'm using your definition of exist, and your application of object, location, and concept.  Any problems that come from my usage come from one of three things

1.  incomplete definition.  If this is the case, lets explain what is wrong with the definitions, or throw them out and use ones that are more clear.

2.  My misapplication of the definitions in some way, which implies #1 anyway.  If this is the case, you should be able to show me exactly where I am wrong in my usage.  So far you have not done this.

3.  Your misinterpretation of what I'm writing.  If this is the case, I don't know what to say.

&gt; lets use your senses definition and money

Now you add in yet another criteria to use for definition of an object or concept.  It's not just ""Object, Location"", but now it has to be able to be sense with my senses?

When do you stop changing what you mean by the word object?  When do you pick a definition and stick precisely to it?  The three definitions you've included so far are all incomplete because they allow for things you say are objects to be concepts, and things you say are concepts to be objects.

If existence only applies to one item and not the other, you definition needs to distinguish them.

&gt; lets burn the paper, show me the money

OK, both the paper and the money have been destroyed.

&gt; You've destroyed the object upon which both the concepts of paper and money have been applied

Agreed.

&gt; Of course the money won't be there anymore, neither will paper.

Agreed.

So, by your arguments, paper is a concept.  It doesn't exist, since its existence depends on something else existing.

&gt; ok so then lets collapse the economy. the paper is in your hands, show me the money.

So?  Money describes paper as it is used within an economy.  It is a concept that depends on both ""paper"" (which I think you'd agree exists, but is also a concept, since it is merely a description of matter that loses all meaning once that matter is gone) and and on ""economy"" (which is a concept)

[another trick:  money doesn't have to be worth anything to still be called money... money is a bad example to use for a concept]

In any case, I don't understand how this is meant to clear anything up about the differences between a concept and an object.

You are left with the same exact problems I brought up in the other contexts, only you've sprinkled more things and relationships into the mix, further confusing things.

Both money and paper are concepts, but I can point to paper, and it has a location, so it's an object and can exist... but its existence is contingent on other objects... paper is an name attribute assigned to a collection of molecules.

-

Keep it simple.  Get back to basics.

Definition of Point: a location in a space.

What is wrong with that definition? Where are the conflicts?

My mom has a recent Nano (the fat one), and it's a piece of shit! I played with my friends brand new iPod Classic (or the previous generation, I can't remember), and it was retardedly bad.

Now, the iPod Touch and the iPhone are different breeds altogether. Instead of being designed as an iPod, they were designed as an iPhone, which Apple still apparently cares about competing with. The iPods seem to be just Apple resting on their laurels, because they own the market. 

I've never used a Zune, but I'd imagine they are pretty good, better than the recent iPods.","1230804219"

Further research shows that that 65 mpg figure isn't the combined mpg.  The combined mileage is 38.9 mpg.  Once you do the diesel to gasoline conversion, that would come out to 25.93 mpg combined in order to break even on what you pay for gas.  That's not very difficult to come by.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;the objective features of a good have nothing to do with how it is produced. A farmer on poor ground can more laboriously produce less wheat than a farmer on fertile ground.

Just wondering where you saw that. Use-value is a value that satisfies a need 'be it of the stomach or of the mind.' That is not limited to commodities - and is qualitative. Exchange value is the quantitative exchange of use values for other use values. Simple enough.

Value is equal to the amount of labour power required to create a commodity. This does not determine price - that was made clear. It is merely explaining that the individual worth of each commodity can be defined by the amount of labour time invested. That value is also determined by social averages of necessary labour time to produce a commodity etc etc etc.

The theory of exploitation is the exploitation of the labour time given to the employer by the worker. The worker produces his needs, value equal to his subsistence wage within a certain period of time of the working day, the remainder of the time, the value created is going to the employer. Therefore: The employer must exploit the time of the worker, keep value beyond the workers subsistence for himself, and therein create for himself surplus value (profit). It is here that we find the fundamental conflict between worker and employer. The reason why wages are pushed lower by the employer at every opportunity, the reason why the capitalist must revolutionise his ability to produce faster and faster. The reason why the more the worker gains, the less the capitalist has and vice versa.

That is what the marxist theory of Capitalist exploitation is. Its not actually wrong ;).

*Niggardly* (noun: *niggard*) is an adjective meaning ""stingy"" or ""miserly"", perhaps related to the Old norse verb *nigle*. It is cognate with ""niggling"", meaning ""petty"" or ""unimportant"", as in ""the niggling details"".

*Nigger* derives from the Spanish/Portuguese word *negro*, meaning ""black"", and probably also the French *nègre*, which likewise has become a racist insult in mainstream American culture, deriving from *negro* (the ordinary French word for ""black"" being *noir*). Both negro and noir (and therefore also nègre and nigger) ultimately come from *nigrum*, the accusative declension of the Latin word *niger*, meaning ""black"".

[List of Qassam rocket attacks in 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qassam_rocket_attacks_in_Israel_in_2008)

Included:

&gt;About 50 Quassam rockets were fired towards the Negev, one of which struck a parking lot near Sapir Academic College, killing 47-year-old student Ron Yahye[12]. Hamas, the Popular Resistance Committees and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad carried this rocket barrage. In addition, they fired for the first time six Iranian built Grad missiles (also known as Katyushas, which actually refers to the original launcher) at the industrial city of Ashkelon. While only a few people were lightly injured, this longer distance attack on a larger Israeli city had a major psychological effect.

&gt;Also killed, a Palestinian girl: A 13-month-old Gaza girl was killed Friday by flying shrapnel...when a Quassam missile launched from Gaza at Israel fell short and landed near her home.

&gt;On Friday a 48-year-old Jimmy Kdoshim was killed by a mortar shell while working in his garden in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. After the mortar attack, two Israeli air strikes killed five Hamas security men in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officials and Hamas said. Palestinian militants from the Islamist group Hamas, who regularly fire rockets and mortars into Israel from Gaza, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Kfar Aza collective farm in southern Israel.

&gt;Shuli Katz, a 70-year-old resident of Kibbutz Gvaram was killed early Monday evening from a Palestinian Qassam rocket which crashed into the backyard of a residential home in Yesha – a small community belonging to the Eshkol Regional Council.

&gt;A 35-year-old woman was killed and two others wounded Monday evening when a Qassam rocket struck a car in the western Negev town of Sderot. The woman, Shir-El Friedman, was standing next to the car at the time of the strike and was taken to Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon. Hospital spokeswoman Lea Malul said she died on the way to the hospital. According to the IDF, a total of 15 rockets were fired at the area on Monday. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility.

&gt;Hamas fired three mortar shells from Gaza which landed in the Nirlat factory in Kibutz Nir Oz killing Amnon Ronsenberg, a 52-year-old father of three on Thursday. 

Plenty more, and even more critical injuries. And these are not counting any military deaths, strictly deliberate targeting of civilians.

&gt;Whether or not you call it a religion, I would draw a distinction between that type of Buddhism and the blind faith religions like Christianity, Hinduism even(Buddha liked to mock Hindu gods despite later becoming one), Islam, Pure Land Buddhsim etc.


The sect Pure Land is really an amazing and inconceivable buddhist dharma (as Shakyamuni  Buddha himself said)  which even some highly achieved practitioners might not believe in it.. 

From my **superficial** understanding, I think those religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hindu, etc doesn't *really* require blind faiths..  The reason why people perceive them to requires blind faith was that some of their believers have misunderstood/misinterpreted their religions and teachings, and thus believing 'blindly'... IMHO, they don't even require them to believe in the existence of *their* God (actually these religions all refer to the same and one God), instead what they require them is that they be a good person by following *their* teachings and precepts like the 10 commandments for example... and if they do so, they will be saved and go to heaven (that even include unbelievers), it was not their God that save them, it was their own good deeds that save them (the law of karma)... however, if their believers behave badly, then no matter how 'devoted' or 'faithful' one is to their religion, he will go to bad realms (in Hell, Hungry Ghost etc)... and I believe Judaism, islam, christianity, hindu etc could be considered as ONE religion in various manifestations targeting different audiences, cultural background of their particular times and geographical location .. Their common core teaching is for them to go to heaven realms, if they think and act in accordance to those teachings... Or we might see these religions as different doors to the same destination (heaven realm), and buddhism is a little different in this aspect in that ultimately striving to escape the cycle of reincarnation. I could be wrong though.","1230805209"

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt;But adjust for capacity factor:

You are restricting the comparison to construction costs, but adjusting for capacity?  Why not adjust for decommissioning, fuel, operating, and waste costs as well?  Why not compare an onshore wind farm instead of the considerably more expensive offshore ones?  Why compare a country that has a mature nuclear industry to one that is building its first offshore wind farm?  Adjusting only for capacity is a biased skewing of the outcome.

Comparing construction costs alone is meaningless.  We could compare only the construction costs of a coal plant to a hydro dam, but that wouldn't really tell us anything relevant to this discussion since fuel and carbon costs would be important in that context.

Your reference to the RAE study is better, and it suggests that onshore wind is about twice as expensive as nuclear.  It also suggests that: 

* the actual construction costs of nuclear plants are controversial and unknown (plus or minus 25%)

* nuclear fuel cost is a small but increasingly expensive factor

* new wind turbines have an output 30 times what they averaged 30 years ago, which has driven down costs

* economies of scale and further gains in technology are expected decrease the cost of wind 15% in the study horizon, with further decreases in the future

The bottom line of the study as concerns this comparison is that wind is currently more expensive that nuclear, the real costs of nuclear are not entirely known and are increasing, and the estimated costs of wind are expected to continue to drop as more and better wind farms are built.

But even such studies are limited.  All of this depends a great deal on the geography in question.  There are some countries where labor is cheap and environmental laws are lax (Russia) and thus the largest costs of nuclear power (construction) will be much lower than places where labor is very expensive and laws are strict (US).  Similarly, there are places where peak power demands could be alleviated in a very cost effective manner by the addition of wind farms in spots that have heavy winds for much of the year (cities throughout the US midwest).  Thus, in some places nuclear may be the better option for now, whereas in others wind has many clear advantages.","1230805313"

There can't be any constructive dialog until there is recognition that a wrong has been committed.

If you talk to the Palistinians they themselves will tell you that the main rage they have is that their country was sold out from underneath them and that no one seems to recognise this very important fact.

History has precedent here, recently in Canada the PM of the country stood up in the House of Parliament and acknowledged the governments act of forceably moving natives into government run catholic schools...an act to integrate the natives of Canada into our social structure.

It was an abomination of humanity, one that was long over due for mention and recognition.

Despite the fact it lacks in overall merit for what was done to the native population in whole in the acquisition of Canada...the mere acknowledgement of this act was enough to make the native council of Canada recognise that at least there was some attempt to pay restitution for this henious period of anglo saxon christian take over.

We can do the same here. It simply starts with open honest dialogue but my point is that the honesty of the situation isn't even being recognized.

This is why Hamas is pissed to begin with, with many subplots after.

Until we can be honest with them and admit we were assholes then there can't be any start to fixing the issue as a whole.

Until then, there will never be anyone tiring of aggression.

bars are an ok place... but the people there donmt go there regularly enough to make friends... if its love (like boy girl love) you are looking for. then try places in which you can just talkto someone passively. like, the grocery store (it sounds weird but i have heard the produce section is one of the best places from more then one source). but, go where they are. like... college, job, library, anywhere you will be able to meet a person more then once. but thats just it. you have to meet them. not just see them. must a talk to them. the best thing you can do is make jokes. if you feel dumb walking  away you have done something right. why? because you are now in her mind and stuck  out a little bt. next time you meet her, say something else. if you feel she starts to like you, ask her out. -beware of the false- meaning, dont base how you feel off of how she looks. yes it matters but you can trick yourself into thinking the wrong things about hte person if you go that route.

You chastised me not because of what I said or did, but what you felt about other people's activities?  

You let emotion dictate your actions regardless of fact, and later deride others who let emotion dictate theirs...  You're hypocritical in your thinking, and that kind of thinking does the cause harm, effectively moving your personal environmental impact from the positive column over to the negative column with hummer drivers commuting to/from LA.

Every person you turn away because of your broken thinking is doing damage you could have helped stop.

You are personally causing more damage to the world as a result of your thinking.  Good job.

&gt;I really really want people to understand how much of a problem coal is

Then explain it clearly, and in a reasonable context.

&gt;I am extremely surprised at the balance of opinion on things such as this.

I suspect you're misreading the opinions.  

The balance of opinion I'm getting from reading the comments is that coal as it is implemented now is really really bad, and we should do what we can to get the hell away from it.  That's not all that surprising.

There are questions as to whether investing in ""cleaner"" coal is worthwhile.. whether the total net environmental benefit of heading in that direction will do the world better than outright immediate cessation of all coal use [especially when you know that ain't gonna happen].

That some folks are willing to talk about it doesn't mean they actually want coal to be used forever in any form.  Some folks are willing to talk nuclear.  Some folks wanted to spend more on wind/solar but think the economy is going to cause some research to drop off for awhile, so there needs to be a practical analysis of what is more likely to do more good over certain periods of time.  (since spreading resources to thin means no improvements get made)

If we can make one proposal that will have a measurably positive impact on the environment, and another proposal that will have no impact whatsoever, which option should we choose?

Should we let our own dogma override that?  Clearly not.  You personal feelings don't matter the slightest bit when it comes to the environmental discussion.

&gt; I really really want people to understand how much of a problem coal is

Then why chastise me when I call attention to the fact that someone is taking an alternative source of energy off the table for no reason whatsoever?

You should be calling for the same clarification I did.  Why was nuclear removed with no reason stated.

If we can cut total coal usage by 80% in 10 years, why is that a bad thing to want to talk about?","1230805884"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Great article, Dbzer0. Though I do disagree with one point you made:

&gt;A feudal peasant population is incompatible with Communism.

I disagree. And so does Marx. Marx theorised that it may be possible for feudal nations to skip Capitalism and move on to Socialism instead - as both require Industrial advancement. He theorised that provided industry could enter these places quickly, Socialism could exist in a place where Peasants were the majority.

In regards to China's peasantry - the Chinese peasantry were not an issue until the GMD began to rally them up in opposition to the emerging working class and the CCP. Before then, the Peasants participated in the 1925 revolt just as much as the working class did.

In regards to Russia's peasantry - you know the backward state of Russia, it was not that the Peasants were incompatable, it was that there was a one way street of trade i.e. the Communist Party was forced to requisition produce from the peasants without return - otherwise people in cities like Petrograd would starve to death. It was this one sided non-exchange that lead them to rebel - I wouldn't say that made them incompatable.

Also, on this:

&gt;a benevolent dictator at the top

I don't think that is the right choice of words, it might confuse a lot of people. You cannot be a dictator if you are able to have your position revoked at the leisure of those you serve. What you are is merely a figure head, a representation of the state - in the event of Socialism - the workers state. Even so, the Russian Communist Party prior to Stalin did not have one person as a figure head. There were allocated positions such as General Secretary (which Stalin occupied for a time) and People's Commisar (Trotsky) - but neither were more powerful or of higher status than the other. They were merely organisational positions - the balance of these positions however was progressively being tipped by Stalin, who rather sneakily began to centralise power in his own positions and mount nationalist politics in other Communist Parties with his collaborators (which Lenin sought quickly to squash.)

So yeah, I don't think that correctly describes the workers state in russia etc.

It was also the reason that Lenin was not able to successfully end Stalin's rise. Yes, Stalin had to wait for Lenin to die, and as Trotsky comments in his work on Lenin's Last Testament, it was fairly obvious that Stalin was merely biding time. It is because Lenin had to appeal to the whole of the Russian Congress that nothing more could be done - and Stalin, along with many other members of the Congress (most of whom did not see Stalin the way Lenin did - nor recognised what he was trying to achieve) were able to successfully convince the rest that Lenin was merely derranged after his stroke. That he was an ill man and was going a little loopy.

Goes to show, democracy goes both ways. Perhaps the outcome would have been different if Lenin and the Bolshevik (Communist) Party had agreed to remove Stalin and to increase the numbers in head of the party to 100.","1230806176"

When UN decided to split the British Palestinian mandate into Israel/Palestine in 1947, and British troops withdrew, the mandate was immediately invaded by Jordan, Egypt, etc. The war followed, when dust settled, parts of Palestine were annexed by Israel and parts were annexed by Jordan.

&gt;because the are bullies and they had the backing of an immoral government

And you are aware of course, that arab countries had extensive USSR backing? So I am not sure what's your point. That's apart from the fact that Arab countries have 20x population of Israel.


I donot understand how a sane person with the knowledge of basic facts of modern Middle East history may take such an one-sided view.


PS. and don't bother to bring counter-facts: I'm quite aware of Palestinian suffering: My point is it's NOT ""Israel is bad, palestinians are good"" kind of situation. But rather, ""We have had 60 years of violence, what do we do now""...","1230806389"

You really are applying a lot of judgements to me here, and I can wholeheartedly agree with pretty much every single think you've said.

Nuclear has a stigma, it is expensive, it takes a very long time to be built. Regulations and red tape make it very difficult to even begin. It takes huge investment which is recouped over decades. Uranium is finite but waste products can be reprocessed.

Coal is overwhelmingly #1 for electricity generation, especially in China now.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Actually, the picture appears to be legitimate.

However, **your attempt at debunking is a complete failure.**

The methodology you're trying to employ to ""prove"" the article is ""fake"" has no validity. 

*You can't attempt to verify whether or not a **print article** was actually published based on whether or not that article is posted on the website.*

News websites frequently (usually every few years) go through site updates and restructuring, after which old articles and old links are often no longer available. Most of the time, the link format and structure for the site is completely changed in the process, and old articles are either completely removed, or placed behind a pay-to-access archive.

Thus, any attempt to ""prove"" that this 4 &amp; 1/2 year old article is fake -- based purely on the article's unavailability on the website -- is utterly and inherently flawed.

Furthermore, in following your own suggestion to Google search the first line [""This is what happened to a Palestinian child who joined teenagers throwing stones at Israeli border police""](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22This+is+what+happened+to+a+Palestinian+child+who+joined+teenagers+throwing+stones+at+Israeli+border+police%22&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0), the search result **links directly to several newspaper archive services which verify that the article is in fact legitimate:**

[Encyclopedia.com](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-115890185.html)


[Highbeam.com](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115890185.html)


[Bookrags.com](http://www.bookrags.com/highbeam/the-day-israel-used-a-boy-aged-13-as-a-20040423-1-hb/)

Thus, not only is your methodology flawed, but your own suggested ""evidence"" disproves your point in any case. How you managed to ignore such search results in the process is beyond comprehension.

Finally, on the issue of Israeli use of Palestinian human shields, one can find several [reports](http://www.btselem.org/english/Human_Shields/Index.asp) from B'Tselem (Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories):


[Nov. 14, 2002: B'Tselem Report - ""Human Shield""](http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20021114.asp)

[March 8, 2007: Israeli soldiers use two Palestinian minors as human shields](http://www.btselem.org/english/human_shields/20070225_human_shields_in_nablus.asp)


[Human Rights Watch](http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/03/15/israel-stop-forcing-civilians-assist-military-operations) has also condemned Israel's use of the practice.

You're absolutely right, they left eviction notices! All they need to do is put up an eviction notice for Gaza now and it would all be better.

You pay for the development of the firmware once and sell the product millions of times. 

Moreover, you have control of the hardware too! This drastically reduces the complexity of the code you need to write.

Doing the software right would have cost more but you get the benefits over many iterations of the product.

This bug has probably cost Microsoft _more_ than the cost of investing in the software already. Yesterday, many thousands of people returned their 30GB Zunes. 

How much will that have cost Microsoft in comparison to doing the code right in the first place?

Again and again I see it proved to me that if you don't pay for quality now you'll pay for it later but with extra interest.

We can't imagine a commercial vendor adopting the same software development techniques of NASA. However, for the Zune there is no reason why they couldn't and the product would probably be better for it.

You see, the zionist will frequently torture, such as performing sonic booms over Palestinian territory, and when the Palestinians get fed up and retaliate, for example, by shooting rockets that typically miss, the zionist propaganda will kick in at this point (obviously omitting the mentioning of sonic booms) and say, ""Look, they're terrorists!"". Another example is the zionist will frequently cut off water or food to the Palestinian ghettos, and because the Palestinians are desperate, will wander around the streets in search of food at night. When they do, the Israelis will shoot them and say they're terrorists placing explosives. When the Palestinians retaliate, again with rockets, the zionist propaganda will kick in and flood western media with ""Look! They're terrorists!""

Whoever does it, IMHO, shows a rather cynical side of themselves that they would release a product of which they say that it can't be counted on to do what the makers designed it for. What is that saying about the way these products are designed?

Have you ever heard a master craftsman say that his table was not fit to put things on? Do you see car manufacturers tell their customers their products are not fit to be used for driving? Do you see glass makers tell their customers they shouldn't count on the bottles they make to be fit to carry water in?

At the same time software makers tell us their products are not fit for their purpose [why bother nagging to us about them in the first place]. They can cost outrageous amounts of money, although they're not fit for the purpose. They very likely contain intellectual property that the manufacturer will protect in court with religious zeal, but they won't guarantee that it will do what they themselves say that it will do. You can't even sell your copy to someone else [EULA depending] because that would somehow constitute theft or infringement, when you can sell your car worth multiple times the cost of some software to your neighbour as easy as buying a loaf of bread.

It is beyond me why software companies who put these clauses into their EULA would even remotely expect their customers to respect this kind of agreement when they absolve themselves from any damages [$5 USD, are you kidding me?], make a product they don't value enough to even dare make the claim that it will do what they're selling it for and that's more often than not full of bugs and vulnerabilities.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Don't be stupid. Who in their right mind would send the launcher to stock up on rockets in a monitored urban position and then back into firing position, knowing full well that there are drones in the air?

You're right, Hamas certainly would not risk military operations out in the open knowing there are drones in the air, especially in an area they know is monitored by the IDF.

However a civilian who is trying to get his property to a safe location wouldn't think that he would be targetted by the IDF.

&gt;No other country is so ignored by international laws and faces fourteen year old suicide bombers.

You make it sound like Hamas is the only organization which uses child soldiers.  Besides, the children who are put in prison tend to be accused of committing petty crimes like throwing rocks at Israeli security forces (see the video at the link).

Finally, would it be too much to ask not to try them in a military tribunal? There is nothing wrong with detaining children if there is cause for suspicioun, however there is something incredibly wrong about putting them through an adult prison system.

So all you're doing is justifying the reason why Israel has the right to break international law not how it isn't.","1230809122"

I agree, the entire program is ""ugh"" - I had to get most of working through trial and error, since some syntax works and some doesn't. ;-)  It's a picture of one starting point of SWYM (and of my engine), and, like the hero at the start of a journey, the hero has *got* to have defects, or there's no character arc.  The hero has nowhere to grow.  So it's a *good* thing. :-)

Regarding `[ each(b( each(a( it )) )) ]` the inner `each` is necessary, isn't it?  I was really hoping that functions would automatically and *universally* return lists; and have list arguments.  This is how I interpreted your philosophy, which seems really cool to  me.  If you want a single argument, it's a list of length one... and everything automatically processes it as a list of one - so it *seems* like one argument... until you need many, and it automatically adjusts.  That's really cool and impressive to me.

Originally, I just wrote `b(a(it))` - but had to keep adding stuff til it worked.  I added the outer `[ each` for consistency across all the functions, but b already returns a list, so it isn't needed (for that reason as well as yours).

How about every argument and return value being a list?  (some trickiness if you really want to return a list of one list - might need some escape syntax). It would make things a lot simpler, and the coolness of your approach would really shines through (IMHO).  I like ""everything is a list"", but I'm sure it will have problems.

---

*EDIT*

Nope, doesn't work.  Can you show me another version of `[ each(b( each(a( it )) )) ]` that gives the same result?

I think it's because `b` can return a list of lists, and they need to be flattened (with `each`), then made into one list.  (try editing out the outer `each`, and see the result).  The list of lists comes about because `b` is called several times (forming a list of results), and the result of each call can itself be a list.

Wrong. Hamas is covering up the launch site until the last moment and then runs for their lives as soon as the launch is over. They literally have seconds to get away before IDF responds. If they gave any advance indication of the next launch site or the launcher, they would not be able to fire *any* rockets, because IDF would crush them while they're still boarding the car.

The bulk of the Bible is an accounting of events in different writing styles and a couple of prophetic books as well. I don't think that most Christian bible scholars would tell you the Bible was written by God though it was certainly inspired by God.

This argument would be accurate no matter how you approach the Bible, historically, religiously, as an atheist or literarily.

The concept of God writing the Bible is a relatively new one that seems to have more basis in pretending parts of the past didn't exist or that a brand new interpretation is needed a la most protestant groups. Though divine inspiration would certainly be a common theme especially when using varying definitions of *inspire* as appropriate.

Israeli organizations routinely provide aid to Palestinians.  Remember that Israel is officially at war against Hamas, not the Palestinian people (they are for example not at war against the Fatah led Palestinian government in the West Bank).

Palestinian civilian casualties are seen as unfortunate (albeit not particularly moving) collateral damage in the war against Hamas.  They are not and have never been the target.

The IDF actively tries to minimize civilian casualties (also because it is bad PR), it's just not that high on their list of priorities.","1230809824"

Of course, there are multiple sides to this coin as well. It is true that American military dominance is necesarry to contain nuclear powers on the Asian main-land, but this is not the main focus of the US military policy.
The burden the US has to carry is only a fraction of the burden it chooses to carry. 

The criticism towards US policy concerns those cases where the need for military action (whether offensive or defensive) is not very clear. Terrorism is the primary example. The primitive reaction that satisfies our hormones is to strike back, but in reality there is hardly anything a soldier can do to decrease this threat. Yet there is quite a lot active diplomacy and public relations (e.g. charity) could achieve in this case. In many ways it is barbaric to choose military action when that is not the best option. The 'liberal' view expressed by most reddit users is simply to resist the barbarism and make the right choice.

This should not be confused with the European view. Due to their fortunate lack of a military burden their policy and mainstream view aligns with the liberal view. However, given the opportunity (military power) they would be equally barbaric. There are no differences in morality between populations. ","1230810121"

To suggest that the study may be invalid because nutrition is ""complex and influenced by many variables"" is contrary to exactly what double blinded randomized trials are designed to control for.

The author of the media item, Sherry Baker, seems mostly upset at the media reporting of the papers rather than the actual results of the papers themselves.

Unfortunately her conclusion that the studies are inconclusive is somewhat incorrect unless she is referring to the stated possibility that vitamin E causes cancer and selenium causes diabetes, where, as she says, the results were not statistically significant. This is certainly where more studies need to be done. The study suggest that there is a link which needs to be investigated. Saying these supplements are safe is completely and horridly the wrong thing to do, as there is evidence that suggests there is a link.

The quote from a Dr Gann is simply ludicrous; ""give up the notion of placebo controls"" is equivalent to ""give up the search for truth"".

For me, a pun usually involves a homonym of some sort. *negro* and *niggard* are not homonyms, you have to make two steps, from negro to nigger and then from nigger to niggard. Has the original post involved the word nigger, using the word niggard would be a little more like a pun.

Also, a pun relies on being unexpected. In this case, the relationship between the words nigger and niggard is not unexpected, it is routinely confused. So for me, it is not funny to substitute one for the other because it isn't particularly unexpected.

However, if it made you laugh that's good. Just because it didn't make me laugh doesn't mean it isn't funny.

But yeah, I understand it is meant as a pun. In fact, I used to say something like it. Some of my ancestors are Scottish, some African. So I used to say things like _I can't decide whether I'm Scots or niggardly, but either way I'm not paying $1,500 for a MacBook._ It wasn't that funny, especially considering I didn't know that niggardly had nothing to do with nigger.","1230811165"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; you think renters only sue landlords for racial discrimination?

Of course not.  Nobody made a racial distinction between lawsuits of other types:  It might be actually racist to accuse blacks of being more likely to bring frivolous lawsuits in general.  But nobody said that.  It's fairly clear the first poster was talking about racial discrimination lawsuits.

Who is more likely to sue a white landlord for racial discrimination?  A white tenant, or a black tenant?  Obviously the black tenant.  Can you honestly disagree?

Therefore, if the following statement is true:

&gt; ""it's NOT more likely for a white landlord to be sued by black tenants""
(which you apparently agree with, ding ding ding)

Then it must mean that it's more likely for the white tenant to sue for something ELSE (other than racial discrimination, obviously).  To balance out, see?  If blacks are more likely to sue for discrimination, yet not any more likely to sue IN GENERAL, then white tenants MUST be more likely to sue for... I dunno... anything else.

But that's fairly absurd.  I can't imagine a type of lawsuit that would be more likely coming from white tenants.  It is, however, very easy to imagine a racial discrimination lawsuit coming from a black tenant-- making a pragmatic distinction between races entirely reasonable, at least when talking about the likelihood of a lawsuit.","1230811228"

And so the question I have is this, ""why on earth would a handful of you downmod this?""  

I mean, do you object to a citizen thinking this whole thing through, then publishing his thoughts &amp; reasoning?  Or do you downmod this because you accept the Israeli government's explanation for what it's doing in Gaza as literally the truth (and the whole truth)?

None of you who have downmodded the author's explanation, or have simply downmodded the fact that it has been published at all, have bothered to even venture a word of explanation so far.  Is that because you are simply using the reddit downmod in an effort to conceal this man's writing, or to attempt to censor his writing?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","On October 3, 2001, I.A.P. News reported that according to Israel Radio (in Hebrew) Kol Yisrael an acrimonious argument erupted during the Israeli cabinet weekly session last week between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his foreign Minister Shimon Peres.  Peres  warned Sharon that refusing to heed incessant American requests for a cease-fire with the Palestinians would endanger Israeli interests and ""turn the US against us.  ""Sharon reportedly yelled at Peres, saying ""don't worry about American pressure, we the Jewish people control America.""

""The Israelis control the policy in the congress and the senate."" -- Senator Fullbright, Chair of Senate Foreign Relations Committee:  10/07/1973 on CBS' ""Face the Nation"".

""I am aware how almost impossible it is in this country to carry out a foreign policy [in the Middle East] not approved by the Jews..... terrific control the Jews have over the news media and the barrage the Jews have built up on congressmen .... I am very much concerned over the fact that the Jewish influence here is completely dominating the scene and making it almost impossible to get congress to do anything they don't approve of. The Israeli embassy is practically dictating to the congress through influential Jewish people in the country"" -----Sec. of State John Foster Dulles  quoted on p.99 of *Fallen Pillars* by Donald Neff

The long history of bipartisan Congressional support for Israel led former Secretary of State James Baker to call the Congress ""The Little Knesset"" after Israel's Knesset (parliament) in Jerusalem.    Congress's embarrassing and unpatriotic display of allegiance to a foreign country that is dependent on American largesse and support is the unknown scandal to the American people.  With the media's strong, biased and sympathetic portrayal of Israel while simultaneously denying any opposing view of Israel or human pictures and stories of the endless suffering of Palestinians, its no wonder that we the American people are so unaware of the true face of Israel.  Thus shockingly but not surprisingly only 4 % of the American people are aware of Israel's 34 year brutal military occupation of the Palestinian people.

http://www.mediamonitors.net/khodr49.html

And even if I liked Israel, as I used to, it would still be wrong and dangerous for them to have the control of the media and the US that they do.

What do you suppose they trade for it. They are allowed to control the media and government when it comes to Israel and in exchange they let the plutocracy control the media about other things.","1230811989"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'd say that Haskell is the most orthogonal usable language around. Its feature set doesn't include things like iteration and variables which are staples in most other programming cultures, and which are available in all other mainstream languages. The reason for this is that Haskell was conceived as a lazy language to replace all other academic lazy languags around in the 80's, and laziness implies purity. Haskell was the only language that tried to tackle making a pure language work in the real world head on, instead of making compromises (which is all too easy if you're working on a strict language).

And now, 20 years later, it turns out purity is jolly convenient when the complexity of software is rising. It automatically isolates large parts of your programs in domains that are typechecked and act predictably only based on the inputs, no internal state. It's a testers dream.

Basically, the reason Haskell is so popular is that it's the only language in a niche which is looking more and more attractive as new ways of handling the increasing complexity of software is needed. ","1230812109"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Which is exactly what Hamas did at the Rafah crossing. Yes?

While I certainly don't want to defend Hamas it appears the Rafah crossing was closed off by Israeli mandate after hamas took control because Israel does not recognize Hamas while the open Rafah crossing was a negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian authority.

also 
from B'Tselem:

&gt;Also, Israel could close the crossing down by preventing the EU monitors from getting to the crossing, given that the agreement stipulated the crossing would not be opened in the absence of the monitors. When Israel informed the monitors of a security warning that necessitated closing of the crossing, the monitors did not take their positions at the crossing and it remained closed. Since the abduction of Cpl. Shalit, Israel has used this method to prevent orderly movement at the crossing. In doing so, it imposes an almost total siege on the Gaza Strip, with nobody entering or leaving.

[source](http://www.btselem.org/English/Gaza_Strip/Rafah_Crossing.asp)


I wouldn't put it past hamas, if the Palestinians aren't feeling desperate enough to give Hamas their support then hamas would probably find a way to create that desperation. 

I just don't think they're all that capable of creating the desperation and Israel plays a significant role in helping hamas in this regard.","1230812563"

No, sorry, that's bull. You're offended by violence but you don't want people to see it? There's no need to censor anything because no one is forcing you to watch. I wish IDF released more videos to show the world that the war isn't pretty.

Killing needs to be documented. This is the documentation.

&gt; When I first saw the video I thought 'yeah Hamas loading rockets onto truck', and I'm really cynical about anything that comes out of the IDF.

IDF did some stupid and outrageous things in the past, but that's not a reason to immediately assume that there's a blatant fabrication published on the official IDF PR channel.

In the end, what is important is the philosophic life and that is just as rare in the academy as it is in the rest of the world, contrary to what one might expect. The current university system is bad for cultivating a philosophic view of the world because, past the undergraduate level especially, the necessities of making a career in the specialist environment of higher education takes hold of every breathing moment.  This way of living doesn't make the philosophic life impossible, but it does put up significant barriers against it, so it really isn't a place where one goes to learn how to love wisdom, but usually a place where you can go to learn how to position yourself in a language game that serves as the representative of philosophy in the university environment. It's all *dianoesis* and no *noesis*; there's no room for that when there are promotions to be sought and research grants to be applied for.

So do an undergrad in philosophy, learn what other philosophers have said. No one said that you need to teach in a university to lead a philosophic life. But you don't necessarily need to study philosophy in a university either — all you need is access to the books, and maybe not even that. 

It is good to have people to talk to about these things, and that is where the undergrad experience can really shine in comparison to other contexts where one might want to talk about philosophy. Everyone has the time, and the number of people who have an agenda to push in discussion is radically lower than in either the academy proper or in the outside world. In the end, all you really need are one or two ""philosophic"" friends if you want to lead a philosophic life.

If you want to be known as a ""philosopher"" and publish monumental works of the spirit or incisive statements of not quite verifiable truth leading the world of Science into new realms, that's another matter all together.

Of course a fuller story can be found elsewhere , this suggests the man was suffering some delusion and not on a religious rampage.

The essential problem that we face now is we consume more than we produce. So, if we can increase production and lower consumption we will be alright. Fortunately, the current market climate makes all of this possible. 

Government needs to understand this and make every concession possible for small businesses. This is what is going to generate the amount of jobs and spur the innovation that we are lacking.

 And now, more than ever, we need to start making goods that create demand across the world. Fuck trade agreements, we need to be competitive. This means relaxing much of the antitrust and patent laws over the next few years to help lessen our innovation gap. Essentially, our entire market system needs to be overhauled to optimize innovation. 

However, I do agree that the plan to stimulate the economy through infrastructure is a mistake. If the end goal is to heal capitalism then we need to be capitalist. I just don't see how spending billions on roads is going to do this. If they really want to help, they need to fund infrastructure projects that will assist in innovation. Or better yet, fund research that will help us make products cheaper and better and that help people consume less.         ","1230813479"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;I disagree. And so does Marx. Marx theorised that it may be possible for feudal nations to skip Capitalism and move on to Socialism[...]

I don't know. I think the correlation in this case is pretty damning. I think the biggest problem was not simply that they could not rile up the peasants but rather that the peasants, illiterate and outside of the working conditions which make on a socialist, did not really understand what they were fighting for. That is why in the Russian Revolution they mostly supported Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks who kept betraying them at every turn. So once the correct situation occurs, such peasants are easy to convert to the counter-revolution with the correct rhetoric.

I believe that a majority of proletariat is required because such proletariat, by the needs of capitalism, requires literate and organised forces. 

In any case, this is a bit irrelevant now as there's no more feudal nations left at this point.

&gt;I don't think that is the right choice of words, it might confuse a lot of people

Ah ah, in this case I am indeed talking about a benevolent dictator. But one who's power is limited in another way as I explain.

I hope you are kidding. I find Haskell very interesting, but the syntax makes me want to cry. It seems designed for people with a brevity fetish who enjoy reading mathematical formulas.

Haskell will **never** get the traction of the currently big mainstream languages with a syntax like that, simply because it alienates most developers. 

The switch to a pure language is mind-bending enough for most people.

Now, compared to many other functional languages it may be fairly readable, but that says more about other functional languages than Haskell.

showing the overwhelming material advantages held by the Israelis. 

Given the forces and armaments at the command of the Israelis, seems to me that firing rockets at them and expecting to continue this ad infinitum is the act of an extremely stupid group of people. Proportionality? What is this - some kind of childish game with someone shouting ""That's not fair?"".  

Let's take an example: suppose I started firing home-made rockets at my neighbour. The state would step in with overwhelming force and almost certainly shoot me dead in the process. Whatever, I could expect to be crushed - and I would be.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The problem with append is that it has to traverse its first argument: append(x,y) first copies x and puts y at the end of the copy. This is a big problem if you're repeatedly appending:

    xy = append(x,y)
    append(xy,z)

This first copies x and puts y at the end of x. Then it copies xy, thus copying the copied x again. This is something we want to avoid in rnormal.

Your rnormal isn't complete, because you have to deal with leaves too:

	def rnormal(node):
	  if(node is a leaf) return cons(node.value, nil);
	  else(node is a branch) return rnormal(node.left) ++ rnormal(node.right);
  
Note that cons(node.value,nil) constructs a list containing one element: node.value.
  
Now suppose we wanted to compute the rnormal of a tree and append a list at the end. This is what rnormal_append does:

	def rnormal_append(node, list):
	  return rnormal(node) ++ list; 

It just performs rnormal on the node and appends the list at the end. 
    
Note that `rnormal_append(a_node, nil) = rnormal(a_node)`, because appending nil does nothing.

This rnormal_append is inefficient because append has to copy the entire rnormal(node). Can we write a more efficient version? Here's how you can do that:
 
	def rnormal_append(node, list):
	  if(node is a leaf) return cons(node.value, list);
	  else(node is a branch) return rnormal(node.left) ++ rnormal_append(node.right, list);
  
If the node is a leaf then it's simple: we just cons the value of the node in front of the list. If the node is a branch then we pass the list down the right branch of the tree (to make sure that the list is appended at the end).

Now we can make anything that looks like this:

	rnormal(x) ++ y

More efficient by doing this:

	rnormal_append(x,y) // avoids copying rnormal(x)

Do you see rnormal(x) ++ y anywhere in our code? Yes:

	rnormal(node.left) ++ rnormal_append(node.right,list);

So we can transform that into:

	rnormal_append(node.left, rnormal_append(node.right, list))

This is the final algorithm:

	def rnormal_append(node, list):
	  if(node is a leaf) return cons(node.value, list);
	  else(node is a branch) return rnormal_append(node.left, rnormal_append(node.right, list));","1230815262"

"programming","t5_2fwo","If you have been programming in Python long enough, you might notice several shortcomings of Python (or rather any similar imperative programming language in general):

* Partial support for lazy evaluation: why does `a and b and c` not evaluate `b` and `c` until each predecessor is checked and proven true, but not the case with `all([a, b, c])`?
* Distinction between mutable and immutable objects: why are some types immutable (like tuples and strings), but all others are not? The sooner you learn to appreciate the power of object-orientation in Python, the sooner you realize that the existense of immutable objects is awkward. Call it handy for performance, but to me it's butt-ugly.
* Variable assignments/definitions are not unified. Special constructs that introduces new variables in the local scope such as `def`, `class` and `for` do not make use of the assignment operator `=`. That makes it hard to keep track of assigned variables.
* Distinction between functions and methods. Again this is my argument of the awkwardness of OOP in Python. Having `lst.sort` and `sorted(lst)` is sort of (no pun intended) awkward and ugly. Why would someone want to sort a list (and modify it) and not return a new one to be combined in a large expression?
* Distinction between statements and expressions. You would realize statements are big one-liner killers in Python. Statements (and, as per argument above, methods which return nothing) forces you to write even some simple instructions in more than one line.

I was once a Python maniac. But the immense popularity of Haskell in Reddit convinced me to learn it. The thing is really hard to grasp, but after a while, the trade-off is really worth it. Never before I've seen a language so beautiful and so well-made. Coming from a Python background, Haskell convinced me that:

* Purity is good.
* Lazy evaluation is good.
* Static typing is good (something that C failed to teach).
* Object-oriented programming is not that good after all.

But where did your data come from? Is it global or not? What does this ""University of Alabama at Huntsville temperature data set"" measure? It sounds like something that the well known denier Roy Spencer would come up with. Roy has been known to produce global temperature data that really was only a sample of 20 degrees either side of the equator.

You might want to look at these

http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/Image:Short_Instrumental_Temperature_Record_png

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Satellite_Temperatures.png

The second link shows that 1983 was quite a nicely cherry picked maximum for you to work from. Was that on purpose or purely chance? The choosing of that point comes across as purposely deceptive.

If you are getting your data from here (or similar)

http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/public/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.2

Then I think you have even left out the complete data for 1983, which has a nice little drop at the start and would have made the graph a lot less flat. That's really naughty! No wonder you didn't want to show your source.

Given the CO2 levels in 1983 were 341ppm and in 2008 were 384ppm the expected rise in temperature is approximated to be 3 x ln (384 / 341) which is 0.36 degrees Celsius.

http://www.carbonify.com/carbon-dioxide-levels.htm

Even given that I am using the UAH data and there is no factoring of solar activity or el nino or any other temperature effect we get 0.02C rise from your extra ordinarily cherry picked data from this data set. If we take all of 1983 into account we get a 0.21C rise. Not quite 0.36C, but as I am somewhat sure you understand, carbon dioxide is definitely not the driving factor in temperature - as your chart shows: the temperature goes up and down.

I might be making some wrong assumptions but unless you quote sources I have to go with what I can get.

Applying a line of best fit I get an increase of over 0.4C for the period using the data, which is a little bit more than what the IPCC carbon model predicts.

&gt;me:
&gt;all these are *contributing factors* in the decline and degradation of society as a whole. you: 
&gt;&gt;You need to stop blaming homosexuality as some sort of ""megasource"" of problems and face up to the fact that there are other factors at play. check out what they teach the [Philippines](http://www1.prolife.org.ph/page/homosexuality3) about homosexuality. I see both sides of the coin, but if I had to choose whether a little boy can use the toilet next to my little girl in school, I would have to vote against. you: 
&gt;&gt;You obviously feel that your own personal vindications are somehow valid above others. You're a pompous fuck who needs his fat nose punched back into reality. 
&gt;Is this what you gays teach your kids? Is this *your* definition of progress? since youre such a hard core believer in equality, why do you threaten the use of violence when someone doesnt agree with you? good luck on your ventures, happy new year.

You're still wrong.  You claim that homosexuality is contributing to the downfall of society, yet there is no evidence of that, proving that somehow people who admit they are gay leads to the degradation of our politicians, our laws, or morals, etc.  And the reason you haven't quoted anything to back your statements regarding this, proves you quite possibly know you're wrong and are too stubborn to admit it.  Religion doesn't not equate to the levels of morality in a society, as there's plenty of documentation of religions doing quite the opposite of what they preach.  Don't believe me?  Go read up on Google...

And I believe in equality for all, and freedom for all.  I've stated that several times.  You on the other hand are accusing homosexuals to the decline of society like some ignorant cowardly fuck, and you act like a pompous know-it-all.  So yes, you deserve to be smacked around into reality, because you're clinging to the idea that religious ideals and sticking to them like glue is the only way a society can survive, and there is no proof of that correlation being true.  Plus, there are a good number of religious institutions, leaders, and representatives that act quite the opposite of religion, and this has been documented throughout history.  Were Catholic priests supposed to molest children?  Nope.  It's just the fact that more of the ""hidden sins"" of people are becoming more and more open, and less and less easy to hide away.  

And what about our global leaders, declaring war and asking for assistance from their deity?  Is that not hypocritical?  And this is the way war has pretty always been waged.  So again, you're wrong in thinking that somehow straying from religious morals is causing the global problems we're facing today.  In fact, it's quite obvious that religions institutions help promote these problems.  Why, just look at the religious-backed fight between Jews and Muslims...

You're wrong, and Happy New Year, hopefully one of your resolutions is not to come off like an ignorant hypocrite who has to argue circles regarding things.  You need to learn that you can't blame people's sexuality for the problems we face, period.  A lady in San Francisco deciding to be gay has absolutely nothing to do with President Bush deciding to abuse policy to wage war.  Learn a little, live a lot, listen to everything.  Our personal viewpoints and opinions are all different, but that doesn't change the fact of how we should handle things.

I dont really rememeber exactly how she interpreted the rules, but imagine the least tetris-like game, and lets use that for the sake of argument. So she asked for confirmation 'am i right?'.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","There is no contradiction here (assuming the existence of portals). Consider:  
The two portals must be exactly the same distance apart as the beam is long. We know this because the two ends of the beam meet precisely, so they can be welded together. Let's say that the beam was originally 1 metre long, and the portals are exactly 1 metre apart.  
When you weld the two ends together you still have a beam of metal which is *exactly* 1 metre long in our universe, so no change there (since you started with a beam of metal exactly 1m long).  If one portal disappears (is redeployed somewhere else) then the beam will presumably be cut at that point, and we'll still have a beam exactly 1m long to play with, just with a weld halfway along it.  
If you want to think of it another way: imagine that you could weld the two ends together in a completely invisible fashion so that the weld wasn't at all evident. Now, if you look at the case shown in the cartoon, the weld is halfway up, but we don't know that. It just looks like a normal beam. Now imagine that you take the original, unwelded beam and move it up until the ""join"" is exactly on one of the portals. There is no difference between that and the first case. In both cases you have two portals, exactly 1m apart, and with exactly 1m of steel between them.

When civilians are killed, they are ""collateral damage.""  

But, we know that's not the case.  War means death and destruction.  There is no such thing as collateral damage.  While the overall objective of a war may be to claim territory or some other resource, the strategy is always to inflict the most damage on the other side and the way to do it is through killing.  

Wars kill.  They kill children leaving school and women at the market.  They kill dogs pissing on fire hydrants and cats chasing mice.  War is about destruction and death.  The real question is why both sides can't say, let's stop this nonsense. Let's lay down our arms, jets, rockets, tanks and suicide-bomb vests.  You live in Israel and we'll live in Gaza.

I do agree, the majority do need to be Working Class, as the over throw of Capitalism is specifically in the Working Class's interests - as opposed to the Peasant classes of Feudal society who stood to gain somewhat.

When I moved to the US, I was appalled at how much men and women here in conform to the stereotypical male and female personas the media creates.  It was bad in the UK but much worse here.  So many girls obsess over diamond engagement rings, big weddings, have general high-maintenance ""I want to be treated like a princess"" attitudes.  But the men are just as bad.  They *love* to complain about the big wedding, how they'll get into trouble if they're caught looking at another girl or how they need a ""pass"" to go out for a drink after work, then try and get you to go to hooters or worse a strip club so they can reinforce their views on women as being either whores or goddesses that need tributes.  They are conforming to social norms just the same.  

When I mention my wife would never object to me coming home late, or would think I was crazy to buy her an expensive ugly rock, or that we got married in our lunch hour because we needed it to share a visa to come to the US, they act as if she's some rare freak of nature.  But that isn't true — there are plenty of intelligent women out there who don't fall in line with the norms our media feed us.

 DILUTE THEIR MESSAGE

Make up a large number of signs with pictures of paper and plastic bags, and of pollution made up of these bags. Write on the BIG signs ""God Hates Bags."" Get 100 to 200 people to stand all around the other people with these bag signs. Dilute the hate message to the point that most people passing by have NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

Encourage anyone who asks, to stop using plastic bags or even paper bags at stores, but instead to bring their own reusable bags. Quote a scripture verse or two about how god wants us to be good caretakers of the garden of eden or something. 

This approach will frustrate the original protesters, and has the added side effect of being good for the environment and forcing the conversation to be about bags and bag pollution.

Do not talk to the other protesters at all, except to tell them about how God Hates Bags and they they really should recycle.

If you so hardcore you don't give a shit about labels, do give the PS3 a look, as it's got _Eternal Sonata_, the ""native"" version of _Mirror's Edge_ (underestimate it to your own detriment) and most of the more interesting mainstream seventh-gen games. Oh, and _Uncharted: Drake's Fortune_, a gorgeous and fun game from Naughty Dog (a division of SCEI).","1230818538"

I do agree it would have been more just to create the Jewish country in Berlin or something. I also think that's irrelevant now, because it would be more immoral to destroy Israel. The most moral (and pragmatic) solution is to divide the land. 

I also think that the Palestinians chose to have a destructive narrative instead of a constructive one. Instead of agreeing to divide the land, and start building their nation, they choose (over and over again) to fight in hope that Israel will go away.

* Kill all the men and boys above the age of 5. *All of them.*
* Kill any women not willing to sexually service Isreali soldiers, or marry an Israeli citizen.
* Small children may be spared, but they are to be put into Israeli schools to teach them how to be Jewish.

Solution #2: The end of the Jewish state.

* Withdraw Jewish settlements that are over the 1967 border.
* Allow Palestinians the right of return.
* Reimburse Palestinian families for land seized at current-market value.
* Set a time line to combine Palestinian land with Israel in 10 years for a one-state solution.

Until the Israelis commit to one of these options, we are going to have another generation of death and instability.","1230818790"

They somehow decided that they have a right that extends beyond the property to the whole of Palestine, and had the arab countries back them up. Well, they gambled and lost.

&gt; Due to ongoing torment by the Israelis, the Palestinians have become increasingly radicalised. They are fighting an invader and an oppressor.

Hamas wants you to think such a thing. If you want to blame the whole gazan population for this, then you are advocating IDF bombing it.

&gt;  Most people would see that the Palestinians are the wronged party and Israel as an appendage of the US empire, controlling its master and feeding its love of war and violence, which is a required ingredient to its survival.

They are the losing party, not the wronged party. Things would have been different if there was a sovereign ""palestinian"" state with borders and a government, but there wasn't at any point of history.

&gt; It is time for us to beg the Palestinians for forgiveness and promise to compensate them excessively for their suffering and loss.

You really can't have rationality and reason with numbers.

&gt;Their beliefs have been passed from generation to generation for many centuries.

So what? Truth is not a matter of opinion. People have believed crazy things for generations.

&gt;That cannot be said of the FSM or angry turtles.

But that can be said for the other major religions in the world which combined have more followers than Christianity.

I'm sometimes struck by how differently this matter is approached than the Turkish approach to foreigners living in their land, some of which land the Turks had taken off Greeks by force centuries before.

A few decades before Israel was set up as a country, Greeks and Armenians were shipped out of Turkey in the hundreds of thousands, to create a truly Turkish, pure Turkey. 400,000 Turks were also moved from Greece to Turkey.

What's so incredibly different is that in the case of Turkey, multiple generations of Greeks and Armenians were evicted from their familial homelands forever, and were taken into neighbouring Greece, Macedonia, etc. Most of these lost everything they had and were forced to start again in a new land.

In the case of Israel (and this is not a comment on the right or wrong of creating an Israeli state in the first place), Palestinian refugees were not similarly welcomed, and instead seem to have become a political football to be preserved in perpetuity. Edit: wait a moment, refugees are still being held [in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria](http://www.mideastweb.org/refugees1.htm)?. The Greek and Armenian refugees certainly had it better than that...this seems like a political football, in comparison.

At the same time, Jewish refugees from Arab lands were being forced out in ever greater numbers, made to abandon Jewish property in Arab countries estimated at $300 billion (today's value), totaling over 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the State of Israel). Gives cause to wonder who got that land...it appears not the Palestinians, as they don't seem to have been welcomed with open arms either.

Hammas is committed to there being no Israel, we know that, which is another factor. One wonders what other Arab states feel similarly.

Just makes you realise what a mess things are, and how difficult it is to find real solutions amongst all the long-lived division.","1230819321"

"programming","t5_2fwo","While it is true that inferred static typing is the one true way to solve our computing pains, I'm sure most Haskellers would, in their hearts, prefer to use a language like Ocaml.

The problem is that Ocaml is (a) too easy to use.  

No monadic straightjacket means that it would appeal to conventional programmers and that you can write imperative portions which will work perfectly well with the rest, and you can do Unix programming, etc.

Haskell levels the field between hackers and math nerds who don't know much about computers.  It also protects math nerds by having a model different from (some would say ""inadapted to"") real computers (graph reduction), which utterly confuses real hackers.

(b) Ocaml is developed by Frenchmen, which apparently is double plus ungood.  Maybe someone should fork Ocaml and call it Freedom ML or something for you yankees.  Or maybe Barack ML.

Just kidding actually.  I'm sure Haskell users are progressive people who took refuge in such an intellectually elaborate construction to protect themselves from the waves of anti-intellectualism that have stormed their country for at least 8 years.

"sports","t5_2qgzy","Good, I can tell you directly... you are a moron. Your reasons are very idiotic and baseless.

1. What is the relation between having the highest player and winning the WS?  That's like saying, no team with a one armed pitcher from Minnesota has ever won the WS.  There is no correlation between the one and the other.

2. What does Javy Vasquez or Kevin Brown's performance have to do with the expected performance of CC, AJ or Teixeira?  Do the Yankees put some hex on first year players?  

3. Look at teams like the 1928 Yankees, 1975-1976 Reds or any other team with a boat load of stars... they seemed to have got along and won just fine.  Using the 2008 Tigers as reason to state why the 2009 Yankees will fail is weak. 

4. The Yankees had one of the best bullpens in the MLB. You use ERA to explain your point (in the comments section of the blog post), but using ERA to evaluate a reliever is ineffective.  A reliever does not throw enough innings to offset one bad performance.  Plus, if a reliever comes in the middle of an inning and lets all the inherited runners score, then he did not do his job.  The catch here... that relievers ERA will not be effected, the pitcher who he replaced will have a higher ERA. 

In terms of inherited runners prevented, the Yankees were 9th in the ML and 7th in the AL (above TB and Bos).  http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/sortable/index.php?cid=441697

If you want to look at reliever ERA, Yankees were #7 in ML, #5 in AL.  
BAA #3 in both ML and AL 
OPS against #4 in ML, #3 in AL
Blown Saves fewest in MLB 
WHIP #4 in ML, #3 in AL

http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/aggregate?statType=pitching&amp;seasonType=2&amp;group=9&amp;type=reg&amp;sort=&amp;split=128&amp;season=2008

Should I go on?  

5, 6 and 7 are all very weak, so I'm not going to entertain them.

8. Replacing Abreu with Nady or Swisher was solid, in terms of defense.  Abreu was terrible in the OF.  Replacing Giambi w/Teixeira or Swisher is a tremendous upgrade offensively and defensively.  I can go into the numbers if you would like, but maybe this can be your HW assignment.

9. Replacing Pettitte and Mussina w/younger and better pitchers such as CC and AJ is a win for the Yankees.  Pettitte had an AWFUL 2nd half of the season (he's traditionally been a strong 2nd half pitcher, so somethings amiss), so he won't be missed as a front line starter.  The Yanks have a potential rotation of:
1. CC
2. Wang
3. AJ
4. Joba
5. Hughes / Aceves / Pettitte (?) / Kennedy

That's a hell of a lot better than the crap that was pitching for the majority of the 2008 season.

10. Tampa Bay Rays - Ever hear of the 2007 Colorado Rockies?  In all fairness, the Rays are a good team, but I want to see them do it again to really believe in them. 

Rob Neyer, Joe Sheehan (or anyone else from BP) know their shit.  I suggest reading articles from BP, Hardball Times, etc. to get a better understanding of the game.  A lot of the points your tried to make are just nonsense and typical of the crap that is spewed on ESPN or other main stream media outlets.  There is a lot of good stuff out there, do some research and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I disagree completely. The problem he's presented is so simple that anyone could prove it with a little thought, but on a deeper level as well. Atwood considers programming and mathematics to be distinct disciplines, when I'd argue that they should be the same. Programs should not be written without thought to their correctness, and how much more correct can you get than a proof?

Of course, I don't prove all my programs' correctness formally, but for every piece of code I write I am constantly thinking about pathological cases and how it could possibly fail. Once a piece of code has passed this test, I have to think about why it is necessary to be like that. If I'm unable to convince myself that it is necessary, then I break out the more heavyweight methods.

This is definitely not rigorous, formal mathematics -- you just wouldn't have the time, but the kind of reasoning you (should be) doing while programming does resemble a more informal kind of mathematics.","1230819848"

If you look at it as a problem of avoiding unneeded conflict and keeping social ties well maintained while working toward the common good, all of these things could be seen in most social animal groups where individuals have their own will. Those sorts of social rules seem pretty universal, and out of those I could imagine that ""morality"" as a human construct came about from maintaining and laying out the rules in early human groups where speech allowed us to start sharing complex thoughts directly with each other.

I think the idea of morality may be a human construct and may be quite flexible from culture to culture, but there are core rules that are pretty much universal because morality comes from a common and real thread of looking out for the best interest of all.","1230820260"

Certainly, but at least with literates there is always the possibility that they will read for themselves the Marxist theories and realise how it truly works. 

With illiterates unfortunately, they always have to believe what their ""scholars"" tell them the theory says. If their previous leaders turn around and start promoting authoritarian versions, they won't be able to know the difference.

This is somewhat relevant with Religions, where before literacy became common, people simply trusted that their priest presented the whole truth, when in truth he was hiding all the nasty parts. Now, the bible itself has become the biggest deconversion tool :)

Since in this case it is the rotation of the block which changes the flux through the aluminum, it will necessarily tip over more slowly.

I'm unsure if simply dropping it would produce this effect: that would depend on how rapidly the magnetic field changes as you move around inside that machine.  At any rate, I'd expect the effect is more impressive because it's changing orientation.","1230820376"

"business","t5_2qgzg","It works like this. In a country goods and services are produced and traded. Via the central bank and commercial banks of that country money is injected (as debt) into society to accommodate for the trading of those goods and services.

Here's a small example:
If there would only be 2 people and 2 goods in a country, the goods being 1 fish and 1 potato and someone would borrow $100 in that country's economy from a bank, then there would be 1 fish, 1 potato and a $100 bill in that country.
Consequently the fish or the potato would be worth $100.
The number 100 however does not matter here, what matters is that there is only 1 piece of paper in circulation that has 100 stamped on it which functions as a medium of exchange.

The problem however starts here. When the central bank starts printing 10 hundred dollar bills. Then the fish and the potato become worth 10 hundred dollar bills and thus $1000.
Technically the fish and potato have the same value, namely 1 fish is worth 1 potato when traded without a currency as a medium of exchange. However what has dropped in ""value"" is the paper bill. 1 paper bill is no longer worth 1 fish or 1 potato.

And that's the key between currency values. The value of a currency is measured by how much goods and services are produced by the country/economy of the currency versus the produced amount of that currency.

Comparing this to the dollar and pound means that the central banks of the US and UK started printing more money in the last period. Much more than the expansion of goods and services in their countries. The EU also expanded their money supply, so the Euro also devalued, however the US and UK printed so much more money in proportion to the EU, that the Dollar and Pound declined even faster than the Euro. That's why people see the Euro as a stronger currency, because with 1 Euro you can buy more goods or services in the EU than you can buy in the US with 1 Dollar.

So the numeric value of a currency is the proportional link between the amount of goods and services which can be traded for that currency versus the amount of goods and services that can be traded for in another currency.

ANYtime you use a while loop, set it up for it to be impossible to go onto infinity.

If you do a while that should loop about 100 loops, set up an integer called loopcount:

while( days&gt; 365 &amp;&amp; loopcount&lt;10000){

      whatever code here

      loopcount++

      if (loopcount==9999){

         echo ""error in loop 276""

         code to do in case of loop failure

      }

}

if you are expected up to 10000 loops, set the condition at 1 million. But put a limit on it.

Its a pain in the butt to do that for every loop, put it doesn't require that many integers in memory and makes the program much more defensive. ","1230820704"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;In the eyes of the law, you are paying a debt when you purchase something from a store, etc. 

So no law, just ""my father says so?"" And you think this is persuasive?

Like I said, sales are governed by state contract law. Most state contract laws are modeled on the UCC. The UCC treats sales and debts COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY. The laws that govern debts have NOTHING to do with the rules that govern sales. Sales are covered under Article 2, and the rules that govern sales exist in their own little legal world that is wholly separate and distinct from the laws of, say, letters of credit, which are governed by Article 5. There's simply no legal nexus between sales and debts, unless you're talking about purchases that are debt financed (and even then, the fact that the buyer becomes indebted to the seller doesn't change any of the fundamental rules of contract formation). ""In the eyes of the law"" means nothing here because you can't point me to a single law or legal opinion that tells me anything meaningful about anything you're saying.

Let's try to simply your argument, so I can understand what the hell it is you're saying: Why is it meaningful to you that every time someone buys a hamburger and McDonalds, they're entering into a debtor/creditor relationship (or so you claim)? Help me understand just what it is you think is happening in that transaction and why it's significant.

&gt; because currencies change hands many many times a year, the capital gains tax makes it impossible for gold or any other asset to compete as a currency against the dollar.

This makes no sense whatsoever. The only reason ""other currencies"" are subject to the capital gains tax is because they accrue in value over time. Dollars don't do this. So no, you don't pay capital gains taxes on the dollars in your pocket, but they're also worth less over time, while the ""other currencies"" tend to be worth more. And on the off chance that your ""other currency"" turns out not to be worth more, then you don't pay any capital gains tax, because you had no capital gains, which makes them indistinguishable from dollars from a tax perspective. 

This is like the argument that winning the lottery sucks because you get taxed in a higher bracket. Sure, someone making $1mil gets taxed higher than someone making $20k, but his after tax income is still going to be north of $500k. Similarly, someone who stashes their money in bonds instead of dollars is going to pay capital gains tax, but because his bonds have accrued in value, whereas dollars would have lost value over the same period of time. The capital gains tax means he only gets to keep 85% of the accrued value, rather than the whole 100%, but even 85% of 5% (or whatever the average yield is on bonds) is a hell of a lot more than what he'd have with dollars, which could be worth 2-6% LESS over the same period of time.","1230820755"

Hamas admits that up to 80% of the dead in the recents strikes were Hamas members. By any military standard, that is a fantastic minimization of civilian fatalities. A real military tries to have few civilians deaths. Compare that to Hamas who primarily targets civilians, and even says that there are no such things as civilians in Israel.

Those that only point out the rocket deaths are missing the main point: the rockets primary purpose is to cause fear and panic: the hallmarks of terrorism. Every time one of those rockets (6000 in 3 years) goes off, air raid sirens sound causing people, such as children in schools, to seek shelter. Imagine this happening in New York, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, or your town. See how many years you would tolerate it.

Israel is a sovereign, internationally recognized nation. It has every right to defend itself. Hamas isn't even recognized by the majority of the Arab community as the proper authority over the so-called Palestinian territories: the Palestinian National Authority is. Hamas is nothing more than a powerful terrorist organization or gang. They do not have any sovereignty.

Lastly, Hamas instigated this conflict. They are to blame. The ethnic Palestinians in Gaza need to realize that their support of Hamas caused this onto themselves. The very land they live on was disengaged by the Israelis in a gesture of good-will towards them but instead they continued to provoke Israel. And why wouldn't they? They are a people that are committed to the total destruction of Isreal.

To hell with Hamas. To hell with their supporters. To hell with a Palestinian state so-long as the people side with terrorists.

I had a checkbox and submit button that would send an email through to flag a page for review and I noticed that every so often, some of the flag emails would come through in duplicate pairs.

It took me a while to conclude that some people must actually be double clicking that button. It never occurred to me for a second that anyone would do that and I'm guessing these German developers did the same.

Of course, if I was taking the time to put together a more solid web app, I'd account for crazy edge cases with more robust error handling...","1230821312"
"religiousdebate","t5_2qq6l","I don't think the idea that humans universally have a drive to worship things or believe in the supernatural.

Imagining a ""world beyond the seen"" comes easily to us as we have minds that are set up for prediction and compositing previous experiences into ideas about possible new experiences. When we talk about potential extraterrestrial life or what terraforming a planet or taking a trip to the bottom of the Mariana trench would be like this is imagining a world beyond the seen for most people. We've not seen aliens, or extraterrestrial, Earth-like worlds, but we can imagine what they'd be like. As long as there's something out there we've not yet uncovered or thought out there will be things which we can only imagine, but that curiosity can drive us to find those things.

As for a tenancy to worship things, I don't find that need at all. Worship always seemed like respect drawn to a fault. I can have sincere and potentially total respect for someone or something, but I've never in my life had an urge to worship something.","1230821312"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yeah, I doubt people are celebrating a random guy named Jesus. The one christians are celebrating hasn't existed more than Superman or Bilbo the hobbit (to my eyes at least). And 2 days before that date, i.e. the day when days are starting to become longer, is just 48h, which, I suppose, qualifies for ""a few hours"" title.
Anyway, if you have any problem with me, a 100% atheist, celebrating on Xmas day with all the christians (and here in France, also a lot of jews and muslims), please try to think about something/someone else, I wouldn't like to be responsible for you feeling uncomfortable about that, I can feel at your obvious desire to convince me that I'm somehow doing something wrong that it's really bothering you and I'm really sorry about that.

Try for example convincing all the christians around you that Santa Claus has nothing to do with the Bible, and that Sinterklaas, the basis for Santa Claus, was celebrated on Dec, 5th, making them even wronger than me :)

If you get a couple of magnets from an old hard disk drive (carefully, as they can be dangerous) you can observe its effect on water at home. Put a couple of millimetres of tap water into a shallow glass tray and reflect a light off the surface so it shines onto the ceiling or a distant wall. Bring a strong magnet close underneath the water tray, and you will see the reflected light move as the water shifts out of the magnetic field (or piles into it - I'm not sure which). Either way, it is a good demonstration of how powerfull those rare earth metal hard-drive magnets are.

Funny, I would say the exact opposite. It is the fiat people who want a fixed money supply and don't want a system with flexibility.

I don't have a clue what the ""Palestine"" in that sentence refers to, there was no Palestine government before 1948. Nor did they consider all Zionist groups terrorist. Nor is their opinion automatically authoritative. You are not defending the attacks on civilians by saying that 60 years ago someone else was accused of attacking civilians.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","Alphabets I would teach my children:

* Quite obviously, the Latin alphabet for its overwhelming use in Western languages
* The Greek alphabet; I am a dead languages geek, so my children will most likely grow up speaking a smattering of Latin and Greek along with their native languages. The alphabet is also quite useful in the sciences, as simple acquaintance with the symbols can lessen the initial visual ""shock"" of higher mathematics. It would also help my children become acquainted with diacriticals.
* The Cyrillic alphabet if I happen to speak Russian by that which. I find Russian to be a very beautiful language.
* The Sanskrit alphabet, not only because of my love for the classical language, but also because it acts (I believe) as a primer for the rest of the major Indo-Iranian languages and, perhaps, Arabic as well.

If I have studied any of the pictographic language, I would strive to incorporate them as well. I may soon begin formalized study in Old Norse, so that could be thrown in. Essentially, my desire is that my children will grow up to be bilingual or trilingual, or further polylingual. One of my many goals in life is to become a polyglot, and I hope that such would be passed on to my children. In Goethe's words, ""A Man who does not know foreign languages is ignorant of his own."" Not only do I want to fight against linguistic hegemony, but I do believe that my children would foster a deeper understanding of 'foreign' culture; It would, I think, prevent ethnocentrism and encourage cosmopolitanism while railing against homogeneity of culture.

I grew up with one language and it wasn't until my Sophmore year in college that I started to pay attention to foreign language. I took a year of conversational Latin with an astounding professor (the sort of fellow who speaks Classical Latin, Classical Greek, Classical Sanskrit, and French fluently, not to mention his native English, but also spoke German at home) and the tutelage inspired me. One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't attempt language earlier, when it would have been easier for me to gain fluency. I am, by no mean, too old at 18, but there was a ""golden period"" during my formative years when I could have really 'jumped on the wagon', as it were.

As an American, I feel that one of our greatest deficits as a society *is* our sense of cultural hegemony; There is an air in middle-class  suburbia that speaking in a language other than English to a person whose native language is not English is 'dirty' and somehow goes against what it is to be an American. I think this will be our downfall; there is no doubt that it has harmed our reputation abroad.

And so, I will work diligently to provide my children with an education which is diametrically opposed to the ethnocentric outlook espoused by middle-class America. Then again, I've never fit in with that crowd and I doubt my children will either. As soon as I can, I'm skedaddlin', ya dig?","1230821950"

I agree with the point that Perl suffers from a lack of standardisation.  ""There's more than one way to do it"" is both a curse and a blessing.  But your point about testing and structure is way off the mark.  Most *modern* Perl code is well structured and usually [very well tested](http://cpantesters.perl.org/). 

&gt; Seriously, Duplo?

Well it's just an analogy so you shouldn't take it too seriously.  

Lego blocks are smaller, sharper, more fiddly, but ultimately give you more freedom (which you may not want, of course).

Duplo pieces are larger, smoother, easier to put together and harder to swallow.  You get more pre-built pieces like animals, windows, doors, etc.  

In your earlier message you said:

&gt; Try python instead. Much more rational and forgiving.

I would say that ""much more rational and forgiving"" is a perfect description of Duplo compared to Lego.

But hey, each to his own.  It's great that you prefer Python to Perl.  I happen to prefer Perl to Python (and Python to Java, Java to C++, and so on).  But saying that Perl is an awful language to cut your teeth on is just plain wrong.  Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP are all great languages to get started on.

So that sounds like under a hundred. Yet you deliberately falsely accused Israel of killing hundreds of civilians. 

&gt;I'm thinking that it is not unreasonable to extrapolate ""hundreds of innocents"" 

I think that it is dishonest and distortive. I think that it is an attempt to claim that Israel is trying to kill civilians rather than trying to kill a military force that has deliberately mixed in among civilians.

&gt;This completely skips over the 1400-1600 wounded but not killed in the attacks, of course, many of whom were surely innocent bystanders as well.

Yes, many are innocent. Israel works hard to minimize that number, but it is impossible to make it zero. Hamas though deliberately attacks Israeli civilians. Hamas uses weapons that **can't** be used against a military target. What we have is that Israel seems to have about an 80% accuracy against Hamas and Hamas has a 100% accuracy against **civilians**.

You and I must be thinking of different ideologies. The one Hamas bears can not be allowed in the modern world. This has nothing to do with the sad plight of ""palestinian"" arabs.

&gt; A political accomodation must be sought.

It can't be done with Hamas, and Hamas is in the way.

&gt; There will always be opposition to complete capitulation to Israel among the Palestinians, that is obvious.

So they don't want to capitulate but they also want us to stop doing the only thing we can to prevent them from attacking us? Hamas said just yesterday that if Israel unilaterally ceases fire they *may* think about doing the same. If their cause and ideology is more important to them than their own lives, I don't see why their lives should be more important to us than our own ones.

In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home — and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed — breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert…. Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music….

I've got a device in my pocket that allows me to instantly speak with any of a few billion people in the world in moments. It also can take and store hundreds of photos, a large collection of music, videos, allows for instant or delayed communication with others, and also lets me access the vast information held on the net quicker than I could look up a book in a library. It's on my person from shortly after I wake up til shortly before I sleep and it's pretty much constantly within reach. And all that's just the cell phone.

If I could get some sort of implant that allowed me all those things without needing to carry the phone and it were safe and never needed attending after the install I'd be saving my pennies to get it done.

Ultimately I'd think an implant somewhat like the story Manna has isn't unlikely. Maybe not in my life, maybe so. The important thing is once you start heavily integrating technology you have to draw a personal line where you stop and the technology starts.

Well , not the Daily Mail , BNP , jihadwatch , but still

""WorldNetDaily, also known as WND, is a socially conservative news and opinion website""

""WorldNetDaily is a for-profit website that provides primarily evangelical-conservative-oriented news and editorials, publishes letters to the editor, maintains forums and conducts a daily poll. Besides providing articles authored by its own staff, the site links to news from other publications. Notable staff includes Aaron Klein - Jerusalem Bureau Chief, Lester Kinsolving - White House Correspondent and Staff Writer Jerome Corsi.

The website's Commentary page features editorials from the site's founder, Joseph Farah and other social conservative authors such as Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, David Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Chuck Norris.""

""A commentary by Canadian evangelical Tristan Emmanuel [36] decried so called ""Anglo-Saxon self-hatred"" in Canada and the United States, and used ""warring factions"" of third world immigrants as a base against multiculturalism in order to suggest a whites-only immigration policy for North America.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldNetDaily

Some consistency there of kinds then.

As for the story , I suppose this feeds into your pattern , but you don't get no BNP recruits in America Mr Hurwood . Nick Griffen has established links , but you are still a sad little BNP fascist activist from Corby seeking to promote the idea of rampant crime for your new national socialist order and slow brainwashing via your navigor vigilante site that is designed to draw people to BNP policies slowly without admitting so as per BNP activist guidelines for web recruitment. How about a nice story about some kittens next time from cuddlymuslims.com ?

Of course a fuller story can be found elsewhere , this suggests the man was suffering some delusion and not on a religious rampage.

http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18390116/detail.html#-

All crime stories are not pleasant , some have nasty angles , but there is always a need to seek neutral objective sources that provide a fuller account rather than highlighting aspects . If your recruitment campaign for the BNP front Navigor has come down to sensationalized crime accounts from right of centre sources , why not just stop and at least have the courage of your convictions. No one is fooled.

We teach the kids to respect other people. Not to be racist, not to be sexist, not be homophobic. We teach them what is right by others and what is wrong: I.e. Exploitation is wrong etc. We tell them that the world needs people to fight for each other, to win civil rights, to defend them. We teach them that the only movement in the modern era that has been successful at this is always a working class movement, one which uses its only strength: withdrawal of labour power - collectively - to win them.

How disgusting is all of the above? You know what? Go fuck yourself random internet knit who doesn't know a goddamn thing about anything other than his own over-inflated ego, which compels him to speak shit about the way people raise their kids.

This isn't religious doctrine - this is teaching these kids to be good people for themselves and for others on a material basis. There is *nothing* wrong with that at all.

And you are an idiot for suggesting otherwise.","1230823024"

You see, the Old testament has alot of stories of God being wrathful and angry.  Lots of genocide, human sacrifice, rape, etc...all in the name of the Lord.

Now the New Testament, well MOST christians will tell you is the ONLY book they follow (i.e. you can ignore the old testament...even though they don't).  

The new testament is all about Christ.  When he came down, what he did as a child, what he did as an adult, after he died, etc.  Most of all, what he said...its full of messages of forgiveness, love, compassion, etc.  i.e. Very UNLIKE the Old Testament god.

The Church would have us think God and Jesus are part of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as a sort of gestalt 3in1 organism), but DAMN.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The main objection is that it is far too terse. 

When trying to read languages as terse as Haskell I always end up having to mentally ""translate"" it to follow the flow. It is a slow and tiresome process. 

When I look at programs in languages that aren't so terse I can usually pick up most of what they are doing very quickly without any mental translation step even if I don't know the language in question and the semantics are unusual.

I know some people take to terse syntax well, but most developers I have worked with finds it as tiresome as me or more.

I've had compiler design as a hobby for the last 15 years or so, and I've looked into at least a few languages per year because language design fascinate me. The *only* ones, irrespective of semantics, I have a hard time with are the ones with what I consider excessively terse syntax. I end up spending disproportionately much time on them without getting any more out of it. 

More crucially: It doesn't seem to get any easier. While picking up more terse languages has gotten easier and easier to me, because fewer and fewer of the concepts are foreign to me, with terse languages the syntax barrier remains a massive problem.

Of course this is anecdotal, but the syntax issue is what keeps cropping up in almost all instances where I discuss languages with developers and functional languages in particular come up.

Haskell isn't a hard language when you strip away the syntax. The semantics of it are pretty simple, though it's a language it would take some time to get used to for most people because of how different it is. But it is hampered by a syntax that, while elegant to some, is line noise to a whole lot of people, including people with a *lot* of exposure to a variety of programming languages.

Now you might ask yourself. If all money in society is a pool of loans, then where do the people get the interest to pay those loans? Because banks don't just want their money back, they want interest on top of it.

Here's the answer. Every year banks produce more and more money to give out more and more loans. It's called expansion of the money supply. That yearly expansion of the money supply is what people pay their interest with.
The rate at which the money supply expands is called inflation and if the rate of inflation is higher than the rate of expansion of goods and services, then a currency becomes worth less than before.

The paper money you know today was for hundreds of years something else. It wasn't ""money"" it was a paper receipt. 
When you in 16th century Europe went to a bank to store your gold there, then the banker gave you a receipt. People started trading those receipts for goods and services, because they knew if they went to the bank with those receipts they'd get the gold that was stored there.

However at a particular moment people started to notice that there wasn't anymore gold in the banks. The bankers stole the gold. People were angry, that the bankers did this. The bankers said quite arrogantly: ""Well, you may still keep the receipts"".

Those receipts are now our paper money. Which is now also available electronically.
And because all money in society is debt, bankers call money ""credit"".","1230823158"

&gt;Just prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored a successful rescue. The rescue team was led by retired U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Arthur D. ('Bull') Simons. When the team couldn't find a way to extract their two prisoners, they decided to wait for a mob of pro-Ayatollah revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, and the team spirited them out of Iran via a risky border crossing into Turkey. *The exploit was recounted in a book, On Wings of Eagles by Ken Follett, which became a best-seller. In the 1986 miniseries, Perot was portrayed by Richard Crenna*.","1230823267"

&gt;Suppose there are 100 families, all just got their first child. 50 of them have got a boy, and 50 a girl.

&gt;Next year, all 100 families get a second child. Of the 50 that already have a boy, 25 will have another boy, and 25 will have a girl. And of the 50 that already have a girl, 25 will have a boy, and 25 will have another girl.

&gt;So now there are 25 families with two boys, 25 with two girls, and 50 with a boy and a girl (in any order).

&gt;Now you're meeting one couple of parents. You know that they have at least one girl, so they definitely don't have two boys. They either are one of the 50 that have a boy and a girl, or they are one of the 25 that have two girls.

&gt;So, the chance that their other child is a boy, is 2/3 (50/75).

The difference is that it doesn't have the same flippant sarcastic sound to it that makes it sound like you're scoffing at him rather than just saying useful information.  Just scoffing at someone because of their employer is not a valuable comment, I think.

Probably not.  It depends on the greater social context surrounding the use of Rockport shoes, and the history of comments about them.

No, and I wouldn't do that for anyone.  Note that in my comment I put quotes around the term ""linux zealot"" and preceded it with ""so-called"", to indicate that I don't think it's a useful term.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;I'm unsure if simply dropping it would produce this effect: that would depend on how rapidly the magnetic field changes as you move around inside that machine.

It still slows down.  The classic experiment is to drop a magnet down an aluminum tube and see that it proceeds very slowly.  In this case, the magnet and the aluminum are reversed, but the effect will be the same.  Depending on the orientation and shape of your magnetic field, the object could easily fall somewhat sideways.

Note: I study experimental physics, and so probably making some stupid mistake here.","1230824209"

"politics","t5_2cneq","We implore and beseech our Jewish brethren to realize that the Zionists are not the saviors of the Jewish People and guarantors of their safety, but rather the instigators and original cause of Jewish suffering in the Holy Land and worldwide.  The idea that Zionism and the State of ""Israel"" is the protector of Jews is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the Jewish people... It has been the age-old intention of Zionism to intentionally stir up anti-semitism anywhere possible, and even more commonly, to take advantage of any Jewish suffering anywhere in order to enhance its cause.  Indeed, hatred of Jews and Jewish suffering is is the oxygen of the Zionist movement, and from  the very beginning has been used to deliberately incite hatred of the Jew and then, in feigned horror, used to justify the existence of the Zionist state.  This is, of course, Machiavellianism raised to the highest degree. -- Jews Against Zionism

The meaning of the history of the last century is that today 300 Jewish financiers, all Masters of (Masonic) Lodges, rule the world. -- Jean Izoulet, prominent member of Jewish Alliance Israelite Universelle, 1931

The Jewish people as a whole will become its own Messiah.  It will attain world domination by the dissolution of other races, by the abolition of frontiers, the annihilation of monarchy and by the establishment of a world republic in which the Jews will everywhere exercise the privilege of citizenship. In this New World Order, the children of Israel will furnish all the leaders without encountering opposition.  The Governments of the different peoples forming the world republic will fall without difficulty into the hands of the Jews.  It will then be possible for the Jewish rulers to abolish private property and everywhere to make use of the resources of the state. Thus will the promise of the Talmud be fulfilled, in which it is said that when the Messianic time is come, the Jews will have all the property of the whole world in their hands. -- Baruch Levy, Letter to Karl Marx, printed in La Revue de Paris, p. 574, June 1, 1928

I had on my arrival (at St. Petersburg) an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance, Count Canerin; I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew#. I had an audience on my arrival  at Madrid with the Spanish  minister; I beheld one like myself, the son of a Nuovo Christiano, a Jew of Aragon.  In consequence of that transpired at Madrid I went straight to consult the President of the French Council; I beheld the son of a French Jew#. We fixed on Prussia#. Count Arnim entered the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew.  So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes. -- Benjamin Disraeli, Jewish Prime Minister of England, in Coningsby, p. 207-209, 1844

Regarding what took place on September 11th, well it's very good# it will generate immediate sympathy for Israel. -- Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 2001

Every time we do something you tell me America will do this and will do that#. I want to tell you something very clear.  Don't worry about American pressure on Israel.  We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans know it. -- Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, one Oct. 3, 2001, to Shimon Perez as reported on Kol Yisrael radio.

Our race is the master race.  We are divine gods on this planet. We are as different from the inferior races as they are from insects.  In fact, compared to our race, other races are beasts and animals, cattle at best.  Other races are considered as human excrement.  Our destiny is to rule over the inferior races.  Our earthly kingdom will be ruled by our leader with a rod of iron.  The masses will lick our feet, and serve us as slaves. -- Menachem Begin (Israeli Prime Minister, 1977-1983), excerpt from LEHI (the terrorist Stern Gang) training pamphlet, circa 1946, shortly before the organization began a series of murders of unarmed opponents of the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel.

The United States Senate is subservient to Israel... Israel controls the Senate.. This has been demonstrated time and again,  and this has made it difficult for the Government. -- Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright on CBS TV in relation to Jewish power in America, April 15th, 1972

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his foreign Minister Shimon Peres during which Sharon reportedly yelled at Peres, saying ""Don't worry about American pressure, we control America. Every time we do something you tell me Americans will do this and will do that. I want to tell you something very clear, don't worry about American pressure on Israel, we, the Jewish people control America, and the Americans know it.""

You just have to read what's in the Israeli press. The Jewish community is divided but there is so much pressure being channeled from the New York money people to the office seekers. - General Wesley Clark on The Powers That Be

""The governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other governments, with emperors, kings and ministers, but also with the secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents, and can at the last moment upset all the governments' plans."" (1876) - Benjamin Disraeli - First Jewish British Prime Minister

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","You realise that grammar is hardly a showmanship of intellect, right?

Even the most astute scholars and intellectuals have editors who proof read their works and writings. It just so happens that people make mistakes when they write/type things up. Sorry, that attempt was an epic fail.

Explain to me how it is that I am a child abuser? That would be fantastic. Honestly, I don't see how you can make that claim without backing it up.

Science does show that children's ability to absorb information, to process it etc. are far greater than that of the fully developped adult. (For example: It is much easier for a child to learn several languages than an adult.)

Now, provided you teach them appropriately, activate their minds and guide them through the information, Children prove to be quite astute and very capable of understanding any piece of information given to them (with the exception of intense and complex informations such as physics etc etc etc)

So you're basically assurting that if we try to teach our children anything - it doesn't matter what it is - we are child abusers?

Well that, sorry, is blatantly stupid. More to the point, this society goes through processes of systematic conditioning from the moment a child is born - if you do not make that child aware of them - what you have is a cycle of social conditioning. I.e. men's and women's social roles being reinforced from day one.

And you think that by pointing that out, raising them in a way that will alert them to these things, raising them to know what it is their parents are doing, to understand the ins and outs of what they are doing is abuse?

Its not like its a cult. Its a political organisation. All of what we do and say is backed up with years of factual information.

Now, even still. If we are wrong, if in some way we are abusing these children, it is not sexual violence. And it is utterly insulting and disgusting that you would suggest that. Not only to me and mine, but also to every child that has ever had to suffer something so barbaric. And you, you who has such low regard for those people throws that around like a proud asshat. You should be ashamed.

Also, though this is not going to matter much to you, obviously, you have been reported. And I advise anyone else who reads your comments to report you - in a bid that you get forbidden the ability to spread your worthless, insensitive and disgusting opinions at your own discretion.","1230824298"

Still convinced that it was all Israels fault? If you read the goddamn wikipedia article you would see its not Israels fault. And its pathetic that you think its all Israels fault. But then again you think Palestine can do no wrong and Israel is the aggressive evil.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I don't want to criticize your work but there are a couple things you could do better...

1. Strong red as a background is bad, it's evil on the eyes for text
2. Don't color the rating, that makes it hard to differentiate properly, color the background of the entire comment in a pastel variation.
3. Use colors appropriately, red may mean hot in reddit, but green is a better color to indicate betterness. Blue can still be used to indicated cold/badness.
4. Don't use hsv, go with rgb directly, here is a possible function to use:

        function rgb_rating(rating) {
    	var strength = 255-parseInt(rating * 100);
    	return '#'+hexify(strength)+'ff'+hexify(strength);
        }

and change the call to:

        s.setBackgroundColor(rgb_rating(s.points/maxScore));

I don't know greasemonkey at all, so I'll leave the getting the backround of the entire comment rather than just the points section up to you, but here's a screenshot of this code:

Here is a logic chain I want you to follow.  It is a general one, not specific to this battle or even to the whole Israel/Palestine conflict.

1. Side A has their troops in uniforms.
2. Side B has their troops in civilian clothes and operates from civilian areas and retreats to civilian areas after launching their attacks.
3. When civilians on Side B are killed, outside authority C (that B cares about) blames side A.

How do you expect Side B to react to this?  Are they going to reduce hiding in civilian areas, or try all the harder to maximize civilian deaths, since they will be blamed on Side A?

A good example of irony is this line from Oedipus: ""So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this. You [Oedipus] with your precious eyes, you're blind to the corruption of your life...""

Now, the blind person can ""see"" better than Oedipus, even though he's sighted. The contradictory nature of this statement is what makes it ironic.

"business","t5_2qgzg","Actually there's a lot of reasons not to join the Euro. A large amount of the UK's economy is based on trade between the EU, the US and other anglophilic countries. The UK is able to exploit cultural relations with countries like the US and maintain control of fiscal policy (to an extent permitted by European law) to remove trade barriers (to an extent also permitted by European law) in order to obtain a competitive advantage over Europe. Joining the Euro would require the UK to implement certain measures that would limit the ability to trade with other non-Eurozone nations and would remove some of the advantages of dealing with the UK instead of say France or Germany. The cultural advantages would still be there but advantages associated with tax breaks, interest rates etc. would disappear.

The humans, their toys and skills are exaggerated but if Batman is science fiction then so are all the Bond movies. Batman is just more theatrical.

The first post is reasonable. Curiously the author says the opposite of the popular opinion on reddit on one item: ""The Israeli military has very weakly argued that the Gaza Strip is so overpopulated it is impossible to avoid civilian deaths during operations"" - whereas local hysteria seems to think that Gaza is so overpopulated Hamas can't conduct its war anywhere without being surrounded by civilians.

The second one, I am afraid, is tripe. The author seriously thinks that the truce was sunk by IDF's anti-tunnel operation, whereas even Hamas itself said that they would rather not break the truce over it. The author does not factor the 1948 invasion into Israel and the jews' right to self-determination and rationalizes the arab terrorism because we're the ""occupiers"" and so fair game. This is the usual: arabs are poor and poorly armed, therefore they are in the right, and jews are well armed, therefore they are in the wrong.

Terrorism is unacceptable. It must be fought and the reasons for it are unimportant. If the arabs feel that an injustice has been done to them, they should be reminded of the injustice they did to us, from 1920s to this day, and they should express their frustration peacefully, because escalation to violence means that whoever has the bigger stick becomes the winner and the righteous.","1230825407"

The only ""hiccup"" was the fact that she was a manager at a retail store and she worked alot of hours, not to mention dealing with alot of stress being she is only 20YOA. But we always seemed to get through it.

August comes around and we are right around our 5 month Aniv. She tells me how amazing i am and how lucky she is to be with me, then tells me she thinks she is starting to fall in love with me. Needless to say i was shocked, but very happy telling her i feel the same way. Next day comes around and she calls me telling me we need to talk.

So out of no where she tells me how its not fair to me that she is working all the time and never has time for us anymore, and how its unfair that im waiting around all the time for her. She then feels its best to go on a break and put our relationship on hold for now. The kicker is she tells me that we can still do everything we did as a couple, the only difference would be we wouldnt be b/f g/f. At this point i was confused, but agreed to it. So the next day comes around, i text and call her. Nothing. Few days later i text and call her. Nothing.

The change isn't necessarily bad, as the road to maturity requires changing to a better state, but ANSI C was last standardized in 99, and those changes weren't even exactly huge. These guys try hard to keep backward compatible. By comparison to the newer dynamic languages, the big guys (C, C++, Java) are glacial.

There are low-income white people, and there are middle-class and high-income black people. 

Even though discriminating against low-income folks may have an apparently racially discriminative effect, it is not racism, and provided those who put the policies in place can show there is no racist intent, they should be left alone.

His mother was a prostitute and the name on his birth certificate is ""No Name Maddox"". 

Right there you could have guessed he was not going to be running for President any time soon. From there he was a career criminal in and out of prison. When he got out in the 60's he discovered a subculture of crazy hippies that he could exploit ( Manson was more of a 50's greaser, or a biker-type in real life) 

I find it fascinating that the downfall of the peace movement basically came when hippie culture embraced 50's bikers types ( see Manson and Rolling Stones Altamont concert), mainly because they were long haired and dirty and did drugs too. Before Manson came along hippies were gaining some acceptance in society and the whole idea of Peace was catching on.  

Manson changed the world. He is nothing and he is a big someone all at once. He is a nihlist. An absurdist and a sociopathic liar with the gift of gab.

"science","t5_mouw","That's (potentially) a different case.  The magnetic field around a small magnet such as you describe varies noticeably over a reasonably small distance scale.  So the surface of the tube will experience a changing magnetic flux as the magnet moves along it.

If you dropped an aluminium disc into a long solenoid, it would experience a constant magnetic field, and thus free-fall through most of it's trip.  (There'd be some effects at the boundaries of the solenoid.)

Whether the particular magnetic field used in the video would slow the dropped block will depend on the geometry of the field.  If, locally, the field lines are mostly parallel to each other, and the vertical gradient isn't extremely steep, then the rotating block will experience (probably dramatically so) a greater change in flux than a falling block.

A quick google search seems to indicate that the fields in an MRI machine can be shaped in many ways, so who knows?  :)

-edit-
Watching the video again, I don't see any perceptible speed-up as the block changes angle.  So here, the effect is probably still relevant for a falling block. ","1230826493"

&gt; I expect the S&amp;P 500 to at least touch 1220 in 2008 and my current downside target is 1070.

It closed at 752 on November 20th.

Here is my prediction for 2009: The S&amp;P could finish way below 900, but may bounce back way over 950.

Oh, so that's why Israel always claims that the civilians they kill are members of Hamas, and that makes it OK. 

And the Israeli government is not demonized for its atrocities even close to the frequency that Hamas is, -in fact excuses are often made for Israeli atrocities. Why is that? Perhaps legitimization of the Israeli slaughter of innocent civilians using bogus arguments such as, ""they look like Hamas"", is just too easy to swallow compared to the work necessary to find and understand the truth?","1230827368"

Ninety three trucks, with approximately 2500 tons of humanitarian aid, medical supplies and medication were conveyed through Kerem Shalom cargo terminal. The World Food Programme has informed Israel that they will not be resuming shipment of food commodities in to Gaza due to the fact that their warehouses are at full capacity and will last for approximately two weeks.

&gt; What is clearly missing from this list of Israeli objectives is the attempt to halt the firing of Qassam rockets into Israel's southern towns. Unlike the objectives I mentioned, which are not discussed by government officials, this one is presented by the government as the operation's primary objective. Yet, the government is actively misleading the public, since Israel could have put an end to the rockets a long time ago. Indeed, there was relative quiet during the six-months truce with Hamas, a quiet that was broken most often as a reaction to Israeli violence: that is, following the extra-judicial execution of a militant or the imposition of a total blockade which prevented basic goods, like food stuff and medicine, from entering the Gaza Strip. Rather than continuing the truce, the Israeli government has once again chosen to adopt strategies of violence that are tragically akin to the ones deployed by Hamas; only, the Israeli ones are much more lethal.","1230827727"

As chief justice, he's not just another vote on the court.  He's also essentially the CEO of the court system.  He's advocating that judges, including those who are on the front ranks at the district court level in various cities all across the country, receive a cost of living pay increase.

I did not have to go to *great* lengths to justify reasonable work predictions/estimates.

Almost anyone with a degree can find inside-big-company IT work *somewhere* for *some* company that needs a few web pages or simple Windows forms.  In IT, the programming is generally simple and every project has the same few technologies.  In IT, the management will very often have a hard time distinguishing the good programmers from the bad.  In IT, to advance, you have to prove you have abilities that are valuable to the business--and, since their business is not IT, programming is not a valuable ability but an expense.  Therefore, every task from your manager starts with the words ""We need ... just ... pretty easy ... can you have this done by 5pm""?  There is little understanding of the difference between seeing a page or UI window on the screen and all the magic invisible code that makes it do useful stuff.  In IT, you will be working with generally below-average programmers (but there are exceptions) and they will not understand what you are doing.  They will either make illogical simple programs that don't work or they will make giant over-complications (to seem smarter) which won't work.

In IT, you have to find a way that your programming work either saves the company a lot of money or makes the company a lot of money.  It must be measurable.  My trick:  Grab the biggest project you can work on mostly alone, a project that has caused much visible trouble for the company, and fix it, make it really work well, in a short period of time.  Perhaps, while fixing five bugs, you rewrite the source of the problem.  Do this repeatedly to prove you are valuable.  Watch out for the black holes, projects that were designed with catastrophic design flaws ten years ago--these are sunken costs that the management cannot let go of--they will ride these unfixable systems into the abyss.

Consulting companies are a way to sample the world, but this can be a dizzying approach.  Probably best for new graduates.  Fancy consulting companies send you all over the world.  Look into that if it applies to you.

Now, for the high achievers out there:  As you are finishing college (or high school) make your own software.  Talk to people who have gone into the IT business world and find out what they would pay money for.

Or, consider the idea of packaging existing software into suites, selling the installation, configuration, customization, and support.

Find the part of the industry that allows you to use your best skills.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Have you considered that maybe the thing you find to be too terse is not Haskell's syntax, but the applicative/functional style?

Haskell's syntax is really simple and intuitive. Taking Python as a counter example (sorry I don't know Ruby)

    def foo(x,y): 
        x2 = x*x
        return x+y

The Haskell is 

    foo x y = 
        let x2 = x*x
        in  x+y

Or, as most would write it

    foo x y = x2+y where x2 = x*x

The main syntax elements here are

- Every statement is a definition of some sort, and the first token is the name of the thing being defined. (Which is _awesome_.)

- Function application is `f x y` instead of `f(x,y)`. Really, not that hard to grasp.

- Local variables are declared in a `let..in` block. A `let..in` block can be moved to the _end_ of the definition by using `where`. This is also awesome because, in pure code, order is irrelevant. So this gives the programmer freedom to ""guide the reader"" through the order of definitions. Declare the high-level stuff first, then expose the details in a `where` block. Of course this also gives the programmer freedom to do the opposite, obfuscate _more_, but that's the fault of the programmer.

The only other major syntax elements are classes and instances, records, lists, pattern matching. Let's ignore records (clearly a language wart.) Everyone _loves_ pattern matching, I don't know how you could have a problem with that. Classes and instances aren't really that terse. 

So, assuming you don't have a problem with any of the above, what that leaves is the applicative style. Stuff like:

    snd . unzip . sort $ zip xs [0..]

which an experienced Haskeller reads _backwards_. ""Tuple each element of x with its place in the list, sort the list, then strip away the xs."" In a more imperative style, you'd write this in the proper order:

    i = 0
    xs2 = []
    for x in xs: 
        xs2.append( (x,i) )
        i += 1
    xs2.sort()
    for x in xs2: output.append(x[1])

The operations appear in the file in the same order that the computer performs them, which is intuitive. (Yes Python has `zip`, but that's borrowed from FP.)


Since you haven't told use what you _really_ have a problem with, just ""the syntax sucks"" I have to make wild guesses here about what's _really_ bugging you. I have a hunch, though, that the ultimate problem is that you're just not familiar with the applicative style, and you're blaming it on the syntax. ","1230828434"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I mean no disrespect, but I'm not sure I believe this argument.  When you talk about terseness, are you talking about some definable metric?  

If terseness means more code in a small space, this is a tremendous advantage.  I hate reading mainstream languages like Java or C because of two things: (1) short functions fill a page, and (2) people don't write short functions.  

If you read it slower, but its density means more functionality per unit codespace, wouldn't you expect to read it slower?  Are you sure you don't just FEEL like it's harder and slower?  In reality, you may be reading the same amount of code-functionality in the same amount of time -- you're just not scrolling as much.  Maybe it's psychosomatic. 

Secondly, I think terseness in Haskell compares favorably with terseness in Python and Ruby, both of which have significant mainstream acceptance.  I do it myself -- you can chain a few blocks on one line in Ruby, making a very dense line of code.  Yet, by spending a little time, it is not hard to understand what it does if you're familiar with the tools.

If you think in conventional imperative terms then of course you can easily understand any imperative program.  To think in Haskell you must first unlearn that imperative mindset.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I thought so after my first two serious attempts to learn Haskell.  I went crying back to Lisp, thankful that they let me revert to my imperative style.  I use a functional style in Lisp, but still like to #'setf things now and then.

It was because I didn't truly believe that forcing myself away from those paradigms would have real benefits.  I considered Haskell to be an inferior language to Common Lisp because it couldn't support other paradigms.

Yet, after my third attempt to learn Haskell, it finally made sense to me.  I began to understand what purity makes you do, and that it actually is a good thing.  It has impacted the way I code in Lisp and Ruby now too, even though I don't have to.

Now I feel that Haskell is a valid language in its own right.  It is true that it limits the paradigm, but it's not necessarily a bad thing.","1230829105"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","here's what happens, as i understand: 

price for Europe is tied to the price of oil with some lag, that is, current price depends on average price of oit about a half year ago. price for Ukraine is fixed and is somewhat discounted comparing to European -- partially because Ukraine won't be able to pay full price, partially to keep Ukraine geopolitically loyal to Russian, and partially because Russia also gets discounted transit price.

as Ukraine gets more aligned with western countries and less loyal to Russia (it even partially supported Georgia in recent conflict), it gets less discounts each year and is going to end up with a full market price in a few years.

this year Putin offered price of $250 per thousand cubic meters, that seems to be a discounted price comparing to 2008 European prices, but prices for 2009 would be much lower as oil prices got lower in the end of 2008, so this price Putin offered is not discounted at all. at same time Gazprom demands deeply discounted transit prices. so it is no wonder that contracts were not signed -- Russia's offers are deeply disadvatageous. and Ukraine cannot find any other gas supplier.. but it has some reserves, at least..

why did Russia offer such disadvantageos contract prices is a question. to punish Ukraine for messing with Georgia and NATO? to lower it afterwards to look generous? end up with compromise solution?

another possibility, Russia is afraid from getting hit from lower oil prices, and therefore wants to make new contracts as profitable as possible.

as for Ukrainian debt, it have payed for all gas delivered through the year, indeed, but Russia claims some more $600m as penalties for late payment. while they might be technically correct, this year conditions were pretty bad -- global crisis, credit crunch etc., Naftogaz was not able to get a loan to pay for the gas to make reserves in winter (it has to make reserves for the winter when consumption is higher, but it has troubles financing it as consumers to not pay in advance), and get a huge hit from hryvna devaluing; and it cannot quickly move to a higher, ""market-value"" prices for consumers because there are lots of poor people who won't be able to afford heating their houses then, and bussiness cosumers already got huge hit this year from shrinking demand for their products.. so bitching about late payments in such situation is not very good, and it might mean worsening relations between countries.

P.S. one more clue on why Gazprom wants Naftogaz to pay all debts in full ASAP -- it have offered to make advance payment for transits so this money can be used for repaying debt. besides that, this in-advance payment will make transit price fixed and low for year 2009. so it seems it doesn't really need that money, they just want to have higher profits in 2009.","1230829222"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The BJP is certainly not too Muslim friendly, but hate is a strong sentiment (though I will agree that there are many in the BJP who would consider themselves anti-Muslim). I do agree with you though that both the BJP and RAW, as well as perhaps a good portion of the population is anti-Pakistan, but anti-Muslim is different.

E.g. Muslims have done nothing but been supportive of the rest of the nation after the Mumbai attacks - they haven't sided with the terrorists of course because they are Indians - why would they support an attack on their country, their people and 2. they are good people - they don't support these awful acts of terrorism.

Anti-Pakistani is a different story altogether. While I'm sure many Pakistani people are fine and great, I'm often disillusioned by the behavior of their leaders. E.g. Why keep demanding 'more evidence' after the Mumbai attacks? Why not try to show at least a little bit of action, along with those [empty] statements of sympathy? When one of the terrorists admits involvement with LeT, why respond by demanding more evidence and then claiming that an Indian was involved in the Lahore bombings?

If an Indian was involved in bombings at Lahore, he is a terrorist, go ahead and arrest him and see where that leads. I never would support terrorist activities. However, what did making a big deal out of this guy's arrest show? Was it just to spite India? This doesn't solve any problems, and their attitude hasn't changed from this mentality for many many years.

So, a majority of people I know are certainly not anti-Muslim, but there are a number of people I know who are unhappy with Pakistan.

I'm sort of tired of Pakistani leaders claiming ""more evidence"" ""more evidence"" ""more evidence""... What do you want? What is it that India has to do to prove that the Mumbai attacks may have had some roots in Pakistan.. And why is that such a big deal to accept? Every country has problems and Pakistan is absolutely not an exception - why not use this situation to accept the problems and try to change, instead of needling India after the nation has just faced difficult situation.

Longtime homeowners complained that the new arrivals brought crime and other troubles. In 2006, violent crime in Antioch shot up about 19 percent from the year before, while property crime went down slightly.

Let's put oil onto the fire, why don't we.

Here's one especially for you, sweetheart: ""A first world country is one within the sphere of American influence"". America by and large has always adhered to the Constitution. That's what was so great about it. Now, the Constitution is dead letter, especially where it matters most. This administration has done everything it wanted to. It has ignored, among others, these stipulations of the Constitution:
- habeas corpus
- ex post facto law
- cruel and unusual punishment
- the right to free speech
- the 5th amendment
- the 10th amendment

and nobody who matters is the least bit interested in prosecuting these crimes.

So, by giving up these innate American standards, the US is effectively outside the American sphere of influence and therefor no longer a first world nation, but a third world nation with some characteristics, admittedly, of a first world nation.

This is just the usual non-scientific argument used by those who “disagree with reality” because they don’t like the political implications of it.

Usually it comes down to moronically arguing that manmade and natural warming/cooling factors can’t exist simultaneously.

Of all the brain structures out there, there are so few which there is only one of; the brain is very bilateral. The pineal gland is conspicuous in this manor. 

The author theorizes that it has a lot to do with stressful events like death and birth because the production of DMT seam to happen when the pineal gland is hit with adrenalin type molecules. DMT is metabolized quickly by the MAO system so it's something that doesn't stick around too which is interesting. DMT can be mesured in the blood and you can see people getting hit with it during REM sleep which is something you need to live and stay sane; you'd go crazy and die without REM sleep.

The Evil Behind the Smiles

By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

Western men who visit red-light districts in poor countries often find themselves surrounded by coquettish teenage girls laughingly tugging them toward the brothels. The men assume that the girls are there voluntarily, and in some cases they are right.

But anyone inclined to take the girls’ smiles at face value should talk to Sina Vann, who was once one of those smiling girls.

Sina is Vietnamese but was kidnapped at the age of 13 and taken to Cambodia, where she was drugged. She said she woke up naked and bloody on a bed with a white man — she doesn’t know his nationality — who had purchased her virginity.

After that, she was locked on the upper floors of a nice hotel and offered to Western men and wealthy Cambodians. She said she was beaten ferociously to force her to smile and act seductive.

“My first phrase in Khmer,” the Cambodian language, “was, ‘I want to sleep with you,’ ” she said. “My first phrase in English was” — well, it’s unprintable.

Sina mostly followed instructions and smiled alluringly at men because she would have been beaten if men didn’t choose her. But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted, and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement.

“Many of the brothels have these torture chambers,” she said. “They are underground because then the girls’ screams are muffled.”

As in many brothels, the torture of choice was electric shocks. Sina would be tied down, doused in water and then prodded with wires running from the 220-volt wall outlet. The jolt causes intense pain, sometimes evacuation of the bladder and bowel — and even unconsciousness.

Shocks fit well into the brothel business model because they cause agonizing pain and terrify the girls without damaging their looks or undermining their market value.

After the beatings and shocks, Sina said she would be locked naked in a wooden coffin full of biting ants. The coffin was dark, suffocating and so tight that she could not move her hands up to her face to brush off the ants. Her tears washed the ants out of her eyes.

She was locked in the coffin for a day or two at a time, and she said this happened many, many times.

Finally, Sina was freed in a police raid, and found herself blinded by the first daylight she had seen in years. The raid was organized by Somaly Mam, a Cambodian woman who herself had been sold into the brothels but managed to escape, educate herself and now heads a foundation fighting forced prostitution.

After being freed, Sina began studying and eventually became one of Somaly’s trusted lieutenants. They now work together, in defiance of death threats from brothel owners, to free other girls. To get at Somaly, the brothel owners kidnapped and brutalized her 14-year-old daughter. And six months ago, the daughter of another anti-trafficking activist (my interpreter when I interviewed Sina) went missing.

I had heard about torture chambers under the brothels but had never seen one, so a few days ago Sina took me to the red-light district here where she once was imprisoned. A brothel had been torn down, revealing a warren of dungeons underneath.

“I was in a room just like those,” she said, pointing. “There must be many girls who died in those rooms.” She grew distressed and added: “I’m cold and afraid. Tonight I won’t sleep.”

“Photograph quickly,” she added, and pointed to brothels lining the street. “It’s not safe to stay here long.”

Sina and Somaly sustain themselves with a wicked sense of humor. They tease each other mercilessly, with Sina, who is single, mock-scolding Somaly: “At least I had plenty of men until you had to come along and rescue me!”

Sex trafficking is truly the 21st century’s version of slavery. One of the differences from 19th-century slavery is that many of these modern slaves will die of AIDS by their late 20s.

Whenever I report on sex trafficking, I come away less depressed by the atrocities than inspired by the courage of modern abolitionists like Somaly and Sina. They are risking their lives to help others still locked up in the brothels, and they have the credibility and experience to lead this fight. In my next column, I’ll introduce a girl that Sina is now helping to recover from mind-boggling torture in a brothel — and Sina’s own story gives hope to the girl in a way that an army of psychologists couldn’t.

I hope that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will recognize slavery as unfinished business on the foreign policy agenda. The abolitionist cause simply hasn’t been completed as long as 14-year-old girls are being jolted with electric shocks — right now, as you read this — to make them smile before oblivious tourists.","1230829968"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","I did some telemarketing once because I was desperate for cash and too lazy to get anything else. I'm convinced it was literally the worst job in the world because there is no good that comes of it. Next to being an actual criminal, this has got be the shadiest job that exists. At least if you work at say McDonalds people are enjoying meals because of your work, they're happy for a little while, you contribute a little to society.

But what I was doing was pushing shitty cellphone plans to random people. And when I say random, I do mean random. We got the numbers directly from the phone book. You'd rip a page and go number by number.

Now, the thing is the only people dumb enough to agree to buy a cellphone after some guy called them are people who can't afford cellphones. And if somehow you get a person that happened to need a cellphone, you're not really helping because they could as well just go any place that sells them and get it there. This would also have the benefit that they'd not end up giving their social security number, address and everything else on the phone to someone who called them. (we needed social security numbers to do credit checks, I don't think it was legal to ask for it, but the bosses didn't give a shit, it was the easiest way to do credit checks and that was that.)

Anyway, what surprised me the most was that the vast majority of people were very polite. I would have expected to get ""fuck you""s all the time, but it was very rare.

As for the most memorable call I ever had, I think it had to be this Asian lady. She didn't understand a single word of French or English (the two languages I know) and thought I was calling about something of major importance. Because I used her husband's name (that was written in the phone book) when I called, she was certain that I had something specific to tell her husband. 

Unfortunately for both of us, he wasn't home and no amount of me saying ""never mind"" or ""don't worry, it's not important I'm just selling cellphones"" would make her stop panicking. Maybe the guy was looking for a job and she thought he would lose it if she didn't take the message or maybe he was an abusive husband and she was scared he'd beat her if she didn't relay the information. I don't know, but I could hear the desperation in her voice. 

It's funny, I was making the most useless phone call in the history of phone calls and she thought the exact opposite. For a good two minutes I was trying to hang up while she was trying to keep me on the line. I felt sad for her, she was terrified.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt; Just wondering where you saw

what?  That a farmer on poor ground can more laboriously produce less wheat than a farmer on fertile ground?

&gt; Value is

a fantastical, fairly-land concept when you try to conceive of it apart it from *human preferences*.  If you say 'value' without the silent 'of -- to whom'. When apples start being sold with little stickers that crudely indicate the labor that went into producing them, then you can possibly see odd people deciding to choose more labor-consumptive products, thinking them of higher 'value'.

&gt; even more people can't even recognise the class division.

You can easily convince a worker that they work and that the firm they work for also has these capitalists.  ""Yeah, so?"" is a likely response.  Even if they are themselves satisfied with their job, their wages, their employer, the 'class consciousness' you desire is really an awareness that the capitalists are parasites who don't do anything, who provide nothing to the firm while sucking on its blood, who pervade society in collaboration with the state to maintain their useless and (by this collaboration) unjustifiable role.  Your desired role is precisely that of the libertarian who wants to show a content citizen that the income tax means [slavery (pdf)](http://mises.org/etexts/rootofevil.pdf), that the state's 'services' are really disservices or inferior to what the market alternatives they suppress, that the fiction of the value of a state is maintained by a corrupted intellectual class, etc.

But even if you have good desires, it's pointless if you base them on wildly erroneous economic theory, if you cannot even accurately perceive the basic *economic conditions* that such a theory would have to explain.

It runs to about 80 pages, but Book VI The Exploitation Theory is in [Boehm-Bawerk's Capital and Interest (pdf)](http://mises.org/books/capitalandinterest.pdf).  The third chapter of it (of Book VI) has this:

&gt; Only a very few representatives of the Labour Value theory form any exception to this rule [-- of simply appealing to Adam Smith or Ricardo, and making no effort to prove what they also did not make effort to prove]; of the these few, however, is Marx.

&gt; An economist looking for a real confirmation of the principle in question might proceed in one of two directions; he might either attempt to develop the proof on grounds involved in its very statement, or he might deduce it from experience.  Marx has taken the former course, with a result on which the reader may presently form his own opinion.

&gt; I have already quoted in Marx's own words the passages relative to the subject.  The line of argument divides itself clearly into three steps.

&gt; First step.  Since in exchange two goods are made equal to one another, there must be a common element of similar quantity in the two, and in this common element must reside the principle of Exchange value.

&gt; Second step.  This common element cannot be the Use value, for in the exchange of goods the use value is disregarded.

&gt; Third step.  If the use value of commodities be disregarded there remains in them only one common property--that of being products of labour.  Consequently, so runs the conclusion, Labour is the principle of value; or, as Marx says, the use value, or ""good,"" only has a value because human labour is made objective in it, is materialised in it.

By this I hope to entice you into reading that, both as a clear statement of the exploitation theory of interest and as a clear refutation of it.  This is not a clear refutation of *all of Marx*.","1230830699"

Which is a little inelegant because you're writing `x, i` instead of `i, x` which has a built-in in Python called `enumerate`. I'm not sure what the point of all this is though, since the thing should just come out in sorted order with no other benefit from numbering its members. Why not just `sorted(xs)`? ","1230830964"

I work as a programmer in a production shop.  I think about the above question a lot.  The production employees are strictly monitored on everything.  Arrival time, quitting time, breaks, lunches, etc.  They can't have cell phones, they can't browse the Internet, they can't talk to loud, they have daily quotas to meet, etc.  I, on the other hand, am often late, often sneak out early, often browse the Internet, often take long lunches, etc.  Take this holiday season for example.  I ""worked from home"" at least 6 days in the last 2 weeks.  And I think we all know what that means (L4D).

Any hardware implementation that computes the modulo operator via a loop is doing it wrong. It's far more efficient to use integer division:

    }

In any case, it's better to use the compiler's implementation than to write your own modulo loop. If you do your own loop, you might fuck it up and cause a halt, as in this case. If the compiler converts a modulo operation to a loop, on the other hand, it's guaranteed not to halt (unless there's a bug in the compiler).

They smuggled jews across the border at night, and by day they would murder the palestinians, steal their land and make it theirs, ready to be counted in the census to make a well funded (from british, french and american investors looking forward to the business opportunities of such a relationship). The palestinians were caught off guard since they had been promised the land and then the Americans stepped in and said hey, we will bomb the shit out of whoever messes with this idea of Israel, so bend over and take it or else.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; You say there is no God. To say so, you must know the definition of God, and God by definition can do anything.

Ok but first you would have to proof the existence of that magic god.

Here is a theory of mine:

I farted the universe out of my ass 5 minutes ago and all your memories were fabricated by my anus. Can you proof it's not the truth? No you can't. You could tell me that it's impossible for an anus to create a universe, but I could tell you that first we need to define my anus and you see, my anus is magic and can do anything. So it can create the universe and all your memories, it's easy for my anus.

But the fact that it is so unlikely and the fact that I have no evidence to back up my extraordinary claim makes it OK for you or anyone else to consider my claim as false. Just because billions of people believe in the holy spirit or the soul or allah, it doesn't make it any less false then my fart theory, and in both case should be denounced as false until some evidences are brought up. That's how science works. A few centuries ago, billions of people beleved that the earth was flat, it didn't make it true.

&gt; However, our belief is that they have been corrupted by having man adding, editing and deleting parts of it.

And, even if your attempt to quit doesn't succeed, don't give up hope, as 50% of people who quit smoking, will relapse within 6months. For many people it takes a few tries before they finally manage to kick the habit.

Suggestions on how to deal with some common withdrawal symptoms:

# 1) Physical discomfort or depression - physical exercise can help, even in the form of a brisk, 30-minute walk

# 2) Insomnia - avoid caffeine and other stimulants, relax before going to bed, try to avoid eating, watching television or discussing problems in bed, make the bedroom quiet and comfortable, and keep a regular bedtime routine *(I should add that using the internet before bed is a bad idea too. Too much decision making involved in browsing and such, which can make it more difficult to sleep)*

# 3) Irritability, frustration, or anger - use relaxation techniques, exercise regularly, reduce caffeine and other stimulants, and try to avoid stress as much as possible

# 4) Anxiety or nervousness - use relaxation techniques, exercise regularly, reduce caffeine or other stimulants, talk to a source of support, and use distractions

# 5) Difficulty concentrating - adjust your daily schedule to lighten your workload if possible, lower your expectations of what can be achieved in a day, and understand the amount of energy and time it takes to quit smoking

# 6) Restlessness or impatience - take short exercise breaks, avoid caffeine and other stimulants, and change the focus of attention

# 7) Increased appetite - eat healthy snacks, do not delay regular meals, drink plenty of water, and exercise regularly

# 8) Cravings - wait for the craving to pass before doing anything (usually 5 min) and use distraction techniques

# 9) Changes in bowel habits, including constipation - eat regular meals, drink plenty of water, eat a high-fiber diet, and limit gum chewing

# 10)Fatigue - exercise regularly, eat regular meals, and plan more rest and short naps

# 11) Cough, dry throat, or nasal drip - drink plenty of water and use cough drops to relieve throat irritation

""**The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity**. In reality today **there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese**. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since **Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism**.

For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem.**However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.**"" Zahir Muhsein, PLO executive, 1977, interview to a Dutch paper.

Sure God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, but two thousand years ago, and what is that to them? There has been antisemitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that? They may perhaps forget in one or two generations' time, but for the moment there is no chance. So, it's simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army. Our whole policy is there.

For example, compared to Ruby, the syntax for lambdas / closures is much cleaner, and there's no annoying ""end""s littering the code.  Haskell's layout-based parsing is much nicer than the naive whitespace sensitivity of Ruby, which tends to lead to excessively long lines of code (or unnecessary named temporary variables, which are particularly sad given Ruby's broken scoping rules).  Symbol.to_proc is a nice hack, but still much uglier than just having first-class treatment of functions.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I think you might be a bit confused about the execution model. Try re-reading the tutorial section with the following in mind -

""Multiple values"" is not the same thing as a list. (Otherwise we wouldn't need the ""each"" function.)

In particular, the `at` function returns a list of results if you give it a list of indices, but that's a special feature of the `at` function - not a general principle.

Normally if you call a function with a list, it gets called once, and takes the list as its argument.

&gt; BTW: are you familiar with parser combinators?

Well, I get the idea, from what you've built. :)

Right now you have them all returning lists. If you rewrite them all to return multiple values, it should do what you want:

    ::sym = {
      :symbol = it;
      { if (input.at(it)==symbol) { it+1 } }; // if the test is false, return zero values.
    };

    ::nil = { { it } };

    ::cat = {
      ::a = it.at(0);          // SWYM: using array to have 2 args
      ::b = it.at(1);
      { .a.b };
    };

      ::a = it.at(0);

&gt; unbelievable how stupid some people are.

Indeed.  

You will never get approved for a CCW in the Bay Area.  Never.  Sorry.  And if you get one in another county and move here, I believe the CCW is considered invalid in a very, very short period of time. 

So no, a CCW is not the answer anyone can reasonably expect when living here.  

Further, without a CCW, her situation is hopeless.

Concealed weapons are covered under penal code section 12025.  In particular, it prohibits:

""... carries concealed within any vehicle which is in his or her control or direction, any pistol, revolver, or firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.""

""...carries concealed upon his or her person any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.""
""...causes to be carried concealed within any vehicle which he or she is an occupant any pistol, etc etc.""

A loaded gun is treated DIFFERENTLY than a concealed gun, and is covered in penal code section 12031.  

In particular, it prohibits carrying a loaded gun of any kind on most public streets and in most public places.  It doesn't matter if it is in the trunk or not, loaded or not, etc.   Past court cases have shown ""loaded"" is interpreted very, very loosely: a bullet can be simply NEXT TO the gun in, say, a car. 

Explicitly, the parking lot of a supermarket is, from the point of view of this law, interpreted as a public place.  (See People vs Vega, 1971)  In general, this is a very fuzzy concept and can vary down to the county level.  


Obviously you do not both live in the Bay Area and have tried for a CCW.  It's a little foolish, then, isn't it, to call someone foolish without doing your homework?","1230831636"

But let's be generous - we'll assume that they are representative of the numbers given. 51.4% of them would therefore have a MS or PhD, giving a total of 629 people. Let's be generous and say that an equal number of people with either bachelor's degrees, or higher degrees in other fields, are reasonably familiar with the professional literature.

All told, that would still only be 1258 people, or 4% of the claimed number. It wouldn't be an inconsequential number, of course, but it certainly wouldn't show that global warming was in any serious doubt. Of course, you could determine *that* a lot easier - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#Surveys_of_scientists_and_scientific_literature","1230831916"

That is a stupid and ignorant remark. No one wanted that in the movie; it's just a silly remark to make batman paranoid. Nobody in reality who isn't already dead want's to see the world burn. Let me explain.

The movie was great though. It had an example of the prisoners dilemma. The Joker had two ships of people loaded with explosives; each ship had the detonator to the other ship. They even used a prison ship so that people in the know would see this was intentional. 

So the Joker went on about human nature and some bullshit but he did not realize that he had set up a great opportunity for a tit-for-tat. All the people in the two ships had to do was cooperate with each other till the situation could end and no one would die. It's like that schizophrenic from A Beautiful Mind said would happen. 

And this is why my space monkeys are building a doomsday device. We are going to give out detonators to everyone so that war will be impossible and there will be no more leaders. 

Think about it. How can you become dictator if someone who you might have to step over will just destroy the world if you make them too crazy? So you think you can starve people to death? No. They blow up the world. Everybody will have to learn how to live with each other in equality and cooperation or I will destroy the world myself. Okay.

You can't stop this idea and have better and better technology. This situation is going to happen. There is no stopping it without total Nazi crazy shit. If it's not the bomb then it's nanobots or genetic bullshit. No we will do this right. Unlike Dr Stranglove we are going to tell everybody before we turn on the doomsday device. We have thought this out from every detail. It's going to be beautiful no matter what happens.

It will work because it is a giant prisoners dilemma. We don't need to assume that people are anything but selfish. We just need to make sure that people know what they are doind when they get the detonator. 

So I have instituted a drug test. Before getting the detonator we will give people drugs so that they can experience what it is like to have hallucinations, visual, auditor, tactile and so on, so that nobody will be fooled again by thinking that God told them to blow up the world. Because that is so stupid. God does not need anyone to blow up the world for him; He's God. 

As we certify that a person is an adult who can handle normal brain malfunctions without getting all religious crazy we will give them all detonators to ""[The Reality Bomb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7SByM_Mctw)""","1230831944"

Now that I'm done whining about irrelevant nonsense, the actualy gameplay of World Tour just doesn't work well. Star Power is communal, but only affects the person who uses it. If a band member fails a song, everyone fails. You cannot save your teammates. It's nice to be able to use star power whenever you like on vocals and drums, definitely, but because you can't use this to save people from failing out it's less interesting.

"programming","t5_2fwo","If you have a child, the probability space is Omega = {B,G}. Assume this is uniformly distributed (which you probably implicitly assume anyways). If you have two children, it's Omega^2 which is the Cartesian product of Omega by Omega, ie {(B,B) (B,G) (G,B) (G,G)}. From this you can see that it's 2/3rds.


Another way of saying this that is more indepth: 

Say you have a random variable X_i whose values are 1 if there is a boy and 0 if there is a girl. Assume 50% chance for either possibility.

Y = X1+X2 can therefore represent the event of having two children- if Y = 2, there are two boys, if Y = 1, there is a mix, if Y = 0 there are two girls.

Now we want to know the probability of Y = 1.

Pr(Y=1) = Pr(X1+X2 = 1) = Pr(X1=0)Pr(X2=1) + Pr(X1=1)Pr(X2=0)

That is, the Pr that X1+X2 = 1 is the probability that (X1=0 and X2=1) or (X1=1 and X2=0). Now of course, X1 and X2 are independent so you can take Pr(X1=0 and X2=1) and get Pr(X1=0)Pr(X2=1).

Now, Pr(X_i=1) and Pr(X_i=0) are both 1/2.

So from the expression we get:

(1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = (1/4) + (1/4) = 1/2.

Thus the chance that you have a boy and a girl is 50%. From this it is obvious why when you know one of the children is a girl, the other is 2/3rds chance a boy.","1230831969"

What I learned when I was in California is that even if a ticket is dismissed when you go to traffic school and even if no points are added to your driving record?....insurance companies can still see that activity, so a record is made, even if no points are assigned.

The third could be a huge science station on a planet, basically anything. The RPG behind SS1 and SS2 was solid, but nothing to write home about - but it didn't need to be.
The whole game hinges on what makes it so damn awesome in the first place: SHODAN. And well, the way she acts and interacts with you. Plot twists, believable behaviour, SHODAN had it all.

And I do not think it's that complicated to re-enact. Far easier than trying say a MoM2 which would need gargantuan considerations for long-term playability, balance and overall scope. SS3 ""just"" needs a SHODAN.","1230832936"

You can see how much simpler the 2/3 reasoning is, which is probably why it is more popular.  In any case, both answers are wrong.  The question was,

&gt; Let's say, hypothetically speaking, you met someone who told you they had two children, and one of them is a girl. What are the odds that person has a boy and a girl?

Personally, I don't have a dog, never had one. But quite often when I meet a nice-looking dog, I just have to stop and pet the dog which usually leads to a conversation with the owner. ( ""Hey, what a beautiful dog! Can I pet him? What's his name? Awww, look how he likes being outside."" And so on and so forth)
I'd imagine that a dog could help on so many levels. I hear they are great friends. They get you to walk regularily. And they are just the perfect conversation-starter in the park or wherever you take them. A dog will easily meet another dog which which would probably leave you to talk to the other dogs owner. People (like me) often want to ask questions about your dog.

I mean, of course you'd have to think about it well and be sure that you'd be able to take care of a dog. But I'd guess there are many dogs out there waiting for a nice person to take them home. And I really imagine, having a dog-friend must be very rewarding. So thing about it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The `$` is the *apply* operator, take the function on the left and apply it to the stuff on the right. It is convenient because it has a low precedence and saves you from writing some parenthesis:

    snd . unzip . sort (zip xs [0..])

Remember that application, i.e.

    f x

is just another binary operator (taking a function and its arguments) - and it has the highest precedence and is left associative. That's where `$` comes in handy - without it (or the parentheses), say

    snd . unzip . sort zip xs [0..]

The application `sort zip` takes precedence over `unzip . sort`, since application has higher precedence than composition (.).

The `..` is stepping:

    [0..5] = [0,1,2,3,4,5]  (default increment is 1)
    [0,2..10] = [0,2,4,6,8,10]
    [1..] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,....  an infinite list

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Agreed 100%.  It's comments like these that make me wish we could turn karma into extra upvotes.

I think io9 has gotten so caught up in drawing extra films under the umbrella of sci-fi that they have misplaced the ideas of what it really means to be science fiction.  In my opinion, sci-fi has something to do with the extrapolation of modern ideas and technology into the future, creating a more extreme world that reflects the society in which it was created (Batman does live in a world with different rules than ours, but they are different socially and dramatically, not scientifically).

So, you get post-apocalyptic films in times of fear about nuclear war, and you get films like WALL-E and Silent Running in times of environmental distress.  But that's obvious.  Really good sci-fi films tell you more about the time in which it was made than any documentary.  For instance, we can see the emphasis on macro-technology in Forbidden Planet, the enormous caverns under the surface that surely must make up the entire core of the planet, or even the hundreds of gallons of whiskey 'synthesized' by Robby.  Nowadays it's all about micro-technology, tiny machines with tons of functions stuffed inside them.  And you can see this in our modern sci-fi.

Bad sci-fi extrapolates only one element and leaves the rest unchanged.  For instance, Gattaca shows a future totally unchanged, that has devolved in some ways, in all but one way, the extreme emphasis on genetic technology.

But io9 has lost track of all this, and simply thinks that sci-fi has something to do with gadgets that don't exist in real life.  Sci-fi is really in a rut right now.  There are almost no good living sci-fi writers, and the concept of sci-fi in films has turned into nothing more than a jumping off point for special effects.

Of course, there are problems with my defintion of sci-fi, because films like Star Wars don't fit in.  Then again, Star Wars was never sci-fi, just myths and cowboys juxtaposed into space.

The majority of sane atheists don't claim to be able to prove there isn't a god, so they're already as close as they're likely to get (assuming there's no god).

&gt;But it's easy to become confused: Is atheism -in practice- the assumption that there is no god or that every religious idea is wrong? Because in my oppinion both concepts are not co-related.

The first one. Most religious people believe that breathing and eating are good ideas, so do atheists.

I have worked for myself since turning 19 and have made a decent living doing so.  I am also married and have a son.  This should not be a problem but in real life when you are young, own a nice house in a nice neighborhood, have two new vehicles and rarely leave the house people start assuming you get your money by illegal means.  

While I have always been an assumed drug dealer by my neighbors the last neighborhood I lived in was the worst.  I had the police called on me no less than 10 times and I cussed them just about every time they showed up.  Calls to police claimed I was fighting with my wife in the middle of the yard, complaining about a trailer parked 2 in front of my house, claiming that I abused my dog and various other bullshit that was 100% untrue.  

I even had a police officer come to my house in plain clothes one day.  She was acting drunk and asking me where to score some weed.  When I told her I didn't smoke and asked her to leave she commented about how strong and sexy I was and hinted at taking care of me sexually if I'd be her drug connection.  

Like I said, constantly harassed.  I have no respect for the police already and these incidents only further solidified my hatred of them.  I am not scared to tell them how I feel and I don't hold my language for anyone.  They refused on multiple occasions to tell me who was filing false reports even though they knew it was all bullshit.  

Look, I know most people are fucking pussies and live their lives in fear but I do not bow down for anyone.

Reddit as a news source has two things which distinguish it from more traditional news sites:  (1) the community gets to choose which stories are the most popular as opposed to an editor and (2) the individual posting the link gets to essentially rename the story with their own headline, adding a line or two of commentary to the posted story or adding more information on the subject to the headline.  

The first feature seems to work well I think, I'm very happy with the content of Reddit, that's why I keep coming back.  

The second feature works great when the person posting doesn't just regurgitate the headline from the original story, a headline usually chosen by editors who often times don't want to offend sponsors, a certain demographic block of readers, or their corporate bosses.  

Headlines sometimes hide the news.  Take this story by the AP, published on Yahoo and then posted here:  

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090101/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_israel_palestinians

The original headline reads ""Israel kills top Hamas figure, escalating campaign"".  If you actually read the story, you discover that the Israeli military dropped a one-ton bomb on the apartment building of a residing Hamas militant, killing his entire family including his four children and several others.  I'm morally outraged by blatant war crime, and so raced to Reddit to submit the story along with my added commentary and the additional fact that an entire family was brutally murdered during the bombing.  In the process I had the opporunity to make the Reddit headline **more interesting** and **more informative** than the original headline.  I was annoyed when I discovered someone had already posted the story with the original AP headline.  Consequently no one up-voted the story and now it sits out in Reddit-outer-space as a wasted news story, unconsumed by the Reddit masses.

This brings me to my proposal.  In order to make Reddit more interesting and more informative, I propose a 'Headlines' sub-subreddit, a separate page linked to from each original post that is not (necessarily) a discussion forum about the story but only a suggested headlines board.  It can look very similar to the existing Reddit layout, with the top headline on the page being the one visible on the sub-reddit page.  

I think this was previously proposed but don't know why it was rejected by Reddit administration.  What do you think reddit?

&gt; India is now in the final stages of completing its investigation into the Mumbai terror attacks. That **would be shared** with Pakistan and others, Mukherjee said. Pakistan, he emphasised, will have to act on evidence India gives to it. “And there has to be credible evidence that they are acting on it.”
&gt; Hindustan Times | December 30th, 2008

^ ""would be shared"" indicating it hasn't been shared yet.

Pakistani media has also been reporting that an FBI team that visited Faridkot, the alleged hometown of the surviving Mumbai attacker, was unable to turn up any evidence of any link to the guy. Even the NIC (national identity card) number supplied by India failed to pull up a match. Of course the Indians are saying this is all part of a cover up.

Interpol has said it received nothing from India. China and Iran, two countries important to India, also say that conclusions about the terrorists' origins shouldn't be drawn until the investigation is completed.

Regardless, Pakistan moved against the LeT charity (even though it isn't associated with LeT anymore) and struck their old camps in Kashmir pretty much just for India.

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt; If social security is cut off and old people die it will be because fascism has taken hold in America

Noooo.... 

It will be due to the fact humans can't seem to understand that unending growth is *bad*.

Social security was built with the idea that growth would just continue forever and it will not.  Between fiat currency value squeeze, and inability to tax corporations properly, population distribution changes and the fact that the population may actually decrease at sometime in the near future, social security is doomed to complete and total failure (fairly quickly I might add).

But the real reason that social security is a pipe dream has to do with politicians.  The social security fund is populated entirely with IOUs.  There's actually no money in it.  It's funded year to year from tax reciepts, but the excess is stripped off and use for current government receipt payables.  Once SS income and SS obligations hit parity, that's when you know the system will be entirely fscked beyond all recognition... and honestly, the tax changes that will have to happen to accommodate that will turn America into a place where you simply do not want to retire.

That's one thing they're not telling you about the Bailout(s).  This is effectively the end to social security (and quite possibly medicare).  The government will go through the motions for a couple of years, but eventually the finical reality is going to be driven home and the government will either choose to terminate SS/medicare or the default on future IOU due to SS (guess which will happen first).

I remember when my grandmother got her first social security check (probably about 7 years before she died).  She laughed at it and called it a joke.  That was in the 1980s.  You will laugh at your social security check too and then, shortly afterwards, you will die.  ","1230833483"

If you actively believe there is a god then you're a theist, anything else makes you an atheist because atheism is about a lack of belief in god. Agnosticism is about knowledge, it has nothing to do with being a theist or an atheist which are about belief or lack thereof. So if you don't actively believe there is a god, you are an atheist, and if you also think the existence or non-existence of god cannot be known for sure, then you're an agnostic atheist.

I actually went from the nasal spray to patches, and then reduced the size of the patch. Don't be afraid to use the nicotine therapy in a (safe) way that suits you rather then the one-size-fits-all advice of the makers.  Also, if you don't like patches, then try a few different brands.

This is because the more stocks you have in a portfolio, the more do their independent up or down moves cancel each other out.

What you are left with is moves which are correlated across many stocks, the existence of which makes sense if you think about the interconnectedness of the overall economy.  Most US stocks depend on each other and are also subject to the same macroeconomic and other market driving factors.

As a result, most stock indexes (which are like large stock portfolios) will be highly correlated with each other.  The correlation is even there between say US and EU indexes, but is weaker.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Using RGB is not about performance, it's about simplicity. Since the hue and value are constants, the only thing that changes is the saturation, which is easily done in straight RGB.

So you think it's simpler to define a color in terms of random string manipulation than explicitly spelling out what the code is supposed to do?  That scares me.

Even without declaring it as a string, it still isn't very clear:

    data RGBColor a = RGBColor a a a
      
    -- shade varies with strength (?)
    colorOfGoodComment score = RGBColor score 1.0 score

That 1.0 is very annoying.  It only exists because you are too lazy to calculate it correctly.  Even if it were right, what do you call it, greenNessOfGoodComment?

Writing what you actually mean is much clearer:

    colorOfGoodComment score = HSVColor pretty_hue score pretty_value


From this, it's clear that the color of a good comment is always the same, but with saturation changing linearly with the score.  From looking at the RGB code, I have no fucking clue what's happening.

I think your other points are wrong too, but I don't feel like arguing them in detail.  The idea is to add a small bit of color.  Coloring every comment on every page will look bad -- try it and see.  All I can say is that I am glad you are bikeshed-painting and not actually writing any code.","1230833978"

* She denies the relationship between HIV and AIDS; she and her followers have a vested interest in seeing that her cause of death is not publicly announced as AIDS related.  
* There is no indication from her family or public health officials that her death was accidental or inflicted.

However, couple of things:

1. The LeT charity you talk about is Jamaat-ud-Dawa. It is a banned charity with direct links to a terrorist organization. Charity doesn't automatically make it a good organization - giving money to a known terrorist organization is not the same as say, Bill Gates giving money through his foundation to vaccinate people. Shutting down this charity was a step in the right direction that Pakistan has taken towards ridding itself of LeT (and certainly is an action appreciated by Indians).

Anytime you use a list in Python, every element is evaluated. You cannot have infinite lists in Python. However, you can have infinite iterators, and use them virtually anywhere you would use a list.

That will probably be devastating to the economy in many member countries - and good for others - but I doubt it results in a weak currency. Problem with Euros is I'd really fear political and economic problems; I don't know what the result of those would be so I'd rather go with more predictable areas.

I disagree. If you choose decent names for items in your where clause, it can make a function much more readable, even if they're used only once.  These contrived examples don't really illustrate this point (`x2` or `xsquared` aren't any clearer than `x*x`).

First, the neoliberals, the ""Chicago boys"", advisors to Yeltsin and the Russians, who only wanted to be ""free"" like us in the United States, helped the Russian Israeli oligrachs to loot the country, in the wake of the implosion of the Soviet Union. Another Friedman ""shock and awe laboratory"".

Then when Putin wrested power from the impending plutocracy, and prevented these same oligarchs from selling Russia's oil and gas assets off to Exxon, imprisoning some, and banishing others to Great Britain and Israel, they get Henry Kissinger to go over to offer Putin the same time-honered offer given to many a U.S. backed dictator: get with the program or be targeted for replacement (elimination).

Next, we got a phoney-baloney missle shield stationed in color-coded revolutionary Poland and the Ukraine, the so-called war on terror inflaming all of muslim, oil-rich middle east and central asia, Pakistan being torn apart, India, hoping to get water and oil from Kashmir and central asia being subjected to a false-flag attack; and now facing nuclear war with Pakistan...all of this basically cutting off all oil and gas supply routes from the middle east and central asia to Russian and China...with Israel just sitting there, waiting, to get all of that oil and NG gas flowing to its terminal in Haifa:

Now we have a global economic crisis, an implosion that originated on Wall Street (U.S. and Israel) wrapping up sub-prime mortgage junk, and then flooding the world with this junk.

But Russia is a parasite because its suffering the same economic fate as the rest of the world, and it's cutting off NG to Ukraine, the same country subjected to an NED color-coded revolt, who just happens to be part of the missle shield, whose sole purpose to undermine Russia?

a. Cold turkey, stop smoking immediately, throw out all ash trays and empty cigarette boxes. If random things give you cravings, remove them from your life for awhile.

b. If you can't do it cold turkey make a list of all the times you smoke cigarettes throughout the day, Then slowly start skipping your regular 'habit' cigarettes, you know like after eating, getting in the car, getting out of the car, etc.

2. Get a sweet drink and keep it in your house all the time, orange juice or apple juice. When you get a craving drink this.

3. Stop drinking or partying for a month, if you smoke when you drink this will be a big hurdle.

4. Get non-smoking friends. Trying to quit with someone else generally doesn't work because the other person 
will give in and you'll eventually give in too because they did.

5. A change of environment might help for the first 3 days, going somewhere you've never been will remove a lot of the environmental triggers and you'll just be dealing with the physical withdrawal.

Say we're building a house: yes, in a big sense we're all ""building a house"", but the plumber only needs to occasionally remind himself of that; day-to-day, he needs to be thinking only of the plumbing. Same for the other people.

Slavery is still very much alive throughout the world in many various forms, all of which should be abolished. But we need to handle each form individually, because they all have different intricate causes (though some of these causes – poverty, no local regulation, twisted cultural mores – are overlapping).

I say this because I work with a non-profit to fight sex trafficking, and we occasionally will have people get downright upset at us for focusing ""only"" on sex trafficking. (As if we literally are walking right by other slaves and shaking our heads, ""no, no, sorry..."") I don't fully understand this. If there's a form of slavery not getting enough attention, get on it! Do something about it! Fix it!

You say ""we risk missing the forest for the trees"", and while I agree that we should not become distracted by the ""glamorous"" win of solving sex slavery at the expense of other forms of slavery, we have to understand that this is a slow and meticulous process, and we can't solve slavery overnight. Most of us have to focus on one particular area in order to accomplish real change; I've chosen sex slavery, you may choose another. Beautiful thing is, our efforts will probably overlap; if you get the government to crack down on brothel owners, and I get the local monks and community leaders to teach their followers how wrong rape and slavery are, we've both just helped each other.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If he really said that, then he had every right to be scared of Pakistan's strength at least. That damned bigot. Pakistan isn't for wiping out Israel, the government and most Pakistanis are for a two-state solution where the Palestinians get the land seized by Isreal in '67 including East Jerusalem.

It's been rumored for almost a decade that when Pakistan went public with its nuclear weapons program, it made a threat to Israel to respond to any attack on its nuclear facilities by wiping out Tel Aviv, and that this is the only reason Israel hasn't carried out strikes. It sounds crazy, but if you think about it... there's nothing else stopping Israel from launching air strikes on Pakistan. Pakistan is always checked by the presence of India to the East, it can never take its eyes off its eastern border to worry about anyone else. There's no way it could respond to an Israeli strike except by launching a nuke, so the military issued that threat.

There's always been a bit of tension though. Pakistan sent a couple (I think 8) of its pilots to the Arab countries during the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War and though they arrived just as the ceasefire was declared in the former, they downed one Israeli plane since hostilities continued for a bit. They got a few more kills in the Yom Kippur War and didn't lose any of their own. And they were flying the crappy MiGs (PAF doesn't have any).","1230834956"

It _is_ a conductor, and so current is able to be induced to flow in it, like any other metal.  In this case the motion of the block through the magnetic field of the MRI machine causes and induced current to flow inside the metal.  Currents in turn produce _magnetic_ fields and the interaction of the induced magnetic field and the MRI field is what is responsible for the effect (and the fact that the electrons are confined to move inside the aluminum block).

"reddit.com","t5_6","This made me think of something that happened while watching a movie with my dad.  I didn't enjoy the movie much, so I'm probably a little off:  
In the movie The Guardian, Kevin Costner is regarded as some sort of awesome coast guard dude that everyone respects and wants to be, and throughout the movie people constantly guess how many people he has saved while out on the water because apparently it's a lot since he is so badass.  Toward the end, Ashton Kutcher's character finally asks him ""So, how many is it really?"" and Kevin Costner's character replies with ""3"" or some really low number and confuses Ashton. The then says ""I don't pay attention to how many I save, it's how many I lost.""  Which then made my dad (a medic and firefighter) cry like a baby.  I rarely talk to my dad about that stuff, but when I finally did ask he just said the hardest thing he had to go through was the first time he entered the house of someone who had been dead for more than a couple of hours. He told me about some lady who had been laying in bed decaying for two weeks until the neighbors called the cops. We're talking crawling with bugs and smelling like absolute disgusting.  Another time he mentioned that when he first started working he became emotional all the time, but after a while you have to look at the person as your job and no longer a human being. The only time he gets upset is when the family members are around to remind him that the person dying is real. I gave him a weird look and he said ""Yeah, that sounds terrible."" But it makes sense, I guess. 
My sister is a respiratory therapist so she's pretty much always there when people die in the hospital, but she only gets really bummed out when she develops a friendship with a patient who eventually dies.  The only time she's admitted to actually crying was when a baby who was abused by her parent's died.  I think I would be able to handle it until the family and friends are around.

But morality does not equate to legality.  If all laws were founded in morals, the government wouldn't exist because they rely on murder and theft to keep themselves going.

We need to abolish DARE and teach kids the truth about drugs.  We need to abolish the PSAs that are created to incite fear and sometimes prejudice against drugs and their users.  The government should not be funding people to tell us what we can and cannot do with our bodies.  The truth about marijuana prohibition should be known to all.

Granted, its true that ""godlessness"" is pretty the definition of ""atheism"", but that doesn't mean that atheists are nihilists.  Nor does it mean that we have nothing to say about the universe, morality, etc.

Started with Slackware, figuring one might as well jump right in and google-learn, which was relatively painless, but compiling everything was rather annoying, so I tried Debian.  I can't say it's terrible, but I was disappointed by the all-or-nothing install process (at least let me choose to leave Gnome out) and want something more bleeding-edge.  Example: installing the KDE 4.2 beta from a repository, preferably with the option to rollback if it breaks something (am I right in assuming that Nix is the only package manager that could do that?)

I have also heard that Arch doesn't even automatically load processes for installed programs, which if fine, but is there at least some sort of check-this-box-to-automatically-configure-this-process notification option?

""The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up. ""

""There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.""

""After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on.

The moderates in Israel who want peace cannot convince their people that there is a way out of this when rockets rain down.

The Kadima party looks to loose to Netanyahu precisely because they are seen as too weak when it comes to the rocket attacks...Israeli's will vote for whoever they feel will end the rocket attaks.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It's the same riddle: two 50/50 chances, we discover the result of one of those events (coin flips, sex of the child, whatever) *but not which of the events it was*, and we have to estimate the chances of the eventual outcome.

People get hung up on the fact that BG (boy-then-girl) and GB (girl-then-boy) both involve one boy and one girl, so they think the two outcomes are identical.  However, the difference is which *order* they occur in.

Obviously having a boy then having a girl is a different sequence of events to having a girl then a boy, so the two outcomes are different.  Sure there's the same number of each sex in the end, but the two cases are *different outcomes*.

If we list the kids in birth-order, we have four final possible outcomes: BB, BG, GB, GG.

All we know is that *one* of the kids is a girl, so we have to eliminate BB.  This means that the remaining outcomes are BG, GB and GG - in other words it's twice as likely that the remaining child is a boy.

If it makes it easier to understand, imagine we ignore the order the kids arrive - then BG and GB are the same outcome.  However, because there are two different ways to *get* to this outcome we have to *add* the BG and GB probabilities together to get the probability of ""a girl and a boy in any order"".

Since all the probabilities are equal, this means that the chance of ""a boy and a girl in any order"" is *twice as big* as the chance of ""two boys"" or ""two girls"".  We know we've already eliminated the chance of two boys, and the chance of ""one of each in any order"" is twice as big as ""two girls"".  This means that the chances are 2/3 it's ""a boy and a girl in any order"" and 1/3 it's ""two girls""... the same as if we treated ""BG and GB"" as separate outcomes, and all the probabilities were the same.

Your reasoning does work if we found out *which* of the kids the girl was, but this is a new piece of information that we didn't already have.

For example, we have four possible outcomes: BB, BG, GB, GG.

If (for example), we found out that the girl with the friend was the *oldest* child, then we'd be able to eliminate two possibilities: BB *and* BG.

This leaves only GG and GB, so there would then be a 50% chance the other child was a boy.

However, in the riddle *as you posted it*, all we know is that the girl is ""young"" (not the young*est*), so we have no information as to which of the children she is.

Hence we have to reason according to the *first* case above, and not your version (because we don't know which of the children she is).

It's deeply counter-intuitive, but fascinating once you get your head around it.  I guess that's what we get for reasoning about complex mathematics with a brain designed for hooting at the monkeys in the next tree. ;-)","1230836203"

To me it seems weird because the pulse amplitude, which is the pulse pressure defined as ""systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure"" would increase due to generalized arousal. If I ran a lap my pulse pressure would increase--the systolic would increase from higher cardiac output and the diastolic would increase from peripheral vasodilation. 

If a woman saw something disgusting on video, it would not sexually arouse her, but could agitate her and make her systolic blood pressure go up. Her vaginal pulse amplitude would then go up.

This is particularly a concern since the study is saying women get turned on by lots of things they don't think they are turned on by.

    var lotsOPrimes = getPrimes();

    foreach(int p in lotsOPrimes)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(p);
    }

    IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; getPrimes()
    {
       var i = 1;

              yield return i;
           i++;
       }
    }

That will eventually fail from an integer overflow, but it is lazy evaluation. If I just wanted the first 5 primes, I could grab them from getPrimes without it calculating any more than that.

    // Just get 5 primes from 
    // our lazy evaluated prime generator
    var lotsOPrimes = getPrimes();
   
    foreach(int p in lotsOPrimes.Take(5))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(p);
    }

EDIT: Since people seem to think that terse code is good code:

With the help of a little helper extension:

    static class Extentions
    {
        public static void ForEach&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; src, Action&lt;T&gt; action)
        {
            foreach (T s in src) { action(s); }            
        }
    }

I can now boil it down too:
     
     // Get 100 primes.
     getPrimes().Take(100).ForEach(p =&gt; Console.WriteLine(p));

The reason for using the ListOPrimes up above was to prove that it truly was lazy.

hey... that's what I said.

&gt; Unless they're buying about 30% under current prices, anybody who'd buy a home now is being very foolish.

Oh, I absolutely agree.

Right now is not the time to buy.

...but if you buy outright when the time is right, there's nothing like owning your own home.

Historically home prices have generally increased in value (if you don't count the improvements people put into their homes)... so, from that regard, buying a house is pretty much a sure, long bet (but not right now and not at current prices).  If you look at the long term interpolated home value increase, home prices (on average and in aggregate) should be between $140k to $160k.  Typically whenever there is a 100% increase short term bubble that crashes, there will be an overshoot in the correction.  I would not at all be surprised to average home price drop to as low as $120k... and that's when you buy.  

I think you're off on your 30% estimate.  From my prospective, that's hopelessly optimistic (towards the home valuation side of the equation).  It's not like these real estate bubbles haven't happened in the past (there's very reliable data that can be used to demonstrate what happens).

"Python","t5_2qh0y","&gt;I am saying that I find it totally unacceptable for a language to
&gt;pretend that such a file doesn't exist.

This all started when you said that file names should be thought of as
byte arrays, and I said they are supposed to be strings.  No one's
pretending they're guaranteed to be strings, not even Python 3.

&gt;It can happen for lots of reasons; problems in fsck, or malicious (or
&gt;stupid) users, encoded filenames, sfs data symlinks, and so on.

Maybe you've mistaken me for Python 3.  ""Encoded filenames"" doesn't
belong on that list because I'm talking about files whose names are not
strings--in any encoding.

I'm also not denying they occur.  I'm saying they're not supposed to.
They shouldn't be considered valid (which is not to say that all
programs should detect and reject or omit them).

As for the ways they can happen, well, that's the difference between
""supposed to"" and ""guaranteed.""

&gt;I typically use random filenames (using 8-bit set) for temporary files

Ah, now that's what I'm talking about.  Don't do that.

Use a string.  If you want more randomness, use a longer string.  It's
worth it to use things the right way and avoid a lot of potential grief.

Besides, you shouldn't be relying on the randomness of the name to
prevent collisions.  Opening with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` will fail on a
collision, so call it in a loop and use enough random characters that
you rarely have to repeat.

Better yet, use a library.  Most languages have libraries to do it for
you (using a string like `tmp.a6cf99`) written by people who know much
more about creating temporary files than you or I.","1230836712"

* This is not an ""energy"" tax: it is targeted at a specific energy product. Nor would a carbon tax be an ""energy"" tax.

Energy use in itself is already internal to the market.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;the author keeps comparing us to other animals, he didn't even mention primordial homo sapien society, such as the ones preserved in the aborigines, or the tribes mentioned in the ""Science of Good and Evil"" by Michael Shermer

last time i checked, no one was around 200,000 years ago to report on the prevalence of rape and male dominance in primordial homo sapiens =)

if by ""primordial"" you mean contemporary hunter-gathering societies (though societies is a stretch since these groups rarely have any permanent membership), dominance of any sort is almost universally discouraged, and quite a few hunter-gatherers are pacifists, like the agta. almost all are egalitarian and lack any words for ""chief,"" ""head man,"" or ""leader.""

reputation in these ""societies"" is typically only as good as your last success or failure (not unlike hollywood).

also, no current cultures, hunter-gatherer or otherwise, are ""preserved;"" all cultures are continually in flux and evolving (some anthropologists believe that many contemporary hunter-gatherers, like the san, may have flip-flopped between agrarianism, pastoralism, and hunter-gathering throughout their existence)

however, much like the point in the original article was making in regards to the variety of gender relationships and hierarchies found in the natural world (and thus the stupidity of relying on it to say what should and should not be the case in human relationships), there is considerable variety in the hunter-gather world in this regard too.

here's a good book to read, by people who actually have made a life studying hunter-gatherers:

http://books.google.com/books?id=zFhzH9YHOWwC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=respect+and+equality+in+hunter+gatherer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fpwgIW3UY-&amp;sig=l6Fnj3iGFd9A2V5k8PHe3XN_Ofo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1

ps: is the micheal shermer you wrote about that guy who heads the skeptics society? if so, he isn't an authority and can only report based on a literature review of the available enthnographies--which had he done so, he should not have concluded anything like what you assert in your comment about ""primordial homo sapiens,"" simply because the overwhelming bulk of the literature about hunter gatherers states the exact opposite.

pps:
&gt;Isn't there a feminist reddit that this should go in? Or some other reddit, maybe? Because this certainly shouldn't be in science

Unfortunately, the term is being distorted because it hasn't been around long enough to be commonly understood before the hype and buzz around it started to build. The word ""cloud"" is sufficiently evocative that people have hijacked it for their own uses.

For the end user, cloud computing should be transparent. Stuff should just work, including sites experiencing unusually heavy traffic. It shouldn't matter to the end user whether sites manage their load by provisioning new servers from a cloud or by owning plenty of hardware.

For somebody who wants to create a dozen servers to run tests or crunch some numbers, then shut them down, cloud computing is cool for a variety of reasons.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I was trying to demonstrate how local variables work in each language, so it's irrelevant that x2 is only used once. 

My Python is not that great, so thanks for improving my second example, but you've made it totally applicative! Your one line reads right-to-left:

1. `itertools.count()` : create a sequence of numbers (I assume)
2. `zip (xs ...` : tuple each in this sequence with the elements of `xs`
3. `sorted(..` : sort the list
4. `[ i[1] for i in ...` : extract the second element of each tuple.

This is the order in which the interpreter executes it. My point was that _this style_ of writing programs is unintuitive for people who read left-to-right, because it's backward. Haskell's syntax has nothing to do with it. (I'm just assuming that this is what OP really has a problem with. Most people see long, applicative expressions and think ""woah that's some crazy syntax"" but its really not.)

Object oriented and stack languages are much more intuitive in this way (An imaginary object oriented example) :

    xs.zip(itertools.count()).sort().map(lambda x: x[1])

Which, you can do in Haskell

    (.&gt;) = flip ($)
    xs .&gt; flip zip [0..] .&gt; sort .&gt; map snd

Lots of Haskell newbs define something like `.&gt;` this way, just to get used to the concepts. After a while you stop needing it.","1230837331"

"programming","t5_2fwo","It depends upon what ""writing for the processor"" is supposed to mean. There are definitely contexts in which, e.g. data type definition is prescriptive--such contexts include device driver development, thread schedulers dealing with registers and stack frames, and the like. It's true that Haskell, OCaml, etc. are not appropriate in these contexts, although something like [BitC](http://bitc-lang.org) may prove to be.

But for the overwhelming majority of application domains, data type definition is not prescriptive; the language implementation has considerable latitude with respect to both data structure representation (typically realized in padding and alignment strategies) and code generation. In some cases, exemplified by the link I gave in my previous post, you might have performance-sensitive application-level code (gaussian elimination) which can be made optimal in some special cases based on parameters that aren't even known until runtime, and it can still be a win to generate the specialized code at runtime and run it vs. having the best-optimized code that you can generate statically at compile time, and it's possible to still do this type-safely. We're also starting to see this general philosophy show up in infrastructure such as [LLVM](http://llvm.org). The point is just that it isn't always a win to ""write for the processor,"" whether by that you mean ""write in C"" or ""write in assembly language."" Those are useful tools when data type definition needs to be taken as prescriptive. Under most other circumstances, there are superior ways to achieve both performance and safety goals.","1230837385"

http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000291661

The deal is that your photo is sent to Amazon, and a HUMAN will find the best Amazon match for the photo. This happens in usually only 1 minute or so.  It's pretty effective!

But it's also great fun. You can even play games like ""can they identify this obscure and blurry picture of my old Led Zeppelin album"". (answer, yes, they had no problem.)
Or ""If I take a picture of MYSELF, what's the best Amazon item  they think corresponds to it?""  (I got a picture frame recommended.)
I picture of my girlfriend and I got a book recommendation, ""Perfect Marriage"" (whooooo!)

But you can also play games! Take a piece of paper and write ""The most outrageously expensive item on Amazon"".  Photograph it and wait for an answer! (When I tried it, I got a $750,000 diamond).

Trivia hunt!  I wrote ""A biography of the mother of an obscure US President"" and I indeed got a biography of Abigail Adams.

Recommendations! I wrote ""I'm bored, what's your favorite book?"". Took the photo, and 30 seconds later, Amazon recommended Asimov's ""Foundation"".  [Good choice!]

Even mini-interviews. ""How many pictures have you classified?  Pick an item with the number in the title"".  I got a link to ""200 vacation destinations.""

Kudos to Amazon for the entertainment. If you have an iPhone, it's a great toy. It's also great for screwing with your friends heads since they will believe it's your phone that's somehow automatically recognizing your mouse brand or a doorknob.

I think they have a script that they query which then checks if the username was taken and returns the result and they have to hit that script each time to check any site. 

A better solution would be to just launch a few threads once the script is hit and return the results in batches. For example have a query ID (could be the username) witch each initial query launch the threads which put the data in the database and then hit the script which checks if a query for that username has been started if so it gets the data from the DB, else it starts the threads, once the threads finish running either with or without errors, just mark the request as finished in the DB and have a ""finished"" flag returned in the results to the javascript so the javascript on the page knows to stop hitting the script.

Or if they don't want to use threads they can probably use asynchronous I/O. In any case if they have enough processing power they they would be able to check all sites in the time it now takes to check one.","1230837547"

Actually, he (I assume) does have a point (of sorts).  

I live in the region, and I'm aware that trafficking of people occurs too often.  It's a real problem - drug addicts, gamblers, alcoholics, the desperate, etc. sell children into indentured servitude to pay off debts.  I don't doubt that _some_ indentured servants (let's call them slaves, because that's what they are - at least until their family's debts are paid) are grossly mistreated and their ""owners"" need to be rounded up and appropriately punished.  However, most (of age) working women here do so by choice; choice limited by educational opportunities and economic circumstance no doubt, but choice nonetheless.  And it is true, I know because I hear about it constantly, that some people here think it's funny and know it's profitable to tell stories of horror and degradation, grinding poverty and terrible misuse to naive westerners (including journalists for major newspapers).

For the record, this story sounds plausible, and on a human level I'm totally disgusted by it.  However, it's also important to be aware of the geopolitical context:-

Since striking oil, Cambodia has begun develop and to shrug off the corrosive influence of western NGOs which do not appreciate this.

And if you're doing that each and every time, cussing out people doing their job by responding to a call rather than the asshole neighbors who are trying to cause trouble for you, no freakin' *wonder* the cops don't like you.

So yeah, sounds like you've earned their scorn.

And even then, it sounds like MOST of the problems are coming from YOUR end. You roll right in with an attitude problem, hell, what do you want, hugs and kisses?

I mean, seriously. ""Argh, look at me! I'm a tough guy fighting for my rights!""

No, you're not, You're a shithead. A whole lot of talk, but none of it disguising the fact that you're a shithead.

A lot of people have very legitimate reasons to dislike the police, and I respect and admire their tenacity in telling it like it is. You? No. You're just a shithead.","1230837897"

Simple Golf Swing Tips

If you follow these golf swing tips, you can be just as good as the pros someday.

There is no argument that golf is very popular.

Those rockets are virtually harmless. Israel simply wants an opportunity to slaughter innocent Palestinians. A much better way to stop the rockets would be to stop the occupation, dismantle the settlements, return to 67 borders and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees.","1230837940"

* USA will remain in the doldrums with housing prices falling and recovery not appearing on the horizon until the 4Q 2009. Canada will keep the US company in misery but with less turmoil and slower price declines. Unemployment there will be consistently higher than in the US however.
* China will suffer in the first half of 2009 mostly by feeling lack of external demand. This will force them to spend some of their surplus at home to drive up the demand domestically. They may engage in some sort of massive public works program.
* Ireland will be the biggest economic casualty among the EU15 nations. Their newfound wealth will be exposed as a Ponzi scheme much like that of Iceland. The UK will be shafted but not as bad as Ireland. Germany will be relatively unscathed as their cultural aversion to credit means they've flushed out of the system most of the shite credit.
* There will not be a large conflict in the Middle East. Also there won't be a terror attack of any significance in the western world. India-Pakistan relations will be the most serious international crisis of 2009. Followed by tension between Russia and one of her neighbors. Either Poland or Ukraine.
* A disruptive technology will come along and boost interest in internet startups. This will most likely be an application of weak AI in pattern recognition. Most likely some sort of pattern recognition algorithm that will find application in network security and data mining of all social data gathered by web 2.0 companies like facebook or reddit.
* Clean energy will remain the unfulfilled promise. The most worthwhile alt energy projects will be around boosting insulation not generating electricity from wind and sun.
* Obama will be hailed as a miracle worker because of a lack of an all out collapse in the US economy. His stimulus will add to debt and provide a bit of cushion for the worst affected states but will do little else to boost the economy. He will make one rookie mistake in foreign relations for which he will be castigated by the right wing talk radio. The republicans will manufacture a mini scandal connected with his stimulus plan.

The other portal could be on a different box, and the pipe could exit there, and begin wrapping in a big circle around the box. Because the portals keep the end of the circularly bent pipe from coming back around and ramming into the pipe bending machine, you can easily set up a situation wherein you're bending a circular pipe that doesn't just bend around 360°, but that can bend way beyond that. It's like a short spring, but all in the same plane. It's not something that can exist in our world, as the coil would have to come around pass through the beginning of the coil again, but because the portals are out in the middle of the room on walls just big enough to hold them, the spring can come around 360 and miss itself, as it's displaced.

The easy answer is that it's irrelevant - we're not considering *who* the children are, merely whether they're a girl or a boy.

When reasoning about coin-flips, you don't worry about *which* coin it is, or what metal it's made of, or which currency it is... merely whether it lands heads or tails.

The harder answer is that if we start taking into account the *individual identity* of the child, then we have to take into account all the other individual identities that child could have had... so we start having to consider how many sperm could have fertilised the egg, or how many other partners their mother/father could have had, etc.

At this point we can conclude that it's *astronomically unlikely* that the child at home would be the precise child they are... but that tells us nothing about the chances it's a girl or boy.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; ... the problem could have been posed as ""...at least one of them is a girl..."" which is what the common sense reading already says.

Here we have the heart of the issue.  Not everyone agrees that this is the common-sense position.  I was not being facetious by asserting that the real answer is 100%.

I wrote out an explanation of the 100% reasoning, but it seemed so obvious that I omitted it.  The problem states that someone has told you, ""I have two children, and one of them is a girl.""  In spoken English, when someone tells you that there are two objects, one of which has a property, they are implicitly stating that the other one does not have that property.  This is not ambiguity; it's how regular people communicate.

Here are scenarios that correspond to the three functions:

twoThirds: You are at a party and ask a parent whether they have at least one girl.  They say yes.  What is the probability that the other child is a boy?

half: Select a girl at random from a two-person family.  What is the probability that her sibling is also a girl?

otherHalf: You are at a party and see a parent standing with a girl.  The parent introduces the child as their daughter and add that they have another child around here somewhere.  The first member of the pair is therefore not the older sibling, as in the usual interpretation, but the sibling about which you first obtain information.  What is the gender of the other child?

For comparison, 100%: You are at a party talking to a parent.  The parent says they have two children, and one of them is a girl.

On a lighter note, everyone's favorite game is spot-the-logic-error, right?  If the 2/3 reasoning is correct for girls, it must be correct for boys as well.  Therefore, it doesn't matter which gender the child has.  Therefore, the reasoning can be applied to a parent without knowing which gender the child has.  Therefore, there is a two-thirds probability that a family will have two children of different genders and one-third that the children will have the same gender.

Anecdotal evidence is not evidence. It can mean two things, in this case it's unverified hearsay (i.e. bullshit) or it can be factually correct but irrelevant to the thing which it tries to prove.

&gt;Before science could prove that the Earth revolves around the sun, you would have called that belief ""irrational

You're right. I wouldn't have accepted that without evidence and it would indeed have been irrational to believe that without evidence. There were two competing theories, without evidence they both would have been of equal value. If there were a third theory that postulated even more unproven things, like a hand of god guiding the earth around the sun, I would have said that the most rational thing to do is to reject the magic theory for now and be undecided between the two more rational theories until more evidence is found. The theory that earth revolves around the sun is also testable and falsifiable which makes it a much better theory than your ""God exists"" theory.

What you really don't seem to get is that there are an infinite number of things that might be true but cannot be proven true. Infinite is not just a big number. It's infinite. It would be irrational to claim that one such unproven thing must be true while it has just as much evidence as the infinite number of other things. Just like there's no good reason to believe that Christianity is true and all the other religions are false.

&gt;It's very possible that science hasn't caught up with religion yet.

Well yeah, it's logically possible but the probability of that seems low. I don't know of a single instance where religion got it right first and science followed (Do you? If so, please provide some sources, I would be very interested in these). On the other hand many religions have revised their views after science has made new discoveries. While science is making progress, religion is trying its best to keep things the same.

&gt;Love, God, and joy may seem irrational by today's secular standards

There's nothing irrational about love or joy. They are human emotions which can be studied. The chemicals involved can be traced and examined and MRI can be used to investigate brain regions that seem to be involved in producing these feelings. They can even be artificially amplified or suppressed. And there are good reasons for these feelings to have evolved.

Hamas is condemned by Egypt, banned in Jordan, and ignored by Syria. Because of Hamas and similar ideologies, other countries' interest in gazans' well being is only symbolic. They do not want to be associated with crazy gun toting religious fanatics. Gazans are abandoned by everyone and left alone facing a situation in which they unwittingly attacked a powerful enemy.

You are just mouthing the same nonsense you have unthinkingly taken on board and portray as truth.

Racist is a term like ""homophobe"" like ""sexist"", like many other terms that people throw out to label and minimize others opinions. If I label you a racist then I don't have to listen to what you are saying, I have created a heuristic, a mental shortcut. 

You throw the term out to give yourself an easy way to address my views without having to think about it.

Its a simplistic way of thinking and predominates among shallow superficial individuals.

Palestinians are getting what they deserve precisely BECAUSE of the actions they have taken in the past. 

If they stopped being collectively fucking morons then they would stop being killed. Until the time comes and they continue to rage against Israel they will continue to die.

And guess what, the world doesn't care, its had enough of the Palestinians as well. 

Sure you get the arab nations raising their voices a bit, but they are not actually wanting to DO anything. Egypt hates Hamas as much as Israel. 

The west just want peace because its a bloated corpulent being that slumbers in its own consumerism and doesn't like conflict because its bad for business. 

The only people who are really upset is Iran. And thats because they armed and trained its fighters and see their investment in war and death being lost.

I guarantee that 2 weeks after this stops, there will be no more mention in the media until some Palestinian suicide bomber takes out the bus station in Tel Aviv and kills women and children because THATS what they do best.

And then they will get bombed again, of the borders will be closed again.

Three types of organization gain from this situation, Iran, munitions suppliers, and the media. No one actually cares for the Palestinians themselves.

Show me one arab nation that is willing to take refugees from Gaza? Jordan HATES its Palestinians, as does Lebanon.

It just removes some noise from the definition of the function. In your example, `f` is the same as `sin` (because `f x = sin x`), so `f = sin` would do the same thing with less noise (not `f x = sin`).

Think of it this way – if your function does the same thing as a combination of other functions, why does the argument need to be defined?

    f x = sin x

could be easily simplified as:

    f = sin

A more complex example:

    f x = (a . b . c . d) x

could just be written as

    f = a . b . c . d

because all it's doing is combining those functions to act on an argument. I suppose you could think of it like simplification. In math, `5 / 1` is the same as `5`, so we just write ""5"".","1230838487"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, you are correct to state that agnosticism is a belief that the existence of God cannot be known. I don't recognise your definition of atheism. Perhaps you should read some [Bertrand Russell](http://www.luminary.us/russell/atheist_agnostic.html):

&gt; ""I cannot prove that either the Christian God or the Homeric gods do not exist, but I do not think that their existence is an alternative that is sufficiently probable to be worth serious consideration. Therefore, I suppose that that on these documents that they submit to me on these occasions I ought to say ""Atheist"", although it has been a very difficult problem, and sometimes I have said one and sometimes the other without any clear principle by which to go.""

Where did you get your definition of atheism from?

The OED defines ""atheism"" as ""Disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of a God"", where disbelief and denial are both forms of belief. They are forms of belief which are negative to another belief. Note that what you define as atheism is an *unbelief* in God, where a disbelief is a *positive unbelief*.


**Edit**: Note that *The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy* recognises this conflict: [atheism is] ""the view that there are no gods. A widely used sense denotes merely not believing in God and is consistent with agnosticism. A stricter sense denotes a belief that there is no God...""

**Edit 2**: Britannica 1911 defines atheism as ""literally a system of belief which denies the existence of God"".","1230838509"

Some main points from what I've found so far:

- GPLv2-licensed kernel, 3-clause BSD license for userland;
- originally from the Asbestos project, started in 2005;
- runs on AMD64, x86, and Sparcv8; there's also some code in there for ARM and LLVM, and something or other about an FPGA-based CPU;
- appears to be not actually capabilities-based, although its open approach to creating new labels gives some of the advantages of capabilities;
- you can boot it in QEMU or Bochs (and presumably on real hardware as well);
- they have run a number of programs on it, including vim, some shell, Perl, sshd, gcc, and ClamAV.

I will probably write stuff about it on kragen-tol and/or kragen-fw after I read the papers.

Yes, of course.  Contrary to your perception, I think most people understand this and understand that it is wrong and causes suffering for Israelis.

It's interesting that whenever Israel performs immoral acts or acts of terrorism, the Israel ""supporters"" quickly point to another evil organization's behavior as though it magically negates any immoral acts.

I'm curious, when Israel was engaging in terrorism by subjecting the general Gazan population to sonic booms, what was your attitude?  What method did you use to rationalize this primitive behavior?

&gt; The very land they live on was disengaged by the Israelis in a gesture of good-will towards them

If you truly believe this then you aren't as heartless as you seemed.  However, I truly find it hard to believe that you are unaware of the numerous operations, both from the ground and air, that the Israelis have performed over just the past few years.","1230838771"

A church has to pay no taxes, but a secular humanist establishment is not granted that same benefit.  Also, atheists are commonly discriminated against, while it is ASSUMED that everyone is a Christian.  The president, at one point (not dubya, his father maybe), said that atheists are not Americans.  It's shit like that that make atheists hate the faithful and go out of their way to make a point of it.

I think the people you refer to are militant atheists.  I'm not a militant atheist, not usually.  As soon as someone tries to make themselves better than me or gain something over me by justifying it with their religion, then I become a militant atheist.

"religiousdebate","t5_2qq6l","That's all still very nebulous evidence that brings no hard ties. The Talmud said a man with a similar story to Jesus' lived who had a similar name. When was this story added to the Talmud? If it wasn't contemporary to the time just after his death then it could just be a second-hand addition with no real evidence even when it was added. The story could be a cross pollination for Jews of the time to have as a way of explaining the resurrection story in a way that allowed them to draw the conclusion that he was a mortal man. That sound equally plausible as either a story added to prevent bleeding followers to a new cult or a story of a real man.

That there was a reference to a contemporary priest of the time in the new testament for whom a possibly matching grave was later found is unsurprising. When constructing a story set in one's time it's useful to tie it to real figures or places. Just because there's a real Washington DC doesn't mean that there was a historic link between it and movie characters that blow up the white house.

Just playing devil's advocate here, that's not an impossible scenario to have as corroborating evidence, but none of it is a real hard evidence of a historic Jesus' existence. It could be supporting of any other hard facts that come up though.","1230838879"

Kristof's role is to appeal to women in the U.S., and the way he does this is by stories about overseas brothels or the injustices women face in Islam.  The hope on the part of racist Jews is that every woman so horrified becomes a vote to bomb Mecca.

We saw this most graphically with his recent story about the woman whose face was disfigured terribly by an acid attack.  The story featured a photo of what had happened to the woman.  Of course, what is interesting about this is that we are in the middle on an illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq, a war that The New York Times spared no ink to push upon the American people.

They present us with shocking pictures showing us the result of violence when Muslims commit it, but when it is Jews in Israel or Americans in Iraq who are committing the violence the camera lens seems to never come off.

2) Property prices will fall 12% Y/Y from today's levels according to the case schiller 20 city index.

3) The USD will remain strong through mid-Q2 2009, eventually the inflationary policies of the fed will kick in, the US *may* default on debt, and the dollar will devalue

4) Peak unemployment in the US as officially reported will hit 10%, but not exceed it by very much.

5) Late 2009 will be the nominal ""bottom"" in housing prices

6) At least five more community banks and one major bank will file bankruptcy or require previously unannounced government intervention in the united states.

7) Some time this month, large companies will announce large numbers of layoffs and pay cuts, starting in the technology sector. I wouldn't be surprised to see some cuts at HP later this week.

8) As the dollar declines towards the end of the year, the pressure on the unemployment rate will drop, and offshoring of jobs will become somewhat less profitable.

9) Commodities will retreat in Q1, but will rise substantially by the end of the year, to about 2x their current level (using DBC as an index)

10) Oil will retreat to the low $30s again, but will end 2009 at about $100.

11) Commercial credit markets will unfreeze due to policy maker actions at about the same time that the next panic (likely related to mortgages) begins -- this will provide a myriad of opportunities for mining, dryshipping, and other capital intensive companies with good quick ratios and poor long term debt to equity ratios.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; It wasn't a response. Ethnic cleansing is the logical conclusion of Zionism and the Jewish Immigration Law.

If you believe in time travel and magical thought, that is certainly the conclusion you may make.

&gt; Yes, it's not like there were any Jewish terrorist groups trying to remove Arabs before Israel was formed...

Jewish terrorist groups did not exist until arabs started attacking jews - and **arabs did not do it out of their own volition but under incitement of foreign governments who wanted a piece for themselves and histrionic press**.

&gt; Sounds like the Zionists again.

There are extremists which believe in ""greater Israel"". Their crazy dream will never come true.

&gt; Was it not the Israelis who ethnically cleansed the Palestinians? Your descriptions seems to match them.

There are now two million of ""palestinians"" who are Israeli citizens, and who want to remain Israeli citizens and not subjects of arab countries; who are lawyers, doctors and members of the parliament. Worst ethnic cleansing ever.

&gt; Do tell me in which conditions genocide and slavery are justified?

Genocide and slavery are never justified (even though one must distinguish between owning slaves and being a slave of the state by paying taxes etc). Genocide is a systematic slaughter of a group of unarmed people in order to eliminate that group. To call the armed conflict between terrorist gangs and IDF ""genocide"" merely because IDF possesses superior weapons and training is absurd, because nothing that we have done so far was even remotely close to an attempt to eradicate all ""palestinian"" arabs, and most of it was done in self-defense. Slaughter of hundreds of thousands of arabs would be genocide. Casualties of the armed conflict among civilians and death of militants are not, by any measure, genocide, because they do nothing to erase the arab population. Recently the left realized their stupid mistake and renamed genocide to ""slow motion genocide"", so that they can still say genocide while no genocide actually occurs. 

Fact is, this conflict so far has taken much less lives than many other conflicts, and it has a real chance of final resolution to satisfaction of everyone if islamic fundamentalists (and jewish extremists!!) are excluded from it, either by law or by force of arms.

These studies are designed to follow cohorts of HIV-infected women and their infants and to extend the follow-up period of study subjects for as long as possible. The major risks of ARV exposure to noninfected infants fall into the following categories:

I don't think you'd have the suburbs or the Ford Model T though. A post-fossil-fuel reboot of civilization would probably look more like Japan: dense super-cities linked by electric rails and powered by renewables and eventually also nuclear power (once they re-discovered it).

Fossil fuels are convenient, but they're also dirty and limiting. There is a sort of ""oil is the only possible energy source, we're all doomed!"" religion out there. A little bit of thought and creativity blows that idea away, but it has its adherents. I sometimes wonder if its oil company propaganda.

I wonder too if we need a reboot for ideas like these to be explored fully. The real problem with our civilization seems to be bureaucratic arteriosclerosis coupled with stuffy credential-ism and conservatism. We seem to have passed our innovation prime and have entered an era where credentialed priests once again preside over hierarchical bureaucracies that preach to the choir.

In addition, if the debt is denominated in dollars, there is a demand for dollars in order to repay the debt. 

All of this is consistent with the author's reasoning.  The author apparently believes that the debt can be serviced.

I'm betting that hyperinflation happens because 

* The debt will not be repaid... it is easier for the US to default on the debt
* Foreign creditors - as the author predicts - will stop buying our debt, decreasing this artificial demand for dollars

"sports","t5_2qgzy","&gt;What is the relation between having the highest player and winning the WS? That's like saying, no team with a one armed pitcher from Minnesota has ever won the WS. There is no correlation between the one and the other.

Already explained the correlation: If you tie up most of your payroll in a few players, odds are that you're neglecting other areas of your team. I'm not saying it can't be done, but just that there's a reasonable explanation why it hasn't been done since 1928. Just because you say there's no correlation doesn't mean there isn't.

&gt;What does Javy Vasquez or Kevin Brown's performance have to do with the expected performance of CC, AJ or Teixeira? Do the Yankees put some hex on first year players?

It means we've been down this road before where the Yankees sign big name guys and everybody jumps out of their seats swearing the Yanks will win all 162 games and they end up missing the playoffs because these big name guys fail to perform at the same level. I believe I've provided documented proof of this.

&gt;Look at teams like the 1928 Yankees, 1975-1976 Reds or any other team with a boat load of stars... they seemed to have got along and won just fine. Using the 2008 Tigers as reason to state why the 2009 Yankees will fail is weak.

I'm not JUST using the 2008 Tigers. I'm using the recent Yankee teams as well to explain that there appears to be a phenomenon where teams that are projected to be dominant on paper end up coming up well short at the end of the season.

&gt;The Yankees had one of the best bullpens in the MLB. You use ERA to explain your point (in the comments section of the blog post), but using ERA to evaluate a reliever is ineffective. A reliever does not throw enough innings to offset one bad performance. Plus, if a reliever comes in the middle of an inning and lets all the inherited runners score, then he did not do his job. The catch here... that relievers ERA will not be effected, the pitcher who he replaced will have a higher ERA.

Just think about that ""overcoming a bad outing"" statement for a min. What is a ""bad outing"" for a reliver? Giving up 2 or 3 runs in an outing? You're saying a reliever can't overcome that? Dominant relievers can overcome a ""bad outing"" by pitching another 8 scoreless outings, which isn't all that hard for good major league relievers. And that's IF he gives up 2 or 3 runs every 9 outings. If he gives up 1 run, he need only pitch 2 straight scoreless outings before giving up a run to be considered a ""good"" reliever. Just what is your example of an ERA-damaging outing for a ""very good"" reliever?

You seem to be basing the bulk of your argument on the Yanks bullpen. I never said they were downright horrible or even incapable of putting together a nice year in 2009. My main point was that they're unproven (just like you say the Rays are...and you can't have it both ways).

You have to take into account that those bullpen stats you're giving are taking into account two of the more dominant relief pitchers in the game last season in Joba and Rivera. I never mentioned any concern with Rivera other than mentioning he's going to be 39 next season. In fact, if you remove Rivera and Joba from those stats, the Yanks Bullpen ERA jumps to 4.29 which would be good for 24th in the majors last year. I'm not talking about the bullpen as a whole necessarily...just Rivera's unproven help.

&gt;5, 6 and 7 are all very weak, so I'm not going to entertain them.

Ha! Even if I leave the pressure of the Bronx alone, your boy Joe Sheehan wrote a lot more on how age and injuries played a huge role in the demise of the 2008 Yanks.....so how is that weak when they're all going to be a year older NEXT season? Not to mention Burnett's injury history.

&gt;Replacing Abreu with Nady or Swisher was solid, in terms of defense. Abreu was terrible in the OF. Replacing Giambi w/Teixeira or Swisher is a tremendous upgrade offensively and defensively. I can go into the numbers if you would like, but maybe this can be your HW assignment.

Nady was already with the Yanks for a good chunk of the season last year. He can't ENTIRELY be placed in the discussion of replacing Abreu when they played TOGETHER for the last 2 months of the season. Swisher is mainly the guy that replaces Abreu's production.

Again, not saying that on paper that they didn't do a decent job in replacing these guys, but even if Teixeira and Swisher play well (and that's a big IF in the Bronx), it's not gong to be as great of an improvement as people think. Abreu and Giambi both averaged over .800 OPSs and 6.0 RC/27 which are desirable seasons.

&gt;Replacing Pettitte and Mussina w/younger and better pitchers such as CC and AJ is a win for the Yankees. Pettitte had an AWFUL 2nd half of the season (he's traditionally been a strong 2nd half pitcher, so somethings amiss), so he won't be missed as a front line starter. The Yanks have a potential rotation of:

AJ at his best is a comparable pitcher to Mussina. Wang coming back is a boost, and even if CC pitches like he did in Cleveland last year, the Yanks will definitely have a improved rotation. My main point: It may not be as improved as people think.

&gt;Tampa Bay Rays - Ever hear of the 2007 Colorado Rockies? In all fairness, the Rays are a good team, but I want to see them do it again to really believe in them.

The Rockies weren't even close to the Rays. They only won 90 games in a horrible NL West Division that the 08 Rays probably would have won 100 in. Their pitching staff was nowhere near the 08 Rays....no one even had a sub-4.00 ERA.

You seem to want it both ways where you want to bring up stats about how great the Yanks were last season, but ignore how good the Rays were. You want to base the Rays future performance off of how the Rockies turned out, but ignore the past of how the big name acquisitions the Yanks have made have dropped in performance their first year in the Bronx.

&gt;Rob Neyer, Joe Sheehan (or anyone else from BP) know their shit. I suggest reading articles from BP, Hardball Times, etc. to get a better understanding of the game. A lot of the points your tried to make are just nonsense and typical of the crap that is spewed on ESPN or other main stream media outlets. There is a lot of good stuff out there, do some research and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

You're all over the place, kid. You bring up Rob Neyer (who is well-known for being wrong about stuff time and time again....including calling for the Braves' demise every year since like 2002) and then you knock ESPN....are you unaware that Rob Neyer works for ESPN? You're the kind of guy that would eat up what I wrote if it came from Joe Sheehan. Seems like you have a man crush on the guy or something.

Deal with what I wrote and try to refute it...don't deal with who I am or who I'm not. If I say something ridiculous, then talk about it.

I even ended my article by saying ""I’m not saying that it’s out of the question for the Yankees to go all the way in 2009, but there are a lot of factors against that happening that people are overlooking just because the Yankees are throwing money out there again."" I'm not ridiculous enough to say that it's impossible for them to go all the way. I just wanted to make a point to say there are a lot of factors people are overlooking that they have to overcome in order for them to do it.

If I want to talk about scientific advances or a political subject, I'm not going to bring atheism into it unless there's some justification for that. So what you're seeing in the atheism subreddit is only a small part of what atheists think about.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Obviously there's a large degree of subjective ideas about what is ""clean"" syntax, but there is also a long ""tradition"" of syntax among mainstream languages that one really ought to have a very good reason to deviate from simply because most developers *will* have experience with one or more languages that largely adhere to well established conventions, and deviating from them creates unnecessary barriers. 

Many of those conventions are like that for a reason: Language designers have spent a *lot* of time looking at what seems to make programs readable for people. Languages don't only tend to look similar because they have a shared ancestry, but because it works.

Ruby is a great example (yeah, I'm biased) - Ruby steals a ton of ideas from Smalltalk and Lisp amongst others, but Ruby is seeing success not because of those features (if so, people could have just used Smalltalk or Lisp) but because the amalgam of those powerful features with a syntax that makes them approachable makes that power far more accessible.

Simple things like leaving out a keyword to introduce a function definition, or not separating a function name from its arguments with parentheses (Ruby also allows this, but most people use it sparingly or in very specific context exactly because it is often seen as reducing readability or increasing potential ambiguity in understanding) may seem minor, but when you stack a bunch of small things up it translates into slowing down reading and comprehension for those who need or prefer those cues to read the code at a decent speed. It's not one specific syntax aspect, but the amalgamation of a whole lot of uncommon uses of symbols (or lack thereof).

Different design goals and a different intended audience are perfectly good reasons to deviate from the mainstream expectations, and so I am not saying that Haskell is *bad* for having a syntax like that, and I guess I might have been a bit trigger happy with that comment. 

I appreciate that for someone with a mathematics background the Haskell syntax may be great, and there's certainly nothing wrong with having languages that satisfy people like you as well, but I do strongly believe that languages rooted in that type of syntax will never get the same kind of penetration as languages that focus on a somewhat more verbose syntax closer to spoken language.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; A purely technical argument! I'd love to hear it.

A few examples:

1. [Microsoft ignores whole classes of vulnerabilities.](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=286)  It just expects us to make up for the lack of vulnerability fixes with [half-baked, third-party ""protection""](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=624) that is only really effective after the system has already been exposed to exploit code.

2. Even for classes of vulnerability it doesn't ignore, [Microsoft sometimes waits years to fix known vulnerabilities](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=657).  Hell, its fastest turn-around time on a vulnerability patch was ten days -- longer than the *typical* turn-around time for some systems.

3. Even when it provides vulnerability fixes in a timely manner, they sometimes create more problems than they solve, such as in the case of the SQL Slammer fiasco.  In case you don't recall the details, Microsoft issued a patch that fixed the vulnerability SQL Slammer exploited, then it issued other patches, then SQL Slammer hit, and it actually affected a bunch of systems that had previously been patched against that vulnerability.  It turned out that installing certain of the later patches in the ""wrong"" order would undo the fix from the earlier patch against the vulnerability SQL Slammer exploited.

4. In the world of MS Windows, [privilege separation is a joke](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=376).

5. MS Windows doesn't exactly handle [secure memory usage](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=457) very well.

6. The way MS Windows changes itself without warning, at Microsoft's behest, and hides its behavior and inner workings from the user or admin much of the time, makes implementing effective integrity auditing a significant challenge.

7. The fact Microsoft employs a ""default allow"" approach to security configuration for its software makes it difficult for admins to be sure a system is sufficiently secured.  Trying to secure a system with an inherent default allow policy is a bit like trying to prove a negative.

8. [Microsoft routinely violates the security of its own OS](http://jaqui-greenlees.net/2008/04/08/microsoft-breaking-the-law-again/) on our behalf.

These problems -- and others -- make it far easier than it should be for malicious security crackers to do things like:

- skim encryption keys from keystrokes, RAM, or swap space on the hard drive

- achieve privilege escalation once a foothold has been gained via a less privileged process

- gain a foothold on the system in the first place

. . . all of which undermine the protective value of encryption and other privacy measures.


&gt; a quote from the EULA for RHEL

That's totally not the kind of EULA terms I was talking about.  Try this stuff from MS Windows EULAs:

&gt; You acknowledge and agree that Microsoft may automatically check the version of the Software and/or its components that you are utilizing and may provide upgrades or fixes to the Software that will be automatically downloaded to your Workstation Computer.

. . .

&gt; By using these features, you explicitly authorize Microsoft or its designated agent to access and utilize the necessary information for Internet gaming and/or updating purposes.

. . .

&gt; You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Software.

. . .

&gt; **IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT** OR ITS SUPPLIERS **BE LIABLE** FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY, FOR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, FOR NEGLIGENCE, AND FOR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATON, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA, **EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), MISREPRESENTATION, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF WARRANTY OF MICROSOFT** OR ANY SUPPLIER, AND EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Emphasis mine on that last one.  Read just the bolded parts a couple of times, and realize that Microsoft is saying ""Even if we violate contract, the terms of our own license agreement, and maliciously cause you harm, you agree to hold the corporation blameless.""  Combine that with the previous quotes from the EULA that I provided, and see if that doesn't scare you.

My complaint about the EULA isn't just about the kind of disclaimer of liability for failure of fitness of purpose, or about the limitation of recoverable damages to no more than the direct cost of acquiring the software in the first place.  I'm talking about terms that basically grant Microsoft the ""right"" to send pit bulls to your house to tear your leg off (metaphorically speaking) for no reason other than the same reason a child might tear the wings off a fly or use a magnifying glass to cook ants.","1230839572"

There are a lot of women presented in that movie who are indeed in horrendous situations - husband drinks or is addicted to hash, she's a low-earning prostitute, several kids, disease etc. However, they are in the business out of choice. They feel that they can't do too much better. Ok. That's not a great situation at all in life, but ok, they've made the choice at some level.

However, one of the girls in the movie, whose mother was a prostitute and whose grandmother was also one, was in the no-choice category. She simply was scheduled to become a prostitute at a certain age.

Similarly, if there are women actively wanting to become prostitutes, whatever. I don't support that per se, but I have no say in their lives. It's the kids that are kidnapped, it's the women and children in the no-choice situations that I feel bad for.

So while I agree with you that some stories may be apocryphal, such stories are representative of some truth at least. And that, we need to be concerned about. If you notice, I said nothing against prostitution in general - that's a whole different argument. I just feel bad for the unspoken [few perhaps, many perhaps, I don't know] who are stuck in bad situations and I feel that something should be done to help such people out","1230839808"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Unpopular decisions are necessary sometimes..

There's no real investigation done when this happens. The US gives the Pakistanis a list, the Pakistanis ban everyone on that list. The US would never pay any attention to the results of anyone else's investigations.


&gt; What does Pakistan have to lose in starting an investigation on terrorist organizations based on this guy's claim?


They *have* launched an investigation, they took in all the members of LeT that India named. They just don't have adequate evidence to do anything further or justify turning people over to India.


&gt; I'm glad also that Pakistan has taken a strong stance against the Taliban, for example.. the Taliban did say, however, that in case of a conflict, they would be more than ready to fight against India. What does that mean? Basically, to me, it's a mockery of India. On one side, here they say ""give us evidence"" and ""we don't support any terrorists"" but on the other hand, they do little to suppress statements like the Taliban's and take meager steps in investigating these guys [except perhaps shutting down JuD.. which according to you, seems to have been unnecessary anyway].


The attitude by the Pakistani populace has mostly been ""they may be a bunch of psycho mullahs but they're *our* psycho mullahs"". The Taliban are only one fringe faction of a vast network of religious institutions across Pakistan that trace their origin to the Indian independence movement and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind party (which was probably closer to Gandhi and his Congress Party than the Muslim League initially). Lately a lot of the fringe militant factions have allied under the ""Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan"" banner, or ""Pakistani Taliban"". When they say they'll support Pakistan in a war with India, it's nothing new. The last war in 1971 took place in a very different world. Afghanistan was never a factor then. But now it is. Especially the fact that Pakistan has probably twice the amount of ethnic Pashtun that even Afghanistan has. We're more Afghan than the Afghans. Most of the Pakistani military is Punjabi and Pathan/Pashtun now, the latter approaching 20-30% while the Punjabis have always made up near 40-50% of it.

The Pashtun/Afghan factor is noteable because this means there are more tribes than ever willing to go to bat for Pakistan in the event of war with non-Muslims. The last time these tribesmen fought for Pakistan was immediately after independence when they invaded Kashmir and were about to overrun the entire province. Pakistani Kashmir is in Pakistan's hands because of their help.

These tribes now have undergone decades of experience in warring with superpowers (the USSR, the USA and NATO, and even Pakistan), and are more religious than ever now (meaning more disciplined and organized). 

This was achieved in three stages. Firstly, the Afghan-Soviet war when the CIA and ISI trained everyone over there. Secondly, during the '90s when the ISI helped train the Taliban and in return the Taliban allowed Pakistan the contingency plan of using Afghanistan in case of a war with India. If India were ever to invade Pakistan with overwhelming force, the Pakistani Army would fall back to Afghanistan and wage war from there to take back Pakistan. This is partly why Pakistan was so reluctant to turn on the Taliban.

Thirdly, all the experience the Afghans and the Taliban have racked up against the USA, NATO, and Pakistan. This has now grown to include all the traditionally Pakistani Pashtun tribes (like the Waziris) in FATA and NWFP. Keep in mind this is a brief spat of a civil war in the northern territories. They're actually fighting for two things, to let them support the Afghani Taliban and for the Pakistani government itself to help enforce Shariah law (like it partly has done before during the '80s). PML-N, the real PML party, has always advocated peace talks with the tribes for that reason, they're our brothers, other Pakistanis.

Simply put, if there is a full scale conventional war with India, India will be bringing down a shitstorm on itself. I don't know where to even begin analyzing all the possible ways this could unfold but it would be very possible for India to lose more than just Kashmir in a conflict and this is dangerous because it could mean resorting to the use of nuclear weapons to stem the tide of an invasion from the West that would dwarf anything in India's history.","1230839857"

But, in all honesty, she may have felt like she wasn't seeeing you enough. ""We always [seem] to get through it"" isn't the oppurtune situation for a relationship. It shouldn't be something that you have to constantly make effort to do. It feels great to do that, as it's a testament to how much you like the other person, but, when the novelty of your relationship (""everything was literally going great"") wears off, it can (and seems to have) become an obligation. She wants both of you to be happy (2nd paragraph), but she doesn't want to feel obligated to make sacrifice (""never has time for us anymore""). Who does? 

If it was easier for the two of you to be together, it would probably be different, but the fact of the matter is that she has probably met someone with whom it is easier to be with (""I know she is in fact ignoring me""). I recommend you do the same.

Finally, everything may have been going perfect for you, but you said yourself that she is dealing with a lot of stress and that you were always getting through things. Perfect for you isn't perfect for both of you.

That's the very essence of capitalism and thusly 'the economy.' 

An argument can be made that corruption isn't where the current 'system' went wrong - Why? because seeking manipulative advantage is an *inherent* trait for survival and thusly, all human (economic) affairs. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if it wasn't the current circumstances or players that have seemingly undone the world's financial order, it would've likely been other ones, perhaps at another time. The financial world's problems are not even that unique, surprising, or even complicated. Everyone in banking, finance, etc saw this coming a mile away whether they wanted to admit it or not- everyone.  

Our current economy is not a 'thing' that exists in a vacuum to be sustained or not - it's an abstraction for measuring the output and affairs of human (manipulative) participants.

People who are raised in a religion will often carry an abiding and deep belief in it, but they've lived their whole lives with that religion in the background, usually, just kind of living it.

But converts seem to feel like they've got a lot of catching up to do, and that they've got to go convert others and soon.

This is not always true, obviously. I've known converts who were very laid back about their adopted faith, and I've known people who vociferously practice the faith of their parents, but more often than not it's the converse.

It's like with fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Firefly or whatnot. There are the ones who watched the show from the beginning all the way through the end, and to this day will extoll the series' virtues to the uninitiated. And then there are those who never watched the show until they were lent the entire series on DVD, and those more recent fans will start podcasts about the show and will buy extra copies of the DVDs to lend out to those who haven't seen it.

It just also turns out that transcoding every filename read is stupid, *in addition* to being unnecessary.

Rubbish.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","A piece of holographic film and the image it generates are also an example of an implicate and explicate order. The film is an implicate order because the image encoded it its interference patterns is a hidden totality enfolded throughout the whole. The hologram projected from the film is an explicate order because it represents the unfolded and perceptible version of the image. 
Bohm is not the only researcher who has found evidence that the universe is a hologram. Working independently in the field of brain research, Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram has also become persuaded by the holographic nature of reality. He says that the human brain can be modeled as a hologram. Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by the puzzle of how and where memories are stored in the brain.

For decades numerous studies have shown that rather than being confined to a specific location, memories are dispersed throughout the brain. In a series of landmark experiments in the 1920's, brain scientist Karl Lashley found that no matter what portion of a rat's brain he removed he was unable to eradicate its memory of how to perform complex tasks it had learned prior to surgery. The only problem was that no one was able to come up with a mechanism that might explain this curious whole in every part nature of memory storage.

Then in the 1960's Pribram encountered the concept of holography and realized he had found the explanation brain scientists had been looking for. Pribram believes memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image.

Date: 2009-01-01, 4:39AM EST


-Wow…I can’t believe I am doing this..But I am looking for someone to rent my rent controlled apartment. The monthly rent is extremely cheap and would be a dream for many people in this city. It is in the east village close to A and 3rd. I caught my wife in bed with our neighbor who is almost 20 years younger than her. She is refusing to move out and still seeing him when I am at work, on my bed…I need someone to move in and help me get her out. Man or woman. My plan is to act like we are a couple until she can’t take it anymore. I have done everything possible to try and get her out..But she is a scumbag….So we need to create some type of plan that would get her out..i would charge you very cheap and all you would have to do is act like we are dating. We might have to kiss if front her and make fake sounds when we are in the bedroom. Please respond with a detailed description of your plan to get her out and a little about your self. You could live there after she is out and unless we fall in love we don’t have to do anything else.

Do you think I want India involved in a lengthy battle with Pakistan?

I don't support India's military actions at all and I don't think my posts seem to indicate that. All I can say is, if elements like the Taliban get involved, I hope the rest of the world sees us with some pity can give some aid.

It disillusions me that a. you present these arguments as a sort of ""watch out India"" threat and b. the ""our psycho mullahs"" is embraced and maybe considered normal. Why? There are a huge number of Hindus who reject the RSS and VHP, including myself. India is, and has been for a long time, a very diverse country and this why I'm so proud of it.

Having lived a bit in both Developer and Sys. Admin. worlds, I have tended to solve the problem with whichever tools I was currently happiest with. Sometimes that has meant chaining utilities like Task Scheduler to batch files, sometimes that has meant writing windows services.

As a Sys. Admin, the tendency is to use the tools you have available to accomplish the task, the joy comes from the creative ways that they may be hooked up to do something. 

As a developer, the tendency is to write something that meets your needs, rather than finding other tools and connecting the pieces together. The joy is in coding it, and proving to yourself that the skills you have has some value - I mean, look it wasn't *that* hard to write something to solve the problem...

As I've gotten more experience, I have moved into the phase of: I know I *could* write it, but there are more interesting problems to solve, I'll just find something that gets 95% of the way there, as elegantly as possible and hook it up/modify it to get the last 5%. 

Call me lazy, but I have gained appreciation for not wasting cycles on things that other people have already put a tremendous amount of thought and effort into (this counts for both *nix and windows worlds).

I remember one place I worked for that took orders for womans clothing (Speigel and Newport news), had this horrible backup system. It would take 3 hours every night, and then almost 10 hours every saturday. The systems went completely down. Computers turned off and everything. We had to tell the customers we could take there order, but it would be on paper. Heres the halarious part:

Since the system didnt tell us to promote the credit card, we would have to do it on every paper call, because if we didnt promote it, it would hurt our metrics. When they apply for a credit card we have to do a credit check. Need the Social, full name, adress employer shit like that. THEN we would ask for a credit card number as well, to put the order on if the chick had bad credit and didnt get the card. EVERYONE did this.

I had countless sheets with personal information, and credit card numbers, everything I needed to steal an identity. Then we would pass them in at the end of the night (I worked backshift with 2 other guys) We had no shredder and we just left the sheets laying around for the day shift to deal with. this is a common practice.","1230840510"

The thing you have to keep in mind is, when you're in a position where you feel like you're a failure, you start thinking you can't be trusted to do anything, even taking steps that would be beneficial in the long run.

Muster up your courage, do *something* forward-thinking, and get out there. I was lucky enough to have my parents take out my student debt, and to have some money to get established by myself - self-reliance was something I hadn't experienced before, and I needed to fall down a few times before I could begin to make positive (as in, ones that moved me in some, any, direction) decisions.

Re: The military: It is not a magic bullet. It can, however, simplify life enough for you to get things together and reconsider what you value. I went broke four times there, and if it weren't for the fact that they feed, clothe, and house you while you're there, I would have been out on the street. That environment helped me realize that there are few things I *need*, but the ones I do are critical. The chance of dying isn't that great, anyway; not much higher than if you were a normal, risk-taking 20-something.

Anyone can get laid in the military, although some of them have to pay for it (I recommend requesting Germany if you do go through with it, that or somewhere in Asia), and for a lot of guys that's just a stumbling block that, once they're over it, makes relationships much easier to pursue.

And, for what it's worth, I had a ""lost year"", four years in the military, and now I'm a couple of months away from graduating with a 3.8 GPA. So, it can be worth it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","It refers to the British mandate of Palestine from 1922. After WWI the British were dividing up former Ottoman territory. Technically it was British, but they allowed the Arabs a great deal more autonomy than some other British controlled areas.

In 1946 the Zionist group Irgun blew up the King David Hotel, which was the headquarters of the British government in the region at the time. Almost 100 people were killed and British power in the region never recovered. I don't consider that a defense of Arab terrorism, but I do think it's sort of interesting that once they got a state and an official military, Zionists suddenly find the same tactics they used to get said state somehow more morally objectionable.

I've said it before, I don't like what either side of the conflict is doing, I think that the way things are going, there is going to be an unending cycle of violence till one side or the other is exterminated.

I'm harder on Israel, because they hold all the cards. They get a disproportionate amount of funding from the United States, and they use it to keep themselves in a superior position.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","*Next* to your house. This is a minor but crucial difference, and what I am trying to teach reddit here - at least the people who really want peace - is that there was an episode in the history of jews and arabs that was purely positive coexistence. It was destroyed by racism, and by blaming the other side for all ills. People who seek to prolong the conflict focus on the negative side and the real message of peace - that all wrongs can be repaired if you truly, genuinely mean to - is drowned by the lying shitbags who repeat the same old propaganda to blow on the flames of a confict that has been going on for too long. 

All the antizionist crowd here march on claiming to represent the arab interests and solidarity, and they do not want to become cognizant to the fact that it is not a prerequisite for peace that everyone ""knows their place""; it is not a prerequisite for ""palestinian"" arabs to be a bible-authorized ethnicity for jews to accept them, and it is not a prerequisite for jews to get out of here to be accepted by arabs. Since most of the antizionist crew hasn't ever been to Middle East, they are going on by anything *but* a reality based model of what's going on in here. These dolts can not tell the difference between peace and pacifism, and can not comprehend that they are just as much racist when saying that jews are inherently bad people who are commanded by force majeur to hate and harm arabs as the jewish people who consider arabs subhuman, unclean, inherently flawed, and so on. Bottom line is that down here we can arrive to understanding, but the last thing we need is racists seeding everything with fabrications and ridiculously stupid ideas. Some of the stuff I see here is so bizzare I can not for the life of me contemplate what kind of malice and stupidity could possibly produce them. 

Right now, IDF is doing arabs' dirty work. IDF is set to remove a popular, but embarassing terrorist gang. Then there will be making of faces and burning of flags, but then everyone will calm down and we finally will be able to talk - hell, we're in peace negotiations with Syria right now.

The reference ""He was the christ""  versus ""He was known as christ""  differ hugely,  and the difference is large enough to make or break the assumption that it is likely present in the original text or not.     

To say he is ""The Christ""  would be a bit out of context,  being as Josephus was not christian,   this is saying ""Hey this guy is indeed the son of god,  but lets not discuss that,  I just threw it in for measure.""  A better assumption is that ""He is known as Christ""   is the original intent of Josephus which is a proxy acknowledgement of the Christian belief that Jesus was ""Christ""  without any Author injected validity to the claim of said title.   

Most myths are based on reality,  in some form, with tons of fiction to keep it afloat.   Jesus being a real person isn't really difficult to believe nor even so unlikely.    Of course all the circumstance surrounding him is questionable as hell.    Virgin birth (right....)  Returning from the dead (in the time its not unlikely that one of several things occurred,   scavengers,  grave robbers,  or followers who wanted to inter his body gracefully or whatever)  

I mean the person himself is so inconsequential when removed from his mystical affiliation that making him up seems inane in itself.  Him simply being a guy who happened to fit some post-facto criteria that some other guy decided made him key to his religion.

I never got a sense of being talked down to, it's just an easy way to get into it. RWH didn't cover the language itself as much as I'd have liked; it seemed to give you a overview and then jump into real-world scenarios (which is unsurprising given the title) that were just too big to be good examples.

I think LYAH is a great introduction to the language, with nice example usage tutorials (for example, the latest chapter is building a RPN calculator) that aren't too small nor too big. From there you could just easily move to RWH.

* [For The Silent](http://forthesilent.org): Totally biased here, as I volunteer directly for them, but if you're interested in helping raise awareness and funding for specific projects (building classrooms, buying supplies for safe homes) through the passions you already have (singing, drawing, etc.), contact us. Sorry for the pitifully meagre website, we're working on a new one.
* [Chab Dai](http://www.chabdai.org): Absolutely astonishing group that is acting as the ""hub"" for many disparate NGOs in Cambodia to work together and not duplicate efforts
* [International Justice Mission](http://www.ijm.org): The Big Guns; they do some terrific work in this area and have wonderful hearts. Their occasional smash-and-grab tactics in breaking up underage brothels is a bit controversial, as it has in the past contributed to delaying the building of trust in the rescued children, but they still do great work. (There are a few groups whose names I'm forgetting now, who have an alternative method of slowly befriending the brothel owners and trying to bargain the children away from them, building trust and laying the foundation for ""rescuing"" the brothel owners themselves into a better profession, as many mama-sans are former sex slaves themselves; I'll post those organizations' names when I remember them.)

When you buy a gift card that only requires a code and not the physical card, you don't need a legitimate phone number or mailing address to send it to.  Email addresses can be tracked, but scammers are smart enough to hide themselves behind proxies and anonymous emails.  Thus, any fraud investigations are full of dead ends and now the person has a redeemed a gift card that can't be tracked.  I mean, the best bet would be that someone has to get a warrant to match up a redeemed gift card with a mailing address from a site that wasn't involved in any of the fraudulent transactions, and we all know that most law enforcement agencies would rather be working on clear cut cases instead chasing dead ends.

I'm not the best person to try to advocate pointfree style, being a math grad student. :) I'll give it a shot anyway.

Some people feel that by eliminating unnecessary syntactic elements- namely, explicit parameters- it is easier to see what a bit of code is ""really"" doing, in the recognizing-common-patterns-and-generalizing sense.

One of the Great Promises of functional programming was and is the ability to calculate programs from specifications, and this generally involves manipulating pointfree functions. The ""Bananas, lenses, and barbed wire"" paper has some examples of this.

Finally, writing pointfree code encourages you to write code in smaller chunks which are then composed into larger programs. With type signatures and well-chosen function names, this can actually make code easier to read.

Did you know there's slavery happening right here in Canada and the US?

I'm sure it's more than what I'll give as an example but I wanted to share a news report I read the other day.

Shocking story of a 10 year old African girl who was sent off by her mother for a better life in Canada.

She was given to an Egyptian couple who were living here with their children. This girl was essentially turned into a live in house maid.

For approximately 8 years she was mistreated, never sent to school, wore only hand me downs.

Started work first thing in the morning and was washing dishes right until bed time.

Bedtime by the way was the family's spartan garage. She was not permitted to eat with the family and she was rarely seen outside the home.

Neighbors were on record stating that they had seen her for years washing dishes through the windows and not thinking much of it, except for chores.

Apparantly this is rampant as many children in Africa have no future, even if they have a parent most often they'll be sent off as workers to try and make extra money.

But in these cases they're turned into slaves for high income foriegners living in our country.

This little girl in particular was treated like a dog for years and she grew up not knowing this was wrong or abnormal.

Sad story but illustrates the fact that slavery is happening right under our noses here in North America and very well could be happening in the home next to you.","1230841724"

France and Poland lost WWII as well.  That doesn't mean that the Germans were in the right. Or maybe *you* think they were.

Israel started the war, and you know it.  The Arabs were being provocative in their actions, but even US intelligence estimates say they were dug in defensively (not ready for offense) at the time.   And Begin and Rabin later went  on record saying that the Arabs knew they were outgunned.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; twoThirds: You are at a party and ask a parent whether they have at least one girl. They say yes. What is the probability that both children are girls?

You have the answer backwards, 2/3 is the probability that the children are one of each gender.

&gt; On a lighter note, everyone's favorite game is spot-the-logic-error, right? If the 2/3 reasoning is correct for girls, it must be correct for boys as well. Therefore, it doesn't matter which gender the child has. Therefore, the reasoning can be applied to a parent without knowing which gender the child has. Therefore, there is a two-thirds probability that a family will have two children of different genders and one-third that the children will have the same gender.

You've mixed up the different problems. In the case where you see one specific pre-chosen child, you can combine probabilities in this way, but in that case the answer is 1/2 anyway so there's no contradiction.

In the 2/3 case, you can't combine the probabilities as you have, because the two ""Is at least one of your children &lt;gender&gt;?"" questions overlap; some parents would answer yes to both questions.

So while it's quite true that 2/3 of parents having at least one boy have one of each, and 2/3 of parents having at least one girl have one of each, and that all parents of two children must have either at least one boy or at least one girl, it doesn't follow that the overall probability of boy/girl is 2/3, because of the overlap - the parents who have one boy and one girl answer yes to either initial question and have thus been counted twice.

I believe that the criminal administration of Bush and Cheney has looked carefully at how people behave under threat of terrorism in Israel and has encouraged and implemented a system of changes in American society that will allow them to exert the same extreme level of control the Israeli government and national security have over the Israeli population - basically that there is a file on everyone and that the government has unlimited power if it needs to react to an emergency. The difference is that in Israel the threat of terrorism is grave, and in America it is non-existent. The public safety devices were invented in Israel because of real threats, and I can see them one by one migrate into American society. This scares me to no end. National ID, no-fly lists, airport security checks, surveillance, erosion of privacy in favour of safety are all ideas that are vital for Israel but fatal for America. These security devices were not designed for an imaginary threat - they will inevitably fail in the hands of incompetent politicians and aggravate the population. 

The Iraq war, specifically, is a commercial enterprise IMO. There's no denying that we in Israel benefited from it, albeit indirectly. ","1230842129"

The thing is, I'd like to know where I'm going to be living as soon as possible.

Is it *possible* to find listings for places that open in the future?  Everything I see says ""available now"" or within the next few weeks.

Is there a place I can look for future openings?

$325 EAST VILLAGE- Controlled and large 3 bed (East Village) (map) Reply to: hous-976182933@craigslist.org [?] Date: 2009-01-01, 4:39AM EST

-Wow…I can’t believe I am doing this..But I am looking for someone to rent my rent controlled apartment. The monthly rent is extremely cheap and would be a dream for many people in this city. It is in the east village close to A and 3rd. I caught my wife in bed with our neighbor who is almost 20 years younger than her. She is refusing to move out and still seeing him when I am at work, on my bed…I need someone to move in and help me get her out. Man or woman. My plan is to act like we are a couple until she can’t take it anymore. I have done everything possible to try and get her out..But she is a scumbag….So we need to create some type of plan that would get her out..i would charge you very cheap and all you would have to do is act like we are dating. We might have to kiss if front her and make fake sounds when we are in the bedroom. Please respond with a detailed description of your plan to get her out and a little about your self. You could live there after she is out and unless we fall in love we don’t have to do anything else.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Guess who molested my wife when she was 13?...and Atheist.  Of course this means that all Atheists are secretly child molesters, just as this article obviously shows that all Christians are child molesters.

Honestly, I'm known many people of many different faiths (or non-faiths depending on how you define it) and all of them have been fucked up.  The guy who did it to my wife used many of the same grooming techniques that we lambast Christians for using (obviously he took them out of a religious context and brought them into a non-religious context).

I think we need to grow up.  Too many kids on here want to complain that Christians are some horrible monster, mostly they just want to rage against their parents (or the perceived norm)...I mean, why be an Atheist for that reason, just join the punk movement and decide what you believe for logical and not reactive reasons.

When I came out as a nonreligious person I went through some of the worst stuff you've read on here and yet I've kept a semi-level head.  I realize that nearly all of us are crazy and in every grouping of people there will be the completely insane members (usually the loudest of the members).  If we fall into the game of choosing to only notice the loud and crazy Christians we're doing the same thing the Christians do when they choose to only notice the loud and crazy Atheists.  We're all fucked up, I think I'm closer to the ""truth"" than Christians...but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me if most people in this world want to play a pretend game.  Most of those people will never impact me negatively, those who do I'll try to deal with.  But in my experience the amount of harmful crazies between Atheists and Christians are about he same (there's just fewer total Atheists) so just as I wouldn't want to be associated with some of the insane Atheists on reddit I also won't associate most Christians with the insane Christians.","1230842192"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I definitely recommend watching this video. It's worthwhile.

Of course, games have been moving in this direction for ages. As we were coming out of the arcade era, it was simply assumed that every game needed a level system that sent you back to the very beginning when you died enough times. These days, that's seen as a relic of a past age, and any game that still foists such a thing on players is frowned upon. 

These days, the standard is unlimited game overs that send you back somewhere close to where you died. The best version of this system I've seen is in the God of War games, which respawn you one or two screens back from where you left off with the same health (or a little more) as you had before. The first PS2 PoP game was pretty similar. I haven't played the new PoP, but it sounds like it just takes that basic formula a couple steps further.

I think it's pretty clear that what's needed to enjoy victory is primarily a challenge, and not punishment. But I do think punishment has its place. PoP might be a game particularly suited to the punishment-free system, because in general all you're dealing with is a bunch of jumps and obstacles. It's a series of succeed/fail problems. By going back to the beginning, all you'll do is repeat the exact same motions again, and they'll just be tedious the second time. It makes no sense.

But things are different in a game where your challenges are longer, less simply win-lose, with gradual progress and resource management. To go back to God of War, it would be extremely lame if when you died in the middle of a long fight you simply popped up in the exact spot you were just at and carried on where you left off. There would be no motivation to do your best, to fight a solid battle from start to finish. In short, it would remove the strategy from any even mildly strategy-based game. In those games, the ""punishment"" is actually part of the fun, and not just something to sweeten the victory.

I welcome the Wii and games like Prince of Persia. But I hope nobody thinks this is the way all games should go.","1230842239"

"programming","t5_2fwo","It seems to me that Haskell could have been made much easier to learn without any loss of generality by making it less terse, by which I mean the use of more literate programming conventions.


I'm sitting in front of my computer trying to learn Haskell from the ""Real World Haskell"" book (it's very good, by the way)

I'm on page 30, looking at the definition of a simple function called ""myDrop"" 

    myDrop n xs = if n &lt;= 0 || null xs
                  then xs
                  else myDrop (n - 1) (tail xs)

I'm being informed that ""xs"" should be read as ""plural of x""

Now, I rewrote this function as follows

    myDrop = n aList = if n &lt;= 0 || emptyList aList
                          then aList
                          else myDrop (n - 1) (tail aList)
                        where emptyList = null

It seems to me that the use of words like ""aList"" instead of xs and functions called ""emptyList"" instead of ""null"" as well as extra indentation of THEN and ELSE under IF make it much easier to understand the function (and the syntax) quickly. 

One doesn't have to get distracted by thinking about ""What is this xs thingy"" and ""what is null"" and so forth.","1230842241"

"economy","t5_2qhpn","&gt;Call it what you like, but the notion that the rich getting richer or retaining more of their wealth it is good for the poor is utter nonsense as 12 years under Reagan/Bush I and eight more under Bush II has clearly demonstrated.

Your reasoning is fatally flawed here for a variety of reasons.  A few of the most glaring:

1) You make the fallacious assumption that the rich keeping more of their money means they horde it. This allows you to paint ""the rich"" as some mystical boogeyman from which all problems stem.  Savings and investment that occur when private citizens get to keep their money.  Those with more of this money save and invest more, thus allowing more production to meet the needs/wants of consumers.  And who benefits from a net increase in supply of consumer goods?  The poor, of course.

2) You fail to take into account that both Reagan and Bush ignored the ""cutting spending"" party of the equation as both grew the government and ran large deficits.  This disproportionality hurts the poor as inflation (an increase in the money supply) is required to finance such debt spending.  Inflation is the most regressive tax possible; it devalues the money of everyone and benefits those that receive newly created first (government and the banking cartel).

3) Correlation doesn't equal causation.  Saying ""X"" occurred while ""A"" was president doesn't mean that ""A"" caused ""X"" to occur.  Practice shows that *this* type of fallacious reasoning is incorrect.","1230842336"

&gt;Does that not seem like a bad system to you? Does that not seem like people within the club could do a whole load of bad things, but simply because they know they are going to get rewarded regardless - well, the bad things arn't so bad.

God considers accepting the Atonement to be the best possible behaviour and as such rewards it with eternal life. Any other good behaviour gets rewarded too. As Jesus said, it is best to invest in the afterlife with good behaviour than to be tempted by sin in this world. ([Matt. 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.%206&amp;version=31))


&gt;Would it not be better to reward good people no matter what and punish bad people no matter what?

The truth is that everyone is a sinner and that is what makes it so important to accept the Atonement. 


&gt;So what! If you're going to heaven isn't that enough - arn't more rewards just greedy?

It's not greedy because you're perfectly entitled to them. 


&gt;I'm saying that you should give up pretending anything scientific. You should simply admit you elieve it's all supernatural and have NO NEED to bother even thinking about scientific reasons.

Alright, I believe that the flood waters were supernatural in origin and I have little need to bother looking into naturalistic accounts of their origin.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The difference is in the probabilities. You could equate BG to GB but to do so you'd have to weight the probabilities. That outcome would then become twice as likely as a GG outcome.

Remember that when you say GG, BB, GB, BG what you are actually saying is that each outcome is 25% likely when you start. It is a simplification and it is necessary to record the two results separately in order for it to work. Irrespective there is a 50% chance of a GB/BG result beforehand and only a 25% chance each for GG and BB.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Many Jews lived on the land just fine with little problem.  They were not excluded and did not exclude.  However, you seem to treat ""jews"" as though it is a singular organism, one in which only a small portion of its appendage needs to hold legitimate claim to a land in order for the rest of the organism to also claim legitimate occupancy.  I find it hard to understand the viewpoint that since there were tens of thousands of Jews living peacefully and legitimately in Palestine that this somehow secures the right of millions upon millions of foreigners to immigrate to the proximal land with little regard for the indigenous population, including the indigenous Jews.

I grew up with many Jewish families who had been living in that land continuously since the 13th century and possibly further back.  They lived under Ottoman rule and British rule, but it was not until the absurdly massive flood of Jewish immigrants from all over the world that their land was finally stolen and life became so intolerable that they fled to the US.  One of the families that was most tolerant of these waves of foreigners stayed into the 50's, even as they lost their land to a settlement, were beaten and harassed.  What finally made them give up and leave was when the immigrants, who roundly treated them very poorly, were less and less Jews escaping persecution, but were Jews who were emigrating from good lives free of persecution.

Until you realize that, for the indigenous peoples: Jews, Christians, Arabs, Bedouins, etc, the problem was not that ""Jews"" were immigrating, it was a problem of the sheer numbers of *people* immigrating as well as the newcomers' complete disregard for the lives already being lived there by the indigenous population... until you realize this, you are simply avoiding a very basic truth.","1230842401"

They then take these subjects/links/videos, and throw them up on their blog; however, they don't provide anything extra - no discussion, no perspective, no explanation... other than whatever was said in the original source. Then, ads are added for profit (the ??? here is ""add ads!"").

"programming","t5_2fwo","Let me first say that although I'd like to be the other way around, I'm first, second and third a programmer - then a mathematician. (Progr.) Languages are my passion, so unsurprisingly I've looked at and used many.

&gt; may seem minor, but when you stack a bunch of small things up it translates into slowing down reading and comprehension

Syntax should reflect semantics first and foremost. It helps the user understand the semantics and remember them. A language with radically different semantics than main-stream languages *should* therefore have different syntax.

For your specific examples; Haskell programs are primarly a collection of (function) definitions. With the exception of import statements, that's all there is to it. Why should we then confuse the syntax with a ""def"" or similar keyword? To make it similar to other languages is not a good enough reason to clutter it upp imo.

Putting arguments in parenthesis is also out of line with Haskell's nexts of kin (other functional languages) -- so in this case it is actually taking after other languages. Also, this syntax re-inforces the idea that all functions are curried, another example of how syntax exists to represent a semantic feature.

I respect your belief that these kind of syntax choices may stop languages from gaining traction, but I optimistically disagree :)  I think most syntax choices in Haskell reflect the underlying semantics, a feature I find necessary for a language to be *understood* (not just used) by the masses.","1230842541"

It is in the east village close to A and 3rd. I caught my wife in bed with our neighbor who is almost 20 years younger than her. She is refusing to move out and still seeing him when I am at work, on my bed…I need someone to move in and help me get her out. Man or woman. My plan is to act like we are a couple until she can’t take it anymore. I have done everything possible to try and get her out..But she is a scumbag….So we need to create some type of plan that would get her out..i would charge you very cheap and all you would have to do is act like we are dating. We might have to kiss if front her and make fake sounds when we are in the bedroom. Please respond with a detailed description of your plan to get her out and a little about your self. You could live there after she is out and unless we fall in love we don’t have to do anything else.

That is not the question you need to ask.  First, you need to realize you have *no moral right* to kick someone out of your country, for the simple truth is that it is immoral to initiate the use of force against anyone.

BUT, if SOMEONE initiates force against you, loved ones, other people or property, then *using violence against them is perfectly legitimate*.  Crushing the skulls of those rioters would have been not only legitimate, but a very good use of violence in defense of the initiation of violence.

Unfortunately, contemporary forms of government are so twisted, they do exactly the opposite -- they fail to use violence to stop the initiation of violence, but they use violence to expel nonviolent people preemptively.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I wasn't arguing, I was answering your question about why the Pakistani establishment was ambivalent about the Taliban's comments. It wasn't a simple answer.

EDIT: I should have also mentioned that the Taliban are trying to play the PR game by making those comments, trying to appeal to the Pakistani populace at large. Because again, they don't consider themselves as at war with Pakistan, but rather at war *for* Pakistan. Since they're now up against an elected civilian government, they're on the lookout for any PR opportunities. The government seeks to reinforce that idea as if to say ""yes, we're all united in the face of the Indian threat"", in order to appease the people (trying to talk shit against the Taliban's popular statements in this situation would be a misstep) and ward off India.

And regarding those ""psycho mullahs"" you're talking about a huge number of people. The Taliban are almost synonymous with Pashtun in places. Just read up on the comments of exasperated NATO commanders in Afghanistan or Pakistani generals.

The Taliban really are still a ""movement"", and when I refer to it, I mean the movement. The actual literal group (led by Mullah Omar) too, though the Afghan and Pakistani factions are distinct from each other and united underneath the ""movement"" umbrella.

It's telling that Pakistan's original plan was to drive a wedge between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, putting their support behind another wing of the group that could oust Mullah Omar and his crew (closely allied to Al-Qaeda), sue for peace with NATO and join Karzai's government (and then take it over again... if the Taliban peacefully joined the government, they'd win elections unless the US helped the Afghans rig it.. which they would). They even found a Taliban commander who had the credibility to pull it off (Mullah Dadullah) but he died during fighting and it never panned out.

EDIT: You will always have militant Pashtun tribes. Always. The ""Islamist"" ones, which probably now account for most of them, are colloquially referred to as Taliban because they are allied with the Taliban though they are not the exact Taliban which ruled Afghanistan in the '90s.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","First off, it's 'accent', not dialect, right? NZ does have a dialect involving its own slang and cultural references, but it's distinct from Australian.
The accents - well, it's likely that Australian and NZ accents sound similar since they developed during the same period of colonial immigration. To a NZer, though, there are big differences. Australians tend to extend 'i' sounds into 'eee' sounds - so you'll hear something like ""feeesh and cheeps"". In contrast, NZers often shorten it into an 'uh' sound, so it'll sound like ""fush and chups"". 
The other thing to realise is that what you think of as ""British English"" is likely to be received pronunciation - the crisp BBC sound which has actually been carefully cultured through elocution. Actual British accents vary widely and if you listen to some, you can definitely see where the NZ and Aussie accents developed from. Accents like Cockney or Yorkshire definitely aren't full of perfectly rounded vowels. Interestingly, if you go back in the archives to the early ages of television, or even back to earlier radio recordings, the announcers in NZ were trained to speak 'perfectly' so it sounds a lot more similar to BBC English.

But of course his realization of the fundamental difference was not enough for him to change his eye-catching, sensationalist headline. But at least the article ends with a reasonable conclusion that people's expectations on investment returns will have to be lowered and that government stimulus spending is simply a way to cushion the slowdown.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I feel like I need to make mention of this...  I've always had the idea that if something is to be consumed, that the less wasted the better.  So honestly, let's just theoretically say that a company kills a crocodile for it's meat.  I'm fine with the rest of the parts being used in other products and not going to waste.  For example, use the skin for apparel or other products, clean and bleach the skull for those who collect them, etc.  I would much rather see the entire animal [or as much of it as possible] being used, rather than wasted.  I'm sure PETA and people who are against eating animals would state that I'm probably cruel for eating animals, and we shouldn't eat them at all, but I have an argument for that:

I believe my little rule of consumption applies to anything consumed, including plants, vegetables, and fruits.  I'd rather see an entire fruit be utilized, rather than a few bites taken out before it's tossed away.  And if we can't fully consume an item, I see nothing wrong in trying to recycle it back into the ecosystem, whatever may be left over.  Just because we're consuming something doesn't necessarily mean the leftovers need to be wasted.  It all can be utilized.

First:  Two comments

&gt; SPACE is not an object

1.  We haven't gotten to objects yet, and you seem to be assuming a particular kind of space.  If your definitions and usages aren't circular we can discuss one thing independently of another.

2.  I didn't say ""space"", I said ""a space"".  I was purposefully sticking with a conceptual version as mathematicians use points both in describing how things work in the ""real world"" as well as an infinite number of imaginary worlds.

&gt; keep your fucking idiotic points concise

If you would stick to one topic, I'd have a chance.

&gt;a fucking point cannot be a fucking location in space as space itself is dependent the existence of fucking points.

**You seem to be saying that if you define two terms in relation to each other, it's an invalid definition.  Is that what you're saying?**

If the answer is YES, no explanation is necessary and I will have a single followup question.

You believe that of a hindu and a christian whole lead lives exactly the same (in terms of sinning and being good etc) the hindu is going to be PUNISHED for eternity and the christian REWARDED for eternity. Does that not sound suspicious to you? Does it not seem EXACTLY what a human person would set up to make sure people join THIER faith rather then another?

Is it not odd that most people have the SAME religion as thier parents? If thier was One True Faith would it not have taken over the others by now? 

&gt;I have a feeling that they would have done those things anyway.

They said thier RELIGION and FAITH was thier guiding light in thier decisions to go to war.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I am not a billionaire. But I am still what most folks would call rich. At one point I had around 45 million, and now (for various reasons) this is down at around 32 million. 

Nearly all of this came from selling my business and retiring early. It is more than I ever imagined having in my life, and the figures still boggle my mind. It is more than I can reasonably spend in my lifetime (unless I became a spend-aholic). The same is true for billionaries. Most of their money is just an ego-boost.

Now, of course I had some sleepless nights having ""lost"" 12 or 13 million in a year. Sure, the pain is real - believe me. The billionaires will have felt pain too. They will have lost sleep.

However, the truth is most of the pain is bruised ego. Truthfully, anybody could retire happily with, say, 5 million. It would fund a nice (if not extravagant) lifestyle forever. Anything beyond that is a fat cushion, that helps you absorb shock. You still feel some of the shock, but most of it is absorbed by the cushion that protects the 5 million ""emergency fund"". It is when that last few million starts to get destroyed that rich people really suffer. I have seen friends go down to their last few hundred thousand and feel completely suicidal. Really, completely emotionally destroyed - and losing homes, wives, and friends when they needed them the most.

So, in short, yes the billionaries are feeling real pain, but they are still far removed from the reality that most people face all their lives: having to worry how to pay bills, and live from one month to the next.","1230843433"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;  I find it hard to understand the viewpoint that since there were tens of thousands of Jews living peacefully and legitimately in Palestine that this somehow secures the right of millions upon millions of foreigners to immigrate to the proximal land with little regard for the indigenous population, including the indigenous Jews.

You say ""secures"" but why does it need to be secured? Why can't jews go to a place that they have considered very important for two millenia? Why can't they do that when their lives were threatened, or when they were too poor? The mere fact that there are already some people? It is true: not all of us foreigners are good people, not all try to invest some effort in respecting the place, and some are only here because it's better life than in the country of origin. Still, we all believe that this is a place that matters to us, otherwise why'd we stick to a godforsaken desert surrounded by annoyed arabs? It was never the intention of jews, collectively, to destroy or displace the arabs. Some were loud about their despise of arabs, and others liked arabs better than their own peers.

&gt; What finally made them give up and leave was when the immigrants, who roundly treated them very poorly, were less and less Jews escaping persecution, but were Jews who were emigrating from good lives free of persecution.

They believed that this was the right thing to do.

&gt; Until you realize that, for the indigenous peoples: Jews, Christians, Arabs, Bedouins, etc, the problem was not that ""Jews"" were immigrating, it was a problem of the sheer numbers of people immigrating as well as the complete disregard for the lives already being lived there by the indigenous population... until you realize this, you are simply avoiding a very basic truth.

I was not alive when these things were happening, but I do understand from the history and knowledge available to me that there are specific things that happened and triggered the conflict. These things were not because of jewish immigrants or local arabs, but by racists and interesants. That is where the strife began; only *then* there was significant disdain and mutual disrespect. My understanding is summed up in that it is too late to dwell on history, and that if our generation wants some peace and dignity, we must do whatever is necessary to make peace with arabs, but we can not perish in the process.

Over the years I've seen something related in other people, who I knew were chronically uneasy with their lives in various ways... they needed some kind of distraction in casual settings (saying that they were uncomfortable at home without the TV on in the background, or always needing noise to fall asleep), or seem more anxious in quiet settings where they didn't have a task to focus on.  Or they'll have trouble paying attention to movies, and will be constantly distracted by other things. 

Most of the people I'm thinking of are still able to drill down and study in an academic/work setting, which I gather is difficult for people with more general attention span problems.  On the other hand, I've seen more people diagnosed with ADD who (as far as I could tell) *weren't* particularly uncomfortable with who they are, but who seemed generally unable to focus on anything for long, not limited to unstructured free-time settings.

The link I'll post mentions ""Gays Taking Over"", a gang of lesbians in Memphis who were raping girls there. The link mentions GLAAD was fighting to have the news reports censored or whatever, and it looks like they succeeded. The links are broken in the article, Google has nothing that I see, aside from some text articles from sites like this and Stormfront (white power group, the gang was black lesbians).

All I can say is I remember the news clip well, as it was very WTFish. They interviewed the gang members, who were quite happy to talk about how they rape straight girls since the gang is called ""Gays Taking Over"" or GTO after all. It wasn't bluster either, arrests were made. Perhaps other redditors will chime in who remember the news segment, so I don't seem like I am some gay basher. It was real ... it just seems that maybe GLAAD was successful in having it tossed in the memory hole I suppose.

Both the video footage was destroyed despite her legal teams wishes and the drugs before all possible testing could be carried out. The bag of ganja was never fingerprinted and numerous officials touched it against vehement requests.

From The Australian 21 May 2005:

*One of Corby's chief lawyers, Erwin Siregar, asked the two police officer witnesses, Wayan Suwita and I Gusti Ngurah Bagus Astawa, why no fingerprints had been taken from the ziplock plastic sack inside the bodyboard bag. Suwita answered: ""We knew it was marijuana, so it wasn't necessary."" Siregar pointed out that the crime of drug smuggling potentially carried the death penalty and asked if that made a ""perfect investigation"" more important. ""It's not my duty to answer that,"" Suwita replied.*

*They harped on the lapses of Indonesian officials. They pointed out the examination of Corby's bag and the initial interrogation was not video-recorded or tape-recorded by police, and an official translator was not provided.*

In Schapelle Corbys own words: *Regarding her failure to notice the bag's extra weight, Corby told the
court the bag's handle had somehow been broken en route to Bali,
meaning she had to drag it. Asked if that was why she failed to notice the added 4kg, she replied:
""Well, I had my suitcase and another bag and I had never dreamed there
was anything else in my boogie board bag than what I had just packed.""*


No 'friend' would say she is guilty.

Lets have a link to this particular photo you talk of.

*""Also, people are arrested/life imprisoned/killed for less then what she did and happens all the time.""* So you think someone serving 20 years should be grateful for what she got? Who DIDNT do the crime?

The Australian authorities never bothered to properly investigate the crime. Mick Keelty said ""We are not in the business of clearing people."" What fucking business should he be in, I wonder, with an derisive attitude like that.

For the large part, media in Australia, are vile. They are protecting the drug trade in Australia with their unprofessional behaviour.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; This is a false problem that is created by theism. There is no reason to assume that there exists a person who set up any conditions

Fine, replace ""who"" with ""what"".  The fact remains that an explanation of how the time-evolution of the Universe proceeds does not provide an explanation of how the initial conditions came to be.

Since it's often lost in the us-versus-them mentality of this forum, let me state that I am by no means arguing that religion has a *good* explanation of this, just that it provides one and that science currently doesn't.

&gt; Nobody. That's why they're called random. They are distributed evenly in the space of possibilities, and thus they need no explanation.

(No, they're probably not uniform -- for example, radioactive decay is a [Poisson process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process).)

Responding fully would require getting further into the philosophy of probability than I would like to or am qualified to do.  Suffice to say that ""ordinary"" random events in our world certainly do have explanations.  If I flip a coin and it comes up ""heads"", there is an explanation of why involving the precise acceleration I imparted to the coin, the mass distribution of the coin, air currents present at the time, etc.  Given all of that information there is nothing random about the outcome -- our use of probability is a way of expressing our ignorance about precise initial conditions.

So if quantum-mechanical random events truly do not have explanations, there's something fundamentally strange about them.  Suppose I observe a particle decay within a certain time interval.  In a many-worlds interpretation, there exists another worldline in which I did not observe that decay -- so why am I in this one instead?  These questions probably do have non-religious answers, but they're much deeper and more troubling even today than your dismissive comment indicates.","1230844131"

Further, if a good majority of people drove PLEHV, we'd have a method to store and then later use excess electricity to further dampen out power variations by utilizing the car's battery. It's not that hard to add plug-in stations in parking lots... ","1230844199"

No, that's not the definition -- that's a value judgement.  The definition is ""a scheme where people invest, to be paid with money from future suckers"".  This is exactly what the Govt. does to get money: sells some bonds in exchange of money, then has to pay that money back at a future date, WITH INTEREST.

&gt; We are simply borrowing a lot of money and having a hard time paying it back.

"religion","t5_2qh39","Amazing.  Again you take a simple question with one concept and add more complex pieces to it before even coming to a common understanding of the simple initial concept.

The goal is to take away complication, not add to it.  You don't add complication until you have a common base.

&gt;if you had no body, you could have no name. if you had a name, you must have a body.

This assumes something about the words ""you"" and ""body"".  Those are both EXTREMELY complex topics in the general sense, and we're just not that far along yet.

We haven't even gotten to what makes a valid definition or description yet, since you didn't answer my last question clearly. (yes, or no)

You seem to be working with the idea that existence applies only to objects, and something is an object if it exists.  You've described that relationship several times... and when I try to break the circle you run away.

&gt; therefore, the body is the object

Putting aside the problem of not knowing what a ""body"" is or what a ""you"" is, your rule seems to be if Word1 depends on Word2 in order to be ""haveable"", then Word1 is a concept, and Word2 an object.

I have a body, I have a name... assuming I need a body to have a name, that makes ""name"" a concept, and ""body"" an object.

**Is that correct?**

If the answer is YES, no explanation is necessary and I will have a single followup question.

If the answer is NO, feel free to provide something that clarifies why the answer is NO.

$325 EAST VILLAGE- Controlled and large 3 bed (East Village) (map) Reply to: hous-976182933@craigslist.org [?] Date: 2009-01-01, 4:39AM EST
-Wow…I can’t believe I am doing this..But I am looking for someone to rent my rent controlled apartment. The monthly rent is extremely cheap and would be a dream for many people in this city. It is in the east village close to A and 3rd. I caught my wife in bed with our neighbor who is almost 20 years younger than her. She is refusing to move out and still seeing him when I am at work, on my bed…I need someone to move in and help me get her out. Man or woman. My plan is to act like we are a couple until she can’t take it anymore. I have done everything possible to try and get her out..But she is a scumbag….So we need to create some type of plan that would get her out..i would charge you very cheap and all you would have to do is act like we are dating. We might have to kiss if front her and make fake sounds when we are in the bedroom. Please respond with a detailed description of your plan to get her out and a little about your self. You could live there after she is out and unless we fall in love we don’t have to do anything else.

It was the military HQ and a legitimate target. Care to mention some of the Arab violent acts of the time, or do you only keep track of the Jewish ones?

Volunteering is a great idea on this list, but if that seems a little cheezy than find something that means something to you and do it for someone else. It has a tendency of popping people out of the rut and/or monotony of their lives. Also, if you don't have many good friends, make new ones. This can be IRL or online, w/e. The point is just to have positive influences. And if you are positive to someone else, they often will reciprocate.

I have a friend who has a history of mental illness. Mom has some real issues and he inherited something similar. Meds really help to stabilize them. As a last recourse, sometimes medication can be extremely valuable. But I would exhaust all other avenues; those doctors are all too happy to write people a prescription.","1230844529"

I propose another theory.  It is well known that religious people outnumber atheists by a large margin.  For arguments sake, lets go with 90%/10%.  So you would expect 9 out of 10 sexual crimes to be committed by religious people.  This could lead you to falsely believe that religious people are more inclined to deviant sexual acts since it is reported more.

When a priest commits a sex crime its easy to associate him with a religion.  When Joe Blow commits a sex crime how do you know if he was religious or not?  This is rarely reported in the news.

"reddit.com","t5_6","atheist speaking. no. doing so would interfere with human development.

James Frazer postulated that civilization progresses through a few different phases of ways that we make sense of the world. the first phase is magic, where humans believe they can affect the world around them by imitation (dressing a boy up in leaves and walking him through the village as villagers sprinkle him with water somehow encourages the rain to fall on the crops). this phase eventually turns into an animistic belief, where not only are humans posessing of something that animates the body, such as a soul, but everything in the world as well. rivers, trees, forests, mountains, etc. all have spirits. this eventually leads to religion, where if there are many ordered structures of spirits or gods in various hierarchies, there must be a supreme one as well. Frazer says that the third phase is science. we--humanity as a whole--is on the very cusp of that scientific awakening. it's very exciting to think that one day (if Frazer is right in his theory that we will pass through the phase of religion into the phase of science and reason), religion will be regarded by our descendents the same way that we regard magic now.

so if i could push a button and make all religion disappear, i wouldn't do it. why? because without scientific knowledge, humanity of thousands of years ago would still have resorted to primitive beliefs in order to understand the world around them. eradicating religion wouldn't do any good, because it would just crop up again.

primitive beliefs worked well enough in primitive society as a way of explaining the world. it doesn't make any sense to us now, because we have the means to apply the rigors of science to the machinations of the world. we know that disease is caused by bacteria or viruses. in a world where there exists no microscopes, something happening to your own physical body that causes you do things that are not under your control (such as vomiting, headaches, chills, etc) would look like you are no longer in charge. hence you're posessed by a spirit that has no control of a body and just happened to take up residence in yours. as societies progressed, people started asking questions, looking into things, inventing new ways of asking thee questions, and now we have microscopes.

i'm not condoning religion in any way. i believe it is an excuse for violence and oppression. however. if you look at the progression from primitive magic to influence the world around you, then animistic theology where the world is influenced by persuading the spirits of the woods or the rain etc as personifications (where the gods begin to resemble man), then to what we have today (praying to a god or gods in order to suspend the laws of the universe in your favor), then we see that the next step is logically science. science and reason.

think of it in evolutionary terms. an organism has no eyes, and somehow developes a light-sensing organ. a light-sensing organ is bound to be better than none, so it's passed down. well, a light-sensing organ that senses 5% of the light our eyes can see is better than one that can only sense 1%, so that's passed down through the genes as well. and so on. obviously a light-sensing organ that can only sense 1% of the light our eyes can sense now is shit by our standards. the same way that our eyes can only sense a fraction of the light spectrum is shit compared to a theoretical eye that can sense the entire spectrum. you need something to build on in order to advance and come to a better organ. otherwise put, you need a shitty explanation of the world in order to come up with a good one. religion is that shitty explanation, and science is the good one.

again, religion is in no way good. at the very most, religion was the source of a great many years of my own personal misery and guilt, and at the very least was a profound waste of my time. but it's a stepping-stone. we know it's wrong. we know it's backwards. but without it, we would have just gone back to explaning the world in terms of magic. now we have the means and the intellect and the knowledge that the world doesn't work the way our ancestors thought it did. let's build on that.

i am so fucking excited.

It is overwhelmingly killing of Hamas fighters. Hamas says that about 20% of the dead are civilians. If the rest are defenseless perhaps they should stop firing rockets at Israeli civilians.

&gt;Those rockets are virtually harmless. 

That is, they are deadly and the use is an inherent war crime. But you forgive such war crimes.

&gt;A much better way to stop the rockets would be to stop the occupation, dismantle the settlements, return to 67 borders and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees.

And in exchange for all of that Hamas will give a 10 year cease fire. Wow.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; How about we don't beat up people for smashing property (or even hurting people), but instead try them in a court of law and send them to prison if they're guilty?

How about we PREVENT those people from using violence, with MORE violence, and THEN, when the situation has been defused, doing what you suggest?

My point is that, if they do not meet equal or more force when they exert violence against others, that is going to be positive reinforcement for future acts.  Just like bullies -- they only stop when they meet their match.

&gt; For bonus points, we could use the time they're in jail to educate them that using violence is a bad idea.

I do not disagree with you on that.

But, had the Swedes been more prepared, armed and alert, this event could have been easily prevented when it was beginning, instead of escalating while the police crawled into action.  For sure, a few Muslims might have ended up injured or dead, but once they resort to violence, dude, they're fair game (in the heat of the moment).

But nooooooooo, ""we can't have people defending themselves, it'd be CHAOS"" and thus we deputize the monopoly of violence onto the police, and only the police.  What's the result?  The VERY SAME CHAOS people were trying to prevent, good citizens running away scared, at the mercy of the terrorists, and millions of dollars in damage.  Chalk one up for the followers of Jihad, because the bad guys were unarguably the superior force.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; I don't know why'd you think I am a bad person.

It was probably your wartime bravado and the fact that I was observing you in debates where everyone here seems to be taking extreme stances.  But some comment, here or there, reminded me of several Israeli fighter pilots I knew well in Tucson, who were truly bad people (or at least when judging them by their words).  They literally did not believe that Palestinians were humans and went so far as to claim that a Jew and a Palestinian could not produce offspring because they were different species.  They would say that they needed to be exterminated because they are vermin (literally) and when I said that was immoral, they laughed and said I was a crazy animal rights activist.  When I said that the way the way they talked sounded to me a lot like the Nazis, they responded that there was nothing wrong with the Nazi attitude, claiming that that the only thing that was wrong with the Nazis was that they were mistaken in identifying Jews as inferior, when in fact (according to these guys) the Jews were the world's superior race.

Obviously, as I soon found out from some other Israelis at the base, these guys were not indicative of the Israeli mindset, but were considered extreme by most Israeli standards.

As for the rest of your reply, I basically agree, but am of the opinion that no matter how dangerous things are, there is never an excuse for a domestic lock down or surveillance society.  Once instituted, it will never dissipate, even when peace comes.  The question of personal freedoms and dignity in Israel is obviously a call for the Israeli people to make, but I think they are being enslaved regardless of intention.

&gt; The public safety devices were invented in Israel because of real threats, and I can see them one by one migrate into American society. This scares me to no end.

Yes, it scares me too.  Personally, and I wish more felt this way, I would much rather deal with constant violence and fighting than to become incorporated into a police/surveillance/prison state.  I simply don't understand the desire to submit to a form of slavery in order to avoid violence and danger.  To me it would be similar to choosing to be placed in a box with guaranteed nutrients via a feeding tube for the rest of my life so as to avoid the dangers of starvation that comes with being free and having to find food on a daily basis.

Well, the most obvious one is that it's *one* study. I'd like to see some verification. The second thing that bothers me is that both groups showed similar results to the lesbian portion. So clearly the conclusion that homophobic men are gay is highly flawed (based on this study, at most they could be said to be bi). Which leads us to problem of how sexual stimuli and sexuality works. Could opponents of homosexuality develop a curiosity towards homosexuality? Of course. Could it show up on a test like this, if the person was shown homosexual porn for the first time? Yes. And, of course, another big problem with the study itself is that the test groups average age is 20 point something, which means there is a lot of sexual insecurity at play here. I wouldn't be surprised if that skewed the results.

Anyway, the best this study is good for is to conclude that among 64 Caucasian male college students, some exhibited greater penal engorgement during homosexual pornography than others. If you want to draw more conclusions than that, you are gonna have to show more research.","1230845116"

"science","t5_mouw","Where to begin with the problems with this article?  And the bad labeling above? 

For one, it doesn't account for sex discrimination from employers, it purports to account for discrepancies in pay in the aggregate.  So it's not claiming sex discrimination is a myth if an employer pays a woman less for the same work, or if an employer does in fact have what this author would claim is an anomalous female who is high risk-taking, high status-seeking, who is willing to relocate, but does not reward her as he would a man with those qualities.  So the label is misleading.  The article makes no claim about sex discrimination being myth, as it surely isn't.  

But the article's conclusion that evolution created a population of risk takers and a population of risk averse is rather an oversimplification.  But even if that were the case, the idea of an evolutionary concept of ""high status seeking"" as a trait being applied to corporate status may account for the CEO, but the vast majority of jobs in the world require the skills of the care givers, such as showing up for work even when you're sick, working on a variety of projects, some short (dinner), some longer (gardening), some taking years to bring to fruition (getting a child from womb to matriculation).  The article is lacking the I/O psychologists profiling of each job and comparing to the qualities women have (supposedly) evolved in their attitudes and character and ability.  

In essence the article asks, why do men make more money, and answers, because they want more money, doesn't answer the question.  Everyone wants more money.  So more precisely, it answers, because men want more money more than women want more money.  But still doesn't answer the question, so why do they get more money?  

Therein lies a much more complicated question than this author is willing to tackle or purport is still a relevant question.  ","1230845145"

I will admit that not all labia are created equal, and some are more intriguing than others, but I don't think the structure is something that will turn me away from a woman by itself (unless she has chosen to modify it in some bizarre manner).

&gt;The aluminum is NOT magnetic. When the aluminum is placed into a magnetic field its creates a flow of electrons that make an electromagnet that REPELS the magnetic field entering it, so it falls very slowly. The flow flow of electrons creates friction as they flow, and thats why it heats up and DOESNT FLOAT. However, there are superconductors that dont produce any friction(or very low friction at least) and they do float, so check out some videos about that.

ie: because the aluminum isn't a superconductor, the resistance to electron flow leads to dissipation of energy as heat, causing it so slowly sink, instead of floating indefinitely.

If the company merely asks you if the products they are buying come from israel you have to end your contract with them and report them to the government.

Out of curiosity, do you realize that this analogy has nothing to do with the issue at hand?  Or do you simply not have any idea how to construct a valid comparison?

I used to be able to purchase games and get disks or CDs which give me the right to install them as many times as I wanted, on as many machines as I wanted, for as many years as I wanted.  Now, with Steam, I'm being asked to pay roughly the same amount, except now I can only install my game when and where the publisher says I can, they can revoke that privilege at any time, and there's a high likelihood that if they ever go out of business, I can never play the game again.

So, if you don't think the system is ""wrong"" when it's trying to charge you the same amount of money while giving far less in return - in fact, giving you exactly *nothing*, not even a printed manual - I'd really be curious when you think it IS wrong.

&gt;If you don't want to buy from Steam, don't.

Actually, you're incorrect.  I would LOVE to buy from Stream... but that option is not available.  What I refuse to do is *rent* from Steam, and I will be very consistant in doing so, and in telling people why I do so.

After all, the more quickly people realize they're being ripped off by restrictive DRM, and remember that there used to be a better way of doing things, the more quickly the market can start demanding that ""the system"" start actually giving them something for their money besides unenforcible promises.

And as soon as I can actually *buy* from Steam, I'll be the first in line for a new account. ","1230845432"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; in the context of religious doctrines which ""explain"" things that science currently cannot, Occam's razor does not come into play at all -- there is no alternative explanation

There are countless alternative explanations. First of all, you can substitute FSM to get an alternative. Aside from that, you can use scientific hypotheses. For instance, we don't know how life on Earth originated, but there are plausible hypotheses available -- we just don't know which one of them is correct. This means that just because ""science can't explain"" doesn't mean you can't think of natural explanations.

&gt; I'm very pessimistic about finding a neutral way to encode metaphysical claims as Turing machine outputs so we can use Kolmogorov complexity.

Let's try an example. Suppose there are n species of animals, each of them with m pieces of information (I'm assuming m is a constant to keep it simple). Now suppose you try to explain these m*n facts by Goddidit. Then you need to prefix each of the sentences expressing the fact with 'God did it,' and you've already made the explanation longer than the facts explained.

&gt; your still-unsupported claim

OK, how's this for an argument:

* religious people attempt to make themselves believe that their life and/or the whole world has been given a meaning by someone or something external to them and/or to the world
* from time to time, shit happens (you know the jokes, I suppose)
* when shit happens, reality collides with their comforting beliefs and gives them painful anxiety
* to cope with anxiety and explain evil away, they have to resort to even crazier beliefs, such as original sin
* etc. etc. (vicious circle)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;As far as I can see, it just characterizes atheists in the way that the religious types already see us; that we don't represent anything aside from being godless.

Well, we don't represent anything aside from being godless.  There is nothing else to atheism, it is entirely a response to god-fullness.

And you're wrong, a great many religious types believe we represent satan and his minions [*]... so furthering the idea that atheism says nothing other than ""I don't believe in god"" is an improvement.  (and since it's the truth, I'll call that a bonus)

&gt; but that doesn't mean that atheists are nihilists

And we don't say it does, nor does the pamphlet.  Saying we have no core dogma is much different from saying we have a core dogma of nothing.

&gt;Nor does it mean that we have nothing to say about the universe, morality, etc.

That's exactly what it says.  

Atheists as a group assert exactly zero about the universe, morality, etc.  (other than that they don't affirmatively believe that any god did it.)

Individuals and subgroups may have something to say, but membership under the tab ""atheist"" says nothing about your position on anything else.

I have been pretty successful (but not completely) at staying grounded (at least by some measure) and not worrying about fluctuations in my wealth.

I try to stay focused on my family and friends and direct my energies on the needs of others through charitable work in order to keep myself in touch with reality. It takes a conscience effort, otherwise, you can easily slip into an alternative universe where children are upset at not getting a particular color &lt;your favorite German sports car&gt; for their 16th birthday.

From my personal experience about half the people I know who have significant wealth stay grounded, handle it well and do not completely tie up their self image with their financial success. The other half, well, not so much. They fret over lost dollars (and some of them even fret over dollars not made) and are completely wound up in increasing their wealth/status.

True, but the Fed is also legally obliged to rebate that interest to the State Treasury at the end of each year, and historically it has rebated around 99% (~1% being needed to run the Fed).

The central bank is a government/private hybrid entity. Its member banks are ""owned"", in a limited sense, by private banks, yet its whole Baord of Governors is nominated and appointed by the Senate and the President.

Being a fighter pilot is the highest place in Israeli social ladder - a mother's dream in the same way as american mother's dream of her child becoming the President. Whether true or not for every pilot on personal level, they are treated as the elite. Pilots are taught to think that they are the best of the best.

Arabs do have sides that scare us, but if we want to live here we should get used to these things.

&gt; Obviously, as I soon found out from some other Israelis at the base, these guys were not indicative of the Israeli mindset, but were considered extreme by most Israeli standards.

I haven't read this before responding to the above, and I found myself glad to do so when I went back to read the rest of the comment.

&gt; The question of personal freedoms and dignity in Israel is obviously a call for the Israeli people to make, but I think they are being enslaved regardless of intention.

We do not have the culture of personal liberty, although we are quite a free country in many aspects. We also understand that *now* we need security. I feel bothered traveling into foreign countries and not seeing armed guards next to every door - I forget that I'm unlikely to run into a suicide bombing in Frankfurt.

&gt; I simply don't understand the desire to submit to a form of slavery in order to avoid violence and danger.

Honestly, because when you have a real external threat, it works. You can't afford to play dictator games when war can break at any moment and people are all looking at you asking what are you doing to protect them. But as I said; for us it works, for America it is poison.

"programming","t5_2fwo","There's no single right answer. Programming is a large enough field that there are multiple career paths.

But I think for starters, begin with C. A whole lot of other languages (C++, C#, Java, PHP) borrowed large portions of it, so it provides a very solid foundation.

From there, you have to decide what kind of programming you want to do.

If you want to be a generalist, learn Java next. And some scripting languages too - Perl, Python.

Web developer? PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Both of the above will probably involve using a database at some point. So, as painful and ugly as it is, I would recommend learning the basics of databases: Tables, SQL, and normalization.

If you want to be a Desktop Application dev, you're going to have to deal with MicroSoft in all it's g(l)ory. Learn C# (biggie) and MFC. You can spend your whole life chasing MicroSoft's latest language flavor of the month, but those two are foundational.

On the other side of the fence... if you don't know some Unix, you really should learn some. Sooner or later you're going to run into it. Knowing C and Perl will help you get things done under Unix, and vice-versa.

I think functional languages are very interesting - Haskell and Scheme are my two favorites. But I don't think they'll help you get a job, in general. So I can't recommend them if getting a job is your primary goal.

(Note the conspicuous absence of C++ in the above. I'm a full-time C++ hater; I think for OO you should do Java, and for performance you should do straight C. There was a time when your only choices to do OO were C++ or Smalltalk. That day has thankfully past. You can do OO in a lot of languages now, most of them far less cryptic and overly complicated than C++.)

Lastly... Agile is the buzzword recently in programming management. I think there are good things about Agile, but I also think it's been oversold. A very smart programmer (Fred Brooks) once cautioned us that in programming, there are [""no silver bullets.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) Nothing will ever make programming so simple and easy that anyone off the street can just walk in and do it. Software is *fundamentally hard*, and will always be so. Programming management fads come and go about every 5 years or so, and every one of them promises to be the silver bullet that will instantly solve all your problems - which of course is bullshit. And Agile has suffered this fate. That said, though, there are some good things about Agile. (Make changes in small increments; Used automated tests, and run them frequently; Get feedback from your customers often.) So once you've got the nuts and bolts of all the languages mastered, go ahead and take a look at it. Just remember that it's not a substitute for thinking for yourself - no matter how much the Agile pushers claim it is.

On a personal note, I have found that working on embedded systems, where I get to solder chips and design circuit boards as well as writing low-level code, have been some of the most challenging and rewarding work of my programming career so far. If you're the type of person who enjoys building physical things, not just virtual ones, look into embedded systems.","1230846226"

&gt;Perhaps the most politically damaging event of Hoover's presidency was the Bonus March, staged by World War I veterans in 1932. Several years earlier, Congress had passed the Soldiers' Bonus Act, which granted veterans Adjusted Compensation Certificates, payable in 1945. In May 1932, the ""Bonus Army"" converged on the capitol to urge early redemption for the certificates.

&gt;More than 17,000 desperate veterans gathered in Washington to force passage of the bill. Hoover had already made generous provisions for veterans and felt that the bill was a huge expense that wouldn't help the country's most needy. In July, the Bonus Bill was defeated in the Senate, although the government offered to pay the fare home for each veteran.

&gt;Thousands accepted the offer, but thousands more remained encamped across the Potomac from central Washington in a ramshackle shantytown, dubbed ""Hooverville."" Although the Bonus Army had behaved remarkably peacefully, the police were called in to evict the veterans. A riot broke out and Hoover ordered that federal troops be dispatched to contain the veterans. The commanding general, Douglas MacArthur, did much more than ""contain"", however, and ordered the use of tear gas, tanks, and bayonets, and commanded soldiers to set fire to the veterans' shacks. Several veterans and even an infant were killed in the chaos. Hoover never publicly criticized the general for his excessive conduct, and thus the American people blamed the president as well as MacArthur. -- [Source](http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1580.html)","1230846298"

Yeah, I saw the other post that you mentioned to me in a reply of yours.  Liked it a lot.  The feeling I get is that this attitude is not shared among the majority of Israelis and especially is not shared by ""armchair Israelis"".  But, to be fair, my perceptions and stereotypes are being severely warped by all the crossfire on Reddit.

I'd be interested to see what your take on this guy's attitude is.  I've been kind of poking and prodding him, not to screw with him, but I'm just curious about how racist thought processes work (not that I'm accusing him of racism).  Also, I'm sure, if I looked back over my poke and prodding techniques, there's something there for me to be embarrassed about.

It works as follows:

* It scans the airwaves generating a list of unproected SSIDs.
* Connects to the one with the best signal.
* Pings the website of your choice to check for web connectivity (to negate unsecured pay hotspots with a landing page)
* If the ping gets through then you've got web access so it keeps the connection, else it drops it and moves to the next in the list.

This is all fully automated. All you have to do is plug in, switch on, leave for a minute and 'viola', you have a free access bridge.

You can also specify preferred SSIDs (with or without keys) which it should try first before defaulting to leeching.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","1. It sounds like you're suggesting that Microsoft should attempt to patch vulnerabilities in third-party software, and somehow secure a system with users running as Administrator. This is an area where Linux has an advantage, mostly due to package managers. Any Windows vendor wanting to update automatically has to do it themselves.

2. I'm not familiar with this case. Neither the (biased) blog post nor Microsoft's bulleting address the vulnerability in much detail. Still, eight years is ridiculous. If I cared more than a little bit about security I'd do more research to find out what the hell happened.

3. Debian had a security issue a few months ago. Something about a Debian dev patching a package without understanding the nature of the change...hmm. Horrifying vulnerability that stuck around for years even though the source was available to anyone interested. Well, everyone makes mistakes.

4. SuppressWarning is a *name*. Is it imported by LegitCheckControl, and if so from where? Is it the name of a registry key or value? Is it an internal symbol? We have nothing but the author's assertion of what ""SuppressWarning"" means, and we need more evidence than that. This one is intriguing, and I'd dig around myself, but am using my daughter's computer so have no dev tools available. :P

5. Windows zeroes memory before allocating it to a process. VirtualLock guarantees that locked pages won't be written to swap while locked. I suppose a fresh page could be swapped after VirtualAlloc but before VirtualLock--working around that would be a little fun.

6. Automatic Update can be disabled with a trivial procedure. But yes, auditing is one area that an open-source model has the advantage. NSA gets to see the source of Windows, but not a chance in hell I'll ever get to. :/

7. Windows Vista and Server 2008 have improved this considerably; so much so that I wouldn't use any other version in a security-critical application. Even in those versions, security configuration is powerful but Byzantine. I wouldn't trust myself to do it properly when checking the box labeled ""let everyone do anything, hurr hurr"" is so easy. I expect that future versions of Windows will make further improvements in security configuration--if not, Microsoft will have a hard time getting more of my money.

8. This is point 4 all over again.

You make some good points, and in fact you've partially convinced me--if I needed some serious security, e.g. storing CC numbers or health records, Windows wouldn't be my first choice. However, my contention stands: that recent versions of Windows are a reasonable choice for sensitive applications. Of course an out-of-the-box install isn't perfect for any use, but that's true of any OS.

Apparently I haven't read Microsoft's EULA thoroughly enough. Their limitation of liability is almost certainly overly broad (though IANAL), but god damn, that a dick move.","1230846751"

First of all, not all Jews are Ashkenazim.  There are the Mizrachi and Sfardi Jews as well, you know.  And studies are forthcoming on the genetic links of the Ethiopian Beta Israel back to other Jews; they may be religious converts.

Secondly, the definition of a Jew is someone born to a non-apostate Jewish mother or a convert to the Jewish religion.  So no, Israel is not your land, and it is not the land of the Palestinians.  Any Jews who converted to Islam and married with Arabs were abandoning both their religion and their cultural identity, and did this consciously.

-Wow…I can’t believe I am doing this..But I am looking for someone to rent my rent controlled apartment. The monthly rent is extremely cheap and would be a dream for many people in this city. It is in the east village close to A and 3rd. I caught my wife in bed with our neighbor who is almost 20 years younger than her. She is refusing to move out and still seeing him when I am at work, on my bed…I need someone to move in and help me get her out. Man or woman. My plan is to act like we are a couple until she can’t take it anymore. I have done everything possible to try and get her out..But she is a scumbag….So we need to create some type of plan that would get her out..i would charge you very cheap and all you would have to do is act like we are dating. We might have to kiss if front her and make fake sounds when we are in the bedroom. Please respond with a detailed description of your plan to get her out and a little about your self. You could live there after she is out and unless we fall in love we don’t have to do anything else.

and by the military target rationale you use, one could say that every Israeli above the age of 18 and under the age of 45 is a potential military target because they have a conscript system and after their initial mandatory period of service they can be called for reserve duty until the age of 45. One could also make the argument, however repugnant, that people under 18 will most likely be conscripted into the military and so are still military targets.

I should have clarified that an important element of US funding of Israel is that they turn around and use it to buy armaments from the US. Palestinians can pretty much only get arms through smuggling, which is why they get to use peashooters while the IDF gets some of the most advanced military tech in the world.","1230847000"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Ok.. I work for UPS, so I see this kind of stuff all the time. Most of the drivers want to get you your package, and don't want to break it in the process. It is just more work for them if they break it, and you refuse it, they all know that. And this was obviously a bag of clothes, or something along those lines. I don't know one driver that would actaully throw something of value (you can tell for the most part after seeing boxes all day for years, electronics are usually in their own boxes, lots of little tricks to it). This could get him in major trouble, and he is just going to have to go back later to pick it back up.

If the driver can save 20 seconds on a top, and has 300 stops, that's over an hour and a half he has saved. If he can stay out delivering packages later, more people get their packages. 

Right now we are having the problem of too many packages, people getting all pissed their shit isn't there on time (by all means, a legitimate complaint). Most drivers try to please the customer, they see them daily sometimes, and less work for them is less money.

I'm not saying this guy did the correct thing by UPS standards, but if a driver just wants to get more packages to more people, try not to complain so much that he threw your clothes. There have been two posts like this, and both have been boxes that definitely look like they could be thrown.

Also, try looking for some videos of packages INSIDE the hub. They are subject to things 100x than what you see in videos like this. That would be the place to start complaining if I were a customer.","1230847024"

Here it is:

&gt;Mises and the printing press

&gt;In 1920, Austrian government officials called the eminent economist Ludwig von Mises and asked to meet him to discuss the problem of Austrian inflation.  Mises agreed but made a strange request: he wanted to meet at midnight on a particular Vienna street corner.  Baffled, the desperate government officials agreed.  When Mises arrived, the street was quiet except for continuous noise coming from an adjacent building.  After the officials asked the renowned economist how they should address the inflation wreaking havoc on the Austrian economy, Mises pointed to the noisy building and replied, “first and foremost, you have to stop that noise.”  Why did Mises make such a statement?  The government printing press resided in the racket producing building and government officials had it running twenty-four hours a day, continuously printing money. 

&gt;While we don’t know if the meeting ever occurred, Prof. Joseph Salerno points out that “this is something Mises would have said.”   Further, the story allows insights transcending the factual accuracy of the exchange.  First, Mises’s terse response demonstrates that increasing the money supply *causes* inflation, and phenomena such as rising prices are merely *effects* of the underlying governmental action serving as the cause.  This leads to a second point: politicians and bureaucrats are often oblivious—whether intentionally or unintentionally—to the cause of the problems that so baffle them.  Can’t you just picture the shocked looked on the officials’ faces when Mises called their cure the cause?  The answer allows for a third and final point: politicians and bureaucrats do not gain superior wisdom or angel wings, nor do they stop acting in their own self-interest upon election or appointment to office.  Before Mises doused them with the cold reality of the situation, how many likely stood up in their bureaus, planning committees, and legislatures to advocate *the exact opposite* response to the problem?  Would it not behoove them to save face by staying the course and vociferously blaming an unpopular third-party?

*Footnotes: I used a lecture from Joseph Salerno on mises.org for the background story.  Available here: http://mises.org/media.aspx?action=category&amp;ID=125","1230847098"

The reason they are different is that with the plane on the treadmill, the treadmill does nothing whatsoever! Nothing, it's like it's not even there. It can spin as much as it want but it has no effect whatsoever on the plane.

Not so with this new case (the cart). Here the treadmill is very important - it powers the wheels, which then power the propeller and moves the whole thing forward.

That's why they are so different - in one case the treadmill does something, in the other it's there just to confuse people.","1230847202"

I returned home after 4 years and it appears my words were digested, and it seems my entire family has changed because of them.  All of what i was told to leave over, it seems has come full circle and finally sunk in, and now instead of a person without a family, i've been promoted to the position of family wise man.

It starts out OK and there are a few good titles but with the exception of about 7 all of those titles are available on other systems and are better on other systems.  Then well over half the page is yellow and red scores.  That means well over half the wii games have average scores of less than 75%.  This coming from a system that mostly uses the 7-10 scale anyway shows just how bad most of this stuff is.  To say it's elitist to expect good games instead of crappy mini-game collections designed for casual markets is ridiculous.","1230847244"

"politics","t5_2cneq","You're making my point for me -- it *does* matter what X and Y are, contrary to your previous statement. You went abstract with it, and then as soon as you didn't like the logical conclusion, you retreated to the specifics of this particular situation and tried to misrepresent my argument.

If an organization helps only battered women whose name starts with ""A,"" and I ask what's so important about the letter ""A,"" you would apparently say that I was trying to distract people, or that I was uncomfortable talking about the problem.

Given the zero-sum nature of society's energy, time, and money, I think there is real value in: (a) asking which lines are relevant to draw and which ones aren't, and (b) reminding ourselves of the gulf between what we *want* to do and what we *can* do, and prioritizing accordingly.

The common and historical usage of the phrase ""anti-semite"" in Anglo countries refers to Jews only.

You may wish to analyze the societal issues and biases that lead to that, but that's a different argument, akin to analyzing issues of race, gender, and language.

Calling someone out on this point simply does not weaken their argument.

In the same way, the standard and historical usage for the word ""American"" in Anglo countries refers specifically to the US. It does not refer to Canadians, nor to Mexicans, nor to South or Central Americans.

If you want to argue about that fine, but it's a sideshow, and a clumsy debating tactic.

There are plenty of real criticism about this shitty situation, without resorting to amateurish debating tricks.
