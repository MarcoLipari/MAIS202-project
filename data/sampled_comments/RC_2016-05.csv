Yeah I listen to a lot of mac demarco and Homeshake (his guitarist) so lots of inspiration is drawn from there. I definitely think your right about a solo, it could really mix it up, probably better than a further verse would do. I think double vocals on the chorus would be a good idea as well, just wondering if I'd be able to pull off the mixing for that correctly, worth a try though. I'm really glad you like the lyrics, that's what my favourite part of writing is and so it's really motivating to hear that there is no fault in them. I'll have to try that saturation on the vocals as well. Thanks for all the help, these projects I've been doing recently have really been exciting me, hopefully I get enough done for a full tape.  
Also you're right about mona, that was kind of sloppily produced, there was no bass line at all in it and the guitar sometimes went out of time as did the drums, the cymbals were far too loud as well, hopefully once I give a go at cleaning it up it'll polish up nicely.",1462060801

First of all, Group B cars are extremely tough, and second of all, sorry for the long post, tried to answer as many questions that might pop up as possible, and try to point anyone new in the right direction.

------------------------------------------

It's a bit unclear if you are blaming the ""falling of the cliffs""-part on the setup or not, but if you do, that's not really right. A setup is neither going to throw you off the cliff, nor keep you on the road. A setup can tweak your car to better fit your driving style, and allow you to take some corners faster, whilst having to sacrifice your pace on some other ones that don't fit the setup. 

Before even starting with setups at all, I recommend learning how to keep your focus, and keep it on the right things, so that you're capable of running a rally stage without continuously crashing/spinning. As I said earlier a setup won't make or break it, it can just tweak your handling, but to actually use your handling you must ""learn to drive"" so-to-say. (You don't mention if this is something you can do, but all this is more general, for everyone)

So I can't show you a setup as I'm on mobile, but I'll just go through how I setup all cars. Also worth mentioning is that you say that the diff is not strong enough, which I can understand, but it's just how it is, all cars are different. You should look into learning techniques to work around it, such as flicking, left-foot braking, or just getting better by practice.

Also you complain that the brakes aren't giving enough power when it's set so much to the rear. This should not be something to worry about, most often brakes are used to give front traction or rotate the car around ahead of a corner. What actually slows down your car is the gravel running against your tire's sidewalls, which is much more efficient than your brakes, even when biased to deliver as much brake power as possible. This is partly because your tires will lock, and btw, turn off ABS if it's on. Locking your brakes will make your car rotate easily (making it easier to rotate without as much rear bias as well), and let you slide, the proper way to stop and often approach a corner. It's worth saying that one of the ""aliens"" (super good players) do run with as much as ~80% rear bias, and they set world records left and right.

So also before going on to set up the car, don't blame your mistakes on setups (unless you make a really really off one), if you're good with the car you can set regular top 10 world records with the default setup: there are people who do that even when running no-restart events. It's also worth noting that the game hasn't been out on consoles for very long, and I didn't start fiddling with setups until 250+ hours into the game, though I believe I started a bit late, but just saying that there's no rush, and it might be worth spending the setup time on normal practice.

Now finally for the actual setups for cars, wohoo! These things I do on all non-tarmac rallies, though I often do something similar on tarmac ones, but not as extreme.

Brake bias: if it's a non-RWD, 70-40% rear bias, depending on car and conditions. 

Front diff: As loose as possible

Center diff: default

Rear diff: as strong as possible

Gears: very car dependent, default usually works fine, with the exception of some cars in Finland or Germany, where the gears need to be way longer.

Suspension (I only touch the overview slider, nothing in the advanced setup screen): keep rear and front at the same value, stiffen 1 or 2 steps from default, the older the car, the less stiffening, and generally much stiffer on tarmac.

Damping: Basically always left untouched with the exception of Finland in older classes, where I usually soften them 1 or 2 steps from default.

This setup style is close to what Porkhammer uses (an alien), and usually it's based on turning in and rotating the car fully long before the corner starts, and powering through it, balancing the throttle and the brake to keep the car on the road, and in the middle. This is a tough driving style that requires a lot of confidence, and it's quite hard to start out with. Something that makes it hard is that the diff settings will make your car slide **a lot** when using full throttle when going sideways, making throttle-control very important.

Sorry if I seemed a bit rude before, it's definitely not my intention, but this is a very tough game, and if you are only left blaming on the game, not feeling motivated to actually improve your own driving or continue, it kinda looses it's fun. Also, it's a bit hard to know what level you are at, and most of what I wrote is just general stuff of how I view it. I might have misunderstood everything you wrote and just screwed up :p but I know how frustrating the game can be, so it's definitely understandable that you are frustrated. My recommendation is take a break, maybe a few days or a week, or more, it usually helps both frustration and can somehow make you faster and more consistent, usually works for me.

My personal recommendation if it wasn't clear earlier, skip setups, and drive the default one (which if you didn't know, is made by the dev team, where it's different for each car in each location, not just every slider set at 50% or something).",1462060802

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","The moment the game really clicked for me was Undead Burg. Fighting the shield-skeleton guarding the stairs down to the merchant. We danced a dance for a while. I'd swing, he'd block, nothing would come of it. We stood shield to shield for a bit. Frustrated, I kicked him. 

His guard broke, and it stumbled - I pressed in and slashed, and he fell. Finally, I understood. Moves, combos, playing smart. After that, I could take him out easy, every time. Same with the rest of the enemies there. I needed to respect them still, for a misstep would still kill me. I had started to understand how the game worked, and from there it was upward. That was the first realization I had in the series.

My second realization was after my first run through Bloodborne. I had played it much like DS, slow and meticulous, and slowly learning how to respond to every threat. My first two nights playing Bloodborne, I didn't get as far as even Cleric Beast. Just ran the street repeatedly, trying to get through without using up all my healing items, trying to get a grasp of the game. 6-8 hours before actually fighting and killing Cleric Beast. When I had beat the game and started a new game [not NG+, but a true new character at low level], I ran through there and destroyed everything. What had taken me hours before I did in 30 minutes, not because my character had leveled up, but because *I had.* This was the moment I realized I was truly growing as a player in these games.

The final moment that I first began to think perhaps I had finally gotten gud was in DS3. Even in that BB playthrough the first time, I was always so afraid of each threat. Every boss room was trepidation and fear; every new threat I approached so cautiously and afraid. I felt like a weak spritely grain of sand against such enemies, and that I was surrounded by this menacing terror of a world I only needed to survive. Every big new enemy I saw I would avoid, stay back, level and run to and hope not to die. Every boss room requiring a full preparation for the expedition.

Not so in DS3. DS3, I found myself eagerly taking on every enemy that came before me. Every new big guy that presented itself, I found myself saying ""Alright, sweetheart. Come here so I can kill you."" I had lost my fear to press onward, my fear of losing souls or that I couldn't make it without the utmost caution. I started feeling cocky. I'd swagger into boss rooms as I'd find them, and was only too ready to on the fly start adapting to the challenges. 

Three moments of realization, from understanding the basics, to competence, to gud, over two years of playing. ",1462060804

&gt;Just a fairly homogeneous genetic blob of mediocrity.

Why do you think it's impossible to prevent this in a communist society? 

&gt;Well, politics always has to be about realistic acceptance of enforcement and finding like-minded men who will enter the mutual pact of insuring each other's rights—the aristocratic circle.

Why would they not give in to nepotism? Why would it not descend into a lame old bureaucracy?

&gt;Because we are higher status 
 
How is it decided that one is higher status? Who is ""we""?

&gt;and earned it through our virtus.
 
What does this entail?

&gt;This is about men of merit and valor standing together against deceitful priests and the dysgenic mob.

When you say it like that, I imagine something much nicer than what I picture the reality looking like. You word it like it's the honorable warrior caste trying to fend off these parasites that only want to bring them down. In my eyes, it would really be just another case of a class oppressing other classes. Why does there have to be a state? 

&gt;There's literally no hierarchy, though: no members of an aristo class, only the bottom primitive mob.

Of course there's no hierarchy. You don't need hierarchy to exalt greatness. People can still prove themselves to be exceptional human beings without needing to rule over another.

You will have only two options: retake A&amp;P someplace where you will get 8 SH of credit, or only apply to schools that will accept your 10 QH of credit.

(I guess you could also look for a 3rd class to take at your school that is worth at least 2 QH and falls under A&amp;P.)",1462060808

###Live updates from ringside 

3:31 PM - I'm here ringside. In the front row. Luis Bello just scored a quick first round stoppage. They quickly touted out the next pair of fighters. Jesus Aguinaga vs Adan Mares up now. Not sure if related to Abner but he is trained by Robert Garcia. 

**Adan Mares vs Jesus Aguinaga**

Close first round, both fighters going at it on the inside. Mares took a lot of opportunities to score form the outside as Aguinaga telegraphs a lot of his shots from the outside. Danny Garcia just walks past as the round ends. He and the Fox crew are settling in ringside to deliver the nights blow-by-blow.

This fight is scheduled for 6 and it's on pace for it. We've seen a few low blows thus far as both guys are showing their commitment to the body. Aguinaga is settling back and letting Mares come to him, plotting to counter him on the way in. 

Both guys have settled in and have figured the other out. Their faces both covered in blood. The space crowd is loving the action here. 

This fight is brutal. They've both figured out the others defense and it's open season now. Blood is gushing from Mares face. 

This one is wild. Mares found himself hurt in the 5th but Aguinaga couldn't capitalize. Fatigue is setting in. The weather here couldn't be better. 70 degrees, sunny, a nice breeze. 

Blood is gushing out of the top of Mares's head. I could have sworn I just saw a squirt. His blood is dripping down Aquinas's back. These two are going all out to the bell, referee has to jump in to separate the pair after 6 rounds of ultra violence. 

This fight is a draw. It looked like Aquinaga did a bit more damage, but nobody will complain about this one. There were enough punches landed to make it difficult to tell who won. 

**Terrell Gausha vs Orlando Lora**

**Round 1**

Gauche starting fast behind his jab and he's keeping his distance. He's measuring nicely and keeping himself out of range of Lora's offense. Gausha scores with his 1-2. Lora goes to the body with his jab. Gausha avoids a right and ties up. Gausha looking for the range, lands a good right hand right down the middle. Gausha rips one down he middle, another one. Lora winces form the impact of that one. Gausha to the body with the left hand. Lora tries working Gausha on the ropes. Gets nothing. The 28 year old prospect easily  takes round 1. 

##Gausha 10-9

**Round 2**

Lora trying to find something on the inside. Gausha's movement bothering him. Lora finding his way inside but can't avoid the right. A right gets there for Gausha, right around the gloves. Gausha scores with the right again. Gausha using the lead hand to blind Lora. Brutal body shot from Gausha and a right hand to the head. 

##Gausha 10-9, 20-18 

**Round 3**

Both fighters content to step toward the inside and work. Gausha getting the the better work in, he lands some vicious body shots. Gausha with a big lead left hook, that one made Lora take a step back. Lora's face looks like its on the verge of splitting with all the jabs and rights he's taken. A big right from Gausha makes Lora stagger backward. Lora might not be as hurt as Guasha thinks. The ropes are certainly holding him up. Lora lands a big right hook. Gausha in his guard, waiting. Lora bends forward and they're ear to ear. A right hook by Gausha at the bell. 

##Gausha 10-9, 30-27 

**Round 4**

Gausha trying the right to the body and it works, goes upstairs, connects, lands the left to the body. Gausha settling into a dangerous rhythm here. A big left hook to the body by Gausha. Gausha lands the 1-2. Lora eats a big right hook. He's getting beaten on the inside by these traps Gausha is laying. Lora on the ropes, hard body shots and uppercuts from Gausha. Gausha is putting in work here on the inside, big right hook. A big left hook from Gausha is met by a left hook from Lora. Good exchange for both. 

##Gausha 10-9, 40-36 

**Round 5**

Lora is aggressive coming out and pays for it as he eats a big right from Gausha. Gausha jabbing from the outside. A big right hook from Gausha. Gausha with the jab. Gausha jabs. A lead right from Gausha, that looped its way in. Another one. A left hook to the body by Gausha. Right hook by Gausha, head, body now. Gausha settles in this round, he's coasting now.

##Gausha 10-9, 50-45

**Round 6**

Gausha circling and jabbing. A good right over the top from Gausha and a left hook. Lora tries trapping him in the corner and can't keep him there. Gausha easily escapes. The difference in footwork skill is drastic. A nice right from Gausha scores. A jab from Gausha and a huge right over the top. Another one. Lora looks like he might be hurt, theres blood now. Gausha back in his rhythm. Gausha is swinging for the fences now. Lora is gushing blood outside the left eye. 

##Gausha 10-9, 60-54 

**Round 7**

Gausha boxing on the outside,e the cut on the outside of Lora's eye has gotten no better after the corner break. A big uppercut from Gausha. Gausha with the right. Lora is a bloody mess. A right around the gloves for Gausha. A nice 1-2 down the middle for Gausha. Lora with a nice left. Gausha with a 4 punch combination that connects. A nice right from Gausha. It seem like Lora isn't even interested in blocking the right hand. He's a bloody mess and his accepted it. A left hook for Gausha. 

##Gausha 10-9, 70-63

**Round 8**

The combination of the cut and the uncompetitiveness of the fight forces Lora's corner to stop the fight.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","Found the fix on Bestheda's forums. This worked for me. 

1. Delete Fallout 4 application data. Just navigate to the F4 icon in the PS menu, press the Options button and choose delete. Unfortunately on PS4 you cannot just delete DLC alone.

2. Turn off automatic downloads in the Settings menu.

3. Re-install Fallout 4. If you have a physical copy this bit is easy - just insert the disc and install. If like me you bought a digital copy, you'll have to re-download the whole thing. You may also be prompted to install purchased DLC - make sure you do not install Automatron!

4. Disconnect your PS4 from the internet. This may not be necessary if you disabled downloads, but I did it just to make sure. The option is under Settings, and then Network. Uncheck the box that says 'Connect to network'.

5. Start Fallout 4, loading the character you encountered the bug with. Make sure no Automatron quests or items are showing in the Pip-Boy, then create a new save. Close Fallout 4.

6. Connect to the internet and re-install Automatron.

7. Start Fallout 4 and load up the save you just made. The Automatron questline should start again from the beginning. Obviously you will lose the progress you made.

8. Create a new save and play through the questline as normal, but this time DO NOT build the robot workbench as soon as it's available. Building the workbench and modifying Ada seems to be what causes this bug. I also left Ada at a settlement while I went to the General Atomics factory. This may not be necessary, but I would do it just to be safe.

These steps allowed me to continue with the quest as intended, so I hope this helps anyone else having this problem. ",1462060809

The stories aim to be so realistic that I find it very boring. I miss fantasy elements like Mario or Metroid, something completely of its own. I'm a big Nintendo fanboy but it feels like the spirit is still there. I'm just tired of all the gimmicks of motion control and other junk. I just want a controller.

There's so much complaining in the video game world nowadays. If you don't like it, don't play it, but don't spend all this time spewing vitriol about it and making online communities toxic.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I was in a similar situation myself a few weeks ago but not as bad. Here's what I'd do:

Right now scrounge up as much cash as you can. That's really all you need to be focusing on.

Bring a backpack with water bottles, clothes you can layer, and a sleeping bag. And calorie dense food like breakfast bars, seeds, nuts. 

You can use the restroom, fill up your water bottles, and sort of bathe in fast food bathrooms.

Once you get to your destination, hit up a local homeless shelter. If you travel light they'll see you don't have much to steal and you'll mostly get left alone. You'll meet some interesting/nice people along the way. 

Get a job lawn mowing or landscaping or something like that. Usually those places don't look into your background too much and are willing to give you a shot. You just gotta work hard, but it'll be a decent paycheck for sure. Only problem is you have to eat a lot when you're doing manual labor, so again load up on calorie dense foods and water.

There ya go. Stay strong and just keep saving. It shouldn't be too hard if you're getting solid paychecks and don't have bills. Life will be boring but that can be good because you focus on survival. Once you have a few grand saved hit up Craigslist and rent out a room in someone's house or apartment. 

There will be tough times and even when you do make it, it might not be as comfortable as your room back home was, but not living with bossy parents as a grown ass man is the ultimate feeling of freedom. ",1462060810

I would describe it as a ""hardcore"" core party. In between hardcore and core. Some members are a bit low on lux, some other members are really pushing alot. I'm doingg 1,181,000 lux right now. I don't really care as long as you're reasonably active. 

Mostly 6 stars. Some of my 6 stars that I can share: master form sora, limit form sora, black coat riku, minnie, king mickey, hercules, kh riku, donald ver. b., &amp; KH cloud. Other example of other members are KHII cloud, stitch, mushu, KHII riku, a maxed out KH cloud (no guilt bonus yet). A good selection of strong shared medals. 

Raids show up daily. For raid chains, I'd say it happens often but probably not as often as more hardcore parties. Like I said, a ""hardcore"" core party. ",1462060812

I will just focus on one claim, because I need to sleep.

&gt;The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.

&gt;In terms of sanity, seriously, what is the difference in those two things?

There isn't. And I wouldn't actually care if the president did. It only shows that some voters are not only religious, but also stupid. But if some president would find a way to rally even the idiot, he would deserve my vote too.

I stand by my claim that the religious freaks are a minority. And they are insane. And they have some certain strings a politician need to pull. You see, these people, people who are terrorists by nature, they will find anything to fight for. Religion, atheism, dogmatism, capitalism, socialism, conservatism, you name it. And you need to rally them. Religion is a useful weapon sometimes employed by a politician. And we know why the politician is doing what he's doing. We nod our head, and fool the fools. I don't actually believe that the president is insane. I don't believe Obama wakes up to scripture on his blackberry. But he needs to rally the terrorists in Texas, so he says that shit.

I learned in life that some people are cynical, stupid, and insane. You need to pull their strings. If they pretend they want to hurt you, just pretend they're the boss, and in return, they will respect you.

"whatcarshouldIbuy","t5_2ys2t","If you're looking to go at it on your own, and you don't have a family to worry about, why not save some money and downsize to a nicely equipped X3 or X1? If you're looking to stay with BMW, both are good options in their segment, and would likely be a better way to go if you aren't using the size of the X5 accordingly.

However, I'd also advise shopping around a bit. Assuming that you'd want to continue leasing, and coming into a strong sales season for most brands, some may be willing to offer a competitive lease offer to get you behind the wheel of one of theirs... Think Mercedes GLC, Lexus NX, and the like. Much of that would come down to what you prefer most, and as you've stated, if interiors are the most important part to you, you're going to have to sit in as many as possible.

If it were my money, I'd look to both downsize and look for better options when it comes to performance and value. As much as I like many of the luxury offerings on deck these days, there are plenty of competitive mid and low level cars that are offering nearly equal levels of performance and craftsmanship to many of the luxury offerings.

The act of marrying, or the state of being married; legal union of a man and a woman for life, as husband and wife; wedlock; matrimony.  Common law is a legal union.

Wisconsin was the leading experiment in how much they could get away with, funded by the Bradley Foundation and the DeVos family (Amway) fortunes.  

In several states (Jindal's Louisiana), voucher programs were ruled to be unconstitutional, so ALEC came up with the subterfuge ""scholarship"" legislation, now passed in more than twenty states (see ALEC's State Policy Network with affiliates in every state).

I say this because there will be a significant number of cards that are either too basic or too low yield, particularly the ones he added from his classes, which are not in first aid. I too have just used anki throughout my first two years, but 800-1000 cards a day is a LOT.

I ended up going through FA and making my own cards on shit I considered high yield and didnt know. Usually ended up being anywhere from 100-250 cards per chapter. The returns from these cards were much more than bro's at THAT stage of my step1 studying.

EDIT: There's also a chunk of stuff that is in FA but not in Bro's deck. Also, seeing the tables/diagrams in FA is much more helpful for integrating information than the binary facts that are presented in the anki deck.

I know there's one in the area because one of our tree's got almost entirely destroyed. I suppose it could possibly be a squirrel though, since we've only caught the porcupine in action once. I planted about 100 crocus bulbs though and they all have been partially eaten in one way or another, so I have no idea if that rules out smaller critters or not. Plus the fact that the fence got torn out so it's probably something bigger (and it wouldn't be people, I live at the end of a back road) As for the others, there's no evidence of a groundhog on our property, I'm not sure I've ever seen a skunk or raccoon on our property, and we do not have possums in our area.

i hope your all! well and have a great snooze or day! 

ive come to feel like its my obligation to  comment on my autonomous actions. 

i call them autonomous because the action itself is so ingrained in my ethos that i do become subconscious when i do it. 
kinda like Ayrton Senna at monarco. ""i was no longer driving, it was like i was in a tunnel and i kept moving outside of my conscious range

with graffiti it causes me a sense ofsome people meditate do yoga and exercise but theynnever cut if for me. 

ive always struggled with depression and graffiti filled that void due to the fact that when i did it i felt invisible. my perceptive problems vanished into the wnd. i felt calm and in control. 

this leads to my conclusion. im a normal human like yourslef, i work, i pay my taxes (and not that finances count) im surprisingly financial stable. actually bought my first house last week! not bad for a 23 year old i mast ad. its amazing what the stock can do
im just like you, but i feel an illness inside of me that i need to express. also to show that society isnt totally in control. 

if your not happy with your 9-5, quit! follow your heart in life and lets face it, all humans hearts are looking for is happiness :)

preserve the natural jungle, destroy the cement one. 

hope this give some insight to a graffiti writer first hand.

ill finish this a beautiful elegant quote.. 

""its a sign of poor health to be well adjusted to a sick society""

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt; It is comparing the suicide attempts after surgery vs the general population, not before and after surgery. All it is saying is that surgery is not a magic fix, and there should still be psychiatric treatment after SRS:



&gt; As for the later, I have actually read this in the past, and it does not support the narrative you are trying to paint. In fact, the person who authored this disagrees with people who misattribute the study. Hell, if you doubt the legitimacy of TransAdvocate, she gives a nod to the article on fucking reddit!

Fair enough. So what about this then?

&gt;There is no conclusive evidence that sex change operations improve the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation, according to a medical review conducted exclusively for Guardian Weekend tomorrow.
The review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the University of Birmingham's aggressive research intelligence facility (Arif) found no robust scientific evidence that gender reassignment surgery is clinically effective.

That sounds pretty clear to me.

Edit: And more, here are some words from the psychiatrist in chief of John Hopkins' -

&gt; Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital and its current Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry, said that transgenderism is a “mental disorder” that merits treatment, that sex change is “biologically impossible,” and that people who promote sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.

&gt; http://cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/johns-hopkins-psychiatrist-transgender-mental-disorder-sex-change

Try getting through the whole thing, then checking out his article in the WSJ. There is no proof that transition surgery works, afterward patients still have insanely high suicide rates, and so on. I even saw a study that said 80% of post op patients were happy, but of the 732 odd patients who were contacted for interviews half of them were dead and all about Just over 200 wanted to comment.

We can actually measure the CO2 levels before the official recording. It is a very sofisticated technique that involve the analysis of the bubble of air trapped into ice caps and rocks that have been carbon - dated.

Anyway, the actual science is not the point.
On the website of Mr Trump, you can find this
&gt;Climate Change: It is a hoax. Trump does not believe climate change is real, tweeting out his skepticism with strong language and calling it a hoax on Fox News in 2014. In a 2012 Twitter post which is no longer accessible, Trump charged that the concept of climate change was created by the Chinese to suppress the U.S. economy. In addition, Trump has expressed firm opposition to wind turbines, which he sees as an environmental and aesthetic problem.

So we have two positions. Trump and the scientific comunity.
For me that would be a dealbreaker in a candidate. The conscious choise of refusing such an important scientific fact entirely, calling it AN HOAX.

So I would ask around as it's going to be operational very soon. I read an article from a month ago that said there in the final stages of review, so hopefully patients will get the needed help soon. (as far as dispensaries, let's hope there's a parallel effort to make it available! Otherwise, I wonder if they'd mail order from California, being Guam and all, military planes!)  
p.s. the reaction was probably because of change in another medication that has a known interaction between the two drugs or the source of the tramadol. I've switched from regular to generic and had some new side effects. I would also look at the extra buffer ingredients that go into the pill, sometimes there's a change in one and it causes an allergy. For example, sometime soy lecithin is added to so much and some individuals are sensitive to soy. It'd be worth getting an IgE allergy test as you may also have developed a new allergy.

In the Ashwoods, the heroes gathered up to plan their attack. Kalina and Ellion were sitting together on a rock, and right next to them the Ashguard. Siprum was sitting on the ground with his legs crossed, while Narum and Spera stood beside him. Behind them, Metus was cowering in the shadow of the ashen trees. In the middle of the circle stood Kellinar who, as the leader of the party, spoke first.


“We need to think of a plan of attack. The Necromancer we’re challenging is ver-”


He was cut off by Narum


“LET’S JUST GET IN THERE AND BASH THEIR SKULLS INSIDE OUT”


Siprum grabbed her by the shoulder firmly.


“Let him speak. This is important.”


Narum almost bashed *Siprum’s* skull, but then she calmed down and listened.


“As I was saying… The Necromancer we’re going to fight is incredibly powerful and, more importantly, is holding Mor’inon hostage. She is the goal of this operation. **Not the necromancer**. He comes second, and so do the wards preventing Godly intervention. She is our top priority. She must be saved at all costs.” 


“The Necromancer, Ilafin, can set in motion his ritual prematurely, raising a huge army of restless dead and *killing* Mor’inon in the process. This **MUST** be avoided. For this reason, Narum” - he gave her a disappointed look - “a full frontal attack should be avoided, as it might tip him off of our presence and scare him”


Kellinar paused to look at each member of the party.


“Now, we must think of an effective plan that will allow us to either dispatch the front guard or to sneak in”


Ellion stood up.


“If I may, I’d like to play something before we get onto that”


Kellinar stiffened, then smiled with relief.


“Sure, Ellion, thank you”


Ellion played a powerful ballad, of heroes who faced impossible enemies and emerged victorious. This inspired the party. After he was finished, Kalina put a hand on his shoulder.


“**That was wonderful, Ellion. Now though we really need to plan…**”

The Restless Dead were patrolling around the Citadel, While a good force of them were manning its walls.


Suddenly, from the woods, a melodic cry was heard. It sounded like multiple different songbirds were singing together a beautiful melody, but was at the same time somewhat out of tune, annoyingly so.


A Group of Restless Dead rushed to check the source of the noise, only  to find Ellion cheerfully screaming at the top of his lungs. Before they could attack, though, Half of them set off a trap and fell in a pit of Iron spikes, while the other half was peppered by arrows and throwing daggers coming from all directions.


Other patrols came, and they were met with similar fate, as Siprum, Spera , Metus and Kellinar  made quick work of them with their arrows and daggers. Siprum’s traps worked flawlessly too. Then, suddenly, a large battalion made of the last patrols came through the woods, quicker than any before, and rushed Ellion. The Archers did their best to protect him, but this time they were simply too many. Ellion was struck, and with a loud moan the music stopped. The undead who hit him could almost show glimpses of pleasure, but, with a terrifying roar that came from behind the unconscious bard, he was instantly struck by a massive beam of light, alongside the rest of the battalion. Nothing remained but cinders.


Kalina appeared beside him.


“**I told you not to act as bait dammit!**”


“**SPERA! HERE! NOW!**” - then she disappeared again.


As the Allfather’s daughter rushed to heal Ellion, her sister and Kellinar looked up at the Citadel. The Undead within were now on guard, though they were still unaware of what had happened or what the origin of the song was.


Then, suddenly, all the watchtowers on each corner of the citadel started getting ravaged by the Impure Smallptehas that haunted the dreams of all Undalean farmers. The nightmares made quick work of the watchmen, but were eventually dispatched by the reinforcements. That came from the walls.


This was their chance. A huge terrifying snake appeared in the center of the Citadel, with Metus riding on top of it, and around it the whole party was assembled. Kalina was panting for the effort but was still holding strong.


The remaining Restless Undead rushed to the inner courtyard to kill the intruders and protect the entrance of the Undercroft, and they were met by Narum **smiting** away, Kellinar crushing them with his warhammer and Shuedoth who sliced them up with his wings, followed by Yolunda blasting at the survivors. Metus drove his mount into the fray, eating its way to the last of their ranks. Meanwhile, Siprum was firing away from up above, Yaldia was dashing around with beams of light and Kalina was protecting Spera and Ellion, who was conscious again, yet still rather battered.


The Restless dead crumbled under the divine powers of the Demigods and the party gathered again to reorganise.


___


“**ELLION!**” - Kalina rushed to him while he was recovering his strength - “**ARE YOU ALRIGHT?**”


“Yes, Darling, nothing to worry about. Spera is an excellent healer.”

___

Meanwhile, Metus was recovering his summons


“I’m gonna send you back to the Beyond for now, Fidelis” - smiled Metus while stroking the snake’s scales -”I’ll see you there, I guess”


“STOP NAMING NIGHTMARES!” - shouted Narum.


“Only when you stop ‘redesigning’ your battle standards”


“Grrr”

"Helldivers","t5_2ya0t","Does this mean I'm finally getting the hang of the game if I can (typically) do this sort of thing? :P 

Alternative, ""I'm gonna stand here and make this my patch of dirt, and you dirty Bugs|Borgs|Squid are gonna take it off my cold dead hands!"" loadout. Due to the unknown time you'll need to be there, this avoids limited supply strats.

* Weapon - Paragon, Justice, Breaker or Supressor. 
* Perk - Strat priority. Because you want a lot of firepower in short repeatable bursts.
* Strat 1 - Ammo
* Strat 2 - Strafing run
* Strat 3 - Railcannon or heavy airstrike
* Strat 4 - Static field or Napalm

Tactic: Find a defendable area, with at least one wall to protect you. Set up napalm and static field to cover directions (making sure to kill whatever's on the far side of the napalm on a regular basis!) and simply hold your ground.

Bringing a second person? Have them pack...

* Weapon - The opposite of you - if you have a shotgun, they bring an AR and vice versa.
* Perk - Strat priority again
* Strat 1 - Recoilless Rifle (but you take the pack)
* Strat 2 - Resupply pack (they take all the ammo, you resupply from them)
* Strat 3 - Napalm or static field.
* Strat 4 - Laser strike or Railcannon

Two people make it more interesting as you need to move as a cohesive group. P1 needs to pay attention to P2's requirements for the RR and pack, reloading or calling down ammo as need be. Two sets of area denial means you can overlap and/or extend your area denial.

What's that? Another Helldiver has entered the area? FOR LIBERTEA! They should be armed with...

* Weapon - If their aim is true, railgun. If not, another AR or Shotgun (even the trident is OK by this point).
* Perk - Strat priority. Seriously OP.
* Strat 1 - Angel
* Strat 2 - Obliterator, or one of the  mortar weapons. Rain death upon trapped foes.
* Strat 3 - Railcannon or heavy airstrike
* Strat 4 - Your choice, but ammo if using ammo weapons is good.

The third person starts to reach diminishing returns. A general purpose role here with some light healing and general utility starts to make sense as a support player.",1462060836

This type of comment always depresses me as much as the original article does.

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","Under all modern operating systems, when a process terminates all of its resources are relinquished.  There's no way for a process to consume memory after it has terminated, so memory leaks are about dealing with resources while your program runs, not after it finishes.

For simple trivial programs, it might not really matter.  There's a school of thought that says you shouldn't worry about explicitly freeing memory if you're writing a short-lived program that's about to exit anyway.

But there are counterpoints to that philosophy.  For one thing, many programs don't have that luxury.  In particular, libraries can't assume they will be used in a short-lived program, so they must always take care to do accurate memory accounting.  And it's not uncommon to start out writing a program and then turn around and later decide that it's so useful it needs to be turned into a library so that the functionality can be reused in other contexts.  But if you never bothered to manage memory, under the assumption that you were writing a short-lived program and not a library, then you have a ton of work on your hands; you may have to completely rethink the entire foundation of your code.

Certain classes of programs are not short-lived, like servers.  When writing code that's going to run for a long time, it's absolutely essential to not leak memory, because even small leaks will add up to significant amounts of wasted memory as your program runs for weeks or months.

And then there's the issue with tools like valgrind which can be used to diagnose all kinds of errors, including leaks.  Again, if you write code that intentionally leaks, that's a defensible standpoint under certain circumstances, but it also means you make it a lot harder to use these tools, because they will light up with thousands of alerts to memory leaks, drowning out the actual problems that you were trying to find.

Especially as a beginner you need to learn the proper discipline of how to manage memory.  You can always choose to intentionally leak if you've made a careful analysis, but you can't do the reverse — if you've developed shit habits of never properly dealing with memory then you won't be able to write libraries or servers or all kinds of other programs.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Well, they are in essence a child. I think those decisions and the naivete fit his/her upbringing very well. Though, I agree, their reaction to Ryoma doesn't make much sense (especially considering Corrin was just told to kill Hinoka, and they were talking about bringing back her head). But... that kind of got drowned out when Ryoma commits Seppuku. My jaw dropped. It was amazing and tragic all at the same time, one of my favorite moments in the entire game.

I think Corrin's regrets about what happened accentuate this enough that it's not so big a deal, especially because it's been established pretty effectively that Corrin is not the smartest person in the world and he's naive as hell (both are character qualities integral to Corrin). He/she expected a bloody spear to sell the story, after all. So I think when it all comes down to it Conquest Corrin is childish, which as I said earlier makes sense considering his upbringing. I think when you look at it like that it makes watching what happens really difficult and really makes you empathize with Corrin, especially because you can tell he/she is in a lot of pain (that scene with Azura directly after Ryoma's death sold this element perfectly). 

It leads into Takumi handing Corrin his bow very effectively, as Corrin has to come to terms with the things they've done and forgive him/herself. 

I do think a lot of these things could've been done better. In particular, instead of Corrin being surprised about Ryoma, it would've been better if he/she was just unable to bring themselves to do it. Instead of sparing Hinoka and her retainers, it would've been more effective if Corrin was forced to make the decision to kill one of the retainers and then say Hinoka ran away (and if Corrin can really not bring themselves to do that, then Leo could do it). And they really missed an opportunity to explore the conflict of Corrin being unable to save/spare everyone they fight despite all of his/her want for that to happen.

Still, the ideas at play are are extremely compelling, and I'm overall satisfied with what they delivered (that Takumi bow thing, just damn that moment was so fucking cool). I think Conquest Corrin is one of the most interesting and complex characters in the entire game, very different from his/her Revelation/Birthright incarnations (which almost feel like entirely different characters, mostly because they are much more generic). 

I think the reason you didn't enjoy all of this as much as I did is because you played the game as if Corrin was you. I made my Conquest Corrin female, so it really helped me to disconnect from her and observe her that way. Just bringing up that it might have been a potential problem hindering your enjoyment of probably the most individually character driven story Fire Emblem has ever done.",1462060841

Except, Western news was reporting that the town had been entirely evacuated a year prior, when Al-Nusra was taking it over. So the 45,000 people it was ""feeding"", could only have been terrorists, as per our own media.

The West's involvement in Syria is too caught up with the notion that the only bad people there are ISIS, why?

Because if they admitted that the majority of non-ISIS fighters (aka Al-Nusra and the Islamic Front), were there wishing to establish an Islamic State, run through a dictatorship, identical to Saudi Arabia. Most Americans would flip shit and there would massive backlash.

But the goals of the majority of fighters in Syria, just like the fact that in Syria, there was peace for non-Muslims, and they didn't need to live in fear like they do in nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Are unknown to the CNN/Fox news watching Americans.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","If your focus is on objective play and you're comfortable with the role of marksmen then I would recommend Quinn mid.

She's seen success in the midlane in the west but sees a lot more play in Korea. I think this 'may' be attributable to Aurelion Sol being far more popular there and Quinn is a great pick into him because her vault cancels his passive and W.

She has high impact on other lanes as well from the mid-lane because of her insane roaming potential post-6.

While she is ranged and a marksman, she doesn't necessarily play like your standard ADC. If I could compare her to anything I'd say she's most like an AD version of LeBlanc with even better roaming potential + objective pressure because you can be on the map pressuring top right after you were done cleaning up bot-lane.

She builds like an AD assassin as well with Youmuu's, Maw, Sterak's, etc.

I've recently had success building Duskblade on her as a 2nd/3rd item and going a more Armor Pen focused build which is the direction players have been taking her in Korea.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","They may have, but they could have gotten it back. It varies where you are, but if someone has epilepsy/seizure disorder they are required to be seizure-free for six months. After six months, with medical documentation, the individual can get their license reinstated. 

Unfortunately, medications can ""poop out"" and suddenly stop working. Presently there's no way to predict when or if this may occur. 

Sometimes people who have seizures also have auras which are essentially warning signs of an impending seizures. A weird smell, a sensation in your stomach, spots in your vision, etc. These auras can allow a person to get to a safe location. Not everyone has auras, so there's no time to 'prepare'. 

If someone is really unlucky, they may not notice their medication has stopped working. There are ""milder"" forms of seizures, which are not as obvious but can still cause impairment. Sometimes a person unknowingly has nocturnal seizures and it's only discovered when one occurs during the day. 

This is an example of an epileptic's worst nightmare. Not only did this accident occur, but look at the location. Over the water. If the car would have driven into the water there would have been little chance for survival. ",1462060849

All it takes is some play with the minion hoard to take the tower and win the game. So holding onto the card for the best opportunity is the way to go. It's best to also know what other counters the enemy might have to the minion hoard. Maybe the enemy is running arrows and fireball. Maybe he has a wizard and arrows. You need to know all of his cards, and then begin understanding where it falls into the line up, and wait for his one mistake to take over with the minion hoard. 

The nice thing is that folks tend to panic when they see a golem heading their way, so they tend to drop all their troops on top of him. So even if my opponent has seen my minions and minion hoard, he may still drop his wizard to damage my golem. In which case I drop my minions, and place them in a way to target the wizard first. (This is where the poison spell is handy. It limits the spaces where the enemy will drop troops, and many of the times, they will drop troops in places where it is easy for your own troops to specifically target). Moving on, once he sees the minions in play, he'll throw the arrows, and then my minion hoard come in and it's over. ",1462060856

1. Rashad Jennings
2. Paul Perkins
3. Shane Vereen
4. Orleans Darkwa (he'll be on the bubble)

6. ~~Bobby Rainey~~

I think there's a chance that we go into the regular season with 3 RBs on the roster as well. Meaning one of Darkwa or Jennings would be cut.

It is not vindictive, it is not childish. And yes the company has the right to shut him down when he is blatantly sharing his toxic behavior.

Why would RIOT react now to criticism when more popular pro-players have been doing it? Riot has no reason to ban him just because of his criticism? Who do you think he is for Riot to take notice on his criticism against them ?

The issue is that he is proactively promoting toxic behavior and he is proud of his banned accounts. Don't tell me that this isn't part of the issue cause it is. All his permabanned accounts shows he is not capable of reform and especially when he was promoting toxic behavior should be shut down.

For illegals in our country, detain them. if they have a expired visa, give them an opportunity to renew it or start on a path to citizenship. if they never had a visa, deport. come back with a visa or willing to become a citizen!

 meanwhile no welfare benefits for non citizens. no free healthcare, no social security, no medicare/medicaid, no drivers license, no bank account, no investments, no taking your kids to school, no food stamps. you get NOTHING if you are here illegally. get a visa, or apply and work to be a citizen or leave. 

if you have a visa, and it expires, you will get a knock on your door in a week, and officials will say ""renew, get your citizenship or leave"" you get 30 days. 

your parents must be citizens for you to be a citizen of the united states. no anchor babies.

&gt;* Former California Governor Pete Wilson gave Cruz his endorsement as he introduced the US senator from Texas.

&gt;* Cruz received more applause at the convention than either Trump or the third-place candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich, who also spoke on Friday.

&gt;* If were fractured and were divided, Hillary Clinton wins and the campaign is lost, he said, referring to the Democratic Partys front-runner in the Nov. 8 election for the White House.

&gt;* Cruz has downplayed the severity of the losses and in his speech Saturday looked forward to upcoming contests, which he has said will put him on the path to thwarting Trump.

&gt;* On Friday, he was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside.

From what I've experienced, it basically tells the game ""reject any world with *any* areas less savage than [minimum] or more savage than [maximum]"".  I would not modify either of these values beyond 30/70 respectively.  

Now, setting savagery XY variance higher might help.  Basically, it means ""how severely the savagery level can vary per unit in X direction or Y direction"".  So a very high XY variance would allow giant elephants to spawn adjacent to bunnies.  A very low variance would mean that bunnies spawn next to dingos, then monkeys, then tigers, then rhinos, then elephants.  I am reasonably sure this is more or less how it works.  

What you want to edit are further down the advanced parameters, values like 'minimum high savagery areas' I think.  Set this higher, while setting the 'minimum low savagery areas' to 0.  I'm pretty sure these high savagery areas are placed, then smoothed out according to the 'savagery x/y variance' value.  At least, this is how I got it to work with mountains/elevation.  

Want more nasties?  Increase megabeasts and megabeast caves.  More sites gives more places for vampires to hide, and shorter histories or fewer civs means fewer of these guys get killed for one reason or another.

"UBC","t5_2qy2j","Ivey school of business uses the case method for some of their courses which is similar to Harvard and allows for more discussion based learning. UBC is adapting some of this but the main courses are still lecture based although it is changing. 

For the school, the quality depends not just on the classroom but the quality of the alumni. In Vancouver, there isn't a lot of head offices so the very ambitious students tend to move away to places with opportunities such as Toronto, New York, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, etc. This limits the participation of some of the top alumni. Also if you want to get a job in finance which is centered around major cities like Toronto, New York, London, it is better to be from that city because you get better network opportunities or introductions from professors to these companies as some of the hiring managers are former students of the professor. 

UBC Sauder should have employment reports but like other schools, a lot of this is self reported and not verified against tax returns. This means people could exaggerate or more likely, a greater portion of successful job applicants reply while those looking for a job might not. The quality of jobs are not mentioned meaning that students could be working at Starbucks as a barista to pay the bills. There is the other end of the spectrum where you have second generation wealth and these students don't work and just shop or invest. I tend to find the students who are successful to be self motivated and are self starters meaning that they will succeed at UBC or at an Ivy league or even a small town college. Some of the students that doesn't do well just do the bare minimum and likely stuffed their resume/personal profile when applying to UBC.

What I do find lacking are good job opportunities that the university provides relative to the student population. For example, in UBC engineering more than 5 years ago, co-op placement was 100%. During the past few years, it fell to 67% and kept going lower as the co-op opportunities did not grow with the student enrollment growth. ",1462060868

I called the number on it only to find out that they had no record of it. I'm assuming in my case the guy who printed it out didn't fill it out correctly or decided to cancel it for some reason or screwed up some other way and I thought no more about it.

I was going to say that maybe the cop who wrote your ticket just didn't get around to filing whatever they need to file to make it legit on their end, but that doesn't explain why it was the wrong colour...

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","Enjoy the fresh start :) I def did. Graduated uni last spring and the fresh start was a big step forward for me and helped me feel more confident making friends etc. I did register with the disability center and I used it at least once to get me an excuse for a missed deadline. 

About living on your own, the good thing is you won't have your old habits in your new place. Like, the light comes in from a different window in the morning now so you don't sleep in as much, or you don't have as much space so you don't feel as lonely, or whatever. Try and be who you want to be :) no one will know you, or anything about your problems, and you can be unafraid to do what you like and to spend time alone or make new friends. 

Just remember to take care of yourself. Hygiene was an issue for me when I first lived alone, and it never was before then. Food as well, I skipped meals way more often when I lived alone. 

About self harm, I also struggled with it and to this day still get the urge. Now I pinch myself or snap a rubber band or hair tie, maybe once a month, max, on average. I just wanted to reach out and say that I really hope you are okay and I really hope that you can find a way to stop. It's an addiction and it's very difficult. I stopped when I met someone so horrified by it who wasn't always there to stop me that I didn't want to hurt them anymore. And I haven't done it since. Honestly getting rid of your knife or blade etc. really does help (or did in my case). And, everyone says it, but I do really hate my scars. They get pink in hot weather and it makes me super anxious (since most people don't know why they're there). I hope you can recover from it soon and I know how hard it is. 

You will become more stable. Some of your moods are likely normal teenage moods too and once those go and it's only the bipolar moods I hope you're able to cope better. Remember to take your meds, set an alarm or get a weekly pill box if you need to. You will form romantic relationships and friendships similar to a non BP person but it's true that BP will always be a part of you and that may or may not affect your relationship (it's affected my marriage but I'm currently not stable med-wise). I think you'll be okay :) you sound self aware and grounded in your post and if you can hang onto that you'll have more going for you than plenty of college freshmen lol! I'm joking, but really, you're gonna be okay and you can do it! Good luck!!!",1462060869

The advantage of winning toplane is that it is so far away from relevant things early game. If you can consistently draw 3 people top lane then it means your mid has free CS and your bot doesn't have to worry about ganks.

I think this MMO has the best PvE/PvP system because they're connected.

Arena is stat balanced, which is good, it makes the gear itself irrelevant but you can still progress your character in PvP through HM levels and HM skills, however neither of those things are such a big impact that player skill cannot overcome them. Hacking is a different story and I'm not going to touch on it in this.

While doing PvE, you gain HM levels and HM skills which help in PvP. In arena, you gain those too, as well as Zen beans toward soulstones. This helps both PvE and PvP players.

The PvE people that just do arena for the daily Zen Beans are never going to cause issues for actual hardcore PvP players anyways, as they will never reach the high plat/diamond level unless they are also extremely good at PvP anyway.


While yes, botters and hackers are an issue, it is not linked to anything about HM skills and levels. Both botters and hackers can and should be removed without taking away the progression.",1462060874

"GoogleCardboard","t5_32byj","AMOLED has low persistence so it gets rid of motion blur. Also, Note 4 can be used with the GearVR Innovator Edition. A lot of people like the content that is exclusive for GearVR.

I personally dislike the GearVR. The phones are not yet fast enough to process a large FOV for the Asynchronous TimeWarp to work properly for fast head movements. I am a minority in this thinking and I get downvoted quickly when I suggest that the LG G4/Xperia Z5 Premium are better for VR.

Lastly, I am a developer - not a consumer - so I don't look at existing content nor do I use any. I like how Google Cardboard is a plugin for Unity and anything that would work in Unity ""just works"" which is not the same for GearVR (mostly due to loss of USB data).

In summary:

IPS has more subpixels - less SDE

AMOLED has low persistence - no Motion Blur

There are some other aspects that create more immersion for VR such as tracking latency/accuracy.",1462060874

You really think that would be no big deal...making New Yorkers walk past a statue to Bin Ladden everyday. 

Building statues to the Enemies of everything your country stands for is utterly insane.

Homelessness could be helped by giving away all of these memorials' land (that are largely owned by the state anyway) to affordable housing there instead.

Disease,Poverty, lack of social programs, could be helped by taking statues down from public lands and selling them for profit.

I am talking about the future. Why should government land and money be spent on up-keeping and protecting these symbols of a horrible cause? Why should a single penny be spent on them or a single inch devoted to glorifying them that could be used for all of the things you listed?

It is not a petty and insignificant thing when the government pays to upkeep these things and the opportunity cost of such prime real estate being used only for the glorifying of horrible causes.

That pushed me deep into depression which led me to drug abuse. 

The drug abuse numbed any withdrawal feelings I was going through but ultimately put me into a very bad place. I realized I was at rock bottom and had to choose between the eventual death I was headed for, or start getting clean and become ""normal"" again.

I've since been clean for over a year and now only smoke pot (which I've always done anyways). It wasn't an easy thing to achieve, and I still have that urge in the back of my mind..

I answered to tell her, once again, ""wrong number"", but when I picked up it was a man's voice who I assumed was Patrick. When I said ""hello?"" he asked ME ""who is this?!"" I said ""umm...you called me"", he said ""hmmm well I don't remember calling you Eb-"" (he started to say my name, which reveals the fact that he lied about not knowing he called me and also HOW DOES HE KNOW MY NAME?!) he stammers and then says ""uhh nevermind, but anyway, how old are you?"" I tell him I'm 11 and he says ""hmm well you've got a sexy voice Ebony, how about I call you back later and we talk more?"" I hang up the phone and block the number

2. Not a ""call"" but after I joined field hockey team I got all of my teammates' numbers and saved them on my phone, I was really good friends with one girl named Elie so I text her over the break from practice...or at least I thought I was. Eventually she asks me if we can hang out and I say sure! She says ""ok, cool, meet me at my house in D.C."" which weirds me out because I know that Elie lives in Virginia, after I grill ""her"" with a few questions I discover that I hadn't been texting Elie at all, I'd put in the wrong number and had instead been texting a grown man who'd been grooming me for about 3 weeks. :'(",1462060886

See, if you buy hats or something that are just decorative, sure. That's fine. Drain your wallet, I don't care.

But if what's being sold is characters or courses which you would play on online, then I'd say you're being ripped off because you aren't getting the full experience that the game has to offer. Especially when DLC and non-DLC players mix, and it becomes a Pay2Win situation.

Even then, if it's jarring to the story, I think it's a ripoff. I'm worried about how Yooka Laylee is going to do their DLC. If the content's omission leaves a gap in the base game, I'd say the people getting the main course have been ripped off by the chef. He left something out of it that should've been there, and he only serves it to people who buy the desert. No, not for me. Now, maybe the desert doesn't even fit the meal. I'm not a connoisseur, so I don't have a good example for the analogy, but for Yooka Laylee, I'm worried that the DLC will just be tacked on and have no relation to the existing content. It's kind of a lose-lose situation I hold against the developer admittedly - I don't want content that even appears like it should be there in the first place, and I don't want content that appears like it shouldn't be there at all.

Beyond *that*, I have the gripe of the industry model of maximizing profits instead of creating a loyal fanbase and bringing general happiness to people. DLC content often comes with a high markup, and as developers see how much more money they can really make by releasing more DLC than base games, that's where their model turns too - more desert for everyone willing to pay, less main courses.",1462060889

Given that we've only had 4 die of natural causes to the UK's 6, I wouldn't blame age as the main cause. Assassinations seem to be the bigger problem.

"steroids","t5_2rifm","Hey guys,

I'm 25 years old, 5'9"", around 140 lbs right now. A few years ago I did a 4 week cycle of Epistane and was amazed by the results, even for such a short trial. I used nolva for PCT and had got my testosterone blood levels checked at a lab - I had something like ~970 ng/ d/l or whatever it is. I wanted to put that on my refrigerator lol.

Anyways, I'm interested in joining the big leagues now. The only potential issue is that I'm on 100mg of methadone a day and I don't want to overload my liver, so orals are out of the question. I'm completely fine with pinning, but it would be nicer in my opinion to only do it once a week instead of every day.

That said, I've narrowed down the ingredients of my next cycle to a few choices. I know that in any scenario, I want to run test (probably at 500mg/week, unless that's not recommended. but starting with 250mg for the first week to ""ease into it"" unless that's also not recommended). 

So starting with test as a foundation, probably test prop so I can stop quickly if I need to and also because the main thing I'm planning on running it with is tren a, which would be good because they're both short esters?

The only thing about that is I've heard it can be pretty harsh and I don't know if I want to do that for my first cycle... Any recommendations? Should I just keep it simple and do a test-only cycle, maybe 8-10 weeks, for my first real cycle? Or are there any other good primarily bulking AAS (forgot to add, I have very low body fat, don't know the percent) to add to the stack that would be a good fit and better for a relative juice noob?",1462060894
"anime","t5_2qh22","Rant incoming.

I'm actually fuckin pissed that they lost, not because I've any allegiance to Saya and Kirin but because it was so predictable. Now I know this is generic anime number whatever, and I came here for that but imagine the story lines if Kirin and Saya had won and had to face Ayato?! I actually said to myself at the start of the episode ""any bets now that Saya and Kirin will push the robots to the edge only for some asspull to defeat them, afterwhich everyone will say it doesn't matter cause Saya and Kirin should/can be proud of themselves"". And I was right

It would be so much more interesting to watch Kirin and Saya face Ayato then what is inevitably going to be Ayato getting his final release against the combined mecha in the final to win. Fuck that shit, I'm so salty right now...",1462060894

He can't pay cash (only 80k taxable account) for the house so he needs a 400k loan. Without the new house and his current expenses he's looking at needing around 1.5 million more or with his current saving around 12 to 15 years. 

Bigger house is more expenses. I'm factoring in another 250k needed to cover them, which may be conservative.  So now he's looking at needing 2.5 million total plus 800k house equity before he's FI.  So from 1.1 million he needs another 2 million which is probably 17 to 20 years based on current savings which will be cut slightly.

I think he said he was 38 so his FI date was going to be around 50 to 53 but with the new home it's now around 58, close to 60 or the typical retirement age at which we can access 401k.",1462060895

My theory is that there are no aliens period. It's all human enemies. But the SDF is just some radical sect with time travel powers. Erase you from the history books could be metaphorical but I'm saying its literal because of the fact that they show the clip of nuketown being taken out. ""Nuketown is offline"" is like a status message. I think they're going to go after popular maps or places from past games and go all meta with it. 

Which would also be sort of a good reason to back modern warfare remastered. Something like. Experience modern warfare before the SDF changed history? They'll probably use that line that that general says in MW2, ""history is written by the victors"" or change it to ""history is RE-written by the victors""

General troubleshooting is to rename the save file in your server directory that you're using. Take note of all mods on the server. Restart the server on a new world. If it has the same problem, since no mod assets are in the world, remove one mod at a time until the problem stops occurring. The last one you removed is the culprit. 

Make sure the most recently updated version of the mod is on the server, and reload the server. If you still have issues, get rid of that mod. Once done testing, rename the save file to the default save name. Bear in mind that removing a mod from a server while any assets from a mod are still loaded in the world can corrupt your save file.

**Emmanuel Ogbah** is a legitimate mid-first round talent. Another guy who was a huge performer at the college level. He is going to be an issue for the tackles he lines up over. Hopefully he can fill out a little and become a factor in the run game as well.

**Carl Nassib** is a beast. I'm hoping he can also fill out and become a legit 3-4 DE. Like Ogbah, he is a proven pass rusher, but if he wants to play this role, he needs to become tough to move. Like Joe Schobert, I love the idea of a walk-on who worked his ass off to get where he got. That is a recurring theme in this draft class and it makes sense - I don't want other Phil Taylor.

**Shon Coleman** is my favorite pick not only because of his amazing story, but the value we got from a mid-3rd round pick. He will more than likely step in and start at RT (compete with Drango). I love how these two young tackles will learn from one of the best tackles of all time for a while until JT retires.

I found a great spot, which also offers great comfort, but tried moving the foam due to how people reacted to that thread. Lost comfort, and everything got blurry.

What works for me is the wide foam in its default position. The strap is tight as I can get it, and it supporting the HMD near the top part of the back of my head. Set to my IPD, of course and then I just shoogle it around a little bit until I find the best spot in terms of blur.

Basically, just try moving it around, find what workjs for YOU. Whether it's the foam, lens placement, HMD placement, strap placement, etc, etc.

I had my Vive for a few days, messing around with it every ten minutes or so during gaming, never truly happy, and eventually I found what worked for me.

You'll never completely wipe out blurred edges, and the same goes for glare. But finding what works for you, and only you, helps things along.

Now to answer your question after I addressed your stupidity in no uncertain terms, unless you are bear grylls, or extremely well educated on survival you will die, even then. you will die. america back then was extremely sparsely populated, let alone a MASSIVE country. 

If Europe then you would die probably within 24 hours unless you're extremely well educated on survival, history, &amp; old school linguistics from then because you'll be branded as a heretic and slaughtered or just a peasant and for standing up slaughtered, all that negates diseases such as idk smallpox, the plague, cholera, you name it.

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","A few years ago, I monitored a bluebird nest box trail at my local nature center. I was filling in for a lady who would be gone for the summer. Before she left, she took me on the trail a few times to show me where all the boxes were and how to check them. The round trip was probably a couple of miles. And it wasn't a nice hiking trail, it was a lot of bushwacking through tall tick infested prairie grass, poison ivy, thorny stuff etc. I could barely keep up with her.  I'm guessing she was in her mid 70s. Had previously done a lot of triathlons and I don't know what else. She also volunteered on cross country ski patrol in the winter.

"IronThronePowers","t5_361bq","Aerion remained with his back leaning against the wall, though he shifted his head to look at Aelora partway through her question. ""Why do you ask? Do I make you nervous?"" he inquired with a slightly raised eyebrow and a teasing tone. After a moment, he held up a hand and waved it through the air between them, dismissing the question as rhetorical if she didn't want to address it.

He glanced down at the stone below them, eyes trailing the cracks where small blades of grass could be seen poking through. Her questions brought up old memories that he hadn't spent time considering in a long while, ones that used to give him pangs of regret or disappointment in himself of the person he once was. But that didn't seem to be occurring now; instead, it felt easy to discuss these things with Aelora. He was finding that it was welcome, in fact, to have someone with whom to share a more vulnerable side of himself.

Aerion lifted his head again to look over at Aelora, his face bearing a bemused expression. ""You might be surprised at how awkward I was when I was younger,"" he answered with a grin. ""I wasn't as bad as my cousin Bryen, the poor kid. He's been sheltered too much. I don't know where I get it from, but I've always felt a natural confidence in most things. Talking to ladies was one area that I had to work at; I used to get my tongue twisted in knots fairly often. I didn't feel an actual ease in that regard until I was around your age.""

He turned his back away from the retaining wall to lean against it sideways. Facing Aelora, he placed a hand on the stone wall near but not touching her. ""Our early conversations on this road to where we are now, during the trip to Summerhall and at the ball, and the one where I first came calling to formally start courting you, were much less awkward than my first conversation with Lanna, for example.""",1462060915

Define the type of water system this bandit group patrols.  Is it a cold water open ocean, like the vikings crossed in their longboats?  Is it a warmer sea dotted with islands, ocellating between calm conditions and awful storms, as seen in the ancient mediterranean?  This would help to imagine the sort of ships that would be used by the bandits.  

If there is no predictable wind pattern, the bandits might need to rely on dozens of rowers (either slaves or professional seamen) to keep the craft moving.  The boats in such a system may be designed for ship-to-ship combat, with massive rams cast in bronze to cripple ships before boarding.  
 
If the waters are stormy, vast, and unpredictable, perhaps something like a viking longship is more appropriate.  Its light, shallow drafted, crewed by only a few dozen.  It's mainly for troop transport purposes, rather than ship to ship combat.  Get in, smash and grab, and get out.  Light enough to take upriver and portage across small stretches of land.  

Who claims the waters?  Who would dare to challenge them by picking off the merchants in their waterways?  Are these men foreign to the government that claims the waters?  Are they fishermen who have been driven to piracy by environmental destruction by a foreign power?

After these details are hammered out, you can plug in any race, weapon system, leadership structure you want and it will feel more substantive.

You wouldn't expect either of these things to be as true. You would think tradesman as a component of labor should associate with Democrats and socially conservative religious immigrants would identify with Republicans. This just shows how critical issues like immigration are. Just look at Trump supporters (key issue- immigration). They are native born, poor, low education, and often in areas hit hard by illegal immigration. People that have to compete with undocumented workers.

*talking about about plumbers, welders, and mechanics here. Not winemakers and cartographers. Though overall tradesman are far more split than I expected. Possibly due to the Democrat's significant ties with labor rights.

 **The indefinite banning of Tyler1**

&gt;Hey all,   
&gt;  
&gt;Instant Feedback catches the most unsportsmanlike players in League, but some people go out of their way to continue ruining games for the community. Because of a well-documented history of account bans for verbal abuse, intentional feeding, as well as account sharing/purchasing, evasion of sportsmanship systems, and player harassment, we will not allow Tyler1 to hold a League of Legends account, indefinitely. Any account definitively used by him will be banned immediately upon identification.   
&gt;  
&gt;We know we’re not perfect, and this dragged on too long, but we want you to know when the rare player comes along who’s a genuine jerk, we’ve still got your back.

In college I was hanging out in our detached garage with my former SO and a close friend. The garage in question has a pair of windows on the east side that look out into a trash ally. As We were having a few drinks to wind down after a show there's a sudden loud shattering noise. We are all startled and confused until we notice one of the alley windows is completely broken. Now it would't have been strange or unlikely for some hoodlum to have thrown something at the window. However, we were a bit perturbed by upon investigation to find the glass had been blown throughout the alley meaning the force would  had to of come from within. It was only the three of us in that garage at the time. We were sitting in a circle with eyes on each other when this occurred and we couldn't locate any sort of projectile. 
That was an old house and we had several other odd experiences, but that would probably be the most obvious and hard to dispute. ",1462060920

"amateurradio","t5_2qi86","My Wife and I go to the middle of nowhere, often and alone. We event a Jeep and our trailer. Both are outfitted with comms. 

My setup is all ham based with a one way PLB thrown in for good measure.

Here is what we bring: http://www.wranglerforum.com/jeep-profiles/37409/

Everyone says ""use a sat phone"", but really they don't work very well when offroad. Sat phones require horizon to horizon visibility or they drop calls. In a canyon you can expect the call to drop before the call can be completed. Additionally the equipment is very fragile. The charger really does not like the voltage changes that come from being solar powered either. I'm not a fan. 

There are two use cases to consider: 
Local comms and emergency comms

Local mostly depends on who you are talking to, but rule out CB if anyone is hiking. A rubber duck antenna is too short for the 11meter cb band. Cb is useful on a vehicle if you plan to meet random people along the way, as cb is the most popular band when offroad still, for some reason that I don't understand. 

You'd be much better served using the 70cm band that plays nicer with shorter antennas. FRS is really close to the 70cm band in frequencies, but it's too low power. It can work in a pinch though. GMRS is OK in that there is no test to get a liscense and vehicle to vehicle radios are relatively easy to find. The problem is that finding a handheld that puts out legal limit power on GMRS is really hard to do. Most of them (*caugh Motorola *caugh) put out like 200mW. 

If folks are hiking ""really far out there"" you can get maybe 20 miles of real range from a 2m ham band handheld connected to a roll up jpole that someone got up at the top of a tree. 

The best for local comms is if everyone gets a ham liscense and uses 2m/70cm handhelds. Most good mobile radios also have a cross band repeater built in. This lets you use a truck to extend the handheld range. 

Emergency comms is another story. If you break down in the plains then a sat phone is awesome. If you break down in a rocky canyon, the sat phone won't even connect. A beacon is useful, but only if someone is looking for it. Check with your local responders, but the folks in the national forests of California have told me that they don't look for beacons unless someone is reported missing who is believed to have a beacon. They get too many false positives otherwise. 

A SPOT has the same problem as the sat phone, except it does not need to be connected for very long to get out a message. A SPOT still won't work in a tight canyon, but will probably work with 25% horizon visibility. 

Sometimes you'll get lucky and be able to hit a VHF repeater to call for help. You'll need to know about the repeaters beforehand for this to work. I bring the repeaterbook app along. It has a local DB that works when the phone is offline to look up nearby repeaters. 

Most of the time though, there won't be any infrastructure nearby. For that, I chose a one way beacon, and a HF ham radio with a deployable (stationary) inverted V NVIS wire antenna. The best mobile antenna is between 1% and 10% as good as a base antenna, so I bring a base antenna in a bag. It's a wire dipole and a 18' buddipole pole on a tripod. 

This setup still works in a canyon as the signal goes straight up and comes straight back down, although sometimes the person on the other end can hear you but can't respond. The range is a doughnut starting at about 50 miles away to about 250 miles away. It does not matter who I reach, as long as they believe me that there is an emergency. I carry multiple GPS recievers so that I know where I'm located. I also look up the emergency number for where I'm going ahead of time so that when I reach someone I can tell them who to call.",1462060922

"ModelUSGov","t5_33mfm","&gt; The US has less than 5% of the world's population, yet we spend more on our military than the next 14 nations combined. We have special forces deployed in 134 countries, maintain over 900 military bases across the globe, and are actively involved with at least seven wars right now, none of which are declared by Congress like the US Constitution requires. We need to refocus our efforts on national defense instead of international offense 
&gt; We should interact with our neighbors with free trade, and stop arming our future enemies. Protect US borders and shipping lanes from violence, and let's exercise some fiscal responsibility when it comes to the federal department responsible for the most waste.

The United States also has an 18 trillion dollar gross domestic product, international interests that must be secured such as Israel and other trading partners while our current spending has actually been cut by the Democrats. Free trade requires free nations, as we learned from the Cold War, and with ISIS, radical regimes, and other terror groups running around we can't just pack our bags and go home. We don't declare war on many of these groups because that would imply we need to treat those captured as ""prisoners of war"" and not ""enemy combatants"". This means they can utilize our constitution and the Geneva convention and use it to their advantage. 

&gt; Lastly, I will be working with other parties to advance individual liberties by reducing federal involvement in our everyday lives.. It is undeniable that the federal government is well beyond its Constitutional limitations. I will look to repeal laws that Congress was not originally granted authority over in article 1 section 8. This will have the benefit of invariably reducing the debt and likewise the tax burden that Americans must endure for the excesses in Washington.

This is just sugar coated regression. Article 1 Section 8's Interstate Commerce clause serves as the basis for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and court cases such as *Heart of Atlanta Hotel v. United States* as well as all regulations created by the federal government. This means we could return to an era of entirely segregated America where someone has to get hurt before any tort law can come to our rescue. This would be like stepping back into the early 1900s and late 1800s and completely disregarding the Progressive Era's initiatives. I am a man of free markets and civil liberties (for citizens and not terrorists) but disregarding needed reforms in the name of constitutionality is just dangerous fundamentalism. Honestly any progressive or moderate who votes for this guy based on this stance is really a sell out or uninformed and he should change his stance.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","&gt; How often do inputs actually get dropped that this is necessary?

Never, because the architecture ensures that anything thats ""dropped"" is picked up again.

Thats what your game does when it says ""Waiting for server..."" - it waits for the server to give all the lost commands etc.


If the client cannot retrieve the information whatsoever or the server doesn't get proper response from one of the clients, it just drops that client.

&gt; What happens if it does?

If this wouldn't be done, the game would not be synched anymore and two entirely different scenarios could play out. I.e. one player killed that unit, the other player thinks it's still alive and crazy stuff like that.


With games like DotA2 etc, you can just let the server do all the bookkeeping because there's 10-20 player-controllable objects. In StarCraft II, you have a couple hundred. So entirely different beast.


I think Blizzard is actively working on a solution similar to what /u/disieh_ was talking about: A server that's ensured to get all the necessary input and then observers being able to retrieve live-input from that server as if it was a ""CPU game"". Though as this requires an extra server, I'm pretty sure Blizzard will only have this feature for pro-games and such.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","Found a fix on Bethesda's forums. This worked for me. 

1. Delete Fallout 4 application data. Just navigate to the F4 icon in the PS menu, press the Options button and choose delete. Unfortunately on PS4 you cannot just delete DLC alone.

2. Turn off automatic downloads in the Settings menu.

3. Re-install Fallout 4. If you have a physical copy this bit is easy - just insert the disc and install. If like me you bought a digital copy, you'll have to re-download the whole thing. You may also be prompted to install purchased DLC - make sure you do not install Automatron!

4. Disconnect your PS4 from the internet. This may not be necessary if you disabled downloads, but I did it just to make sure. The option is under Settings, and then Network. Uncheck the box that says 'Connect to network'.

5. Start Fallout 4, loading the character you encountered the bug with. Make sure no Automatron quests or items are showing in the Pip-Boy, then create a new save. Close Fallout 4.

6. Connect to the internet and re-install Automatron.

7. Start Fallout 4 and load up the save you just made. The Automatron questline should start again from the beginning. Obviously you will lose the progress you made.

8. Create a new save and play through the questline as normal, but this time DO NOT build the robot workbench as soon as it's available. Building the workbench and modifying Ada seems to be what causes this bug. I also left Ada at a settlement while I went to the General Atomics factory. This may not be necessary, but I would do it just to be safe.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","That is what we thought too, and is certainly something that makes Polio right before his death unlikely. However I don't think it rules out post polio syndrome, which would not require significant aftercare once the original illness has been taken care of. In fact many people with post polio symptoms even today do not realize that their problems are related to a polio infection as a child and so never seek out secondary treatment. At the time the recommendation for patients with Polio was to have the initial symptoms and infection treated at the hospital in Victoria, following which they would transfer to their local hospital if secondary treatments were required. I don't think it is too much of a stretch to think he was treated initially in Victoria, met Jestyn who then left due to the unwanted pregnancy. He then had a change of heart and attempted to find her again, at which point he died. The doctors, nurses, etc. may not have seen him for up to 10 years before his death, and so may not have even thought of the person they once knew as a possibility. But I think your criticism is well founded, and something to take into account. We are trying to get a hold of old Polio patient records, something that is proving insanely difficult. ",1462060930

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Carriers were used repeatedly, and effectively, by the Royal Navy and the US Navy in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres. However, you don't see any carrier-on-carrier engagements in either of those theatres, for the simple reason that neither the Germans nor the Italians completed an aircraft carrier. Additionally, the confined waters most of the actions in these theatres were fought in wasn't entirely conducive to the use of carriers. 

British carriers had a poor start to the war in the Atlantic. They were initially deployed as sub-hunters, a decision proved disastrously wrong by the sinking of HMS Courageous by U-29 on the 17th September 1939. HMS Ark Royal had a narrow escape three days earlier, taking near-misses from U-39. *Courageous*' sister ship *Glorious* would be sunk in April 1940 by the German battlecruisers *Scharnhorst* and *Gneisenau*. All they had to show for these two losses was a few aircraft kills, and a few merchants sunk. However, the Mediterranean Fleet's carriers would be a lot more successful in 1940. *Ark Royal* supported the British attack on the Vichy fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, with her aircraft incapacitating the battlecruiser *Dunkerque*. Carriers were repeatedly used to fly fighter aircraft to the besieged island of Malta, with *Argus* and *Ark Royal* participating in the first such operation at the start of August. Carriers were used to attack Italian airbases, as well as the ports of North Africa. *Ark Royal* participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, launching sorties against the Italian Fleet. However, the big success of British naval aviation in 1940 was the Raid on Taranto. Taranto was the major naval base in Southern Italy, home to much of the Italian fleet. Aircraft from HMS Illustrious (including part of *Eagle*'s air group) attacked the port during the night of the 11th-12th November. Three Italian battleships were sunk or heavily damaged, in return for two aircraft lost. However, just a couple of months later, *Illustrious* would be heavily damaged by German dive bombers while escorting a convoy to Malta.  

1941 saw the RN's carriers involved in two major surface actions. The first, in the Mediterranean, was the Battle of Cape Matapan. *Formidable*, supported the battleships and cruisers of the Mediterranean Fleet during this action, protecting them from air attacks. Her aircraft repeatedly attacked the Italian fleet, with one successfully torpedoing the Italian battleship *Vittorio Veneto*, while another hit the heavy cruiser *Pola*. The former would survive with heavy damage, while the latter was immobilised, and sunk in a nighttime surface action along with two of her sister ships. The second, in May, was the hunt for the *Bismarck*. The RN's carriers became involved after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, with *Bismarck* turning for home with the RN in hot pursuit. HMS Victorious' aircraft attacked her on the 24th, scoring one hit that caused only minor damage. Two days later, *Ark Royal*, following a sprint from Gibraltar, came into range. Her aircraft, following an accidental attack on HMS Sheffield, scored three hits. Two caused only minor damage, but the third jammed *Bismarck*'s rudder, allowing the RN's battleships to catch and sink her. 

Following these battles, the war began to calm down for carriers in Europe. The main usage in the Mediterranean was to support convoys to Malta, providing defence against air attack, and flying off fighters for the island. This was dangerous work, with both *Ark Royal* and *Eagle* being sunk by submarines, while *Indomptable* took heavy damage in an air attack. USS Wasp supported two of these operations, before being withdrawn to the Pacific. Carriers were also used to support amphibious operations, such as Torch and Husky. In Northern Europe, they were used for attacks against the Norwegian coastline, including attacks on the battleship *Tirpitz*.

Smaller escort carriers were also hugely important in the Battle of the Atlantic. These small, slow carriers, usually converted from merchant hulls, closed the 'air gap' in the mid-Atlantic (the area that couldn't be covered by land based aircraft from the US or UK). Aircraft could cover a much wider area than a surface ship, and respond much more quickly to sightings. They were also much more effective against surfaced submarines - submarines of this period tended to surface when not in battle, as they were faster on the surface, and it was more comfortable for the crew. Even if an aircraft didn't attack a submarine, it would force it to submerge, slowing it, and preventing it from reaching and attacking its target. Without the escort carriers, losses to submarines would have been much higher. ",1462060936

I bought a house with my now-husband when I was 20, engaged at 22, and married at 24. My friends were all supportive, but thought I was crazy when we bought the house. When that seemed to work out OK, they were excited for the engagement and the wedding, but they would say they didn't understand how I could be ready for all of that.

Now, I'm 30. Same group of friends - 10 of us. 2 other couples are married, 3 are engaged. 2 are in very serious relationships, and 2 are single. They're all finally in the mindset of, ""I get it! I know why you wanted those things!"" And now I'm pregnant.

He would be tried as an adult in most cases and is about to be old enough to go to war.  He can decide if he wants to play football or not.  You may have the right and/or ability to force him to stop playing but I absolutely guarantee you are going to deeply damage your relationship with him.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","Found a fix on Bethesda's forums. This worked for me. 

1. Delete Fallout 4 application data. Just navigate to the F4 icon in the PS menu, press the Options button and choose delete. Unfortunately on PS4 you cannot just delete DLC alone.

2. Turn off automatic downloads in the Settings menu.

3. Re-install Fallout 4. If you have a physical copy this bit is easy - just insert the disc and install. If like me you bought a digital copy, you'll have to re-download the whole thing. You may also be prompted to install purchased DLC - make sure you do not install Automatron!

4. Disconnect your PS4 from the internet. This may not be necessary if you disabled downloads, but I did it just to make sure. The option is under Settings, and then Network. Uncheck the box that says 'Connect to network'.

5. Start Fallout 4, loading the character you encountered the bug with. Make sure no Automatron quests or items are showing in the Pip-Boy, then create a new save. Close Fallout 4.

6. Connect to the internet and re-install Automatron.

7. Start Fallout 4 and load up the save you just made. The Automatron questline should start again from the beginning. Obviously you will lose the progress you made.

8. Create a new save and play through the questline as normal, but this time DO NOT build the robot workbench as soon as it's available. Building the workbench and modifying Ada seems to be what causes this bug. I also left Ada at a settlement while I went to the General Atomics factory. This may not be necessary, but I would do it just to be safe.

These steps allowed me to continue with the quest as intended, so I hope this helps anyone else having this problem. ",1462060943

Doesn't really matter when you S-OFF. Flashing, RUU-ing, etc, does not affect S-OFF.

Dragging an child to church is acceptable (I say this as someone who lost faith at age 7, but still got dragged to church on occasion). You are not a child.

Telling someone that they are acting like an abusive person for a non-abusive action is not cool.

She's blaming her own misfortune on you and your brother - guilt-tripping you whilst you're holding her up.

She doesn't let you stay at other people's houses, tries to enforce a curfew, controls what you can do?

Whilst I don't doubt this is a very difficult situation for you to work out, in my opinion as an outsider - move out as soon as you can afford to, live your own life, and set up boundaries. 

One part of being an adult is that you decide for yourself. If you wanted to, you *could* eat nothing but bacon, and go out every night until 4am. She's not letting you grow up.",1462060949

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;it's hypocritical to me when you hear guys like Rush Limbaugh talking about poor black people being ""welfare queens"" 

We weren't talking about that Rush Limbaugh says, though, we were talking about whether or not *I* was *advantaged* because I'm white.  Would you be offended if I just picked a black person I don't like and assumed that person represented you?

My family is ""po white trash"" from Arkansas, on the banks of the Mississippi River, and worked the cotton fields right along side other poor people.  My uncles worked the farms, or worked the Chicago Mill, a saw-mill.  I have one uncle who lost half a hand to a saw blade, and one grand-uncle (is that a thing?)  who lost more than that - a big blade snapped and hit him in the chest, ripping out most of his ribs on one side and most of that lung.  He was crippled by that the rest of his life.  

Most of my family (both sides) graduated high school, but only a couple got any other education. My folks were too busy getting evicted from one apartment or another, moving every 6 months or year to help me with money for school.  No ""white advantage"" that I know of.  Seriously, we were looked down upon by pretty much everyone.  

&gt;If you're going to be working and close to poverty though being black just makes it worse.

I went to a mostly black high school (Tucker High, in Dekalb County Georgia.  Look it up) and have lived in the South pretty much all my life.  Living next to black folk is nothing new for me.  I know there are racist asshats still roaming the US, and who knows what goes on in their twisted minds.  I know that the color of one's skin has nothing to do with one's intellect, ones abilities, or one's potential.  I also know that one can prosper if one puts one's mind to it.  I've gotten part of the way there, working steady for the last 25 years, and making decent money for the last 10 or so.  Now, the rich people are taking some of that win away from me by sending my job overseas, and eviscerating the middle class while doing it.  I'm going to keep looking, and eventually will find a way to keep my home and not go bankrupt.  But, trust me, no one is giving me anything on a silver platter.  

Yes, it's hard to be poor in the US.  But, and I want to say this gently, with as much respect as I can muster over this text medium, we can't blame others for our place in life.  I don't think that I am to blame for poor black people who have not been able to escape poverty.  I don't want to take the blame for it.  I don't want to be accused of getting handouts that kept me from being poor, while more richly deserving black people have been denied the same opportunities.  I got NOTHING handed to me for free that wasn't available to anyone else, and I got less of it than others did, because I'm not a ""protected class.""  I got a crappy, public school education in an underfunded, minority school.  I got passed over for jobs because there was a black woman who also applied. Yes, businesses in the City of Atlanta do most certainly pay attention to hiring quotas.

So, I worked hard and joined the Georgia Army National Guard, where half of my unit was black, and said ""yes sir"" to the black officers (and meant it) and ""okay sergeant"" to the black enlisted NCOs above me (and meant it - those were some great guys, for the most part).  That got me the Montgomery GI Bill.  I understand that before I was old enough to know what a bill was that black soldiers were denied that, but by the time I was in school, that was over.  Now, I have kids in college, so I think it's time we stop casting blame, and start looking for solutions.  Don't you? ",1462060950

Being oppositional to zoos is also directly contradictory to your stated goals. Just by living in any way other than subsistence (including the Internet connection you used for this), you are benefitting from the extinction of species. Development has been the primary driver of species extinction. Managed hunting and trapping as well as zoos have all SAVED species from extinction. Zoos reintroduced the last species of wild horse to the wild, have reintroduced several other species and have prevented the extinction of hundreds of species through species survival programs.

So what you're really saying is that your entire philosophy is an unscientific sham that believes that it is okay to monocrop and wipe out species by constructing houses, malls and apartment buildings, but saving them through proven conservation efforts is wrong.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","Found a fix on Bethesda's forums. This worked for me. 

1. Delete Fallout 4 application data. Just navigate to the F4 icon in the PS menu, press the Options button and choose delete. Unfortunately on PS4 you cannot just delete DLC alone.

2. Turn off automatic downloads in the Settings menu.

3. Re-install Fallout 4. If you have a physical copy this bit is easy - just insert the disc and install. If like me you bought a digital copy, you'll have to re-download the whole thing. You may also be prompted to install purchased DLC - make sure you do not install Automatron!

4. Disconnect your PS4 from the internet. This may not be necessary if you disabled downloads, but I did it just to make sure. The option is under Settings, and then Network. Uncheck the box that says 'Connect to network'.

5. Start Fallout 4, loading the character you encountered the bug with. Make sure no Automatron quests or items are showing in the Pip-Boy, then create a new save. Close Fallout 4.

6. Connect to the internet and re-install Automatron.

7. Start Fallout 4 and load up the save you just made. The Automatron questline should start again from the beginning. Obviously you will lose the progress you made.

8. Create a new save and play through the questline as normal, but this time DO NOT build the robot workbench as soon as it's available. Building the workbench and modifying Ada seems to be what causes this bug. I also left Ada at a settlement while I went to the General Atomics factory. This may not be necessary, but I would do it just to be safe.

* Before the 1.5 update, pretty much any issue could be sorted by using LOOT to manage your sort order and the Nexus Mod Manager to make sure your installs were done correctly. 
* CBBE works well but you pretty much have to bodyslide everything if you want the clothes and armor to be customized properly.
* After the 1.5 update, things have gone a bit fakakta. Bethesda changed how mods were managed and implemented its own *log in* system to access your mod screen. It doesn't even work consistently for everyone. Nexus Mod Manager wasn't as prepared as it hoped either, no you have to activate the mods every time you make a change. Furthermore, any UI mods break the game.

So, Bethesda basically messed up Nexus modding with the 1.5 update, and *their* system of modding doesn't work for everyone. People are upset, but the reality is this is a problem that will be fixed by them or the community likely within weeks.",1462060954

You might also post this subject in /r/relationships

General advice for getting over a break-up is to do what you're doing and look at mistakes you may have made and learn from them. Don't take full responsibility for the descent of the relationship, but own your part in it. From there, try to accept that it is over, find what gratitude you can for having been in that relationship, and start really focusing on yourself and find out where the happiness is in being alone. That helps create secure attachment and can give you the confidence that will draw someone to you who is secure and willing to work with you inside a relationship to overcome that clingyness. Those people do exist. Not everyone is so put off by ""cling,"" and some even enjoy that sort of attention.

"jillstein","t5_2ty1q","Legally beholden or socially beholden?  Surely it must only be socially beholden, and the legislators still have individual choice as private citizens.  One legislator switching over would be very risky for the legislator, but there is safety in numbers.  If a whole lot of legislators switch all at once, then retribution becomes very difficult.  If, say, a tenth of Dems switched to Green, then the Dems would need their votes and couldn't alienate them.  Like I say, I don't think the constituents would mind as much.  They don't like the two-party system, and they still have the same person they voted for in office.

I don't think that the number of Greens from the split has to reach anywhere near half of the Dems.  Look at how much influence the Tea Party caucus holds with the Republicans, and they are only two senators and 48 representatives.

I think that the number of Democratic legislators who would prefer to side with the Greens is greater than zero.  If the Greens could find and coordinate, say, 5 Democratic senators and 20 Democratic representatives at the federal level to switch all at once, it could be done safely.  This could be tried in, say, the Vermont state legislature as a test case if desired.  Oregon and Washington are also good candidates, no pun intended.

Okay, you will NOT win by camping him out, unless you're Tink.  Fox can't even do that unless he's on Delfino's; that failure to understand Ganon's strengths and weakness is extremely common in Melee, and exactly why stuff like Biz taking a game off of Armada or Kage beating Mango happens.  Ganon just gets you in a corner, which is exactly what he wants.

Ganon loses to being smothered.  He loses to pressure.  Running away to the corner is literally ""How You Lose to Ganon 101.""  Even the most mobile of characters have trouble getting out of the corner against Ganon; Ivysaur is not going to be able to do that.

Ivy is a character built on outspacing opponents with her superior range.  Ganon's ftilt, dtilt, fair, bair, nair and up-air all heavily outrange Ivy's moves, even her lengthy bair and grab.  Ivy has better edgeguards and a little bit better punish game, but she straight up loses the spacing game.  This matchup is hardly bad for Ganon at all.",1462060971

number one - by saturating culture with music due to the proliferation of digital media (eg mp3s), the push for new styles to stimulate has accelerated the evolution of music

number two due to different styles being easily available, many artists incorporate elements which they wouldnt have otherwise, which has blurred the boundaries between different genres of music

i used to find it very easy to categorise my music into discrete genres. there was the occasional track that was hard to place, or that transcended a few boundaries, but generally speaking it was easy. a lot of more recent music doesnt fit so easily into the old categories, having elements of each one.

To share a perspective on this, from the emanations of the name Baha, of one of the personages in that tradition:

&gt;KNOW thou of a certainty that Love is the secret of God’s holy Dispensation, the manifestation of the All-Merciful, the fountain of spiritual outpourings. Love is heaven’s kindly light, the Holy Spirit’s eternal breath that vivifieth the human soul. Love is the cause of God’s revelation unto man, the vital bond inherent, in accordance with the divine creation, in the realities of things. Love is the one means that ensureth true felicity both in this world and the next. Love is the light that guideth in darkness, the living link that uniteth God with man, that assureth the progress of every illumined soul. Love is the most great law that ruleth this mighty and heavenly cycle, the unique power that bindeth together the divers elements of this unique power that bindeth together the divers elements of this material world, the supreme magnetic force that directeth the movements of the spheres in the celestial realms. Love revealeth with unfailing and limitless power the mysteries latent in the universe. Love is the spirit of life unto the adorned body of mankind, the establisher of true civilization in this mortal world, and the shedder of imperishable glory upon every high-aiming race and nation.

plus there seems to be some beef between the kingdom of lothric and the ""divinity"", whatever that means. consider the description of the winged knight armor:

&gt; Armor of the Winged Knights, who swore themselves to the Angels.

&gt; Worship of the divine messengers was viewed as heresy in Lothric and unrecognised by any of the Three Pillars of rule.

&gt; This is believed to be why Gertrude, the Heavenly Daughter, was imprisoned in the lofty cell of the Grand Archives.

In a field with fresh blood, the party probably won't want to be reminded of the disaster of the 2016 primaries. Plus I'm willing to bet that Ted Cruz will make another run in 2020.

&gt; * Every week  boom, boom, boom, I knocked them off, Mr Trump told his supporters in California referring to the defeat of other Republican candidates by him.

&gt; * His two Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and governor John Kasich of Ohio, are lagging far behind Mr Trump in the delegate count.

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; Why can't they catch these bad actors through other means? 

That's the rub. 

I'm advocating for *more* use of *unbreakable* encryption by more people.

Apple did a very good thing with recent versions of their iOS:

- system, and Apple app files, are automatically encrypted; but 3rd party apps had to opt-into having their files encrypted
- in subsequent version of iOS, Apple changed it so that **all** files are automatically encrypted

This is a good thing, as encryption comes essentially for free (3rd party app developers don't have to take any action). 

The other innovation that Apple did was multiple levels of file security:

- some files can be read as soon as the phone is turned on
- some files can only be read after the user has unlocked their phone for the first time after reboot
- some files are locked every time the phone is locked

This is, again, a very good thing. Because now nearly every data file you care about is re-locked every time you put your phone down. Google's Android needs to follow suit (which will require a huge re-architecting of the operating system).

I didn't answer your question, except to say: technology companies need to be constantly making it *harder* to catch these bad actors.

As for seeing if something is working, I listen to my body. I track my energy levels, mood, weight and see if food have specific effects. It's working when I feel good. Even if that means I lose weight a little slower.",1462060991

"h3h3productions","t5_3345f","I definitely get where you're coming from but I believe you're dismissing it too easily and with some weak reasoning. Both of your arguments (gullibility and social pressure) are just different manifestations of the fundamental power dynamic that is present in all kinds of hypnosis. In a well-performed stage hypnosis these elements just make the induction to trance easier, instead of being ways to force the subject to fake it. That's why they pick certain kinds of people, it's not that they are ""gullible"" or ""weak-minded"", they're just excited and open to the idea of hypnosis, which is great because nobody wants to sit through a 30 minute induction just to ease the subject into a light trance.

The idea that they pick ""insecure"" or ""weak"" people is a common myth. What if they picked somebody with crippling social anxiety or selective mutism? Would they suddenly feel free to act on anything the hypnotist told them without the slightest hint of shame or shyness?

I'm not saying *no* stage hypnotists are fake, actually, most of them probably are; but there are some genuinely effective stage hypnotists who understand the science and social dynamics behind what they are doing, and I don't think it's fair to put them all in the same bag.",1462060994

Also upgrading right now on a 12gb or higher data plan gets you an extra 2gb per line that upgrades. So potentially you could switch your plan, use device payment plan to upgrade a couple of lines, and you could be looking at having more data and a lower bill. 

Now, what I would do. Drop the plan to 12 gb. Upgrade all four of my smartphones on device payment. That would give you an additional 8gb (20 total) for roughly 260-300 a month (range varies on the phone payment and insurance)",1462060996

Two-Fisted has nothing to do with Push. They are separate attacks. The character with Two-Fisted could attack with a sword in his good hand, and a bare knuckle punch with the off-hand with no penalty, other than -2 for the off-hand unless he has the Ambidextrous Edge. That is a single attack with the second Fighting roll at a -2 thanks to the Edge. 

If he wanted to follow the attack with a Push, he suffers a -2 multiaction penalty. This means a -2 to the sword attack, -4 to the punch, and a -2 to the Push attack. 

As far as Push goes, you could actually take up to three different styles of Push attacks in a round, at a -4 penalty for all three. Bash pushes the foe back 1"" for every success/raise on the opposed Strength roll. Second, Shield Bash (requires as shield) and does up to +3 Strength damage on a success. Then finally, Prone is a push (opposed Strength) that only renders the target Prone.

Its a marine, perceiving things as the Primarchs do. So yeah, Primarch. But, like I said earlier, GEoM was FTE for Horus. But I also could see that easily being due to timestop.

&gt;The primary reason why I doubt Emprah or Horus had planet busting strikes was because what we see with the Orks earlier. Emprah nearly died to an Ork warboss because he played the idiot ball and chose to fist fight him.

Like I said. Huge outlier. You're basing all of your underselling on that when the Primarchs have much better feats. Like I said. Story explanation. Or this was a massively buffed warboss. 

&gt;Rogal Dorn implied to die to a few hundred Chaos Space Marines, who once more, are woefully behind in the destruction capability. 

We don't know what happened to Dorn.

We also have no idea what happened with Luther and Johnson. We do know that Luther was Chaos amped enough to put him on par with the Primarchs.

Where has it been shown that Abbadon is on par with Horus?

&gt;Sanginus. Another ""normal"", unbuffed primarch. Even though all the damage Sanginius did was a single crack, it still implies rather easily that you want to argue Sanginius is something along the lines of a continent buster, it's doubtful Horus can have planetary durability.

&gt; * A Hindu tailor was hacked to death by machete-wielding ISIS militants in his shop on Saturday in central Bangladesh, the latest in a series of brutal attacks on intellectuals, activists and minorities by the dreaded terror group in the Muslim-majority country.

&gt; * Nikhil Chandra Joarder (50), a resident of the Dubail village under Gopalpur upazila of the Tangail district, was hacked to death on Saturday afternoon.

&gt; * Asked about the possible motive behind the attack, Mr Jalil told reporters that a case was filed against Nikhil in 2012 for making a derogatory comment about the Prophet.

&gt; * ISIS Amaq Agency reported the groups responsibility for killing the Hindu tailor for blasphemy in Tangail district in Bangladesh, it said in a tweet.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I'm going to go against the anti-police circle jerk happening here.

While I personally don't agree with the no-knock raids, I can understand the reasoning behind them. In certain situations, if law enforcement (of any type) announce that they're at the door, it would give the suspects time to dispose of or hide potential evidence or possibly even allow time for the suspects to make an escape. It might also give the suspects time to arm themselves or open fire at the police. 

That last part actually did happen here in Dallas a while back. [Senior Cpl. Norman Smith, along with several other officers, knocked on a door to serve an arrest warrant.](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20110613-man-who-killed-dallas-police-senior-cpl.-norm-smith-gets-life-sentence.ece)  

The problem with no-knock raids however is evidenced by the story at the top of the thread though. Sometimes it happens to innocent people. I'm not sure if it's happened yet, but what is the outcome if someone's door bursts open with men running in yelling and the homeowner decides to lob some rounds at the invaders? Are the police going to return fire and end up having a shoot out with what was previously innocent people? Will the homeowners now have a litany of charges against them for what they believe is just defending their home against invaders? What if someone on either side dies? ",1462061003

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;Blindly following any ideal is a bad thing, but that's not even taking place in the video. I hardly doubt this man is blindly following religion. He even says he's doing what HE believes, which he then explains is what god wants him to do. He made the point of saying it is what he personally believes and has decided. He even admits to struggling with forgiving the man. If was truly being a blind follower, he would have just forgiven, no struggle or reservation.

What he says there is open for interpretation. He could mean ""I believe BECAUSE that's what God says to do"" or ""I believe AND that's what God says to do. The ""struggle"" could be between his conscience vs. his religious beliefs, a struggle within his conscience, or even a struggle with his interpretation of his religious beliefs. 

&gt;You're trying to say that all religious people are blind followers, who don't spend any time figuring out what they personally believe, and adhere to, which is a broad and wrong generalization.

No, I'm not anti-theist. In my first comment I said ""Powerful video in how brainwashed **some** people are by religion"". 

&gt;Yes, he's obviously influenced by religion, but it's obvious he also had to have other inherent qualities that inspired him to be so forgiving. You even said yourself ""Doing things in the name of religion are is not always positive.""

I think it was the Safari Grill or some restaurant similar to that. It's a sort of side-stand or quickservice looking restaurant where you order food at the counter like a food court, and then sit at nearby tables. My mom's the only one hungry, so she orders her food, takes it, and we head and sit down at the tables. A table or two over, there's a lone backpack just sitting on the seats. I didn't think too much of it, but my mom's the kind of person who immediately assumes everything like that is a bomb and proceeds to give the same spiel to me and my sister that she always does, yet is fine sitting where we are anyway. A couple minutes later, out of NOWHERE there is a tall man suddenly standing behind her wearing a men-in-black style suit with pitch-black sunglasses. He looks down at my mom:

""Is this your backpack ma'am?""
""U-Um, no, it was just here when we got-""
""I'm going to need all of you to clear a 500 foot radius around this area.""

We listen, stand up, and start walking away, and the instant we even slightly turn our heads we see at least thirty more men in suits pouring in from every direction (it even looked like some came out of the walls!) making an impenetrable circle around the backpack. We turn to talk to each other in fear for less than ten seconds, and by the time we look back, everything is gone except for the first man (who is still standing calmly at attention staring blankly forward), and all of the other guests are still walking around and talking like nothing had ever happened. We walk back up to the man and try to ask for any explanation as to what that was and he cuts us off and says:

I even buy the dvd when it comes out, but download until then so I'm still paying for it. 

I'm stuck on an ADSL1 connection, the best I can stream is 240-360p, maybe 480p on a good day. Live in a rental so no foxtel option. But of course the argument always comes down to someone saying ""It's still doing the wrong thing no matter how you want to try and justify it, regardless of if you pay for it later by buying the dvd""

Using a cheating engine in a game against other players is getting a leg up on an already level playing field. Pirating (in some cases) is getting a leg up onto the level playing field. 

But no, you're right, people use pirating to get stuff for free. So therefore anyone who pirates is a bad person. Because the world is black and white with no shades of grey. ",1462061006

NXT is very GPU-heavy so it plays an important role in determining how well the client runs on your system.

While it does make pushes in the first two minutes more difficult, it allowed for me to place a minion hoard in my deck. Which is a very strong defense, even if they are arrowed soon after. And for offense, they punish my opponent on a misplay. So since that switch, my defense and offense greatly improved. 

So I recommend you do the following. If you're struggling with your current deck, just switch out a single card, and see what it does. Keep doing that until you figure out a nice combination that seems to click. ",1462061010

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;I think you used 'costs me' far too broadly, and in a way that makes difficult to have a direct break down of that idea.

Maybe it's difficult to ""break it down"" because there are actually very good reasons that workers can't have everything and the capitalist can have nothing

&gt;I am not opposed to having maintenance costs associated with the use of capital

Who decides the maintenance costs? The capitalist or the worker?

&gt;A negligible sum of time to the point of being trivial; by equal right, I could charge any owner of capital for speaking to me about using the machine even if I am not at it-- after all, I could be ignoring him instead, and that might be of greater worth and value to me.

The only reason he has to speak to you is because you claim that you should be able to tell him that he can't use his machine whenever he pleases (cause you know it's his)

&gt;If it would be onerous on you to calibrate the machine to your preferred settings, it would be equally onerous on the person who changed the settings to their own preferred calibration. This cost, again, goes both ways.

And again, that is only the case because you are imposing on me and my machine. If you didn't claim you had a right, there would be no conflict

&gt;Operative words here being ""if"", and all contingent on basic assumptions about overhead that come with use of any given piece of capital. You could very well have a case for charging for current labor and resources used to maintain the machinery.

Huh?

&gt;If you have a single mill and lathe, which you use almost exclusively for all work, then yes-- you're free to keep people from ever accessing it.

Why does it matter if it's a single little benchtop lathe or a huge machine park?

&gt;The problem is when you extend your treatment of ownership to everything you've ever ""invested"" in, despite not having done the actual work of producing.

If i've worked at job A, earned a bunch of money, bought a machine from company B, I still have the exclusive rights to that machine

&gt;for those of us who think markets will still be a thing, the price of using capital would always be tied to its cost to use-- that is, time and resources to maintain it.

Meaning what?

&gt; state mechanisms which prohibit people from starting cottage industries,

Give me an example of such a mechanism

&gt;and a good deal of it would probably find itself tending towards ""occupancy and use"". 

Have you seen the general qualities of public ""occupancy and use"" today? Public bathrooms for example? Or basically anything that is used by many. It usually turns out shitty, dirty, broken and disrespected. What would make this any different? 

There are infinitely many scenarios where it SUCKS to share stuff - would you like to share your bed just because you're not using it for a week? If the answer is no, then you can apply that same rationale to every other item you use. There is no inherent difference

&gt;When, in your mind, does the bargaining process for how much they ought to pay for the use of capital come into play? At what rate do you start negotiations for the use of the mill and lathe? Let's assume it costs 2 schmeckles (about 1.5 oz Ag, so you have some sort of reference) in maintenance for each hour used, and a total of 24 repair hours for every month of use (by most machinists standards, this would be a sub-par and costly machine, if it was constantly needing repairs). If I came up with 12 shmeckles to use your mill and lathe for four hours, would you shrug you shoulders and say 'yeah, why not', or would you try and get more out of me? If you knew for certain that I could definitely go somewhere that wouldn't charge me an exorbitant rate for the use of the machinery, do you think you'd be more or less willing to negotiate for a rate that more accurately reflects the costs of maintaining the machinery?

Would I try to get more out of you? If I felt like what I was providing you was worth more or that it was a lot of work to maintain it yes, probably. Can you explain to me what part of the process you just described that is different from today?

&gt;It is important to understand we make no objections to them recouping and controlling the full product of their labor at the machine; however, we distinguish this from other people mixing their labor at the machine. The question of ""why would they maintain it, if they can't profit from it"" is pretty evident-- to have the machine to use, when they need it.

Why wouldn't they just let others maintain it if the only advantage they get is the ability to use it? You're saying everyone else gets that ability as well, so there's no difference in your mind anyway. Also, you say

&gt;we make no objections to them recouping and controlling the full product of their labor at the machine;

I'll have to assume this means that you want them to recoup the cost they have of maintaining the machine. 

What happens if the machine breaks? Are they simply expected to buy a new one from scratch out of pocket, still not being allowed to charge a dime to those who use it? Why in the world would anyone be dumb enough to ever build a machine in this scenario in the first place since that would be hundreds of manhours with zero reward

&gt;as ownership is exclusively the capitalists.

""Capitalists"" are not an exclusive class. Most people are capitalists, most people are workers. Workers can become capitalists quite simply, as can capitalists become workers.

&gt;The difference between living in a monopoly with one owner and a plurality of owners with a monolithic vision of ownership is negligible in this respect.

That is definitely not neglible since first of all it's false, and second of all, the fact that it's false means that it's not a monopoly which means that ""capitalists"" don't hold some exclusive and all-controlling power that they have exclusive rights to

&gt;No, a capitalist has monopoly rights over capital and is able to extract profit from labor because of those rights.

No he doesn't? ""Monopoly"" means that only one entity has access to a certain thing. Since workers also have access to capital, it is in no way monopolic. 

&gt;but are prevented from utilizing it in a fulfilling manner by way of state enforced policies which are ultimately to the benefit of capitalist organizations.

Give me an example, I really can't think of any ""state enforced policies"" that prevent people from utilizing whatever ""capital"" they have at hand

&gt;for one, its obviously very uncomfortable for a trans person to be forced into a position thats socially seen to be belonging to the other gender on the basis that they dont pass well enough.


It can also be quite uncomfortable for a cis gendered person to have to share a bathroom with someone that physically appears to to be the wrong gender for the bathroom they're in. 


&gt;on top of that, there are people who identify as a different gender that isnt covered by our current binary and furthermore there are people whose sex couldnt even be properly placed in either bathroom.


What gender/sex isn't covered by our current binary? I'm pretty sure there are only two genders; male and female. Not even talking about identifying differently than your physical biology would suggest. 


&gt;if the reason for doing it is to prevent sexual harassment then thats redundant as well. a very large proportion of people currently and especially in the future arent heterosexual. 


I've seen studies that range from 1.8% to 10% homosexual or bisexual, and even less asexual. I haven't seen a credible study that suggests higher than that. That would be nowhere near a very large portion. Could you provide me with one? 


&gt;half of young people arent a 0 on the kinsey scale and as progressive changes in society go onward this is only likely to increase.


Could you link me with this study as well? 


Main article: Kinsey Reports

Men: 11.6% of white males aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.[3] The study also reported that 10% of American males surveyed were ""more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55"" (in the 5 to 6 range).[3]Women: 7% of single females aged 20–35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.[4] 2% to 6% of females, aged 20–35, were given a rating of 5[5] and 1% to 3% of unmarried females aged 20–35 were rated as 6.


I believe that a very large number of people are somewhat ""confused"" about their sexuality when they're young, and this has been going on forever. But most people figure it out by at least their mid twenties if not sooner, and most people end up identifying as predominantly heterosexual. [This](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) study would agree with that. 

I think that this progressive society we're in glorifies being different and people take their young confusion and run with it, seeking support from like minded individuals and perpetuating it, but at the end of the day (or rather their adolescence) they'll realize it was just a phase. Most of them will end up identifying as predominantly heterosexual, some of them as homosexual, a little less as bisexual, and even fewer as asexual. 

As far as this increasing beyond half (a figure I can't find sources for)  that would fly in the face of evolution by natural selection. The only objective purpose to life (in general, not ones personal life) is to continue. A society with a significant portion of people not interested in reproductive sex would spell disaster for life. One could argue that actual sex isn't necessary for reproduction with modern medicine, and that's true, but that hasn't been the case for very long. Nowhere near enough time for an evolutionary revolution to take hold. 


Edit: I'd like to point out that genderless restrooms are certainly a possibility in the future but it would need a society wide change of view on all things bathroom related. Most people don't even like the idea of using a public restroom period, especially one that's for multiple people. Adding in the possibility that maybe your crush is in there and hears you fart or hears your turds plopping makes it a humiliating experience. It would also take a tremendous amount of trust in people. People feel vulnerable when attending to their bathroom business.

Needless to say, it was pretty bizarre... and it got even weirder when I received *another* call, not five minutes later. This one came from a young man (with no discernible accent) who had apparently invented a telephone number for his father to call, and the resulting digits had just happened to match mine. The reason for this lie was never explained to me, and the kid asked me to ""just pretend you don't know anything"" if his father called back.

They don't work on accident though. And it can get messy if I'm not careful about the wind but with a strategically long necklace and some aviators I can feel a little more summery.

 The deep plunge isn't ever modeled on anyone with giant breasts and I am nursing but I had this dress with a very deep V neckline and needed some room and access for the spawn and threw my Hail Mary and pulled it off.

He's been WONDERFUL. Never hesitated to help give her meds, clean up when she had accidents from having worms, etc. It's certainly been tough, but she's getting better (she was in pretty rough shape and it's taken a while) and it hasn't been without its frustrations but he's handled it like a champ and its only solidified my confidence in him as a partner.

2.  the short term threat isn't so much the GMO ""crop"" itself.  no.  the problem is the crop is GMO'ed to be resistant to certain pesticides -- so the  pesticide kills the bugs, not the crop.  and humans are generally NOT bread to be resistant to these ""hi tech"" pesticides.

You make very good points - although in the first one, most MMOs do have some PvE elements, in the event of bots being added to PS2 that'd have to be as subtle as possible.  The distinction would be clear if you were fighting a bot or a person, but I totally understand what you mean - I love how in PS2 every fight is unpredictable, since you never know what the other player(s) might do. However, the same can be said for any other multiplayer shooter - Battlefront and Titanfall included. Bots will take away from the ""players and only players"" thing PS2 has, and that's one of its main selling points - subtracting that even in a subtle way in exchange for improving the new player experience could be hugely detrimental.

As for the second point, yeah, this is the main obstruction to having even a few bots in the game. Even having bots just on frontline bases could be taxing on server performance. Programming reactive AI would take weeks if not months of dev time that could be spent on far better stuff like fixing Construction bugs or adding new content, plus they'd have to be extensively bug-tested, and they'd still be a real pain during server hiccups.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;  Christian baker doesn't even want to make a business agreement with a gay couple for a wedding, that baker should be ran out of business. Do I have this correct?

No, you don't have it right. Not all ""agreements"" are equal. 

The *public market place,* aka stores and businesses that serves the public, isn't the same as making a hotel reservation, and you simply cancel your reservation. 

What you're not seeing in this ""agreement"" dynamic, is the *consumer* is the one that's opting out of doing business. In the public market place, the consumer gets to pick the service they're willing to pay for, not the provider of the service picking whom they shall serve. 

Public taxes pay for the infrastructure to allow the baker to run his/her business (roads, water, electricity, fire department, police protection, etc). 28 states, or so, have no protections for people in the LGBT community. This will change over time. Not necessarily because of the good will of lawmakers, but because money has always been the engine of social change. 

I suggest you google ""public accommodations"" and ""protected classes."" 

&gt;All these people pulling out of North Carolina are doing just that - pulling out. They already had agreements and deals set up with these PRIVATE BUSINESSES. And now they are breaking those agreements and deals because they disagree with a bill that would ultimately effect less than 0.3% of the population.

And you're not going to see a single lawsuit arise out of it, unless there was a contract that was breached. 

You don't understand the concept of, ""the customer picks the business; the business doesn't get to choose their class of customers,"" ""religious beliefs"" or not. For the most part right now, and in those states that fear bathrooms so much, when their economy dies, they'll be singing a different tune. Unfortunately, some good people will be hurt economically by this, but such is the price of stupid lawmakers. ",1462061031

I would not just take 1 maybe 4 or 5 at a time then I got introduced to bars or pills prescription pain killers etc. so one day I was with my buddies's and decided I was gonna take some x and roll for the day. Got the x told friend's do not let me get some bars about an hour later I got 5 bars. I can remember the next hour and that's it  the rest is blank.

  this was at 2 pm or around there next thing I remember is I'm jumping fences then I jump one more and bam a cop with lights gun drawn etc is right there so I hit the ground. He's searching me etc and I look around ...no shirt on no shoes 1 sock no pants and in my boxers and it's 2 am. At this point I'm trying to remember anything or hell  even where I am. He asked me what happened and me being on x I look down at what I have on and went into save my ass mode.told him I was from out of town was staying at a friend's house and got jumped. 

So now I'm in the back of the cop car heading to my buddy's house who is not there. We pull up and his mom's car is in driveway. Me and his mom were cool but not like she knows I get fucked up cool. Anyway were walking to the door and all I'm thinking is please say yes. So he knocks she ansers takes 1 look at me and says my GOD WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU etc.... she takes me home not a word was said between us lol.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; I think that’s reading too much into the text.

*""The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness.""* So how does this passage outline what it means when it says 'godlessness and wickedness'?

It goes on saying:

*""For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him""*... He wants praise and attention. We both seem to agree that He is also jealous. 

*""They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.""* God wants what we would describe as sycophants in every other context. I don't change the description in this instance, because I have no reason to, and every reason not to.

*""and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.""* People appreciating things besides God and taking some credit (doesn't say intentionally) from Him in the meantime.

*""Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.""* I suppose we would refer to other parts of the Bible to understand what is sexual impure. And homosexuality is certainly one such impurity.

God's wrath comes down on these kinds of people. I'd also argue that those worshiping idols or other Gods aren't convinced that He is their One True God that condemns such beliefs.

&gt; You’d like a book written directly by God rather than through human hands? 

Yes. Definitely. Actually, not a book. Maybe an actual message in our minds that we understand as genuine. Or even an untouchable, candid entity that can be approached and spoken with. The fact that God (allegedly) primarily depends on a book as a means to spread His message shows us that He is bound to the methods of Bronze/Iron Age people... Which is ludicrous to imagine.

Jesus could always come back and do God's work for us. Christians are human, and humans make mistakes - they're not exactly fit for saving souls. And the Bible relies on human minds, too.

&gt; Paul is writing to people who already believed in God and basically pointing out why they should continue to believe in God rather than worship idols like everyone around them.

I know this. Which is why I'm wondering why Paul didn't try preaching to anyone besides the choir. Skeptics are always at a loss with the Bible.

&gt; Why would he spend his time trying to convince skeptics who didn’t exist?

Because their souls deserve to be saved(?) Jesus could have informed him that his letters will survive the ages and be very influential, even in the future.

&gt; I’m not even convinced that homosexuality as we understand it (a sexual identity) existed until much more recently.

But every mammalian species has gay members. Every single mammalian species. We're mammals. I don't see how you could conclude that homosexuality is a recent phenomena given that we evolved in nature, and nature has shown us that homosexuality exists alongside mammals.

&gt; I didn’t say anything about homosexuality. I really don’t think this passage has anything to do with homosexuality. 

Maybe not. But would Paul consider anal sex (of any kind) to be ""unnatural sex""? And would he denounce the choices of gay people? Because this would bleed into the idea of being anti-homosexuality.

&gt; Nearly everyone in Rome (the people Paul is writing to) would have worshiped the state sanctioned gods and goddesses. Christians didn’t do this and they were accused of being atheists or of being subversive to the state religion.

Fair enough. Strange wording, though. I'm also not convinced that atheism didn't exist. It would have existed... just not very common, I'd surmise. But maybe I'm wrong; maybe every single human on Earth believed sincerely in the supernatural - it could be possible.",1462061032

I didn't, and still don't, know anything about running technique (such as stride or where your foot should strike). This explains why I suffered so often from shin-splints.

Additionally, I was a vegetarian for five years prior to lifting (and a month or two into lifting). I had no idea about macros and most certainly wasn't eating enough protein.

I'm getting the impression your concept of ""mechanical"" and ""narrative"" are skewed in some way, because that doesn't make any sense. Mechanical means that the effect is governed numerically. Narrative means it's not. Every spell in both systems is tightly bound to the underlying numerical system. Once again, I'm left with the impression that your ST just kind of ignored those rules in favour of a more narrative experience - which isn't wrong, but that's *not* a characteristic of the system.

cWoD = classic WoD, and nWoD = new WoD (or Chronicles of Darkness, according to a recent rebrand).

Right. 300 days out correlation is basically zero. 200 days out r squared is .5, not a very strong correlation. You don't get a clear correlation until r squared is close to one.

Look again. Trump's unfavorable level has stayed pretty flat (honestly he probably can't get much lower). Hillary's has gotten exponentially worse over time and the main event hasn't even started yet. Given that her unfavorables keep going up, it doesn't yet look like she has found how low she can go yet.

Like I said. We've never had a race between two candidates this disliked. In the past the winner has always had a net positive rating (except '92 Bill in some polls and he was only minus one or two and that was a 3 way race).

3. Chelsea and Real Madrid are notorious for changing their managers frequently, so it's not all on Mou.

Serial failer here signing up for **Hard mode** 

**Definition &amp; parameters of Hard mode for me:**

* No browsing of porn model sites/erotic sites or anything that get my pants on fire.
* No hoarding of pictures, photos, videos of porn/erotic nature
* No using, whether watching, reading, creating, collating of said saved pictures, photos, videos of porn/erotic
* No physical &amp; mental masturbation/fantasizing, edging, orgasm.


My goal is to follow through and complete the above goals for the dates starting from 01/05/2016 ending in 01/08/2016

**I am doing this because:**

* PMO is a problem for me, always has been. I know if i reclaim my energy and time i will accomplish amazing things for the world.
* I want to reduce and ultimately eliminate all fetishes that current has their claws embedded in my mind.
* I want to get rid of the fear that if i don't have this, i dont have anything else and that i will be missing out
* I want to be able to develop multiple responses to life's challenges instead of constantly retreating to PMO
* I want to win this one challenge because if i do, i know nothing will stop me.

**METHODS:**


I am serial failer. I felt shitty for this for a long time until i realised that when i fail i always said: *DAMMIT now i have to reset* instead of *DAMMIT i am just going to give up*. I realize now i have the tenacity to pull this through since i've been in a chain of resets for 3 years straight. I have always been in battle/in war, badly bruised and mauled but never stepped out of it.

So i will attempt something new to help me achieve my goals. I will post up my diary now.

"programming","t5_2fwo","There's no allocation or copy penalty to using wrappers on a modern compiler, and GCC emits the exact same code for both the template wrapper and a plain old `std::string`. It's the same for heap allocations - wrapping an object doesn't add any overhead the way it does in the JVM languages that lack an AnyVal equivalent.

I just tested the following on [GCC at Godbolt's site](http://gcc.godbolt.org/):

    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    struct Foo;
    struct Bar;

    template&lt;class T&gt; void test2(T t)
    {
        std::string s1 = t.s;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; s1;
    }

    template&lt;&gt; void test2&lt;std::string&gt;(std::string s)
    {
        std::string s1 = s;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; s1;
    }

    template&lt;class T&gt; struct Id{std::string s;};

    void test()
    {
        std::string s(""hello!"");

        Id&lt;Foo&gt; foo = {s};
        std::string saz = s;
        Id&lt;Bar&gt; bar = {foo.s};
    }

and all three assignments compiled to the same machine code (which in this case was the `std::string` copy constructor I think). It's the same with `std::string&amp;` references (which are just pointer copies in all three cases, no copy constructors needed) and `std::string*` proper. No overheads are introduced because the `struct Id&lt;Foo&gt;` is completely compiled out, and the machine code is as if the template wrapper never existed, just like AnyVal.

When used as function arguments for test2 (not using references because they're a bit dull, compiling down to a single move instruction), sometimes I had an overhead when I didn't use -O (issuing a call to the Id&lt;Foo&gt; copy constructor) and sometimes it was optimised/inlined away to std::string (or further) even without -O, making the wrapper zero-cost except for development/debug use (when retaining the compiler deems the constructor and function calls preferable to keep).",1462061039

When you consume large amounts of alcohol, glutamate is almost completley inhibited causing a buildup of glutamate in the presynaptic neurons, as well as an upregulation of glutamate receptors as a your brain's compensatory mechanism to try to maintain homeostasis. When the alcohol leaves your system by the morning, you experience a rebound of excess amounts of glutamate. This actually has the potential to be excitiotoxic, especially if combined with stimulants (your ""ADHD meds"") and is actually one of the main causes of alcohol induced neurological damage.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","If you look in to what it means to be an exempt employee you might have a case and can possibly sue for overtime. A former boss of mine (retail general manager) sued for overtime because he was made to cover associates hours and duties (the company was refusing to allow us new hires) so much that the majority of his time working at the store was spent doing non-exempt duties. (Running the register, stocking) if more than 50% of your time spent is performing non-exempt duties you may have a case. I think it's worth looking into especially in California. I think that companies sometimes treat employees this way because not everyone knows their rights and I think it might cost more to automatically classify employees as non-exempt and pay them overtime than paying employees a settlement when they sue for overtime. Meanwhile they get a lot of free labor. 


I'm wondering if it would be more beneficial for you to talk to a lawyer while you are still employed with this company or after you leave. Have you kept any records of the hours you have worked? A schedule or other evidence showing the hours you worked and do you have co-workers or former co-workers who would be willing to attest to what kind of duties you perform on your job?

"instant_regret","t5_32dy0","&gt; Now, you may think that is comparable to adultery; I do not. Like you said, a cultural difference.

The ""syntax"" is comparable, not the semantics. The point is that I don't think that ""they intended to commit  crime X""  is obviously a reason for a conviction for that crime (or even an ""attempted crime X"") if it's actually a set-up. 

There is a vague difference between, to use the concrete example of TCaP again, a guy grooming a child in a chat room, then visiting that child, and being caught by the parents, who call the police; and a guy being ""honeytrapped"" in a chatroom, if that's even a word.

Vaguely this is probably the same intuition that makes people cry (falsely, I know) ""entrapment!"" in similar circumstances. 

""Attempt statutes"" *seem* very hard to distinguish from thought-crime to me, and this is presumably why your point (2) is required. But then the state, or in this case a TV show, *sets up a situation in which (2) occurs*, and I would suggest that one can not affirmatively know that the person would have ever reached (2) without this set-up. What if an *actual* child, behaving in an actually childish manner, would have prevented (2) from ever manifesting, for example?

I don't actually know how my country would deal with these kinds of situations, but a very small survey (of three people in my vicinity) roughly supported (in a very anecdotal and useless way) my vague feeling that this is a cultural issue. All three agreed that *something* feels fishy about this, without fully being able to explain what the ""something"" is.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Be careful of how high you go, you could seriously screw things up. If you have a Beth account, you can download the No Jetpack AP Drain from yours truly and it will take you higher than vanilla but not high enough to cause things like crashes or ""unloaded cells"" issues. 

One thing though, there exists no way to make the Jetpack move you forwards or backwards, and when you change direction mid-flight, it's like if you were walking, but there's no increase in movement speed, only height. This is because of the engine's limitations in which it will struggle when the player is moving too fast and simply doesn't have enough time to load everything in time. You can try this by hopping up on a Power armor and setting your scale to 10. You'll see the game may freeze while it's loading the adjacent cells. ",1462061046

"movies","t5_2qh3s","It's funny that I find that he gave one of the most greatest unintentional *Christian* messages around.

**The whole ""everything happens for a reason"" message is total crap.**  Bad things happen for no good reason all the time.  Your son is born with asthma.  Your daughter has some water fetish.  Your brother's a minor league screw up.  And your wife is run down by M. Night Shyamalan.

But the real Christian message is that no matter what happens to you, **God can *USE* it for good**.  That memory of your wife's death that brought down your faith?  God uses it to muster your courage.  Your minor league washout brother?  You now have a major league ET beater at your side.  Your daughters obsession with water just ""Home Alone""ed your entire house.  And that asthma that threatens your son's life?  It just saved him.

THIS is the message that Shyamalan missed.  Not that everything in the universe is tuned with God's perfect and unchangeable plan (though some may disagree strongly) but that no matter what horrible situation we face, God's will for us can not only overcome, but use that very situation for good.

Sorry if this sounded too preachy or anything...",1462061047
"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","Its just like gambling. You will have long streaks of wins, long streaks of losses, short streaks of each, and everything in between.

Only thing you need to know, ranking up isn't determined by wins, its determined by total rounds won, and individual performance (Which doesn't happen without teamwork). If your teams are shit, but you're doing well. You won't lose much elo for the loss. 

If you lose a game, try to give them a real fucking fight and make it 14-16, not 7-16.

If you win, try to absolutely crush the souls of your opponents and win 16-0, not 16-10.

As long as you have that mentality, and your individual score reflects it, you're doing good even if your team is losing.

It seemed as if your food level depleted rather quickly, causing you to need to hunt quite often.
Also, unless I missed something, it seems like you only have the number of inventory slots that are available to you in your hot bar.  While gathering lumber and rocks was rather easy, you couldn't stockpile to craft whenever you wanted to.

To some extent, your hormones and neurochemicals will be in turmoil ... you will have to exercise PMA and willpower. It's a limited resource, so save it and restore it whenever possible

Avoiding temptation and minimising risk can't be overstated. Socialising with addicts exposes your body and your self to temptation. There's this idea that we're masters of own own selves, and it's sort of true, but this doesn't translate as being directly in charge of our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes not even our actions. Much of society would cease to function if this were accepted, but think about it for a moment and it's obviously the case ... the point being : you have to manage your risk of relapse.

I could manage your risk but you probably couldn't afford me. So could you parents, but  again, you probably can't afford it. The cheapest option is to manage it yourself. This idea that 'only the addict can *cure* themselves' comes from this ... but actually it's just a question of cost. 

Can you socialise with users and manage your own weaknesses? Maybe ... but it's relying on luck, and eventually the addict's luck runs out. Don't fuck about with your sobriety. I myself would stop socialising with drug use

Have faith that you can manage your addiction! And practice this faith! Also practice faith thaleaves worth this temporary difficulty

Other more tangible actions - dai!y exercise if poss, plenty of sleep, good unprocessed food, fibre a d lots of water, minimise caffeine, work at getting your grades up .... and, ultimately, time. It'll take *months* for you to recover, and you may *always* be prone to this (you're only human, after-all, and addiction is part of the human condition)

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","&gt; The untruth could be anything - but George would not have given us this passage without the means to solve the mystery.

But apparently he did because there's no reason for a reader to consider that the waif might come from Westeros.  On the contrary GRRM presents her as not being from there while giving us no reason to believe that she is.

Your attempt to address that she's apparently not from Westeros in the books is to rely on something plausible being not believable (yes - it's plausible that she's never learned Westerosi - entirely plausible) and something from the show - the same show where the Lannisters' mines have dried up and where Meryn is a saddist pedophile?  You can't rely on the show to solve book mysteries when it contradicts the books.  The waif doesn't say she is from Westeros, Arya never notes any accent, and she does get training in the language from Arya which is a pointless waste of time if she knows the language like a native speaker would.


&gt; We do know, however, that Roose has a thing for common women:

No, your interpretation of that passage is just wrong.  He fancied this woman who was pretty in a way that isn't rare or special or exceptional.  It's a not a reference to her blood or birth - it's a reference to her particular look - pretty as is not uncommon for young women her age but she's not a great rare beauty.

&gt; However, the Waif's stepmother clearly believed the Waif was next in line to inherit, despite being a girl. If the stepmother's child was a boy, it means the Waif came from either the North or Dorne.

No, it doesn't.  I don't know how they do it in Braavos but in the North daughter Bolton would come after a Bolton son the same way Sansa is after Bran and Rickon in the Winterfell succession.

As for your attempt to address this:

&gt; There is an obscure point of Northern law that applies in this case, introduced to us by Roose Bolton himself. If a girl is the primary living heir of a house in the North, anyone who marries her can claim her lands and wealth.

I don't think that's obscure at all - I think that is probably the general rule, but here is the thing - the primary heir of a Lord in his own right is that Lord's eldest son if he has one - Roose's alleged daughter can't inherit the Dreadfort ahead of a true born son.  She just can't.

And that is what the waif says - she says the step mother does this that her blood may inherit not ""to ward off a long shot risk that would probably never eventuate"" like the edge case you present that occurs in the middle of war and is apparently an attempted coup rather than the result of some obscure Northern law as you present.



&gt; Arya knows Roose Bolton and his penchant for hunting hounds well 

How and since when?

&gt; The Waif calls Arya out for thinking like a Stark - right when Arya is contemplating the rivalry between the Starks and the Boltons

I don't believe so. I believe she slaps her for showing that she's thinking like Ayra Stark by employing a mannerism that belongs to Arya Stark (chewing her lip) and I believe that rather than Stark and Bolton rivalry she's thinking of a more personal adversary called Weese and how Weese's dog up and attacked him after she gave Weese's name to Jaqan, and specifically how Weese's dog suddenly went all crazy as if someone had dosed with Basilisk venom.",1462061053

I drove my Realtor, Lawyer, and Mortgage Broker crazy (and I google'd and researched every little thing on top of that). I'm a Project Manager for work managing multi million dollar accounts. I ask questions for a living basically.

I had a Small Business class where a Professor gave a great piece of advise that applies to EVERYTHING in life; ask for what you want. The worst thing someone can say is no. So ask them why they need a second appraisal and then state, ""OK, that makes sense. So the bank will be paying for that, correct?""",1462061054

That's the point.  Eliminating most deductions affects more than just the wealthy. Would that not cause the wealthy to end up spending more in taxes than you and I because of the same scale you speak of? 


&gt;There really aren't as many loopholes as people think too.

I went from a single chamber ""safe"" design I found on the IC2 forums shielded with reinforced stone, to what so far has been safe enough that I dont even use the reinforced stone (been hacking away the room to use the blocks in recipes). It is a 6 chamber one of my own design (there are likely better, but this one I came up with myself). It uses 27 single rods and generates no extra heat (keys to safe automation), the rods can be safely removed/replaced while running (be sure it's off when setting up the filter on pipes though): http://imgur.com/gnn1ZDh

It aint the best one out there, but I mainly wanted it for spent rods to centrifuge for the plutonium, and for it to be 100% safe.

http://imgur.com/Td9WHqq

Weird idea that people seek to steal the paws off of the Monkey Kings (Unless the current Monkey King is immortal or if there's only one ever in existence, wasn't sure). Would work like most monkey paws in that the person makes the wish (Gold, information, follower, treasure, etc.) then rolls. Whatever they roll the GM decides on how to grant the wish. 

Ask for a follower but rolled low? Bam, you just got yourself a stalker that follows from afar. 
You want treasure? Bam, it's stolen from your teammate and is now permanently bound to you. (Cursed item created.)

Just weird things to happen depending on the roll and whatever the GM feels like interpreting what is asked for.

Edit: I also made it consumable assuming the fact it is on it's last wish. I didn't want to make it reusable nonstop since it can be a bit OP to use it to spam wishes.",1462061060

Rivers are symbolic of many things, but perhaps mainly change, emotions of all kinds, and perhaps being likely to go with the flow. Forests are symbolic of the unknown/unconscious and transformation of those who enter. These don't seem to be mutually exclusive, but perhaps leaning towards one more than the other says something about a person's personality.

I know this is very tenuous, but the symbolism of rivers vs forests is something everyone can understand. It's part of all cultures. I'd be interested in understanding her interpretations for each symbol and how they relate to each house of course.",1462061062

In brief, we have been dealing more and more with issues such as GMOs, nuclear energy, budgeting for research and so on. Overall I think the current Congress has done an okay job at handling these issues (especially with regards to energy) but the fact that we even have GMO labeling bills or anti-cloning legislation going up for consideration is bad news in my book. 

I also want to shape free trade agreements with optimal oversight, reform immigration policies to streamline the process, and secure civil liberties for American citizens. On this last point, this includes ensuring gun ownership rights are defended, that censorship is combated, and that unnecessary surveillance efforts which target American citizens are curbed. 

As for my district, I believe one major issue we need to tackle is the radicalized left in the Northeast. I have seen a nightmare scenario unfolding with the rise of the communists in the wake of many socialists losing power. The ideology is toxic to New England and the Atlantic Commonwealth at large. We need strong representatives both at the state and federal level to stop the tides of radicalization.

&gt; &amp;quot;No one who reports issues is safe at TSA,&amp;quot; Mr. Livingston added, saying that employees are less likely to tell supervisors about security problems out of fear of retaliation - a chain of intimidation that runs through the agency.

&gt; House Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah reported that &amp;quot;Many airports are complaining that TSA is getting worse, not better,&amp;quot; and said that more than 100 of the agency&amp;#039;s screeners quit their jobs weekly.

&gt; All three witnesses agreed that the TSA&amp;#039;s new director, Peter Neffenger, is making progress in righting the wrongs of previous TSA leaders, although they said more turnover was needed in the administration.

The Appellant requires 2 head/1 body to kill, LitC changes that to 1 head/2 body. You won't 2 shot with it, ever. Well, maybe LitC + weapons bubble could, though you may still need a tether or sunbreaker melee.  

For the fusions, my personal preference is the Hitchhiker FR4 from Dead Orbit. It's a very slow charging fusion, so pre charging is your best friend, and it kills with 4 bolts on everything but ramlocks and strikers w/max armor, respectively. They will both take 5.  

I really want to like the Omolon handcannons. I really do. I've got the Uffern with Outlaw/Rifled/Third Eye and it's a killer roll, but I can't get over the sound/visuals. They just feel like waterguns.  

Your best bet for snipers, however, is vanguard/crucible packages. Pulled a god-rolled Longbow (Longview SLR10 or Ambush/Eye of the Storm/Quickdraw/Unflinching) from a crucible package, that and vanguard are the only ways to get the Y1 31 impact snipers.

Nuclear is by far the safest current form of power generation. It's also quite 'clean' and if we invested in breeders the waste would be practically nonexistent.

"sooners","t5_2r5kj","Eh, I guess I'm one of the few that qualify for this post. I think there've only been a few I.E./Pre-Meds, at least that I know about, we're talking less than 10 ever. My view of the program is pretty neutral. The IE office doesn't know a whole lot about the pre-med prerequisites, just what they are. How you fit them into your schedule is completely up to you but the guideline they have isn't bad. The advisors you have wont know anything about medical school, so knowing what it takes to apply and get in is on you. (MCAT, volunteering, research, etc.) check out/google the Student Doctor Network (SDN).

My opinion, get most of the hard classes out of the way Freshman/Sophomore year (Chemistry: Ochem 1/2, Biochem). Most of the biology classes you'll look at taking are memorization based and not that difficult and you could take them at the same time as I.E. Classes with little difficulty. The hard IE classes are mostly junior year in my opinion, but it depends on what you take. I would load it front heavy with a single bio/chem/math/physics class every semester so you have a science gpa every year for your med applications. Hopefully you know that medical schools track your overall gpa and science gpa by year so it's necessary to take at least 1 science (bio/math/chem/physics) every year to have a Sgpa.  

Classes with labs are super difficult to take later on as I.E. Usually has 1 section of upper division classes per year (that's right, it's a year between sections, I.E. is that small).

The program as a whole is not really that difficult, it's doable, just be prepared for your friends to be taking blow off classes while you're taking upper division bio/chem classes. ",1462061068

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; He's gonna have a hard time of it. She's about as defined as a public figure can possibly be.

To expand on this, when you run for office you face scrutiny like never before. The higher the office, the greater the scrutiny. She ran for senate, then ran for president as the presumptive nominee, then had 8 years to plan her next run. Clinton has been under the microscope for at least 8-15 years.

Conversely, Trump's only serious scrutiny was from colleagues in the business community for most of his life, and they didn't benefit from publicizing their findings. He's only been a candidate for 9-months, and wasn't taken seriously by most outlets until the last month or so, and he still isn't even the nominee.

Once he's the nominee, anything can happen. Every statement and business transaction since forever is up for discussion, not to mention every ex-girlfriend, evicted tenant, jilted business partner, screwed investor or snubbed doorman is going to be looking for a payday selling their story.

I assume you've lived a normal, average life, much as I have. I'm a suburban dad and would pass a background check in a minute... but if I ran for president? That guy I bought ecstasy from in college would be looking for a payday. That one night stand I had when I was 25 would be in play. The boss who fired me at 17 from the burger place.

I'm not saying it's fair, but it's all in play. The difference between Clinton and Trump is that we have a much better idea what her skeletons are, and we have virtually no idea what Trump's got hidden.

Considering his playboy life in the 80s and 90s, I'd be very surprised if we don't hear some stories between now and the election he'd wish to high heaven weren't true.",1462061068

And these relegation canditates turn into monsters every year in the Super Lig in the last few weeks. Also see Akhisar's form, have won just once in their last nine matches. If Akhisar win 3 out of their last 4 matches I believe they could make it to the Europa League (the 5th spot goes to qualifications). So that's kind of a motivation maybe for them.

I'm good at problem solving at night, but better at reading conceptual stuff during the day. You can't force yourself to do something productively when you and the frequency of what you're learning are not in sync. 

Also, plan fun sh*t during the weekend so it motivates you to be productive during the week. Almost like setting a deadline to stop working, drop everything, and have fun. 

Good luck. PM me if you have any questions.. ",1462061070

Everyone in this post so far's attitude has been do whatever the heck you want there's plenty to do, none of you seem to have yet accepted the fact that the April update doesn't have much new content. But it does give us a lot of new ways to play, and it is with that in mind that my post was made. Perhaps you guys need to sit on the April update a while longer before you are able to have this conversation.

"YouShouldKnow","t5_2r94o","The process is called dark adaptation by rhodopsin bleaching. After the photopigment is bleached (exposed to light), it needs to reset and rod cells (night vision) take a bit longer than cone cells to regenerate their pigments.  

There are also other higher level processes like ganglion cell inhibition and other things by nerve control. Cognitive factors might make perception alternate between the bright eye and the dark eye such that you can only see the dark stimulus or the bright stimulus, but not both (binocular rivalry). But those are all perfectly normal responses.  

If you actually check yourself in the mirror after closing one eye, you'll notice that both eyes are equally dilated, but it's tricky because your eyes dilate so fast and you can't really see the mirror in the dark. You could also try having someone shine a light in one eye and have them check the other eye for the pupillary light reflex, like how emergency responders do.  

I always do it so that I can see in the dark. It is also the purpose of an eye patch back in the day so captains could see below deck.

This one is a little long, and I created it before checkpoints were added as a feature, so true platforming skills are a must if you hope to make it to the top!

I don't really care anymore, most of the people I know stopped playing this game and I did too. I am a solo player, and if you restrict me from doing anything solo I'm quitting.

It exhibits a lot of patterns of a conduction vaporizer in that it has a set time and temperature - most convection vapes are on demand and cache a bowl faster than conduction, so they don't usually have a timer.  There is logically a conduction element because the bowl is surrounded by a heater that gets the glass quite hot as well as the bottom being directly on the heater.  I'd say there is a bit of convection because of the even AVB and I just don't know if there's enough heat to get to the middle and I never had to stir mine for even extraction.

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","1. Foaming cleansers can be too drying for dry skin. Try a gel cleanser instead. 

2. One of my favorite hydrating toners. Totally recommend!

3. The WPE is a first essence (helps brighten skin and hydrates) while the Snail Mucin is a regular snail-y hydrating essence. First essences go before your hydrating toner if you plan on getting the WPE. Both are fine choices but essences aren't your priority right now. 

4. The Mizon AIO is way too light for even oily skin. Do not recommend as your sole moisturizer. The Rosette Ceramide Gel is good for oily/combo but will probably be too light for you. I say keep searching for a heavier one.

5. I say you should go for the former as it's a moisturizing sunscreen vs.the  Biore Essence which can even be drying for some.

6. First cleanser needed to remove sunscreen. Make sure you add one!

I picked him and held him without realizing the extent of his injuries. He is pretty tough so when he didn't calm down right away I pulled him away to look at him and his face was covered in blood. We went to the ER where they took X-rays and determined there was no bone damage and the teeth would probably heal back on their own, but not before taking notice of the previously mentioned black eye and half jokingly half seriously asking, ""I don't need to call CPS do I?""

And, with /u/linkprovider's idea of an L, it occured to me that the mounting block doesn't actually need to mount to the door. It can simply rest in a cradle that's mounted to the door.  Then, if all hell breaks loose, I can just lift it out and have the door open in a tenth of a second.

I *did* consider a linear actuator but, I decided that my dog is exactly stupid enough to find a way to get cut in half. At least with the screw drive, it'll be slow enough that she can probably get out of the way.

Do you wanna learn following a syllabus and in a structured learning environment, or would you rather learn in a more relaxed environment. Do research on schools around your area. When you find one that catches your eye, call them and ask for an appointment so they can debrief you on information about the school/ prices / learning environment/ etc. You can also do a intro flight with them to get a feel for the school and the helicopter to see if it's what you truly want to do.

sayonara-bye (sayo, as he's nicknamed,) was a Korean player who once held #1 global. He used to stream at www.twitch.tv/jungjushee but eventually had to stop playing because South Korea auto-enlists you in the army, and it was his time to go. He had EXTREMELY formidable speed/bursting ability and to this day many of the top 50 would have trouble managing the same scores he has, some which exceed a whopping 300bpm. He does however, come back to play every now and then. He left around February-March 2015, if I recall correctly, which is not long after WubWoofWolf reobtained #1 global.

Some of his scores include Colorful Days +DoubleTime, Shotgun Senorita +DoubleTime, S.M.L +DoubleTime (which is harder than it looks), and quite a few more.

Oh, also, you know Gimme Gimme Gimme? Yeah, he was one of the first couple of people to Hidden+DoubleTime it, if I recall.

EDIT: Oh yeah, suppose I should mention his setup, in case you need some convincing that yours is perfectly capable. (I don't mean this in a rude sense, but when players get inconsistent/depressed they tend to blame their setup, so, for reference....)

He played using a Wacom Graphite tablet (I thiiink the same one that hvick225 had until around the beginning of march 2016,) and a dell laptop. At the beginning, he didn't even have an external keyboard. He just went at it with the laptop's keys and a (fairly) dated tablet at the time (3-5 years old). He eventually got an external MX Switch USB Keypad, but there were never any upgrades besides that.

Sooo yeah, if you ever feel that your setup is inadequate, just look at sayo's and prepare to feel humbled/amused/what have you.

LT | LT | C | RG | RT
---|---|----|----|----
Ereck Flowers| Justin Pugh | Weston Richburg | Bobby Hart | Marshall Newhouse

This seems like the best lineup, now if they can get Davis from SF out of retirement just sub him in place of Newhouse. Either way, Newhouse was a liability yes, but with Perkins/Jennings/Vereen we have 3 really good pass blocking RBs that can help Newhouse with outside speed rushers. The rest of this oline is stout. 

**IF** Ereck Flowers develops and takes that big step this year though? We'll have one of the best left sides in the NFL. And all three of them will be under 25. Which is amazing. Ideally we're able to keep this unit together so whenever we do have Eli retire, our new QB will have a good stout veteran line to develop behind.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","While that is a very informative and detailed answer, one qualifier I'd add (that seems to be missing) is the timing of American aid.  Most of the aid was very heavily weighted towards the latter half of the war (1943+). That's understandable. It took time to ramp up wartime production and, obviously, there was a significant delay between goods rolling off the production lines in American factories and those goods reaching the front in Eastern Europe. Thus, very little of it made to front before the critical Battle of Moscow which ended Operation Barbarossa. It would be fair to say that for nearly a year, the Soviets faced the Nazis mostly on their own. And even as late as the Battle of Stalingrad, only about 20% of the total L-L goods had reached the Soviet Union (if my memory serves me right). 

I don't want to minimize the gargantuan effort that it took to drive the Nazi back, from the Volga to Berlin. And the American aid was critical to making that happen. But it is also true that the Soviets were able to halt and even push back against the Germans before the bulk of that aid had time to arrive. ",1462061092

Als je het er zelf niet voor over hebt, blijf dan vooral lekker thuis. ""De horeca is al prijzig""; ja, no shit, kut. Enig idee hoeveel werk en kosten erbij komen kijken om jou een lekker biertje voor te zetten? Natuurlijk kost dat veel meer ""dan in de supermarkt"". Er komt zó veel meer bij kijken dan de meeste mensen zich realiseren.

""ik geef alleen fooi als de service uitstekend was"" wordt er vaak geroepen. Het is helaas zo dat de gast steeds meer (belachelijke) dingen verwacht en het volkomen normaal acht dat deze wensen worden vervuld. Nee, natuurlijk is het geen enkel probleem als u zonder te vragen een aantal tafels aan elkaar schuift, stoelen bij andere tafels weghaalt (waardoor hier dus niemand meer kan zitten (dus geen omzet)) terwijl wij ook prima tafels hebben voor groepen. Tuurlijk krijgt u lekker veel koekjes bij de koffie, die krijgen wij immers ook gratis, niet? Neehoor, het is helemáál niet lastig dat u pas aangeeft een decaf cappucino te willen wanneer uw cappucina al op tafel staat, túúrlijk zetten wij die opnieuw!

Being robbed does not qualify. If you are being robbed and fight back (unwise!), it does not qualify unless things escalate to a point you believe you will die or be greatly physically harmed.

I love the gameplay itself,the mechanics and the way challenge modes outside of the Incursion are laid out.
Fixes That Need to happen:
1. Gear dropped from Dark zone enemies should match their levels. Seriously....163 gear is worthless to anyone other than a new 30
2. Rogue system needs a tweak or 3. If your team is rogue and within 5 meters of you then you should also be rogue. Level 1 timers should be yellow instead of red to indicate a POSSIBLE accidental misshooting. Level of Rogue should also increase XP loss and DZ fund loss through tiered system.
3. PVE loot and map areas should also have more replayability through world bosses and events similar to supply drops ...not saying 240 loot should drop but maybe up to 214 - 182 level loot.
4. NPC difficulty in Incursion and some challenge modes: Shotgunner snipers and instadeath is NOT fun. Testing this with gear levels as the OP stated should be done to ensure it is possible. This isn't Dark Souls ..... unrealistic difficulty does not equal fun.",1462061097

"startups","t5_2qh26","Hey there! I used to work with another subscription box company as their whole marketing department. I went through your web presence and here's a bit of feedback

1. It took way too many clicks to get through your signup process. Each page averaged one decision per page, and I got to think about how much money I would be spending every time I clicked. This is no bueno, you're giving your customers a ton of time to change their minds.

2. It looks like you've kind of given up on social media. Honestly, this is a mistake. You have a niche product that has a really solid chance at creating a good community. You need to be taking the time to find good articles about self-care for psoriasis, and posting those two to three times a week. Even if you never run advertising, this is a cheap/free way to get yourself in front of some eyeballs.

3. A few of the things you've mentioned can be tackinged by [CrateJoy](https://www.cratejoy.com/). I've heard some good things about them, but do not have personal experience working with the platform.

4. You have literally thousands of Instagram followers and are posting less than once a week.

You are turning a profit, however small, with only 23 subscribers. How many do you need to be where you want to be? How much did it cost you to acquire those 23?

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Either way, we win. But we win more ""minds and souls"" going against Hillary. Because then the Sanders camp will be open minded (as much as they could be) to Trump. If it was Sanders Vs Trump, the Sanders supporters would never be able to support Trump, they would always be sore.

As much as I disagree with Sanders on virtually everything, at least he sees the problems. Trump and Sanders are very much identifying the same issues... But Trump has the correct approach, treating the root cause whereas Sanders wants to treat the symptoms. Sanders should beat Hillary, but he won't. This is unfortunate for the current state of the U.S. but better in the long run.

Of the LEGAL U.S. citizens who supported Bernie, I estimate up to 70% will learn to love Trump. Many will be dyed in the wool commies, but once the see Trumpian results... They will understand. I've spoken to a few, and they all at least respect Trump on a basic level. They do not respect Cruz. Or Hillary. Or anyone else. The Bern bros will come around.. Many are now.

Personally, as much as I think Bernie should win the democrat nom., I want Hillery to get it. She deserves it more than just about anyone.

People of Aionos tells the story of the Empire of Aionos and more importantly, it’s people, as they go through the 3rd Aionosian civil war. From six different point of views, the player will experience, participate and live in the most crucial conflict for this once great Republic.

Great editing is invisible and here I share nine different editing techniques to help shape an actor's performance.

THIS GUY EDITS is a youtube channel by film editor Sven Pape, an A.C.E. award nominee, whose credits include work for directors James Cameron, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and James Franco.

Sven cuts his latest film on FCPx for Sundance filmmaker Mark Webber. “Flesh &amp; Blood” is their third collaboration. 

Several times a week THIS GUY EDITS (T.G.E.) will post update videos. You get to see the timeline and the editor's play-by-play-commentary as he cuts scenes. It shows work in progress.

THIS GUY EDITS is not about how to run a piece of software, but rather how to tell stories creatively. 

For example T.G.E. puts Walter Murch’s theory of “The Blink of an Eye” to the test. Another segment reveals editing tips on how to dramatically get into and out of scene. A future episode includes David Mamet’s philosophy on scene writing as it applies to editing.

So I researched the crap out of it to see if the benefits I kept seeing everywhere had any merits and finally decided to buy some. I took it every day and last month, BAM, the spelling changed to turmeric from tumeric. We have had the exact same personal ME, I'm excited by that! I'm not alone. LOL

It seems like they're possibly building the legends up to 'put over' another star eventually--like they feel like the legends need to be on TV kicking someone's ass despite being retired so they can later be demolished by some heel/face and give that heel/face extra credibility.

For example, if I remember right, Shawn Michaels would come back every once in a while and do things like superkick Del Rio and leave--and it pissed me off when that happened, quite frankly. But Shawn has also come back later and gotten his arm broken by Brock Lesnar, turned heel on Daniel Bryan and gotten demolished by Bryan. Perhaps it's the same logic that goes into a veteran winning a match so he can later lose a match and put over another talent when it's needed later.

Or, as usual, I could be looking too much into it.

I think Steve Austin, on the other hand, just comes back and Stunners people. That might have something to do with spikes in merchandise sales or flat-out nostalgia, but who knows what might happen in the future? I like that Baron Corbin idea /u/8each8oys suggested.",1462061111

"MawInstallation","t5_32f60","Agreed.

It's not unreasonable to believe that any/all the specific Jedi deaths shown on screen would have happened, and many more like them. But given how incredibly powerful the Jedi are shown to be, it seems inevitable that a non-negligible chunk of them would have survived, especially since the clones went straight into Jedi Killin' Mode and attacked without any mind for tactics. 

On Kashyyyk, for example, Commander Gree seemed to be under the impression that the most sensible approach to killing the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy was to sneak up behind him with one other trooper as backup. (Contrast that with the preparation by the 501st and 212th before confronting Pong Krell under ostensibly similar circumstances, or the multilayered deception used by the clones in *Brain Invaders*, and the behavior of these order 66 clones begins to look decidedly fishy.) It seems that any Jedi not immediately in the line of fire or trapped aboard a cruiser would have a pretty solid chance at surviving the initial assault, and their odds of escape would only get better from there.

If you're not that handy I do recommend professionally installed blackout curtains. I also recommend external ""rolling shutters"" for complete blocking of light or external ""solar screens"". Not only will this block all or most of the light depending on your choice, it also blocks out the heat. 

Which brings me to my next suggestion; an air conditioner in your bedroom. There are many options but you will sleep better under those warm blankets when its cold in your room. It will also create background noise that will drown out most other noise.

I have had great luck with ear plugs although they can sometimes be uncomfortable. When I put in ear plugs it is like my brain flips a switch and I'm out: but it took a while to achieve.

The tin foil suggestion is good too. I have used tinfoil throughout my time as a traveler. It can create some noise sometimes but not much and it will eventually get small pin holes in it. Packing tape works very well to keep it up and secure. I have melted a few blinds covering up the window with tinfoil but eh, they don't cost that much. A rolled up towel at the bottom of the door can help too.

The reason our infrastructure is crumbling is not because of a lack of available funds. The state gov is awash in tax money but they blow it on other shit. One of the primary purposes of a state gov is infrastructure. They need to stop spending on bullshit like the crony train and spend it on fixing bridges and other essentials. I have friends who are engineers that refuse to drive certain bridges because our state gov spends the money on coke and hookers instead. Spending must go down or saving the money we lose to illegal immigration will mean nothing.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","&gt;I officiated over a company of Latter-day Saints as they received an endowment from on high. Watching over the company, I saw soft tears in some eyes, and heard gentle sniffles in the room. My own eyes moistened more than once. I noticed many smiles as each member of the company, one by one, conversed with the Lord through the veil.
&gt;
&gt;This was the peak of holiness for me and several others. We were away from the world, learning about God's plan of salvation for his children, and making sacred covenants. We were making eternal bonds with dear ones away. We were in the house and presence of the Lord.

This is what I read into what he was saying. In the next part he says what you are saying:

&gt;That's why I'm deeply sad that in your anger you felt you were justified to degrade the sacredness of the tokens of the priesthood. The rites of the temple are dear to the hearts of millions of Latter-day Saints, including my own. To see them profaned before the world was wounding.

This is what I felt he was saying in his writing, much in the same way that he feels Tyler profaned (ha!) the temple secrets, which is speculation so far, and I don't see it in his video either. It may well be that Tyler showed the sure sign of the nail but until he comes out and says that, it's nothing more than speculation.

"ludology","t5_2s9y2","I'd argue that grinding is very subjective, and also very hard to actually pin down. People call things ""grindy"" when, in their opinion, they have to repeat the same gameplay loop too many times; however, another person might not think the same way for various reasons, whether they like the loop itself and would be content repeating it much longer, or they found the level of repetition was sufficient, or maybe they enjoyed the mindless aspect of the loop. After all, a lot of people play games like Cookie Clicker, which are basically grinding without the promise of improvement in other non-related gameplay.

Not that that can't be a good answer, this is an opinion thread after all. But I think people tend to assume that games they consider grindy are universally bad for every player, which is a bias we need to keep in mind.

"dancarlin","t5_2rkab","The car was a lemon to begin with, and we cracked the cylinder head somewhere between Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.  Before that, we were running for 5 days through the Pamir Highway with multiple oil leaks and a broken starter.  The Pamir Highway is the second highest elevation road in the world, and extremely remote - on our 5 day drive, we encounted only two villages with electricity.  We literally would flag down every single person we saw on the road and ask to buy ""masla"" off of them (oil).  We would buy random dirty oil in soda bottles and just pour it in, because it was better than nothing. It would just leak out on to the ground anyway.

After the cylinder head cracked, we were running on only three cylinders (top speed about 30mph)... in Mongolia there are no real roads (just dirt tracks), so we were literally offroading in a budget Fiat, with only about 6"" of clearance, and the power of a riding lawnmower.  

So suffice to say, lots of breakdowns.  

Perfect situation for an adventure!

For his sake, I think you should still try having sex with him despite your frustration, because frustrating him doesn't help either of you, but at the same time he really needs to hear you out and take to heart what you need from him.

Still, you may never really orgasm with him even if he tries harder.  You may still need to masturbate, but that's probably more common than we know.  He then needs to understand that you need to do that because your needs aren't being met.

I know a couple with a hot woman that craves tons of sex but her husband has low testosterone and is rarely up for it.  So, she needs a release and got a vibrator.

Let's do a Celtic Cross spread. I need to try out some of the bigger spreads anyway, and I have a bit more spare time. (I mean, really, I feel lame, doing spreads on a Saturday night, but last night was gnarly enough for anyone :P)

**Overall climate/situation:** The Sun. Whew, let's start this off with a bang! The Tarot's got a couple exclamation marks for you. This card indicates a very powerful surge of creative, assertive, almost arrogant energy in your area of expertise. We're channeling Apollo here.

**The primary obstacle**: 4 of pentacles. Hoarding of resources and opportunities; a reluctance to make mistakes. Dude, you can't move *forward* if you're so anxious to take risks. Gotta crack a few eggs to make a cake.

**The root of the question**: 7 of cups. Many alluring options are presenting themselves to you, which makes you uncertain of which way to go. Some will be magic; others lead to veiled pit traps.

**Past**: 2 of cups. There was a professional opportunity that felt like a ""match made in heaven,"" and you dedicated yourself to it with the intent for the long-haul--or as part of a long-term plan.

**Present**: Queen of coins. You're sitting pretty and comfortable--or if not comfortable, you're at least it's the ""devil you know."" But it's not the best you can do. (The Queen is second to her King.)

**Future:** The Chariot. You see this decision approaching on the horizon, and it's an all-or-nothing moment. You have to pursue your choice with all your heart, and not look back--or it won't succeed as you need it to.

**What you think about the situation**: 9 of swords. You're stuck in a state of paranoid planning, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It causes paralysis of action and of thought, impeding your ability to perform and act.

**What others think of the situation**: Alas! Others look at your situation, and their head spins. You're the ultimate juggler to them, balancing more pros and cons and obligations than they could possibly manage. However, there's a mastery implied here that shades this card toward the positive. While *they* couldn't do it, they think *you* can do it--and with style. 

**Your hopes and fears of the situation**: 10 of coins. That's... fairly self-explanatory. You hope that you'll find financial success and personal stability, but what worries me is that this is a *hope*--not a confident certainty.

**Most likely outcome, should things continue as they are**: 7 of coins. Ah. So this means wise planning, stability, and steady movement toward a goal. Whatever you'll pick, you'll pursue it wisely and well.

Mainly? If you want wellbeing, stop doubting yourself. You are competent at what you do; everyone else thinks you are, too.  Dedicate yourself to the path that you want--that you secretly know that you're good at--and screw the uncertainty. GO. ",1462061127

Naturally, only you can tell what'd make you the happiest, but it sounds a lot like you don't conform to the feminine stereotype - and that doesn't automatically make you a man unless you want to be one. Maybe try thinking about how far you'd want to transition if you did, first. Would you want top surgery? Bottom surgery? HRT? Then think about why you want them, if any: What results do you hope for? How do you think transitioning will help you mentally? Socially?

If you're very conflicted, you could also shop around for therapists in your area who are sensitive to gender issues. A therapist would also have the additional benefits of, should you decide to transition, helping you along as you come out to your family and can give you an official diagnosis.",1462061127

She's a photographer, and luckily had her good camera on her.  4 hours later, my face hurts from grinning so hard and she had 2 job offers.

Reading this back, it sounds like such bullshit... but it happened.  Artegon Mall in Orlando.  Friggin break dancing.  It was amazing.",1462061128

Why didn't I talk about how my husband knew about the luncheon, but his wife didn't, and I lightly chewed his ass out for being deceitful to her? I rationalized it was because I didn't want to paint him like some kind of mustache-twirling panty demon. Why was I so defensive about his behavior. I am considering my inner thoughts within the context of your constructive (thank you, by the way) criticism. 

The two sentences that really had me thinking were my bafflement, and the fixation on his emotions. You're absolutely right, baffled is the perfect term for how I felt. I never really thought about what it meant that I was confused on a subject that should have been very clear to me at the time. I would love your thoughts and help on that one, since you're clearly seeing things that I should be seeing here. I remember during this time I approached him with a project I wanted his opinion on, and he looked at me and harshly stated ""I have an opening between appointments at 10:30 and 11:00 tomorrow."" It was such a different reaction than normal, I remember wondering if I presented myself as though I expected him to drop everything and help me. I responded with ""No, if you're that busy, don't worry about it, I'll work it out on my own."" God, now that I see that in type I feel like an idiot. I'm an idiot, aren't I? Jesus. 

Fixated. Yeah, I can see that. Do I want him to still have feelings for me? Before this conversation, I would have answered ""no, of course not. I want to avoid that complication.""

We know it's silly to think life can only be like this. We don't even know what exactly life is. It gets confusing when you get down to the level of cells. We still don't know what kickstarted life on Earth. My personal ""theory"" is that it was not on Earth that life was started. It's just where it thrived. 

Scientists are aware other forms of life can exist. We are also aware that we may not even recognize life if we saw it. Think of a plant. Having never seen one before, you see one, study it. Is it alive?  It's organic, but it doesn't seem to move, doesn't react, can't move from it's spot in the ground. Looks more inanimate than anything when all you're used to is animals. ",1462061133

Because TV-ISPs like Comcast and AT&amp;T are losing money on their traditional TV services, they've decided to implement bandwidth limits and fees to recoup losses since people have found that it's more affordable to subscribe to several streaming services instead of traditional television (we know what happens when you stream, you use bandwidth) and the real problem is that most people have no other option for an ISP. Comcast makes one move (creates these additional fees) and AT&amp;T follows, people will pay the $30 and Comcast/AT&amp;T will laugh all the way to the bank.

The reason I call it a racket is because these ISPs have invented this problem (really it's their problem) and then created this $30 protection fee that you can pay each month to get them off your back.

tl;dr: None of these fees are necessary to run the internet portion of their business. They're implementing these additional consumer costs to recoup losses on their falling TV subscriptions.",1462061134

That, or you do the opposite and focus more on the politics and warfare, in which case you might as well play the AGoT mod for CK2.

But a Skyrim-esque game(first person, in-world exploration, character customization and interaction) with the warfare of ACoK and political intrigue of the AGoT mod? That'd be fantastic, but god knows how much that'd cost to develop and publish.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","""Science"" means a bunch of different things.

For instance, there is the abstract concept of discovering things about the material universe through making and testing hypotheses, exploring data, and so on. We could call this ""scientific method"". This is related to ideas such as empiricism and statistical hypothesis-testing.

But there are also the social institutions of science — such as university degree programs, research institutions, peer-reviewed journals, corporate R&amp;D departments, government funding agencies, and so on. We could call these ""institutional science"". The questions of who gets a Ph.D., or what research gets funded, are questions about institutional science.

Also there's the accumulated body of beliefs about the world that are taught as having been discovered through science. These change dramatically over time; sometimes old ideas are thoroughly debunked or reversed. We could call these ""mainstream science beliefs"". For instance, plate tectonics is a current mainstream science belief, but in the early 20th century it was not.

Finally there's the set of practices or behaviors that are believed to be based on scientific findings: technological practices, such as medicine or engineering; but also other cultural practices, such as ""healthy"" cooking. Also counted here are practices that come with the force of law, such as forensic science or criminal psychology. Since the term ""social science"" is already taken, we could maybe call these ""science-based social practices"".

----

Exactly which beliefs get taught as ""mainstream science beliefs"" varies widely, and people have different opinions on it, too. Some areas are highly contested, such as diet and nutrition. Some are subject to political denialism, such as evolution or climate change. Some things that are *taught* as scientific actually stem from misunderstandings or flawed experiments — such as the ""tongue map"" or the idea that spinach is unusually rich in iron. Some are just outdated, such as the planetary model of the atom which you'll still find in school chemistry textbooks.

What ""counts"" as science depends on which sense of the word you're working with. You don't need a Ph.D. to test lots of your beliefs about the world using the scientific method — but if you want to gain access to a particle collider to test your ideas about physics, the Ph.D. (and more) will be a huge help. Many experiments are expensive and require the help of dozens or hundreds of collaborators, assistants, technicians, support staff, and so on. Institutional science does have a lot of control over what research programs can be pursued, by whom, and when.

And when we get to the science-based social practices, it's a bit of a mess. Take forensic science for instance. Is fingerprint identification ""scientific""? How about DNA identification from a blood or semen sample? Penile plethysmography as a diagnosis of sexual deviance? Phrenology to determine psychopathic personality characteristics? A color change on a urine test for the presence of cocaine? The polygraph? Whether these  investigative techniques are taken as being good evidence in a courtroom has depended on whether they are believed to be scientifically supported ... and *who* believes them to be scientifically supported or not; notably, law enforcement agencies, judges, and legislators.",1462061135

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","With practiced strides, Garrick silently scaled the mossy wooden steps, reaching the balcony in five seconds flat. I followed his example, but to a chorus of creaks. He scowled. ""Move quicker. You'll make more noise lingering on each step than you will if you stumble on the last.""

Garrick handed me the pick, and I tried to jimmy the lock open. The hair on my neck stood on end as the door rattled from my effort. After three seconds, he snatched the pick away from me. ""Do it slower! If we didn't care about making a racket, we'd have just broken down the door already."" He attacked the lock, and before I could blink, it had yielded with a small click. Garrick pocketed it, swung open the door, and snuck into the house.

So maybe I wasn't cut out for the recon or the prep or the break-ins. This was my moment, though. This part I could do, if only we'd ever reach it. The hallway stretched to eternity as we crept through it. Follow Garrick, no noise, no sudden movements. Remember the three steps. 

*Step 1: Perform the hit*

The door to the bedroom was ajar, which was good, because I wasn't sure if we were supposed to barge in or not. As we slipped through the crack, I withdrew my pistol. The target lied buried beneath a mound of blankets, stationary, save for the periodic ebbs and flows induced by its snoring. I darted past Garrick, standing over the bed to get a clear shot. No face was visible: only blankets. The target's heartbeat accelerated at my approach: did it sense its impending death?

BANG. The mound leapt backwards in the bed. Smoke rose from the bed, signaling the location my missed shot. From under the sheets emerged a half-awake face that immediately turned into a half-panicked face, which then turned into a fully panicked one. ""What do you want? I'll give you anything! Please, just-""

BANG. My second shot hit him in the chest this time, and he slumped off the bed. Okay, that did not go according to plan, but at least I finished the job. Garrick nodded silently from his position in the doorway. I turned back to the body.

*Step 2: Make your mark*

""All artists crave recognition,"" he had said, ""and we are no exception. Leave your signature on all of your pieces. The glory is worth the risk; you will certainly live to regret it otherwise.""

I dipped my finger into the blood now pooling around the corpse and hoisted myself onto the bed with my other hand. Above the headboard, I scrawled the tag I had come up with on the white wall. It was a backwards capitalized ""G"" with a smaller ""X"" resting within the inner curve. My tribute to Garrick, my ever-patient mentor. Hopefully the reference would not be lost on him.

*Step 3: No witnesses*

And with that, it was done. Unbelievable. It was certainly not the cleanest of missions, but for my first, I was overall satisfied with it. I walked up to Garrick and prepared to step out, but he held out a gloved hand to stop me. ""Aren't you forgetting something?""

He looked at me expectantly, and I searched his eyes for a cue but found none. Garrick sighed and pulled out his own gun. ""Clear your tracks. Get rid of anything or anyone that could link back to you."" For a second, the barrel was trained on me, but Garrick passed it over my shoulder and pointed at something behind me.

Turning around, I saw a pair of gleaming eyes from a carrier beneath the nightstand. My ears were still ringing, but if I focused hard enough, I could hear the sound of faint mewling coming from it. I exhaled.

""Do we really have to kill the little guy? He doesn't actually count as a witness, does he?""

"writing","t5_2qh2n","What a refreshing post. A couple other places, I have been doubtful about the ""lessons"" people are always giving. I feel that I'm at a point where I understand the basics enough to wonder when, where, and how to bend or break them. It feels like this subreddit is fanatical about making people decent writers, but there's rarely talk about innovating things into something new and taking creativity to the next level.

I have like so many ideas that have been bottled up, waiting for a post like this one. I probably should have started one a long time ago.

I'm a science fiction writer who focuses on the ""plausibility"" of my fiction. For a long time, I was obsessed with proving to my readers that what I wrote is scientifically sound. I was gung ho about that hard sci-fi, but as I came to learn more about the craft of creative fiction, I found that I was actually limiting my writing to a kind of pseudo-nonfiction at best. It was super rigid. I think this is a pitfall that a lot of science fiction writers should be aware of. Maybe some fantasy writers as well.

One thing that science fiction writers (and others take note) should do is **remember that you're writing fiction.** Don't be afraid of breaking Einstein's relativity. Don't be afraid of contradicting Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Instead, string together some clever smoke and mirrors in the form of a good fictional setting. If you want to have two quantum computers spin qubits between each other faster than the speed of light, take the time to set that up in your story. Don't explain the theory and exposition; just allude to the *plausibility*, remain consistent throughout the story, and audiences will eat it up. Even engineers like myself who science and math all day long. We don't necessarily want to read another hard sci-fi textbook on our free time.

This is already long, but I want to touch upon what you brought up:

&gt; I break these tropes, but I also innovate them

You mention taking the tropes that everyone around here shuns and looking for ways to twist it into something new. That's brilliant. That is how you use a common trope. It's a recognized trope for a reason: it works and has worked plenty of times. A lot of ideas can come from the trope's inverse. For example, let's talk about fantasy. Dragons are considered some of the strongest creatures in many established fantasy lore. A dragon is always the end boss or some almost god-like entity because of their prowess, knowledge, and sheer strength. 

How about inverting this trope. In a brand new fantasy universe, dragons are not huge fire breathing human eating machines. How about a dragon that is very knowledgeable, bookish, or gifted with some very coveted extrasensory perceptions. Emphasize their magical abilities, but downplay their strength. Make them beautifully fragile. The book is about a kingdom that has entrapped a dragon. The King and his generals make him predict the future outcome of wars. Because of this, the King is unstoppable and is seizing other neighboring realms left and right. 

Maybe that's a shitty idea, I don't know, but it's just an example of taking a known trope and thinking about it differently to see where it goes.

Great idea, I think you struck gold with that one.",1462061138

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; I know several other folks whose names were very familiar have scattered. Do you guys still keep in touch with each other beyond a ""I might need them for networking in case I need another job"" capacity, even though everyone has gone in different directions, many literally? How gruesome is that, being in an industry where you typically get laid off every year or two, and knowing that you might have to pick up and move a couple thousand miles for your next job?

Wish I could say yes, but I've never been good at this. We moved around a lot when I was a kid and I never developed the ability to maintain friendships over long distances.

Honestly, I'm not that good at maintaining friendships over short distances. Large part of why I got married, so I'd always have at least *one* friend no matter what... :P

&gt; Paragon Studios always struck me as a particularly tight-knit crew, more than just a group of developers who happened to work with each other. Not being a member of the game developer community and myself having worked for megacorporations for the past couple of decades, is that kind of thing the norm or the exception in the game development industry? Or is that just a misperception, was working for Paragon Studios fun with some folks you liked, but at the end of the day, still just a job?

It depends. Some small studios are really tight-knit. Some large studios manage it. Some small studios rarely interact with each  other outside of work.

It's really difficult for a company to feel that way when there are over 50 people working there. At it's peak, Paragon got big enough that I no longer knew everyone's name, and my circle of people that I considered to be more than 'workplace proximity acquaintances' become more cliquish. But I always felt Paragon felt more like a family than a corporation. I remember the shock I felt when Rachel was let go. Even screwed up and sent a 'WTH?!' email to the whole company rather than just Ken like I intended.

&gt; Also, how does the City of Heroes community compare to others you've dealt with?

Amazing, imo.

&gt; I mean, I know you probably won't say any bad things about us (at least, I hope not...),

The hell I wouldn't. You guys could be a right bunch of assholes at times. But I always tried to remember that people who don't give a shit about the game aren't complaining about it on the forums.

&gt; After all these years, what still sticks out to you as, ""Man, those City of Heroes folks, they were really different because of that""?

I admired how hard they fought to keep the game alive and preserve it's memory even today.

&gt; As for the game itself, can you ever remember a time when something was unpopular, but you knew in your heart that it was what had to be for the long-term health of the game?

&gt; Was there ever a time when you just had to dig in and refuse to change something

No. But I do have a story related to this. Shortly after I started at Cryptic, they decided to add cat ears as a costume accessory. Jay made some cat ears, for female models. We said cool, now we need to port them over for male costumes.

Jay planted his heels and refused. For him, cat ears on male characters was a bad idea. What ensued was a lengthy argument over email about this, with Jay posting pictures of effeminate men and crossdressers wearing cutesy cat ears. The debate started to heat up.

Then someone posted a number of examples of bad ass characters with 'cat ears', like Black Panther.

That ended the debate, and the ears got ported over. After that, Jay never argued against porting things over between genders.

&gt; change something that was broken, because you genuinely felt you knew better than the community?

Not me personally, but we certainly made changes like that all the time. The community, for all their passion, just didn't have the same access to the big picture and data that we had. They weren't as personally vested in the success of the game. If CoH shut down, they'd be sad...but life would go on. We'd be out of work. Literally looking for a new paycheck.

Two very different mindsets there. Hopefully, if things go right, we're in agreement the vast majority of the time. But while many people might *think* they really wanted to be completely omnipotent, when given absolute power and no challenge, the game becomes boring, pointless, and you walk away from it. So we were always trying to find ways to give large moments of gameplay that involved a lot of cannon fodder and made you feel unstoppable, balanced against different levels of challenge for people to overcome.

&gt; Was there ever a time when you did something that was unpopular that later reflecting on it, you thought, ""I was wrong,"" and wished you could go back and undo?

I think I mentioned limiting the color palette for some of the power customization. I'm sure we got a bit to zealous with trying to make very fine balance adjustments to random powers. The later was really done with the intention of avoiding the 'City of X' builds that so many complained about.

It's a tough place to be. The game hinges around creating a personal *super* hero. People *need* to feel more powerful than everyone else, that's part of the fantasy. But when *your* choices are overshadowed by someone else who's tapped into an imbalance in design, that cheapens the gratification. Then when you try and balance the power, the people who've built up an identity centered around those powers/powersets without regard for their balance feel like they're being singled out.

Really no way to win...

&gt; Thanks again a ton for your work on the game and support of the community, and we wish you nothing but the best at DSV and in the future!

Thank you.",1462061139

you honestly think that if you quit because someone mistreated you and you stood up for yourself in the work place thats a bad reference on you? 

`for intentionally quitting in a way that makes life hard for your coworkers`
if you do this and blame why you quit on the boss. Does it really come off as you making the lives of your co-workers hard or is does it come off as the boss's fault?

 framing it this way will really hit that motherfucker. especially if the OP is involved in a critical role at a critical time and then quits out of nowhere. The company will be begging for him to get back if it were the case, and if not the boss will surely be put on the hot seat and his life would be a living hell because a critical employee left at a critical time because of him.

think of it as OP just quits because he can't take it anymore it ""just happened"" to be at a critical moment.

is it revenge? yes. 


will the company hold it against you? Nope they'll hold it against the boss.


are you exiting the company like an adult? yes.

do you appear immature? nope not remotely.

if the op frames it right the boss will come off as a total douche , the boss's life would be a living hell, and he comes off as a poor ""victim"".
and we all know everybody empathizes with the ""victim"".

[Here's a reasonably solid, if slightly critical(these guys want more US money for biomedical research so they'll be warning of an impending switch in research dominance to Europe and Asia) analysis of current and future trends in the biomedical field](http://assets1c.milkeninstitute.org/assets/Publication/ResearchReport/PDF/CASMIFullReport.pdf)

tl;dr
The US has more new drugs approvals in the EU each year since 1997 than any country. The US has more drug approvals in the US than any country since 1997. The US has better research universities than any other country. The US is the global destination for highly educated researchers. The US spend ~50% of the world's research spending in biomedical research. The SF, Boston, New York, and DC metro regions all produce more patents than any other metro region in the world. San Diego, LA, and Philly are only beat by Tokyo. 57% of patents are produced by US firms. We are the leader in medical diverse exports. ",1462061143
"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","There is a tipping point, but it's pretty low.  A nerv with one mk1 liquid tank can out-delta a terrier with the same-sized FL-400 tank.

If you're using LFO tanks with the oxidizer drained, the tipping point is higher, though, because you're dragging extra dead weight.

I usually use nervs for crewed missions to Jool or beyond, and the spark/terrier/poodle class for anything nearer.  But it's mostly because they're less hassle.

2. You can use per-AD, Filter routes, or route tags.

4. It uses Delay and Bandwidth by default. It can use Load and Reliability as a metric also, but If MTU is not a factor. 

7. I said IGP!! So you can either set a static route to the eBGP next-hop-IP address or on the neighbor that is connected to the eBGP neighbor you can issue the neighbor [IGP Neighbor's IP add] next-hop-self. I think the wording was shitty on that question, so my bad. 

8. CISCO IOS will use a feature called WRED to do this when global synchronization happens. 

10. During the Active state the neighbors perform the TCP Three-way handshake.

If someone finds religions nonsense, they leave religions. Things like the concept of hell and heaven, God's testing us may sound silly to some people, so they dont believe in abrahamic religions, and abrahamic gods. I think there are some good proofs for god's existence but if someoone doesnt believe in religions, they probably cannot believe in god. Deism does not make sense to atheists, and to theists also.

An interesting fact about yourself - I have the best knowledge of Harry Potter of anyone I have yet to meet. I am a boring individual.

What made you join the MHOC? - I love political discussions, but all my friends have really similar political views, so I worry about being in an echo chamber.

Are you involved in real life politics/ do you intend to be in the future? - I try to go to rallies and protest marches whenever one I agree with is on, and am hoping to get to question my local MP soon!

Main political ideologies - Massive pro-welfare state, socialist through and through, and believer in the fact that education is the way we can slowly destroy the toxic class system we live in.

Political compass score - 
Economic Left/Right: -9.13 
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.77

"gaming","t5_2qh03","When I was younger I used to be absolutely obsessed with Legos. Every bit of money o managed to earn went towards Legos. Holidays, all my wish lists were Legos. I loved it. I spent thousands of hours building. I managed to collect around 5,000 pieces(obviously an estimate I didn't count one by one) and had all of my Legos in this large cardboard filing cabinet thing(they were stackable cardboard filing cabinets that were). Up until about 11 I would play with them constantly. Once I started maturing I found interests in skateboarding, biking, paint balling, air soft, etc. and sort of lost interest in Legos. The cardboard cabinet was moved from under my bed to the garage for whatever reason. Fast forward to age 13 ish. I was outside skateboarding in front of the house.and saw a couple Legos on the floor and I'm like ""awesome! Free Legos!"" So I quickly pocketed them. I stand up and see a few more about three feet ahead of me and again ""no way! More Legos!"" *grab* again I stand up and see more and more and more, all the way to the end of the street and around the corner... The same route the trash truck drives. 
My heart fell out of my ass at the thought that my Legos were gone. I sprinted to the garage praying my cabinet was still there. Gone. I start panicking. Heavy breathy,increased heart rate, flushing face. I thought I was dying. I searched every part of my house. Even like, really unrealistic locations like behind the couch and under the bathroom sink. Pretty sure my brain was overloaded or something. I'm obviously not in the right mind. I find my dad and start yelling at him ""dad! Where are my Legos!""
""I thought you didn't want them so I threw them out, sorry bud.""
I explain how expensive they were, how long it took me to collect them all, how much I obviously loves them since I had built models all over my bedroom and so on.
""Oh, well sorry."" 
I'm freaking out at the lack of care he is showing me and my teenage angst is peaking. 
""How would you feel if I threw out all your fishing poles!!""

Communist arms manufacturers are very specialized, if your plant makes T-72 tanks, then that is all you know how to make. You talking about plant with thousands of workers, plus the entire supply chain, all of the maintenance requirements, training requirements... ... that's a huge amount of political interest in continuing to develop the T-72 line even if the T-80 was better in every way (it wasn't). In comparison to NATO where the big arms companies like Raytheon, Lockhead Martin, General Dynamics, BAE system, etc are all diversified enough to survive the loss a single contract. And in NATO there is a jobs market for the people you lay off from a tank plant as the tank is phased out, in comparison in communist country the government must find somewhere else for these very specialized workers to get retrained and work. And in communist countries they love to locate the important arms plants in the middle of nowhere, because lessons from WWII, so the action of phasing out a tank line would be like a mini genocide on the ground, with thousands of families being forcibly relocated in army trucks.",1462061155

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Já teve gente falando de [Lula para secretário-geral da ONU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV0vONUa3QQ). O que marcou os governos Lula foram a pacificação social e a capacidade de ""unir"" agentes antagônicos na política. Isso virou um ""modelo"" ([artigo recomendado](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/nec/n85/n85a04.pdf)), não sendo diretamente uma característica do Lula.

Um dos maiores líderes da oposição ao chavismo na Venezuela, Henrique Capriles, é fortemente lulista, por exemplo. Isso fica muito marcado no fato de que ele conseguiu unir toda a oposição ao chavismo (de liberais e conservadores com ares de Bolsonaro até esquerda socialista de oposição) sobre a mesma chapa, e saiu vitorioso nas últimas eleições parlamentares.

O problema é que esses agentes antagônicos unidos pelo carisma do Lula têm interesses antagônicos entre si, esses interesses nunca deixaram de existir. A partir do momento que se esgota essa aliança (nesse caso, na crise econômica) essas contradições se amplificam (""a saída é pela esquerda"", ""fora Levy"", ""ajuste fiscal"", ""Uma Ponte para o Futuro"") e a união fica insustentável.

When you are speaking about having him determine your appearance, do you place any restrictions on that? What I mean is: are you specifically seeking him to determine an appearance for you that would ""work in real life"" ... or are you also open to things like cosplay? If you are open to something like cosplay, that might be one avenue for introducing the idea, and then gradually bringing it closer and closer to more ""normal"" situations, e.g. instead of picking a character for me to dress as, how about you tell me what kind of girl at a nightclub you'd like me to be??

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","&gt;You complained about a free game not having wheel support.

PC is about choice. If a game that's expected to have wheel support (e.g. every single racing game) doesn't have it, that's shitty.

&gt;You complained about Uwp before Uwp games came out.

Microsoft's history with making platforms for gaming is precisely shitty. GFWL was a piece of shit. Microsoft also has a history of trying to monopolize the shit out of **the internet**. Oh and guess how UWP turned out? It's another attempt at that, restricting features and fucking over non-UWP versions.

&gt;The guy writing 5 paragraphs about the possibility of Bethesda having their own platform.

Let's say I want to play Skyrim. I open Steam, double-click Skyrim. That will launch Bethesda's launcher in the background, which will then run Skyrim for me. **There is no need for any of that shit other than implementing shitty DRM and driving people away from Steam by inconveniencing them if they choose to use it**. That's bullshit and needs to be shut down.

Again, the PC is all about choice. Here in Village of Glorious, when someone releases a racing game, there's going  to be people who have a racing setup that costs thousands of dollars and they will want to use that setup without having to jump through hoops or waiting for someone to hack in wheel or multi-monitor support because the developer was a console-minded idiot.

If anyone needs help imagining how hopeless we are, just picture a moldy loaf of bread on top of the pyramids of Giza, and another on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. What are the odds that one's mold spores manage to reach the other before they're both long dead and the bread is gone?",1462061162

My point is, is a Carbon tax the solution? Is cutting CO2 the solution? Remember America and a few other Western nations not the largest most populated with highest growth rates.

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","I actually plan on applying to both of these school's hopefully in one year, as a mechanical engineer as well. I'll speak in my experience as an international student but who lives in Illinois.

1-Recognition/Prestige: I assure that the name of UC Berkeley is far more known than the university of Michigan across the globe. Berkeley is the best public university, and its the closest a university could be to Stanford and MIT.   

2-Location and weather: As you may know, Berkeley is close to San Francisco which is better than Detroit. Berkeley is closer to the silicon valley. Berkeley has an amazing weather, to the point that if i talk any further about it ill be emotional by the end of this comment. The weather in the Midwest SUCK!! 
The only reason I would pick U of Michigan over UC Berkeley is that I want to work in the Aerospace industry those ill take all of elective courses from the aerospace department which is better in Michigan.


In the end, pick Berkeley UNLESS you want to work for automotive industry, aerospace industry. I guess Ann arbor is cheaper in living cost but more expensive for tuition. Good luck! ",1462061165

You're also trying to pretend that miners can include everything and anything, regardless, which is plain false, miners have far more metrics than just coin age, and transaction fees, they have propagation costs, variance, verifying time etc. . Pretending that these metrics don't play a factor on block sizes shows you're just making excuses.

In your last year OSAP is gonna give you less than any other year because of PEY. I wanted my last year to be chill and not have to worry about money. Keeping cash in hand is more secure. Boy was I right.

If you don't learn, you are putting yourself at a very distinct disadvantage and lose all right to complain about any loss in total profits. 

* Learn to deal with ill will. Any time you are selling anything anywhere you must be able to do this. This is particularly the case for price discrimination.

* Undercharge iff its not worth your time to find exact price.

https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Reporting-Tip-Income-Restaurant-Tax-Tips

If you report tips to your employer they'll be in your wages, but other tips that didn't get so reported you are supposed to keep track of and *include* manually on your 1040 line 7. So make sure you learn how your workplace tracks tips and what tip income they don't track.

You are also supposed to pay Soc Sec and Medicare taxes on such amounts (the tips not in your W-2), and there's a special form for that.

Form 4137  
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4137.pdf

You can consider all of this to be ""compensation"" for the purposes of making IRA or Roth IRA cobtributions. You wouldn't be able to include any amounts of tips that you didn't so include (i.e. deprecated under-the-table amounts).

Note that several thousands you earn are not taxed (the standard deduction amount for your filing status). The tips are still ""compensation"" even if you end up not paying taxes on them.

Also, if you spend your earnings but have other money saved, you can use (appropriate amount of) your savings to fill your IRA. It doesn't technically have to be the money you earned.",1462061170

There are trillions of potential people who will never be realized.

Women have only just recently won the right to provide for themselves and their families, to become the breadwinner if they want to be. It's something we literally were not allowed to do in very recent generations. We are all working on obtaining equality on this issue, but it's not something that will happen that quickly. Instead of viewing women as the enemy or the oppressors, if you work together with us to continue to push for true equality between men and women, then we'll *all* benefit from it. We'll all get what we want. Women will be freer to pursue the kinds of complete, fulfilling lives they want to have, including taking on roles as providers... and men will be freer to pursue more leisure and time for self-fulfillment and self-actualization outside the workforce. We both need that; we both need to see one another as allies in obtaining what we need from society, not as enemies.

I don't disagree with some of your points--men totally do get the crappy end of the stick when it comes to reproductive agency. Not only may a woman force a man into unwanted parenthood, but men have far fewer options for reliable birth control.

There's nothing sensible anybody can do about the former situation (women holding all the cards with regards to pregnancy) because to remove any of their agency would thrust women back into the oppressed minority class that we fought for generations to claw our way out of. And I'm sure you don't want that.

But men do need much more attention paid to their reproductive options so they can take effective control of their own fertility and avoid getting anybody pregnant unless they intend to do it. Fixing that latter problem would solve the former problem.",1462061178

We often invite solo players to join if we have less than 4 in the team. That does seem key to the dz. it's a team activity. 

My complaint about the dz is the loot drops. I'm in the +161 bracket. I extracted pretty much 30 he, a full stash, and nothing was an upgrade. 

Some of that gear was hard fought and all of it got recycled.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt; I think he did v the Orks. Which is why he was just teleporting around for Horus. Regardless, its absolutely a thing we know he can do, so why would we assume he wouldn't?

Is there any solid proof of this?  And we assume he will not insta time-stop for the same reason we assume Flash won't go back in time and IMP GEoM when he's a toddler.  And even when trying to talk down Horus, he didn't stop time.

In other words: GEoM is a jobber.  

&gt; We've seen things like this from comics all the time. But the descriptors used consistently through the fight imply planet busting.

The difference being that comic book punches don't have the side effect of destroying souls.  It seems to me (and you can definitely disagree on this) that these are just descriptors to imply power of something unquantifiable, not to be taken literally.

&gt; But you could take that away and he's at least a mountain buster. Like I said, we've seen Primarchs No-sell city busting plasma cannons. Russ and Magnus deformed the landscape and broke mountains. An infant Kruze survived orbital re-entry into the planets core. Considering GEoM went toe to toe with a Chaos Amped Horus, I think we can safelty assume that his durability is equal or greater to the Primarchs.

I don't doubt he could wipe a planet, however.  It's his durability I find questionable.

&gt; It still demonstrates a good deal of firepower. Even with its super grimdark maintenance bill.

Seeing as GEoMs job is to control the energy, I'd argue that it's more a feat for finesse than for raw strength.  If you gave him the power, sure he could do some pretty damn powerful things, but then, Superman could also sundip in a sufficiently bright star and pull new powers out of his ass given the right circumstances.

&gt; These are outliers based on what we've seen from the Primarchs. And the rotor cannon is absolutely an outlier. Even in the fight against the orks, bullets couldn't touch him.Most of where my argument comes from is based on Primarch feats, though.

I would argue that feats for a character outweigh extrapolation from another character.  As for bullets not touching him, would that not be a feat for his speed rather than durability?

&gt; Bloodlusted GEoM has the reaction time between that and Precog to at least timestop. But I don't think Green Lantern or Thor have FTL combat speed. And supes doesn't do so casually.

But how long does it take him to fire off the time stop ability? As for precog,  well, this comes up in every GEoM fight.  If we assume that the fight begins on a fair, neutral ground where both characters can only start acting at the same time, then even if one character knows the future, they still must react fast enough  to do something about it to take down a faster opponent.",1462061181

"intj","t5_2qowo","The best advice on this is also the hardest to follow through with—stop looking for a guy. Instead, just focus on doing things toward which you have inclinations. He may or may not ever show up, and that's okay. That's part of the process. Humans have a tendency to believe they must control their fate, but we are not in control. That's an illusion. We control nothing. Reality is chaos and entropy masquerading as order and structure.

In my experience, I have a knack for picking out INxJs in a crowd of people. I passively look for deviation from the norm, which is the standard *modus operandi* for an INTJ. Every woman that I've connected with, I've done so because I was going about my life (and she hers) when I noticed a woman being herself, yet not really belonging to the environment she was in. A woman deep in thought at a club. That's not normal—people go to clubs to drink, not to think. A woman at a coffee shop, sitting isolated from everyone, yet poised to observe everything and everyone in the room. Etc.

Just by being yourself and going about your life, you are sending out flags to the astute observer.  Though to you they may be loud screams, to the world they are but subtle whispers, hidden in the noise of modern bustle. As chance would have it, there exist certain individuals that have a natural inclination towards finding patterns that others miss in an attempt to feed their own inner worlds with data which fuels their thoughts. Said individuals won't see ""resting bitch face"" when they encounter you, but will immediately understand a world full of emotion, wonder, and exploration. All of this happens when no one is seeking. It makes no sense, but our biggest problem as a species is assuming that things should or that they even do. Just live your life and do things that you enjoy. Maybe remember to come up to the surface for air every now and then. Things will work out, or they won't. And that's okay.",1462061181

So without going *too* much into the details (which you seriously ought to check out because it's fascinating and bizarre), the main inhabitants today are from an original motley group of a few English sailors that had mutinied along with some Polynesian women, that all decided they wanted to live on their own island but wound up lost and on a barren rock in the middle of the Pacific (now known as Pitcairn). So, years and years of inbreeding and isolation occurs and instead of going 'full Hapsburg', the people actually have rather good genes. A lot of people attribute it to the fact that because the English blood and the Polynesian blood were sooo diverse from one another, that it basically helped to keep the pool mixed up *enough* and even *helped* later generations be more adaptive to the island.

Now if you see some of the native inhabitants of Pitcairn, some look a little more English or Polynesian, but most look very blended. So on a related note, I'm half-Filipino, and other half-and-half people (or even third, fourth generation mixed) may be able to relate to looking a little ambiguous when it comes to what my race or ethnicity is. It's similar with the Pitcairn people, but because they've had many years of the two gene pools continuing to mix (with the occasional outside blood coming in), it's almost as if they've developed distinctively ""Pitcairn-ish"" features. 

A little bit extensive, but the book [Pitcairn: Children of Mutiny](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/958205.Pitcairn) by Ian M. Ball was a fascinating read. It was written in the late 70s, but after reading it, I was able to look up what Pitcairn is like today--and honestly, it's really not *that* much different. It mostly focuses on the island living, history, and culture, but it might be of some interest.

Even if it's not exactly what you're thinking of doing, perhaps this will somehow provide a unique perspective in approaching this concept.

That's actually not such a hard thing to do. So I would go ahead and get the 401k, move it to an IRA when you lose or quit your job, then keep it it in the US IRA until you retire. Having money in a foreign country is nice way to diversify your investments anyways.

Obviously what happens taxwise in 40 years when you take the money from the US to your homeland: no one has fucking idea. :D This is true of all retirement accounts anywhere, despite what the 'experts' say (I think most retirement experts are used to talking to people in their 50s not in their 20s; for older folks you can say a lot more about tax rules when they retire!).

Clutching his side is a beautiful princess type in a skimpy armor bikini. She's got her face buried in his chest and is watching the dragon in front of them with fearful eyes, but as long as she can hold onto him, she feels safe. Protected. 

That's love. We aren't in a cheesy 80's fantasy novel, but virtually every heterosexual woman wants to feel that way when she buries her face into her man's chest as they lay in bed together. And every man, while no Conan, still wants a ride-or-die bitch by his side. Us against the world.  

Do you get to this scenario through traditional, socially constructed Disney courtship rituals? Hell no. You get to it by being fucking awesome, by cultivating yourself as a man and living an empowered life.

* Ahsoka the bruiser
* Luminara the healer/ability blocker
* Royal Guard the stunning meat shield
* anyone, really, typically Sidious for heal immunity and counter-Sidious, can also use JC for extra heal, chewie for extra meat shield

Other than RG, who still is at 2 stars for me, everyone is really easy to farm, and RG at 2 stars for me is still an excellent tank. His auto-taunt is extremely forgiving for badly timed heals. Having dumped a lot into Ahsoka, her special and high crit rate is its own group heal, while her normal is a reliable auto self-heal. Luminara obviously heals and hurts, while her ability block, QGJ's buff remover, and RG's 80% stun rate combined does well to neutralize any pesky characters and their pesky abilities.

QGJ as leader with his phone-a-friend special can almost always knock out one enemy on the first turn. The sequence for me is always

1. QGJ's phone-a-friend
2. Ahsoka's special
3. and if enemy is still standing, finish off with Lumi.

ThIs is close-ish, but I do need to update it. I finally shelled out for Spellskite and put Gitaxian Probe in. Basically, drop the blue countermagic for black removal and discard. Plague Stinger does a decent Blighted Agent impersonation. Crusader hoses most removal spells thrown at it. Abrupt Decay is awesome. My current predicament is the balance between pump spells and discard/removal. Too much removal, you can't proactively answer your opponents removal on your own dudes. Too much pump and you're just a worse UG list. Too much discard and suddenly you're imitating mono black infect without a full discard/removal suite and you don't move fast enough to win your match ups.

With crusader being so good, I wanna keep tweaking the deck to see where it can go, but I'm seriously considering moving back to a UG list",1462061188

"coolguides","t5_310rm","Just to piggy back on what /u/asilenth said:

Negatives are great because they increase your TUT, or time under tension; it's the time that your muscles are basically working in either direction (By direction I mean the contraction portion such as the up portion of a curl, or the eccentric/negative portion where the muscle is relaxing to a resting length, such as  the down portion of a curl).

By playing around with this TUT you create more microtears and induce more of the inflammatory response in your body, which in the context of weight training is a good thing. I.e. you work your muscles harder, they get beat up more, your body repairs them with new muscle, you get swole and get tons of bitches.

Now, obviously it's important to be smart when you play around with stuff like this. Overloading your muscles is fundamental to muscle building, but you shouldn't make negatives and exhaustion work the only part of your workout. The bulk of your workout should be choosing a weight that's challenging but you're still able to do x amount of reps with perfect form (where x is determined by your goals; generally it's accepted that 10-12 reps is for muscle building and 6-8 is for strength. Don't do 9 or else your penis will explode. And if you're a chick you will grow a penis which will subsequently explode.) But towards the tail end of your workout I like to throw in negatives to basically ""make sure"" my babies got spanked good enough ;)

Sorry for the wall of text, I tend to talk too much and get too excited when it comes to muscle building and shit because I've been studying it since no one fucking told me how this shit works. So if you ever have any questions feel free to ask! May you lift in peace. Wheymen.",1462061189

That being said I still think Steel Fiber, Vitality, and Redirection, and especially Flow (or even Primed Flow) need to be innate. To me they're just as bad as Multishot mods and Serration.

My mom and I had talked the night before, saying Missy couldn't keep up and they scheduled to put her down the next afternoon. Despite having $3 to my name, I make plans to drive out. I want my dog to know I'm not dead, I still love and will be there till the end. But apparently she worsened in the night. My mom tried to call me, but couldn't get through.

Sure, let's say that's true. But wouldn't it be -more- awkward sharing the same toilet facilities with members of the opposite gender? 

&gt; suggesting that having an identity that aint what you subscribe to isnt mental illness, and to suggest that is a rather hateful notion

How? To believe you're something you're not is pretty much the definition of mental illness. If I woke up tomorrow and claimed to be the pope, isn't that me being mentally ill? Its not ""hate"" to say that I'm not the pope and get me the help I need, indeed, treating me as if I were the pope would be cruel. 

&gt; if all bathrooms were single stalled and unisex then none of these issues would arise

Except that the amount of ""issues"" compared to the amount it would cost to change it would be ridiculous. Imagine a stadium, you might have 300-400 stalls/urinals, imagine the cost of maintenance and additional hardware doors, walls, etc.

Its no difference here. If your base is sieged to the point that no ANT gets past, you have to push out to clear a path. If the enemy fails to block the path, well then they arent trying hard enough. :)

I litereally just had the whole ""last push now"" moment in a base. Shelled the walls and turrets to bits with a bunch of tanks, ended up in a dual comet max pushing through the walls with fellow planetmans left and right.


Whats really missing now is he ability to recover from situations where infantary is already pushing your base. But I guess that requires bigger buildings, to force infantary into the base, and that just wont happen before ""phase 2"" ;)",1462061192

As has been said, most people do things in their lifetime - steal, use illegal substances and many other things - that are crimes.  Some of us get caught.

Once you do your time and do it well, the field should be leveled.  However, it's not.  You are always going to have that conviction hanging over you.

As an employer, consider this - it's relatively easy to find out if an offender used his time wisely while in.  Ask what they did while incarcerated; did they improve their educational level, take part in programs and make a commitment to themselves to work and put their past behind them?  

Some facilities don't have much in the way of programming, so not everyone in jail or prison can take advantage of such opportunities.  Telling the truth about their crime, and how they reacted to their sentence, can still tell you a lot about a person.  

A saying, ""Trust, but verify,"" can help you make that decision whether or not to hire someone with a past conviction.  Remember this, too - you know where this guy has been and what he's been doing for the time he's been in.  Everyone else can just tell you what you want to hear.

If he or she has been through a reentry program, you can ask the personnel in that program about the individual's record and adjustment.  You can use public record access to determine if they are telling the truth about their crime and conviction.  

I believe it is worth taking the chance if you do your research.  I have hired former felons, and they have excelled.  Glad I took the chance.",1462061192

I hate how if you post a new thread somewhere, unless you're making the most echochamber opinion possible for that subreddit, you have to steel yourself for the first few responses to be quibbling. It's also always obvious that they have no investment in the disagreement, either, they are literally just being contrary. Just wanting to be noticed for having a dissenting opinion, because Reddit has this weird idea that a disagreeing opinion = automatically more thought through than an agreeing one. 

The number one thing I increasingly feel Reddit is lacking is able to think critically. This isn't something I even think I have a high capacity for myself, and would like to be much better at. And yet I feel like redditors position themselves, in behaviours like this, in a way that they *think* people will look upon them as capable of critical thinking. Rather than actually doing it. 

(Similar to my other repeat complaint over here, where redditors just repeat a text-based meme format for a joke when they see the right cue because they want to look like a funny person not try and be a funny person.)

Yes, please do that first too before lecturing others.

There are two ways to fail the creation of a stone - one is a build in chance to create a broken stone instead by the receipt itself the second one is by not using enough ingredients. You afaik can't influence the first chance, but you certainly can influence the latter way to fail. If he has never failed that recipe due to lack of ingredients and uses less than any other right now then his recipe is more accurate and does not fail due to the second reason.

So your statement ""No matter how many ingredients you put in it will NEVER be a 100% chance to create the stone. So every recipe "" can and will eventually fail""."" while accurate for the first reason to fail - which you obviously criticised about his statement - it is as confusing, misleading and unhelpful about the second part to anyone who doesn't know much about alchemy, because you left this important piece of information out why some recipes are straight out bad and others just more item consuming just like him leaving out that even with the perfect recipe you don't have a guarantee to get an alchemy stone.",1462061194

"mexico","t5_2qhv7","&gt;The cost of corruption takes a big chunk out of the growth potential. In the last 30 years it could have grown at much larger rates with only a moderate decrease in government corruption, but the lag in education and apathy keeps preventing any change there. It's too big and complex a country to fix things like countries like Iceland could, where you just gather 1,000 people for a cause and you are already a force to reckon with.

This comment is laughable, naive, and you are obviously in your early - mid 20's at the oldest, cause you don't know that Mexico already went down that route for 3 decades (60's, 70's, 80's)

To replace and export brand you do this, be better and/or cheaper. That's it. I lived through the ""import substitution"" era in the 70's and 80's. 

I lived to see how tariffs were increased more and more, and because of that the same retaliatory tariffs were placed on mexican products. Because of lowered sales and lack of competition mexican producers couldn't afford to make better products, and they didn't need to because mexicans had no choice. This went on for over a decade until in the 80's the market consisted of:

1) Poor worthless mexican products that no one wanted to buy, not even mexicans.

2) Contraband from the USA, which was both cheaper and of better quality than anything made in Mexico.

Everyone was still wearing cloths made in the early 70's because everything new was shit and people in the border smuggled in powder milk and tooth paste to sell in Mexico because everything here was either not available or of poor quality and more expensive.

The same thing is happening right this very moment in Venezuela, they have to import everything because business conditions got so bad that all of their local producers went broke. 

In Brazil the protectionism cause things like a PS4 being sold for $2000 USD, they wanted Sony or someone to start building computer parts locally. It didn't happen, local taxes and business conditions were too unfriendly to be worth spending billions of dollars in high tech processor factories when half the world has the same tariffs on brazilian products as Brazil has on everyone else to ""protect their local economy"".

This is how you make improve the local offering: Make a product that offers a better value proposition.

The prime example is Italika, the motorbike company. It's only 10 years old, started as an importer for South Korean parts, but it already has sold over 2 million bikes, it has expanded from Mexico to South America, and it has reach the point where the design and fabrication is made in Mexico.

How they do it is simple: the price is more accesible to mexican customers, and to reach that the quality is ""good enough"".

As their market share increases they will have more funds available to produce better and higher quality bikes if they want to keep growing, but for now they already replaced Honda as the best selling motorcycle brand in Mexico.

They could right now go and open a store in Japan if they wanted to (Japan and Mexico have a free trade agreement deal) but they wont, because they know they can't complete yet. If there were prohibitions in Mexico against importing motorcycles, then those same prohibitions would apply to Mexico, and then Italika would be limited to our market, and it would have no competition to drive it to be better, and we mexicans would only be able to buy forever shitty bikes made by Italika, who doesn't need to improve, because we have no choice.

This is all history, this all has already happened multiple times, all over the world, including Mexico.

We need to remember our OWN history, and not even the old one, the one from 30 years ago.",1462061196

I've been in a situation like this (albeit a bit different) and got very sick because my doctor was missing things and just giving ""standard answers"" rather than investigating my medical problems and complaints, so I switched doctors and I found a whole new team of much better GI people.. although I see a PA and RN now, and they just consult with the doctor, but they've been way better than my old doctor and seem much more involved in wanting me to be better.

I would go skylake because you can invest in ddr4 now and use it in builds in the future.

I don't know what case you have or if you want/need a new case. I assumed you were happy with your case and storage for the build below. You might or might not have to repurchase windows depending on where you purchased your old system from and what type of windows key it had on it.(if you have a windows disk you should be fine)

Something that has helped me in an odd way is pre-making things that are healthier, and eating them throughout the day. I'm not a real fan of healthy food, but I like shakes. Stuff veggies into a blender with some fruit and you've got a pretty healthy snack that's not difficult to take down. When I'm not hungry, I have these and it helps so that I don't bindge at night when I'm at my weakest. You clearly don't have to start at veggies, you can start at something you like.

Pros: -Starlight Glimmer and Trixie. Holy *crap* I did not see that pair coming, and they played off each other beautifully this episode. It was like first seeing Sunset Shimmer in Rainbow Rocks, but better.

-Starlight Glimmer has Angel around her pinkie finger/hoof. I find that both hilarious, given their natures and incredibly charming. Also maybe the most brilliant minor forshadowing in MLP since Twilight's expression when introduced to the Cutie Mark Stick. (How many unicorns were there?)

I know because it was the first roller coaster I ever rode. I was 4-5 at the time, and I loved it. I rode it 2-3 times (always with a parent IIRC), and wasn't pleased that I was too short for any of the other roller coasters at the park. I've loved roller coasters ever since.

Honestly, if the girl was over the height limit, I don't see a problem with letting her ride. Taking her into line without planning on letting her ride was pretty shitty, but if she wasn't in any physical danger then I see nothing wrong with letting a child try something new and giving them the opportunity to find out whether they enjoy it or not, especially when the ride only lasts for two minutes and it's not like they went to the park just for her.",1462061207

It's more like a sunburn, more annoying than painful. As for care, I did the salt soaks once a day for the first week and then after that just let hot water run gently on them in the shower and that was it!

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It's hard to know if this is going to be just a phase for her or if it's the start of long-term use. 

It's okay for her to use drugs recreationally. It's also totally okay for you to have your limits. I don't recommend a scenario where she keeps using drugs and hides it from you. It would be better to tell her what your limits are. It probably won't change things; she'll probably still want to hang out and party with her friends. Ultimately, I think she needs to know how much this bothers you and that you need to be okay with setting your limits. 

Don't think of it in terms of you trying to control her behavior. Her choice of behavior is up to her, but it sounds like for you to continue the relationship and be happy in it, she needs to stop using drugs. If she doesn't want to do that, then it would be better for you to find a girlfriend who doesn't party like this. ",1462061211

I'm guessing you mean you need relics from 12.

I'd skip these banners, and wait for BSB Fest, or the Gabranth banners if you want XII RS.

You should be able to clear everything if you have good hones. If you really can't clear the Ultimates, you can use a mythril to build your SB gauge, and that should make it clear-able with the SBs you have.

If you still really want to pull, Banner 1 still seems like the better choice. The shield SB is de-valued in your case, but Basch does at least have SAM over Leon (Leon has DRK though), would be useful for Cid missions, and the shield itself is good. The other relics are also pretty good, and can fit into your team.

So in episode 1, Davos is hoping Mel can do something (pull a shadow baby out of her lady passage, or whatever) to save them from being killed by the mutineers. In episode 2, the mutineers are defeated without any intervention from Mel. Then, after all the excitement is over, Davos apparently wants Mel to resurrect Jon. Why? Has he had a brilliant flash of inspiration that the only future for the North is if there is a leader who can unite NW, wildlings and Stark bannermen? If so, full marks to Davos for working out the entire political theme of the northern chapters of ADWD in just a few minutes of screen time.

The very nature of ""back shoulder"" is that it's in a place only your WR can get or nobody can get. So that was a stupid comment

He's a gunslinger in the sense he throws some balls into questionable coverage because he has the confidence to think he can ""sling"" it into those windows. Like a poor poor mans Bret Farve. Now that won't work against better secondaries, unless you are as good as Farve.

Living here in CA, I speak with a lot of people of all races. It surprises me that almost all Black people I talk to about politics. Know nothing about Bernie. But getting to your statement of black voters is patently false. If you look at the turnout in most states. Exit polls say Sanders did not exceed 20 percent of the Black vote in Southern states, but he won 28 percent in Michigan and Ohio, 29 percent in Illinois, and 32 percent in Missouri. (ajc.com, March 17) In Michigan, where Sanders staged an upset against Clinton, voter turnout exceeded expectations. Some 2.5 million cast ballots — the largest level of participation since 1972, when George Wallace won the Democratic primary there over the cross-district busing issue. So, I think you may want to look at the actual facts versus the narrative that MSNBC puts out as talking points. While Hillary has a lead among black voters. She has not increased those numbers. While Bernie's numbers continue to rise with blacks and minorities. Especially millennials who are educated. Black, white, asian or whatever race.  ",1462061221

There are little tricks like how in BN3 if you hit left while getting hit with areagrab it does half damage. There are mind games in netbattles, and just battling people helps you build experience and really explore what certain chips do. You can learn patterns of your opponent like in smash and like in most fighting games. But I don't think we have any tech to build on like smash.

If you are looking to get a lot better at the game in general, I recommend just throwing some random chips in your folder and try them out.

Then on offense, we still have Peterson and a much improved offensive line with Sully/Loadholt back from injury and Boone/Andre Smith set to start.  Throw in Laquon Treadwell and some development from our 23-year-old QB, and this is still an offense that will move the chains, eat up clock, wear defenses out, and now has some size and physicality to catch endzone contested catches.",1462061223

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","I don't believe that is true about only absorbing a certain amount of calories. Our intestines are extremely efficient. Many mammals only eat rarely but when they do, they gorge themselves. Thus the body needs to be extremely efficient at getting all the calories it can out of food. On askscience, there's a bit of an Eli5 discussion about this.*

One very important factor is that your TDEE goes up as you gain. A  guy who is 300 lbs, 29 years old, and 5'9 burns 2800 cals per day just by being sedentary. And if they do get any activity at all, they burn LOADS more than people who weigh less do. I think that's why the math isn't adding up for you.


I don't believe most Americans gain their weight by eating almost 4k calories. No way. Statistics show most Americans only eat about 4500 calories on [Thanksgiving](http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/21/living/thanksgiving-by-the-numbers/), considered to be the holiday where people gorge the most. It's mostly just eating a bit above their TDEE, in increasing amounts over time. (I saw this happen for myself. When I was young, 2 servings of pasta (400 cals) was enougb. I eventually got up to eating 4 servings and bread and still not feeling full.)

Vauss has already begun his plans, whatever they may be. Magnus may have more information, or even better, a solution or counterattack you can deploy. 

You find the address, following the winding cobblestone trail to a small neighborhood overlooking a large crystal clear lake. 

The house is well-kept, and has the markings of children all over it. A ball here, paintings there. Stepping on the porch, you give a knock on the door. Sniffing, you detect the intoxicating smell of baked pastries seeping through the open windows. 

It opens, and for a moment you're confused, for no one is there. Looking down, you see a young toddler, a paintbrush around her hand. 

""Hi. Um...is your mother here? I need to speak to her.""

She yells for her mother. ""Mama! Someone's at the door!"" The child runs off into the well-furnished common room. Guinevere arrives wearing a dirty apron, her brow caked with sweat and some flour on her cheek.

""Hi there, are you a friend of my husband? If you're looking for him, he won't be back in a few hours."" she says. 

""Actually...I was looking for you. My name is Beed, a hunter. I..."" You pause for a bit. You've never had to break the news to someone before. Usually, you got the bastard and then sold his corpse for money. ""It's regarding your uncle.""

""Avi? What's happened to him?"" 

""Perhaps we should talk outside..."" you say, keeping an eye on her daughter.

""All right.""

You sigh, then produce the letter from your pack. ""A few weeks ago...the wyvern attacked Hark's Landing. Avi...was stationed there. I met him very briefly, and helped defend the settlement and evacuate civilians. I am lucky to have survived."" You hand her the letter.

""No...no...*please*..."" Guinevere gasps, placing her hand over her mouth to stop the incoming sobs. ""No...this can't be true...the rumors...""

""Avi died protecting the citizens of the town, along with many others. I was instructed to deliver this letter to you.""

Avi's niece goes into hysterics, crying uncontrollably. You embrace her in an effort to comfort her sorrow. 

""I'm sorry. From what I've heard...he was a selfless and brave man. I truly am sorry for you loss.""

Guinevere's daughter peeks out from the door frame. ""Mama...why are you crying?""

""Emily, dear...(sniffs)...go play for a bit, all right sweetie? (Sniffs)""

Emily just stands there, concerned. 

""Honey, please. Go play.""

""...oh-kay."" 

Guinvere wipes her tears on her blouse. ""Oh god...I didn't think it were true. I...waited for days, awaiting for his yearly visit...(sniffs)...it doesn't matter now...""

""I'm sure he loved you very much.""

""Dammit...*goddammit*. This wyvern is destroying so many lives...oh, I wish it were all over...""

""I'm going to make sure that no more cities are burned, that no more families are hurt. I can promise you that.""

""How?""

""I'm going to stop it.  Avi will not have died in vain.""

""Thank you. Thank you for taking the time and..."" Tears of anguish silently run down her cheeks. ""I...need to make preparations. Thank you, hunter.""

She leaves you with an unwavering feeling of gloominess, an emotion that sticks with you as you walk along the streets, watching the beam grow ever brighter.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Bethesda tried to do what FNV did with the factions, but did it poorly. There is no proper ""structure"" to the conflict in Fo4 like there is between the Legion and NCR. It goes from 0 to 100, its really weird, one second the game's about finding your son, and then suddenly you're thrust into choosing a side over a conflict that almost seems nonsensical; the entire conflict started because the Institute are just a bunch of dicks killing and replacing people for no reason, Aside from ""we're humanity's best hope"" or ""mankind redefined!"", which are meaningless buzzwords.

It doesn't help that the other factions and their motives aren't really fleshed out either, but at least they're more fleshed out than the Institute. The RR want to save synths, that's all good and such, but they don't have an end goal for what happens after like all of the other factions (seemingly) do. Their security is also abysmal, who the hell thinks that naming your password to your secret base as the same name as the RR is just... Sigh. It makes the RR unintentionally look like complete idiots, no wonder they keep getting destroyed without your help. 

The BoS are at least the most fleshed out... But they're also the most ignorant because they like mass genocide of synths no matter what, which automatically makes them the second worse factions to choose, behind the institute. They also appear super strong with their power armor and vertibirds, but it doesn't help that their vertibirds get shot down all the time by peashooters. That also makes them look like idiots.

You then have the minutemen, which is the best option since you only have to destroy the institute, especially since you're in control of them. But they're also the most boring, irritating faction to deal with, and I don't think I need to say why. Most of their quests are boring radiant shit, and it makes them very shallow. 

But what's the worst is that the Institute makes you the fucking director, yet you can't do shit about it. There is no option to tell the other factions this. If you could, much bloodshed could theoretically be avoided for obvious reasons if you could actually change the direction of the institute (which you can't). This right there is piss poor writing.

Maybe the item is actually only worth that much because demand is low? You don't want to scare the customer away in that case. Or maybe he'll come back later and offer more because he really needs this particular one?

Wanting to get off is certainly a strong drive. However it's also heavily modulated by cognitive inputs.

Human sexual desire seems to be much more complicated than rocket science.

the epa released a report called the tri or ""toxic release inventory"" and listed the top 15 largest polluters.

exxon mobil was 15th, the company who pollutes the least in the usa's top 15.

tyson was 2nd. 

cargill inc. was 4th. perdue was 8th. mccain was 9th. pilgrims pride corp was 11th. us foods was 12th. all factory farms.


have you ever wondered if the media has been lying to you? well, they haven't exactly been lying, they just haven't reported on the companies who control the american diet because they literally pay them not to.


to put this into perspective this is how many pounds were directly released into the water between 2010-2014: exxonmobil: 15,363,763 lbs. tyson inc: 104,468,239 lbs. all 6 factory farms listed: 266,717,602 lbs.

Možda je generalni problem u srpskim političarima? Postoji još jedna garnitura u Srbiji - i to je to! To su te vaške koje sisaju krv po institucijama u administrativnom centru zemlje, ostali (manje prepoznatljivi) predstavljaju činovnički aparat jer nemaju dovoljno poverenja u stranačko rukovodstvo da bi se uputili u BG. Možda ne deluju tako, ali su makar pošteni prema sebi ako i ne pokušavaju da stave glavu u *osinjak*, dok neki tamo Vučići i Dačići ni ruke ne zaprljaju.

Hteli smo demokratiju i tranziciju ka evropskom modelu ekonomije, te kulturi njihovog sistema vrednosti - i eto! Sad gledamo u neke njuške i mislimo se - *e, a da li su oni sedeli skrštenih ruku dok nas je murija jurila po ulicama?* - a suština je da oni ni tada, a ni sada **nisu deo nas**.  
*Opcija II* je da se glave kotrljaju po kaldrmi kao u 19. veku, pa bi vladu konstituisali političari kojima glava još uvek leži na ramenima. Al' onda treba neko otvoreno da kaže kakvi su to interesi potpuno suprotni onim zapadnim - i koliko će to da košta srpsku decu.",1462061235

"history","t5_2qh53","That is a good question and with much googling I cannot find a solid answer. Throughout the preceding century, the purity of silver in solid coins was showing a marked decline. It might have been to make a silver-looking coin that would not be so junky looking after the minting process, or to address the fact that silver coins were too valuable for smaller purchases. Either way it does seem like it was a primarily superficial cause. Regarding wearing off, perhaps it was unexpected, or if known, maybe it was assumed the coins would not stay in circulation for a long enough time to be an issue.

I'd love to hear from a historian or numismatist if they have a real answer.",1462061237

"politics","t5_2cneq","Many liberal arts degrees result in [expected lifetime earnings](https://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acsbr11-04.pdf) that are significantly more than a high school degree alone. 

For example, if you major in Arts &amp; Media (doesn't get more arts than that, right?) you can expect to earn 1.8x as much as a high school graduate or as much as 2.3x as much depending on career choice.

Further, the absolute *lowest* expected earnings are for some of the most absolutely critical professions as far as societal success is concerned (teaching, community service, etc). 

The [median cost of a bachelor's degree is $64k](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnebersole/2012/08/08/why-a-college-degree/#649e31a64a82). At a effective tax rate of 20%, that means ""the tax payer"" breaks even around a lifetime earnings of $320k. 

And this doesn't even take into account the deferred benefit of more people having retirement savings, contributing to health care, and building the skills needed in a post industrial economy. 

Or the savings and benefits to society of lower crime and associated expenses, a more educated and participant voter base, and a slew of other externalities correlated with higher education.

"singapore","t5_2qh8c","Tifu by making a shitty pun

I went zouk ytd, met an ang moh girl through my friend's friend and we hit it off pretty well. After everything we gai gai around the area and started talking... Not sure bout her but I was a little drunk, sober enough to still make conscious, borderline 5/10 rated actions. 

Anyway, we (and our friends) were getting abit tired got a place to sit and were getting a little flirty. Anytime soon action gg happen lo. She mentioned she liked surfing, So i said ""i heard you like surfing, let me surf your net"". Before going in for the kiss. I thought i was smart. She must have thought so too, since we were kissing. 

Well, our friends didnt. They all started laughing the fuck out of my shitty pun ""konk wadafak hahahahahah"" ""omg how u hunt pussy sia wahahaha"" ""cb konk u pro ahahahaha"" ""wah konk pussysurfer hohohooh"" ""wah konk make me wet hahahhaha"" and we were so confused for a moment. When we found out what was going on we started laughing too but wadafuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Mood killed :(

And looking back, my pun wasnt even surfing the SEAS related siaaaaa omg 

And i just woke up and my whatsapp grp is filled with more shittier puns. Im gg be a laughing stock for awhile i guess.

Silver lining i got her number? Maybe ill text her later when im confident with my puns

Joined us after the war and was part of our brilliant side of the late 40s/early 50s winning the league 3 times and getting to the semi finals of the first ever European cup (now the champions league) becoming the first British goalscorer in the competition in the process. 

He retired a one club man and became our manager in 1971 winning the league cup in '72 and giving the club some memorable European nights. ''Turnbull's Tornadoes'' as that side of the 70's was dubbed are still talked about regularly, probably the last time Hibs will ever be a real force domestically and in Europe. They defeated our horrible neighbours Hearts 7-0 on their own turf in the 1973 new year derby, the greatest game in history. 

I wish I had watched his team play, must have been amazing. Met him a few times outside Easter Road in the mid naughties and he had this amazing aura around, I was almost afraid to talk to him. Incredible person and no one has done more for Hibs than him. 

He sadly passed away in April 2011, RIP Ned.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Well for starters, Wilson technically graduated from NC State.  His bachelors degree reads ""North Carolina State University.""

Also, Wilson had an amazing career at State.  Difference between his State/Wisconsin teams was that he actually had an offensive line to throw/run behind in Winscy.  The story of him transferring is a long one and one many State fans do not like retelling, but basically it came down to this: either Glennon or Wilson was going to transfer.  Wilson wanted to pursue his baseball career during the spring and had one year of eligibility left whereas Glennon was going to be there for spring ball and had two years of eligibility left.  While everyone has their own opinion on the situation, Coach TOB told Wilson he could come to spring ball and be the starter or come back in the Fall and start camp as Glennon's backup.  There are a lot of factors that play into the situation such as what if RW kills it in the minors during the Summer and Glennon (who had enough credits to graduate and play immediately for two years at that time) transfers and kills it at whatever school he goes to?  Of course, the rest is history, both are in the NFL and I root for both to do well as they are both great representatives of the University. ",1462061241

The machine I referenced above comes with a 32gig SSD. If you need more storage, you could easily plug in a low-profile USB drive, which would be less prone to failure than SD/MicroSD as a general rule of thumb, anyway. You could even use a cheap USB card reader.

But if having an SD slot is a deal-breaker, there are obviously other machines out there.

edit: Do people actually use SD cards and USB drives these days by plugging them into their machines? If so, is everyone in their youth or a student? When I need to access something that's not on my physical machine, I'm usually grabbing it wirelessly - either from my phone or from something plugged into my router at home or travel router on the go.

It's easily one of the best pieces of zombie fiction ever written, only shadowed by World War Z and the first two Day by Day Armageddon books. It's not too long, only about 94,000 words, but because of this I was able to create an extremely coherent and continuous story with no filler or story-derailing nonsense like love triangles or pregnancy / ""pruhtect da baybee"" shit like what's ruining The Walking Dead and Z Nation. I am extremely confident in it, and I am certainly writing for a profit as much as I am a hobby.

It doesn't matter who sets the mark up, because the cannon completely resists debuffs, but try and get someone with high crit chance to hit it each turn, because critting it is the key to making the battle go faster.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Actually, according to AMD and Intel, running a GPU or AMD chip at 100% for more than one hour, without cooling to keep the temp far below max., will *significantly* degrade the chip as they are not designed for that kind of stress.  Only their server class chips can handle that.  Mere counsumer rated equipment is designed for 100% peaks, but not sustained usage.  


I questioned both manufacturers when Dragon Age: Origin came out and I noticed it was running at 97-100% CPU utilization, continually.  Both companies had to contact their techs to discuss this, and were shocked when they tried the game themselves and saw what was going on.  It was before GPU mining became a thing.
I doubt either company is now granting us server-class components, at the same rates. ;P

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","As much as I think it's overrated, Undertale brings great attention to the problem with violence as the default mechanic in videogames.

Uncharted is a perfect example a game that is really hurt by this violence as the default game mechanic. We have a charming protagonist whose persona is completely at odds with him being a genocidal psychopath super soldier. Also the raw number of dudes the antagonists can hire makes no sense.

They should really think of something else to be the core gameplay loop here. Bioshock infinite is another game hampered by this violence as a default mechanic (though that game is terrible for many other reasons)",1462061252

The issue is that I can only detach *all* of the clamp-o-trons at the same time. I can get the second attachment, but then when I decouple both clamp-o-trons release rather than just the one I wanted to let go of.

"nrl","t5_2qn90","The bunker got this wrong and i believe they simply forgot the new rule. Which is a bit of a worry because they are supposed to be professional refs. 

In 2016 a rule was brought in response to a controversial field goal last year where the warriors basically had half the team line up in the play the ball to protect johnson. The nrl said that under the current laws the warriors play was legal. It comes down to a judgement call if any of those players obstructed the roosters but blocking like that in an onside position is not per se illegal. 

Excuse me using the roar website instead of nrl.com but if one googles ""rule changes 2016"" they can get the source dirext from the nrl 

http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/02/10/nrl-announce-new-rules-for-the-2016-season/

Other rule changes that will be seen in trials will be brought into effect from Round 1.

The first is that teams will no longer be allowed to create a wall in an attempt to stop field-goal charge downs.

The rule allows that “if two or more players form a wall (side by side) next to the play the ball and don’t allow the opportunity for a defending player to move directly towards the player in possession, the referee will penalise for obstruction”.

_______

Now clearly there was a wall  set up (excuse potato quality) http://i.imgur.com/3hIfiHr.jpg under the current rules vaughan is allowed a clear run at wallace by the most direct route which isnt the route he was forced to take. So even if merrin doesnt make contact its a black and white penalty. 

We had a million chances to win that game so whatever right but the bunker got that wrong and i can only think they forgot the rule. ",1462061257

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Two major things are different now:

1.  The bandwidth to actually drive an eGPU is now available in an external port

Bandwidth was doable on TB1 and TB2, but with TB3 it's high enough that you don't have to worry that your $800 GPU won't be able to output at max consistently.  

To me, the port was the main issue.  It was an uncommon port that wasn't often found outside of Macs, but now that it's going into the newest USB standard it'll be everywhere so it's just a matter of putting the TB chip on board to enable it on that port.  And even better, TB3 should be enabled on the CPU with Intel's next chipset so you shouldn't even have to worry about putting an extra chip just to enable TB3 since it'll be native on die.

Quality of life continues to improve for the poor, as a result of improvements made to society as a whole. I believe if our society was determined to make everyone equal, we would slow overall improvement, and in the end the poor would be no better off. ",1462061260

I can't see alternative energy industries seeing any net positive fast enough to overcome the dangers we're facing.

"Calgary","t5_2qn40","Just a note: I am also one of GDX Edmonton's organizers, and I'd just like to add a few points about why we are doing GDX.

For the Calgary folks who might be wondering what Edmonton is doing advertising in a Calgary sub-Reddit. As /u/TerminalPlantain mentions, even though we are an Edmonton group, we are Alberta focused.

We have incorporated a not-for-profit society called the Walkthrough Entertainment Society for the Interactive Arts that seeks a province-wide approach to pushing our cultural/tech industries. We strongly believe that economic diversification requires a provincial strategy that meets the needs of both of our major urban centers (and our smaller urban centres too!). To build a truly sustainable ecosystem, we need developers in close proximity so that we can tap the talent-pools of both cities. We want game development to come to all of Alberta, not just one place. And, we need game development to flourish from our post-secondaries, to our small-to-medium sized indie studios, and of course...AAA studios.

To this end, we have Calgary's own Calgary Game Dev group coming on up! Extra Life will also be running indie tournaments for AsterVoid 2000 by Calgary's own Mad Capacity and Calgary's own Super Banzai by Piecemeal Games. VividHelix, Banyango Games, and even more Calgary studios that I'm forgetting will be coming up.

We &lt;3 Calgary too! :) Help us make Alberta game development a thing, and come to the event to check out and support our provincial developers!",1462061261

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","AJ Styles:
AJ Styles is having a match with Tyler Breeze on RAW, and after he loses clean to Tyler, he sits in the middle of the ring crying. After 1 minute of this, out comes a surprise return from Brodus Clay dancing towards the ring. He gets in the ring, helps AJ up, then proceeds to dance in front of AJ to cheer him up. Next, AJ decides to join in too and him and Brodus share a moment of dancing in the middle of the ring. After a match or two later, the backstage camera pans to AJ and Brodus talking to each other, and basically what happens is that brodus gives AJ a red hat, similar to one that lord tensai. AJ Styles has officially joined Brodus Clay as his tag team partner. Next week on RAW, towards the middle of the show, Styles and Brodus come out dancing. However, AJ has an entire new look and gimmick. He is no longer called AJ Styles, he is now known as the Funky Styles and is completely decked out in Brodus clay's gear.  After they started off their segment by dancing, out come Fandango and Goldust. They're furious. They claim that they're the real dancers of WWE, and they challenge Brodus/The funky style to a dance off on the pre show of Wrestlemania 33. At WM, Goldust and Fandango win the dance off, sending Brodus/The funky style to the back in a mess. BOOM. Fantasy Booking :)

Edit: AHHHH SHIT. I never read the part where you said don't change their gimmick. My bad. But I'm not gonna do another because this took to long to make. Enjoy ",1462061262

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","Honestly, both.  Eventually.  

Morrowind is an older game and a lot of people playing now couldn't cope with the dice-roll to-hit combat (if you roll a mage and try to smack something with a spear, you'll miss almost every attack whereas if you make a character with high Agility and are using a favored weapon, you'll do much better), not to mention that the stamina bar controls success for damn near everything--so if you sprint around and get into combat, prepare to have your spells fail and so on.  

It's pretty ugly, but that and the above can be solved by mods.  There are still quite a few around if you look.  And Morrowind has the advantage of being so old that damn near anything can run it now.  

[Dark Souls I actually reviewed pretty recently.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/211420/)  The big question--are you patient?  The game presents its challenge through a limitation of resources (healing and magic casts) and retreating is basically resetting the area.  You will have to pay attention to enemy movements in order to know when's safe to attack and when you should block/roll.  No on-the-spot or last-room-visited respawning, but at least death isn't crippling.  

DkS1 can be played online or semi-online, but you'll almost need the DSCM to play with others given the shoddy state of networking.  It's not necessary but it's pretty nice to help/be helped with a boss, and having someone invade you can be interesting too.  At least it's almost entirely opt-in.  

The port is kinda bad and you really should have a controller to play it (though there are mods to fix the KB+M controls).  I never ran it above 30FPS and I didn't have a problem, but some people wouldn't let it go.  

They're both great games and you can't go wrong with either one, just they're both dated in their own ways even if DkS1 is newer.  You have a map in MW but none in DkS, but then you don't really need it since it's not exactly open-world (more like a massive dungeon versus Hyrule Field with dungeons).  Neither game has quest markers, but MW at least gives you directions sometimes and DkS doesn't need them either.  Both games don't have enemies that scale with your level like Oblivion and Skyrim do, but level does matter in Dark Souls for connecting to other people.  But I have no idea if anyone's ever beaten Morrowind at level 1 (without using the absolutely hilarious ways to cheese the game to death I mean).  

DkS might frustrate the hell out of you, but that's not to say that Morrowind doesn't have its share of challenge too.  Just the combat is less nuanced.  You can stock up on potions and just spam those while the game's paused and the enemy is unable to stop you.  You can basically stand with the enemy and trade blows (but you can still move around if you want to kinda play fair).  

So...uh, I guess.  Morrowind if you want a big world to explore or Dark Souls if you want better combat?",1462061269

"vegas","t5_2qhrs","just did this but went to San Francisco instead of LA. So the first two days might be good for you.   
**(day 1)**
Left the Las Vegas Strip, stopped at Red Rock Canyon (very nice), drove on 160 through Pahrump (got gas and a six pack of water). Then drove out Bell Vista road until it intersected with 190 at Death Valley Junction. Continued on 190 into Death Valley. Stopped for sunset at Zabriskei Point. Stayed overnight at the Ranch at Furnace Creek.   
**(day 2)**
Next morning up very early drove to Badwater (its ok, but a 17 mile, each way detour, so its your choice), back on 190, going West, stopped at Mesquite Flats Sand Dunes and briefly at Stovepipe wells. I considered the Mosaic Canyon trail but wanted to get to Bakersfield by evening, maybe next time. Heading West on 190 to Panamint Springs is interesting but from there west out of the park there is a spectacular gain in elevation and the road is very twisty in places. Stopped at Father Crowley point, amazing views. Arrived at the Eastern Sierra visitor center just outside of Lone Pine for maps/guides, had lunch in Lone Pine about 1pm. Snow capped Mt Whitney is quite visible from town. If you have time you might check out movie road in Lone Pine, there have been many Western movies filmed in this area. Headed South on 395 towards Indian Wells. Just past Indian Wells, turned onto 178 which at Lake Isabella follows the Kern river into Bakersfield. This was a spectacular drive, beautiful scenery, lots of cool road turns.  Arrived late in Bakersifeld, had some great Mexican food.    
**(To LA)**
if you want to go to LA, from Bakersfield, I suggest driving towards Santa Maria and then taking the 101 South along the coast, where you could stop in Santa Barbara. An alternative might be driving to Maricopa and then taking 33 through the Los Padres. You will get to the 101 just north of Ventura. But I was heading north so..  
**(day3)**
From Bakersfield, up early again. Drove to Santa Maria on rt 166 and took rt 101 North up through SanLuis Obispo. Then drove up rt 1 and stopped in Morrow Bay for lunch, really nice downtown area with shops and great food. Went north on rt 1, stopped at Hearst Castle(San Simeon). Stayed in the little town of San Simeon (really just a bunch of small hotels).  
**(day4)**
Up early, driving north on rt 1 , Saw lots of elephant sea lions on the beach, just north of San Simeon. Had a quick breakfast at the Ragged Point Inn. Lost count of how many times I stopped along the road - the Big Sur area is simply one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Stopped for lunch at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. Ate sandwiches I bought the night before and walked a trail there into redwoods. Took photos of Mcway Falls. Stopped at Andrew Molera State Park and Pfeiffer beach. After many,many  stops arrived in Monterey. Stayed overnight.  
**(day5)** 
Slept in a bit and spent the morning at the Monterey Aquarium. Then drove North on 1 to Santa Cruz, where I had a late lunch on the boardwalk.  Continued north and stopped at several small state parks (Aneo Nuevo) by the ocean. Arrived pretty late in San Francisco.   
  
**A great trip. You will not be disappointed, you will only wish you had twice as much time.**

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Hold the throttle just lightly enough so that your drive tires are effectively spinning freely and keep the front tires pointed the direction you want to go -- but no further. It is better to not turn the wheel quite far enough than to turn it too far. 

It's hard to do, though. I've only been in that situation a few times, and I spun almost every time. In a car with a lower center of gravity where rollover isn't likely, assuming that you're still generally headed down the road and not toward the shoulder, most people would probably have better luck just slamming the brakes and holding the tires at center. You'll spin, but you'll probably stay on the road.",1462061270

You can hit monuments or scout around while the helo is up since most people willing to risk heading out armed are probably attacking it directly.

IDK, I see a whole lot of QQ about playing solo but after having played with a group of 20+ as well as solo, there are definitely advantages to both.

Thanks as always to [Herms](https://twitter.com/herms98):

* Vegeta's getting ""dragon power"" in DB Heroes? What the heck does that mean?

* South Kaioshin doesn't know who Omni-King is. Elder Kaioshin calls him an idiot.

 * As mentioned last week, ""Omni-King"" is a translation of Zen'ō, meaning King of All There Is.

* As mentioned in Jump leaks, Omni-King is ruler of the 12 universes.

* Omni-King criticizes Beerus and Champa for neglecting their God of Destruction duties

* Omni-King liked the tournament so much, he wants one with contestants from all universes

* &gt;**Beerus:** ""If he felt like it, Omni-King could wipe out all 12 universes in the blink of an eye!""

* &gt;**Cabba:** ""Now you can come to Planet Sadal, master!""  
**Vegeta:** ""Don't call me master""  
**Cabba:** ""Yes master!""  

* So yeah, at some undetermined point in the future they'll have another tournament, so Champa spares his fighters so they can fight next time

* And indeed, the Nameless Planet is the final Super DB

* Much like Dende speaking Namekian, Whis has to summon the dragon using the ""language of the gods""

* They have trouble translating chonmage/""topknot"" into the divine language

* They're inside ""Super Shenlong"" now

* So inside Super Shenlong's planet-sized body, there's his ""nucleus"", a smaller version of the main body

* Beerus wishes to revive U6's Earth, though he lies and tells Bulm and co. he wished for a better bed or some such

* Appropriately enough, next episode Monaka wears Mr. Satan's belt and cape

* Next week: ""The Chaotic Victory Party!  A Showdown At Last?!  Monaka vs Son Goku""

* The ""language of the gods"" used to make wishes with the Super DBs is simply backwards Japanese. Using this method, we can see that Super Shenlong says the same ""Speak thy wish, I shall grant any single wish"" spiel as Shenlong

* During this episode the gold dragon is repeatedly referred to as ""Super Shenlong"" and never as ""Zalama"". So they're probably not the same. (That is, the Super DBs were created by Zalama, and are used to summon Super Shenlong, who is a completely different dragon)

* Also, Omni-King is never explicitly referred to as a god, but I guess we'll just have to assume he is. (It'd be funny if they stressed that he wasn't: ""He's the omnipotent ruler of all creation! Of course he's not a god!"")

* Oh yeah: Omni-King's attendants say ""bye-cha!"" as they depart. [**Spoiler!**](#s ""Foreshadowing of Arale's return?!"")

&gt;[**Next Episode Preview:**](#g) Hey, this is Goku! Oh Monaka, I thought you couldn't come to the party? This is great! Let's spar right away! Hey, what's wrong Piccolo? You're talking real funny. And Vegeta, why are you sweating? What's the matter with everyone today? Next time on Dragon Ball Super: 'The Chaotic Victory Party! A Showdown at Last?! Monaka vs Son Goku!' Don't miss it!

I've seen many talk about how they would never tolerate a monogamous relationship.  They get applauded for saying that.  When a spouse wants to close the relationship, I've never seen _anybody_ say ""well if you really love your wife, and this is important to her, why don't you just hear her out?""  And this is to be expected in a forum like this, it's just not that different from how monogamous people reply to the symmetrical situation.

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","I see a lot of responses that boil down to ""the only way to get consistency and solid code out of a development team is to use a framework"". 

Pardon my bluntness, but that's retarded. 

If your team isn't disciplined enough and talented enough to write good code on their own then the solution isn't to effectively impose rules in the form of a framework, it's to improve your team. Maybe it's a question of leadership that needs to be improved, or maybe it's a lack of training, but these are human problems, not technology problems. 

All this framework craze does is mask the real problem by treating the symptoms and it increased your technical debt over the long term. That's not to say frameworks are inherently bad - they aren't - but if you think you NEED them to get ""good"" results from your team then you're being obtuse and only making matters worse. 

Hire good people, train them, give them good leadership (including defining what constitutes ""good"" code I'm your organization) and provide an environment where excellence is expected. This includes giving them enough time to properly perform their work and an environment where they feel safe and valued. Do this and you don't need to force discipline on them via a framework that isn't really doing anything else of value for you, it'll come  naturally to them. ",1462061278

Original Post:

Author: /u/hardtimehome

**Civil suit came up during rental check**
&gt;Ok. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So I was dumb when I was younger, about 5 years ago, and moved into a super shady apartment with a super shady friend who had a drug and alcohol problem. Both signed the lease and were paying rent. Something happened about halfway through the lease where the landlord (another shady person with a drug and alcohol problem) wasn't addressing the issues with the bedbug problem in the apartment, so me, being an idiot, decided I didn't want to pay rent that month. The problem was eventually solved after a couple months but he would keep asking for the money. With one month left in the lease, we got an eviction (surprise, surprise). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For years, nothing came up on the credit report or the rental check with different apartments and landlords. Just recently though, a prospective place said that there was a civil for possession with my name and roommates name on it and was automatically denied an apartment. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand now that my actions did have consequences, so we can get that out right now. I was completely swayed by how angry at the situation I was and was acting irrationally. The city had to come into the building and force the apartment to do 5k in repairs to the apartment because it was so bad before we moved in (there was an outlet in the shower at eye level for christ's sake). The landlord lost our lease, my roommate lost our lease and wanted us to sign a new one, but I refused at that point. My roommate completely trashed the apartment, I took about a hundred photo's when I moved out. I never received an itemized receipt or the breakdown of the damages or any of our deposit back (about 1300$). I never received phone calls, emails or physical mail about this beyond the original summons earlier, so I didn't know what the outcome was of it or if it was even on my record. Nothing comes up on background checks, nothing under collections, the only thing is under previous landlord/tenant records.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry this is coming off as rambling, I'm just kinda dazed right now. I just want to grow up and try to figure out the best way to go about this. ",1462061283

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","  To be fair, psychopaths are basically anti social people who lack empathy for others and have no remorse for their actions. People with some forms of autism have issues with empathy for other beings but generally can show remorse for actions. Psychopaths can live a seemingly normal life and no one would be the wiser, nor would they be automatically killing people. 
  Now generally from my experience with psychopaths is that they're manipulative narcissistic assholes who will try and ruin your life. The good news is though is that they're really fucking stupid because of their own idea of them being grandiose (and media portrayals of them being clever geniuses). 

  This doesn't mean all psychopaths will act on their manipulative anti social impulses, but those impulses are still there. Like I said they can totally keep these under control if they want to, but since they have no remorse or empathy this usually does not happen. Generally they will only keep these impulses under control if it takes too much energy to do terrible shit or if they are afraid of the consequences on them if they do such things. 

  Now under our current system psychopaths usually find themselves in positions of power (CEO's bosses, managers, police, etc.) but in an anarchist society we don't really have these things so really the only power they can have over someone is either they do something against their consent (drug induced rape for example) or the person consents to it (however unknowingly, such as entering a new relationship with them). 

  However as long as we have support networks with eachother we really shouldn't fear these people and not to mention there's really no room for manipulative assholes since there's literally nothing to gain. Everyone has equal access to ""private"" property and the means of production now. It's pointless if only for your own self gratification. 

  So that's where we might see more psychopaths try and form is inside of relationships (romantic or otherwise) to try and leverage power over certain individuals since there's no more jobs that they gravitate towards, we'll see them pop up elsewhere.

"CODZombies","t5_2sal9","No, insta kill and one hit kill don't mean the same thing. I can't believe you are conflating these two. Popshock is a one hit kill but not an insta kill. Example: it takes one hit to kill the margwas with popshock but there is animation that takes a few seconds before the margwa actually drops dead. The same exact thing goes for the electric shield and the thrashers, one melee with the shield will ""one hit kill"" the thrasher, (aka: it doesn't take more than one hit) but it still takes a few seconds to actually have him drop dead. 
Basically ""one hit"" refers to the number of hits it takes to kill, where as ""insta kill"" refers to one hit instantly killing (no delay).",1462061284

"SonyAlpha","t5_2si08","Are you using native or adapted lenses with the a7SII?  If you're using adapted Canon or Nikon lenses, Fotodiox makes an adapter called the ND Throttle, which contains a VND built-into the adapter.  This means that all your lenses will have VND without an array of filters and/or step-up rings.  They're coming out w/ a smart version for Canon EF/EF-S lenses that will let you AF on APS-C E-mount bodies (will vignette on FE bodies in full-frame).

I use the Nikon version of the adapter with my a7S and A7RII, and it works great, though I do wish they had a smart version for Nikon lenses. I haven't noticed aberrations, but I'm not a pixel-peeper when it comes to video.  Here's [an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iPaxQALggY) with most of the clips using this adapter (hyperlapse and underwater clips in the 2nd half were taken on another camera).

If you do want to go fixed ND or are using native lenses, I agree w/ rakunSA and would recommend stronger ND.  On my a7S with a Voigtlander 15mm f/4, I was using a 10-stop ND filter to get usable video during the day.  Would definitely look into 4/6/8-stop ND for the a7SII since the min ISO is lower than on the a7S.  ",1462061284

"europe","t5_2qh4j","I'm Swiss and it's mainly two things:

1. The idea that Switzerland has a very high number of guns is mainly based on a [wrong wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country). It incorrectly states that Switzerland has 45 per 100 residents and gives ""Small Arms Survey"" as a source. However, if you read this source, which apparently nobody ever does, then you will see that it pretty clearly states that they literally just made this number up. To make it even more dishonest they actually list past studies on the subject that show lower figures but then somehow decide to use the oldest study, which is over 20 years old and claims that there are over 12 million gun (so 150 per 100 residents), which is absolutely ridiculous and laughable. Anyway, they use this outdated, low credibility study to justify their high number. Officially the government estimates 25 per 100 residents and if you look at past studies it's probably a bit higher, around 30. That's still higher than most other European countries, but only by a bit. However, there are a lot of people, especially Americans, that really badly want to keep the myth alive that Switzerland has a crazy amount of guns and still low crime rates.

2. The gun culture is totally different to the US. In fact most guns are pretty old rifles as it was tradition that men would keep their rifles after the mandatory military service. It was basically a souvenir. People that own more recent guns are mainly using them in shooting clubs or in sports. Shooting clubs are more like bowling clubs where the shooting is just some activity but it's actually about socializing. And sports is about sports. People that own guns to brag about it or even want to use them to defend themselves are widely considered to be crazy and dangerous. I think that's the biggest difference to the US where people are literally actively encouraged to shoot each other.",1462061288

Easily one of my favorite new games last year.  I just love games that let you play pacifist runs, and the fact that they made it work in that quasi-JRPG format was even better.

Stardew Valley was another one that I never really followed, picked it up the day it came out because why not, dumped 70+ hours into it in two weeks.  It does Harvest Moon better than many actual Harvest Moon games.  ",1462061289

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","The GTX 970 actually has 3.5GB of VRAM. Nvidia sort of fucked the design a bit, the last 512MB is much slower than the rest. Makes the 8GB of the R9 390 look even better. 

VRAM usage isn't at the point where it matters though, 3.5GB is enough that 1080p is completely fine and most stuff at 1440p is also fine. By the time your GPU is using that much VRAM you are probably going to have performance issues with the GPU core itself.

For performance always check actual head to head reviews.

GTX 970 vs R9 390 by [AnandTech](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1594?vs=1595). As you can see, the cards are essentially equal. The 390 does have some minor advantages in some titles at 1440p but the 970 has advantages in other areas, particularly 1080p, power consumption, and noise.

European pricing is a bit of pain, I deal with a similar situation being Canadian. Use PCPP to check prices if your country is supported, some things like 390 vs 970 change cost per country. If you need to save some money I have two suggestions.

1. Get a 250GB SSD instead of 500GB.

2. Get a smaller monitor with lower resolution. Don't go above 23 inch if you stay on 1080p, the pixel density is too low in my opinion and the image is not crisp. 21"" 1080p and 27"" 1440p are great to look at.",1462061295

I feel like I have a good pool of units, but at the same time, I seem to be struggling with content, so my guess is I'm sucking at putting together a good squad.

Currently I'm running an almost mono thunder with:

* Eze lead (boost Atk &amp; Spark damage, spark critical, boost thunder elemental damage)[enhancements are: 20%parameters, 70% spark damage, enhance spark damage buff on bb/sbb]

* Immortal Beast Sargavel (Status cleanse/null, boost in bb gauge fill rate)

* Galvanic Belle Lafiel (50% damage reduction, spark damage boosts bb guage, damage taken boosts bb gauge)

* Rize (very good damage, def ignore, and HoT)

* Tridon (shield, bc/hc drop rate boost, and 150% def boost)

I only just pulled [Mikael](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Storm_Champion_Mikael), but I think he'd be good to replace Lafiel and Tridon. I would lose the shield, but I should see a good increase in my defense. His SBB is also single target, which I've read is good for the late game raids and such. I have a second Rize that I can throw in to replace the slot. Good or bad idea?

I also just pulled a [Sirius](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Tartarus_Massacre_Sirius), and 2 [Nyami's](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Cat_Nyami). I've also heard great things about these units, but I'm not sure how to best implement them in a squad with the units that I have.

I know Sirius is getting an Omni Evolution, so I'm going to raise him up, regardless.

I'm currently on:

* Trial No. X4/ Trial No. 004
* Grand Quest:
* Four Heroes of Palmyna / 20% clear with Ten-Winged Tormentor (stuck on the Hundred Tailed Chimera or whatever the heck that thing is).
* and I'm RC3, but I think that's just because I don't really raid as much as I should be.

I know this is posted late. Hopefully someone will see it.

I'd also appreciate some suggestions for which unit to pick for UoC. I was thinking [Allanon](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Loremaster_Allanon). He adds all elements to attack and boosts elemental weakness damage for 3 turns, greatly recovers HP &amp; slightly boosts OD gauge, which is all so enticing.

Maybe a squad with Allanon/Nyami/Sirius/Mikael(converts even more atk to def with sirius buff up)/Eze? ",1462061297

Improbable things happen all the time. That's how it works. If we know the probability of surviving a certain type of cancer is 1 in 10,000, then for every ten million people worldwide who get this type of cancer there will be one thousand people who survive it. That's a lot, enough for quite the large support and survivors group.

That's not because of a miracle, not because anybody prayed or ay deity intervented, instead, that's because that's how the math works out.

For the person who won last week's lottery, he or she had a one in hundreds of millions of probability of winning it. Yet they won. Not because they prayed, or because of a deity. Because of math. That's not a miracle, that's how the thing is intentionally set up. *Someone* will win eventually.

I'm not religious myself but , just like Christmas, this is like a regular (not sure if the right word) holiday that even non-religious people get  ""dragged into"" to spend time with their families and take part in all those easter-y things.",1462061299
"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Not at all, I think your suggestion is a fair one! Though a few points i'd like to discuss! I wouldn't mind them calling it Kraken 1/2/3 etc, it would serve the purpose of giving each season a unique identifier which is all I was suggesting. However Kraken 3 gives no chronological indication as to how far into the games life cycle we are, I quite like the idea of knowing exactly where we are (though i think that's purely a preference). Though I don't think the length of ""S145"" would really be as much of an eye-sore as you might think. The UI is already full of larger numbers, your gold is almost always 3 figures, your win ratio on heroes is normally 7 characters (236/500) and adding in a badge somewhere with 4/5 characters seems okay to me. 

I think the year button switching between wild and standard is very aesthetically pleasing, I have no doubt Blizzard could find a suitable position for a season counter somewhere.

However i think we can both agree, something would be far more preferable to the nothing we have currently :)",1462061299

"BleachBraveSouls","t5_399jv","his stamina is a base 718 so assuming 3 cookies (since the average person can get them unlike the 5 star accessories/chappies) of the right type that would be 10%, 16% and 20% respectively would be about 1049 stamina (rounding up) adding in the damage reduction would make it so he is able to take 1553, in pvp his health is x10 so that makes his base health 10490 which would allow him to take about 15526. that is also not factoring in his defense though which is rather high and would lower the damage even further. I would be interested to see where in the process damage reduction % happened, if it is calculated before defense that would be even better since defense is a linear damage reduction ie attack-defense but damage reduction is multiplicative so the higher the damage number the more it reduces so if it calculates first than it would give more of a boost.

On a ironic note the whole reason i check Reddit so often is for a break from my math homework since i get sick of numbers.... so i come on and here and do math *facepalm*

You need products like [this](http://www.nacinc.com/) for starters.  Then you need the video processing software - FreeD software is often used for the ""3D effects), that's just the start.

Then you need the actual cabling.  And then the installation costs - you can't just string co-ax from the multiple locations (including on or very hear the goals posts) across the turf, over the barrier and up the concrete steps.  The list goes on and on.

$1,000 is laughable.  Most professional AV companies, let alone world class firms specialising in sports, wouldn't even reply to an email from the AFL for that.

“In following guidelines laid out by the Washington Human Right Commission, the person did not exhibit a gender presentation or gender identity consistent with gender of the locker room as was asked to leave that locker room,” said Gunner Scott, transgender advocate and former LGBT Commission for the City of Seattle. 
The definition of Gender Identity in the Washington Human Right Commission guidelines on page 25-
quote: Gender Identity: A person’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else.
Note: Because gender identity is internal, a person’s
gender identity is not necessarily visible to others. unquote 

He did not exhibit a gender identity, the guidelines clearly said exhibit ..also I'm going to use the term gender presentation. The guidelines have a section with about 15 definitions of Trans &amp; gender terms to help""avoid confusion"" and ""gender presentation"" isn't one of them..So that should help everyone's confusion ..Everything worked perfectly, nothing is confusing...Honestly though not only is this a legal mess..people seem afraid to point it out.

That's why the two countries' designs are so similar; one just copied the other to make sure they weren't short-changing themselves.

The first and only flight of the Бура́н (which described both the operational vessel *and* the program itself) took place on November 15^th 1988 and was totally automated and unmanned. This was the first time such a feat had been accomplished and it included the automated runway landing, which was only around 12 metres off-target even in a strong 17ms^-1 crosswind. The orbiter went around Earth twice and spent three hours and thirty-one minutes in space.

Ultimately the dissolution of the СССР in 1991 led to the cancelation of the Бура́н program, and the only functioning Russian space shuttle was left in a hangar at the Космодро́м Байкону́р (Baikonur Cosmodrome) in Kazakhstan, where it was destroyed in a storm when the roof collapsed.

But in order to get into court, this would have to happen first: You'd have to demand a refund, and the company would have to refuse, then you'd have to sue them. Would a customer ever do this? Unlikely, unless you were trying to punish them, or you really were a complete dick. And would the company ever refuse to settle out of court? Unlikely, unless they felt you had been taking advantage of them for a long time, and they wanted to put a stop to it. To really put a stop to it, they'd have to file a countersuit. I suppose they'd have to charge you with filing a frivolous lawsuit or something like that.

I understand his logic, but I honestly don't care what is causing it because I'm beyond sick from it. I'd rather just be put on meds and not care why, because I've been fighting several doctors on this for almost a year now. I completely agree with you that I don't see why with my tsh and ft4 so out of range he hasn't given me medication yet, but I guess I should give him credit for trying to fix it other ways first. I have tested my antibodies once each, and they were normal. However, I'd like to retest them as I am not convinced I don't have Hashi's. He did test my t3, but I can't remember what he said it was and I never had him give me a copy. My tsh hasn't not gone up anytime we did blood tests, so I'm positive it will go up again this time as we haven't tested it in a month or so. Worst case scenario, he prescribes me hypo meds next time and he just won't give me a high enough dosage, then at that point I'll just see other endos until they up my dosage.

The problem stems from the fact that the path you will take through space depends not only on your position, but also on your velocity. So you could be right next to Earth and still on a course to outside the area where the Sun's gravitational influence is dominant, and you could be at something like 1.8 ly out from the Sun, very tenuously bound and if your velocity is just right, you're still technically in a closed orbit around the Sun! It's of course important to note that velocity means not only the rate at which you travel, but also in which *direction* you travel.

Funnily enough, the Earth actually moves *faster* than Voyager with respect to the Sun! The reason we aren't cut loose is because we don't have the right combination of *position* and *velocity* to set ourselves free! Not sure if we want that yet though!",1462061318

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Now you're playing the victim?

This sub has been taken over by SJWs.

Let me ask you something, seriously. Do you think President Trump would jail a Christian woman for refusing to sign a marriage license because she had a religious issue with it?

Furthermore, do you think President Trump would allow a $150,000 fine (which puts them out of business) on a baker who didn't want to make a cake for a gay couple because it went against their religious beliefs?

The answer? **FUCK NO.**

Do we know what the first amendment of the Constitution is? There's more to it than just ""freedom of speech"".

&gt;The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, **impeding the free exercise of religion,** abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

Now if the government is forcing someone to do something that goes against their religious beliefs, I'd say that's pretty textbook definition of impeding the free exercise of their religion.

This whole Kim Davis issue was just another example of the regressive left attacking the original bill of rights. They're after 2A, they're after 4A, and they're even after 1A. Trump frequently makes note of this during his rally speeches. He also makes note of the fact the Christianity is constantly under attack.

They wouldn't ever make a muslim shave their beard, and they wouldn't ever make a jew take off their kippah.

I can't believe that I need to spell out the most basic of conservative principles in the Trump subreddit.

I also can't believe that I'm being fucking down voted. It's amazing the direction this sub has turned once the bernouts started filing in in droves and supporting Trump because the ""cool"" thing to do.",1462061320

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","&gt; That surely depends on the non democracy and the military occupation. I would argue they are fundamentally the same.
&gt; It would be a better outcome for who? Improve the status quo for who? I dont consider trading military occupation for non democracy an improvement.

There are similarities, but there also are major differences.  Jordanian citizens benefit from more civil rights than do West Bank residents.

&gt; Which is the case because Hamas has taken complete control of the area. I dont see how that would be fixed by giving Palestinians a state.

Gaza's extreme poverty is a result of Israel's blockade.  Israel is blockading Gaza because it is at war with Hamas.  If Israel was able to come to a peace agreement with Hamas, it could lift the blockade.  I don't think peace with Hamas is impossible, despite their extreme ideology.  There may also be a regime change some day, who knows.

&gt; I dont follow. What is Jordan going to do about settlers that will stop the violence?
&gt; I dont believe that either. Jordan annexing the West Bank doesnt solve the security problems in the West Bank.

Fatah's security forces are not effective enough to police Palestinian extremists.  They also struggle to openly coordinate with Israeli security forces to stop settler attacks.  Jordanian police forces would be much more effective in both respects.

&gt; Lets be clear. If the Palestinians were as antagonistic to the Jordanian government as they were to the Israeli government, they would be treated worse. If Palestinians treated the Israeli government the way they treat the Jordanian government, they would be be treated much much better.

I don't doubt that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan

However, I anticipate Palestinians being much more antagonistic to the Israeli government than they would be to the Jordanian government in the event that either annexed the West Bank.

&gt; Not really. As soon as the Palestinians have elections, they will have more democracy than Jordan.

That's a bit of a tautology.  The fact is that currently Palestinians have less democracy than Jordanians.

&gt; Dont the majority of Palestinians want the end of the Jewish state?

Yes, but that doesn't mean they'd accept Israeli citizenship.

http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/new-palestinian-poll-shows-hardline-views-but-some-pragmatism-too

A majority of Palestinians support the establishment of a Palestinian state in place of Israel, but only a small minority desire to live in a binational state in which they'd have equal rights with Israeli jews.

Consider the Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem.  Very few of their occupants have applied for citizenship.  Similarly, it's likely that in the event of Israeli annexation of the West Bank, very few would accept citizenship initially.

I'm still in favor of annexation, as I believe more Palestinians would naturalize as tensions calm over time.

&gt; Yea good luck with that.

Israel has made secular reforms to the benefit of ethnic and religious minorities in the past, and it can do it again.  Israeli citizens benefit from more civil rights and religious freedoms than do citizens of most other countries in the region.

&gt; Well as long as Jews from around the world have more rights than Arabs born there, no amount of secular reforms will make a difference.

Israeli Jews will never willingly give up the Jewish law of return.  The majority of Israelis are descended from refugees who fled to Israel, whether from Russian pogroms, the Holocaust, or from the waves of violence against jews which spread across the Middle East and North Africa post 1948.  It was only a month ago that Israel airlifted jews from Yemen after they were targeted for violence.

However, the existence of a Jewish law of return does not rule out the existence of a Palestinian right of return, which I do believe is necessary in order to achieve peace in the long run.

Other than that, the major roadblocks to equality are things like marriage laws, housing discrimination, and unequal funding of public services, none of which seem like insurmountable challenges.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The [AMA with the writers](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2hgqsi/hi_we_are_the_creator_designer_of_bojack_horseman/) a while back was pretty good to read. Bojack Horseman was actually supposed to be a dumb show in the first half of the first season, just a silly irreverent comedy with very little development. It was done on purpose so the viewer would be lulled into a false perception of the show so they wouldn't see that mid-season gut punch coming. It was a very risky narrative stunt that could not have worked on any medium other than a Netflix binge-watch, and unfortunately, a lot of people did end up giving up on the show after a few episodes. I almost gave up too, which made the mid-season reveal especially unexpected and poignant for me.

So I don't blame people for not liking the first season on their first watch-through. The majority of reviews for the show were negative, but that's because the reviewers were only given the first five episodes in advance to form an opinion. So of course it reviewed terribly.

When the full season was released, the unexpectedly positive word of mouth and viewers raving about the season's second half caught these reviewers' attention. The Onion AV Club, for instance, lampooned the show on its initial impression, but actually changed the review from a D+ to a B after giving it a second chance with a full season viewing. Also, because of Bojack Horseman's strategically devised tonal change in its first season, The Onion AV Club revised their television reviewing methodology for Netflix shows, pledging to watch the entire season before publishing a review.

Many other reviewers followed suit, and it showed. [Season One](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman) got a 58 on Metacritic, and that's because the reviewers only based their opinion on the first half of the season. After seeing the entire season and amending their impression of the show, it's apparent that reviewers were willing to give more patience to Bojack and absorb the entire season before giving an opinion. On Metacritic, [Season two](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-2) surged up to a 90.

Bojack really is quite a game-changer in TV entertainment.",1462061323

There's no absolute authority on any language, and that's a beautiful thing. If you think that there is and that it's taught in English class I'd ask you which English class. Because each is different. You can defend the standard all you want, but when the standard changes will you? Do you accept the recent addition to the definition of literally? Or is it still a mistake for you? 

In my mind unless there's misunderstanding, there's no mistake. That's it. So because I understood what you were saying (at least I hope I did) then there aren't any mistakes. The standard exists for good reason, to clear up misunderstanding, but the standard is built using words. Since they standardize words with those same words, there's no guarantee any of us truly understand each other. As far as I can tell we get pretty close, but I don't know. So defend your flawed standard, and I'll go back to making up words. ",1462061325

Celestation actually thinks that hot healing on tanks is significant enough to be used as an example of a BrM strength.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out Celestation has no idea what he's talking about. It's one thing to design a tank spec on paper but it's another thing entirely to make it viable comparative to other tanks in serious content.  

What happens when a BrM inevitably gets 1-shot from ~70% hp in Legion and the raid leader asks why me and the other healers didn't top him off? Are we supposed to say ""he's meant to be injured and he should of ran into orbs"". I bet that will go over real well.  ",1462061326

Because at the end of the day, this is the same thing. The attempt at alienation of people because of the ""Consequences"" of what they said. The only difference between blacklisting people because they vote for Trump or whatever, and blacklisting people because they support communism is that you agree with one arbitrary view point, and disagree with another.

Also, Alexis was speaking out AGAINST such behavior. At the time of a lot of free speech laws being drawn up in various countries, the idea of ""Tyranny of the majority."" was a very major concern, and a lot of the laws written designed to stop this (Not very well because, you know, the laws were written in an entirely different world with different issues).

Adventure, Drama [1 h 30 min]  
Craig Anthony Olejnik, Stephen McHattie, Gary Farmer, Roy Dupuis  
Director: Louis Bélanger

&gt; After his father's death, innocent Martin Bishop is left with nothing financially. He is however left with his father's belief that ""if a man loses everything but still chooses to do what's right, then he's lost nothing at all"", a belief to which Martin clings. He decides to head north to take a job on one of the Great Slave Lake Railroad's remote construction crews, working as its timekeeper, the person who keeps the records of hours worked for payroll. Martin quickly learns of the rampant corruption at his camp, led by the sadistic foreman, Fisk, who orders Martin to inflate his hours worked, and keep on the payroll those men who he has banished from the camp in order to pocket their wages. Those banished men are left to fend for themselves since they are provided no means of transportation out and have no money. They survive living off the scraps of food from the camp's dump, which is why they're referred to as the ""garbage eaters"". After Martin thinks that Fisk has killed one of the garbage eaters, Martin decides to do what he believes is right by going against Fisk and mobilizing the disparate group of garbage eaters, all at the risk of his personal safety. What may be working on Martin's side are the facts that he has been able to tame Fisk's security and attack dog, King, and that the camp's cook, Prudhomme, who has his own demons, dislikes the sight of human blood.

"wine","t5_2qhs8","Not at all! No topic was off limits for the questions. Multiple choice was fairly obscure actually. I don't know if that's the norm but there were lots of really specific questions, e.g., aging requirements in different areas of Spain, regions in Germany in which certain bottle types were made, etc.

The short answers for me contained a long question about fino sherry, another about moscado d'asti, and tokaji versus eiswein from Mosel. All contained at least one question on the methods of production and/or reasons why it is made that way (e.g., climate usually). There was also a question on cool climate viticulture generally. Another section talked about drinking and responsibility.

Another put you in a scenario in which you were buying wine for a restaurant's wine list, specifically Burgundy and an AC non-cru Beaujolais. It asked you to come up with villages from which you'd buy some premium Pinots and write a pretend tasting note for a mature one. Then a middle-of-the-road priced Chardonnay and why you'd choose that, and explain how the Beaujolais you picked was likely produced.

Now, I got lucky. All of those things I feel pretty well versed on. Had they asked me anything extensive about Bordeaux I'd be scratching my head. So whether it was fairly hard or fairly easy is based on perspective. 

All this said, I think if you're pretty dedicated and keeping up with reading, the chances of passing are pretty high. They make it challenging but fair.",1462061332

I think that yes, you are on the right track with async/await and babel.  You will definitely need to understand callbacks and promises, but nothing you said leads me to believe you don't understand them.

You are going to get pushback from a significant percentage of the Node community with regard to async/await with babel since a lot of people have decided they are going to avoid that and wait until it gets implemented in Node.  But I am here to assure you that there are also quite a few of us who _are_ using async/await with babel with success for some time.  I believe it is the cleanest solution.

If you want something that is a little more popular with some people then you can look into generators/yield to do the same thing without babel.  But again I personally think async/await is cleaner code and my preference.",1462061332

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt; We don't even know if collegia and other organizations were actually banned altogether during the Triumvirate and the collegia we see in the Principate are actually completely new and unrelated organizations!

Yes, that does seem very odd suggestion. I mean, Republican Rome already had pretty complex adminstrative structures (as a rather funny example: I was just today watching Mary Beard's new documentary on Rome's Imperialism and she presented a c. 200 BC ram from a Roman war ship that they recently discovered from the bottom of the sea, and even that had a engraved text: ""checked by the officer Q. S. in charge of quality supervision"", haha!)  and economy - so, you'd expect there to be *lots* of professional institutions and associations with varying degrees of officiality regulating and facilitating commerce, with an investment in the local politics. I don't really see how these associations could just disappear without *very* heavy handed involvement by the State, which I doubt anyone had the time for during the chaotic dying years of the Republic, plus you'd imagine our sources mentioning something. My guess is that perhaps the existing forms of professional organisations sort of started 'intensifying' and gaining more and more relevance towards and during the empire for a number of reasons; when senators lost political powers, perhaps simply associating yourself with someone with big shoes in a high place was not as easy or effective way of protecting your professional interests any more; perhaps the growth of the empire made the markets bigger, wealthier, and more international, which also called for unionising; perhaps new bureaucracy and regulation of *collegia* forced groups to articulate themselves in more specific frameworks which brought about a new consciousness of group identities. And all this is the reason why we get such an abundance of *collegia* promoting themselves through epigraphy etc. in the imperial era. So, the Republican *collegia* surely must have continued on, but of course we'll probably never know in what form exactly :P Ah the joys of being an ancient historian!

&gt; So our sources on collegia drop off the radar for a couple of decades and when the collegia reappear they're totally different, being highly regulated and consciously non-political.

Quite interestingly, there's a lot of election graffiti in Pompeii where professional groups vouch for some candidate or another. I can't remember does any of the groups call themselves *collegium*, but there are definitely groups like fruit-vendors, shoemakers, textileweavers etc. getting behind a candidate as one body. So, there's probably still some sort of patron/client relationship between politicians and professional groups going on, at least on local level. ",1462061333

- One nice die roll with a nice die shape.

Cons:

The point I'm making with Wrath is, if you have Fran's SBs (especially Shatterheart and Mist Overload), are you going to want to run her as a DPS or use her as a debuffer? It would be better to use her as a debuffer because she has a weak base Attack (147 @ lvl 80) and has a weak weapon selection. So unless you have 5* RS daggers or bows for every realm you use her in, it's probably a better idea to just stick her in the back with a bow. She has no Combat, so her most useful DPS ability would be Dismissal. But then that doesn't fill her gauge very fast either. 

I'm arguing that using Wrath+P/MBD and Ace Striker on a Fran with ShatterH and MistO will make Fran into a debuffing monster and this option would be better than worrying about how much damage Fran will do. Because mitigation is more important than damage on a Support. ",1462061336

I will honestly say New York is hands down a far safer city than Chicago. The NYPD does not put up with assholery anywhere near the tourists spots or on mass transit.

You are currently planning to marry this man, and you guys are in your 20s. You both could live 70+ more years. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life dealing with this petty bullsh!t? What happens if you have kids? 'No I won't go grocery shopping because last night I changed his diapers' or No I won't take the baby to the park because I picked her up from daycare' or whatever.

Kids or no, there will be times one of you has to do a bit more than the other, because over the course of a marriage there *will* be sickness, there *will* be family emergencies, there *will* be work drama and work issues/job loss, there *will* be family death, and so on, and all these things will affect what each of you is willing or able to contribute at the time.

Heck there *will* even be times of sheer laziness where either you or your partner just wants to veg out for a weekend LOL

In a good relationship/marriage, these things even out. There is no need to keep score because you are both doing for the other anyway.

Why grey v-neck and not a white v-neck?
Because white v-necks actually show their outline more so than a light grey v-neck under a white dress shirt. This is because our skin is neutral colored, and a white v-neck actually creates a contrast. There are articles online that explain this in more detail, so just Google it.

I honestly sweat far more from that than I do through most of my cardio or lifting, and most days I feel rejuvenated and have more energy doing it.  You don't need any equipment (I started just by using a towel on carpet), just internet access and something to watch the youtube video on.

But! I loved it. More than almost every marvel movie than preceded it. Tightly plotted, character driven, emotionally coherent, great action, and superbly delivered. RDJ in particular gave a really powerful performance, especially towards the end. I found myself gritting my teeth and on the edge of my seat: ""You knew?"" sent shivers down my spine. The ensuing fight really made me realise how much these characters have come to mean. 

Tom Holland was clearly the right choice for Spider-Man; his chemistry with RDJ was great. Really looking forward to more of that.

I hope Marvel continues to keep RDJ creatively engaged and pays him
whatever he asks. For me, he's the emotional core of these movies and ... I want more.

(I believe your link has showed examples on that.) 

Beside, there are so many things animals do in the nature, that could not be done in our society, such as the black widows (spiders) behavior 
Should a Woman killing her husband after intercourse, not be judged because it happens also in the nature ?


Pardon me, for the late answer , I was looking for the link form which I have read the information about fertility enhancement.

""Elevated levels of testosterone in utero""[16] increases aggressiveness and both male and female spotted hyenas mount submissive same-sex members who likely have lower levels of testosterone from their mother
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_displaying_homosexual_behavior

"" Research has shown that simulated mating behavior increases fertility for Cnemidophorus neomexicanus. One female lies on top of another, playing the role of the male, the lizard that was on bottom has larger eggs. The lizards switch off this role each mating season.[53]""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior

There are a lot of websites that discuss this topic , but I believe that you get the idea that  homosexual intercourse  is usually had in the animal kingdom for reasons other than actual presumed sexuality.

I hope this had answered your questions and if you have any others don't hesitate to ask.

but If I may, Do you live in any kind of religious house, or your parents also don't believe in any religion ?

It's a good thing you have no say in the process. Disrespect isn't illegal, and he is entitled to his political beliefs.

&gt; If you want to become a Canadian citizen, you take the Oath with sincerity.

As an aside, I think we should change that. I think the monarchy is outmoded. I was born here and I didn't have to pledge allegiance to the Queen. Why should new immigrants have to?

&gt; For a non-citizen or brand new citizen to effectively lecture Canada on what is or is not an important part of being Canadian is the height of insolence.

No it isn't. The height of insolence is your in-group vs. out-group attitude.

As another aside, what exactly does it mean to be ""Canadian""? I've been thinking about this question a lot and I don't really have a satisfactory answer.

TL;DR: The prof in question also informed the citizenship judge about his decision to immediately disavow and the judge responded: ""I hear you sir. And I thank you for your honesty. I welcome you to Canada and I look forward to the contributions you will make."" Do you really know better than the judge?

1099-Misc, depending on what it was for, usually means filing a Schedule SE (to calculate your self employment tax) which I was told by friend that Turbo Tax only offers via Deluxe. 

I also would not be surprised if Schedule D and related forms (to calculate any gains or losses from your brokerage statement) also is only available if you upgrade to Deluxe. 

You are only ""screwed"" if you could have actually done it yourself on paper. 

These tax softwares and places like H&amp;R Block charge you based on complexity (meaning, what extra schedules do you need to file). You can be getting a W-2 for $1mil * but if that is all you have and aren't itemizing, turbo tax is free for both fed and (for a certain time) state. Specifically, if you qualify to file a 1040EZ or 1040A. They hope to get you used to using them while your tax situation is less complex in hopes of retaining you when you buy a house, start investing, or have children and it becomes much much harder to just do it by hand and paper file.

*Edit: After thinking about this, due to the extra Medicare tax on wages above a certain amount, this is no longer true and there is an extra form that would likely prevent filing a 1040A.

I will say this, I didn't play Conquest as it was myself, in fact that's what the original thread was about (disliking the Avatar system).  I went default on everything.  Interestingly enough I also played Conquest as female Corrin.  Conquest Corrin is different from Birthright Corrin, I will agree.  Because Birthright Corrin didn't seem to give a shit about pleasing Garon at all.  I liked that because I thought that made the most sense.  That he lamented having to fight his beloved siblings but knew Garon was an asshole that was the reason behind everything.  

Conquest Corrin, annoyed me a little.  I'll say that the story wasn't hot garbage or anything it just was inconsistent and Corrin's naivete and cognitive dissonance was bothersome.  Since Birthright Corrin and Conquest Corrin are supposed to in fact be the same person it didn't make sense that the Corrin I was playing in Conquest (which I played second), thought that the best way to achieve peace was to conquer another nation and then defeat Garon whereas Birthright Corrin straight up said ""We have to defeat Garon, conquering Nohr is unnecessary"".

Dwarfs are by no means weak.  In the latest video released the explosive satchels from some units can inflict AoE damage to units.  Honestly, that battle seemed a bit in favor of chaos and the dwarf side seemed to be moving its artillery for a good portion of the advance up the hill but still couldn't get it out of the front line.  It would have been interesting to see the same fight but with the dwarf's artillery behind their front line and their melee up front.

Micron has stated they haven't completely reached parity with GDDR5 yet however.

So the 1080 is going to have 8GB of GDDR5X on a 256-bit bus at 6000mHz for 384 GB/s.

The 1070 is going to have 8GB of GDDR5 on a 256-bit bus using samsungs new chips that get a full 8000mHz for 256 GB/s.

This rumor says the third GP104 SKU is going to have 6GB of GDDR5 on a 196-bit bus.  I see no reason that wont also be 8000mHz chips for 196 GB/s.

Pascal also improves memory allocation in the die. The memory registers were increased, the L2 cache was increased, the L1 cache management, duplication, and allocation logic was improved. Maxwell was 25% more efficient with the available memory bandwidth vs Keplar. I see no reason Pascal won't achieve the same performance over Maxwell.

So 196 GB/s should be like ~250 GB/s when comparing to what Maxwell needed to feed the core.  That would put the GP104-150 well above the 980 in performance.",1462061362

Saying that because the universe is old and big there must be life is missing the major variable; the probability of life beginning to exist or subsequently becoming intelligent AND THEN building a civilization.

Imagine I told you that you had 100,000 billion guesses to guess the positive integer I am thinking of and you thought, ""with that many guesses I'm sure I'll guess it!""

there is absolutely no reason to be confident you could guess my number; what if I picked some astronomically huge number you'd never guess? If you knew the range was 1-10,000,000,000 then you could surely guess every single number and get it, but *you don't know what the range of numbers is* I could be thinking of. That makes being so sure about your guess completely irrational.

Until you know the probability of life beginning to exist, the ""range of possible numbers"" in my example, you can't make any confident statement about how common it is in the universe.

""Selma"" beskriver trods alt selv at hun har sagt fra overfor den slags (og implicit, at det accepteres), men at det samtidig betyder at hun ikke længere er lige så interessant for drengene som de der tillader det? Det jeg får ud af artiklen, er at Selma ikke længere er en populær pige, fordi hun ikke leger med på pubertetslegen, og det syntes hun er strengt... Jeg har stadig meget svært ved at se problemet, eller nogen der ikke forstår grænser? Jo jo, en 12-årig knægt der lige har fået øjnene op for bryster^tm søger grænserne, men det betyder IKKE at han ikke overholder dem der er? Artiklen omhandler trods alt mest hvad Selma har hørt eller set; ikke noget hun (u)frivilligt har taget del i... Eller, skal vi nu også til at sige at 12-årige knægte ikke længere må synge underlødige sange når de er på skoleudflugt?

Dernæste taler artiklen om at ""drengene skal kende forskel på porno og virkeligheden"" - det mener jeg allerede de ved; de giver de jævnaldrende og samtykkende piger et klap i numsen, og forsøger ikke at gangbange læreren... Eller, det er måske ikke bevis nok, når ""den forurettede"" selv siger netop dét?

Det er 12-årige der er 12 år gamle - de er ved at starte 5-6-7 år i helvedet med pubertet og hormoner der raser. La' nu børn være børn, og så støt dem, fremfor at pålægge dem én eller anden forskruet voksen-moral...

... skulle nogen tage fat på noget i den her sammenhæng, så skulle interessen for ""Selma"" skrottes totalt. Hun er en stærk unge, der fatter at sige fra - hun er fa'me sej! Hun er ikke interessant... Nej, dér hvor man kunne støtte, hjælpe og lære nogen noget, er de piger der samtykker til klappet i numsen, og hjælpe dem der netop IKKE siger fra, af den ene eller den anden grund. Der er sikkert de der kan lide det, men der er også dem der er så usikre at de blot udnytter den her chance de pludseligt får, for at blive populære - DE skal have hjælp til at forstå hvad der sker, ikke ""Selma""...

You can get normal2 weapons that can get to skill lv 15 from gold moons or gacha weapons. That's very expensive.

If you have primal builds that can benefit from cosmos weapons, that means you're a mega whale who can throw A LOT of money into the game. If you want normal weapons that can go to sklv15, that's even more difficult because only gacha story SSRs currently have maxsklv 15.

Only other alternative I could think of... Endless grind of vohu guns / Ifrit halberd, etc. But then you only have 3days to grind before it rotates.

Yes, if you have $50000 to throw into this game you can be the very best. And since the beginning too, since if you're already rich you can just dump a lot of money at rank1. Own the game. Okay.

"vinyl","t5_2qh7i","**Catherine Ribeiro + Alpes – ""Ame Debout""**

Label: Philips, Year: 1971

Genre: Art Rock / Experimental

Tune: Ame Debout - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhLTXVS5A9E

Catherine Ribeiro is a French musician with a loud, evocative vocal style atop experimental rock and cosmic folk backing. Fascinating music, reminds me of Nico from time to time. Only pressed in France, I was lucky to stumble upon this one in a local shop here in the States. 

**Alice Coltrane – ""Lord of Lords""**

Label: Impulse!, Year: 1972

Genre: Spiritual Jazz / Free Jazz

Tune: Going Home - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUAM9krmbAQ

Alice Coltrane's final album for Impulse. Fully fleshed out with a 16 piece orchestra and Alice plays her gorgeous harp, piano and Wurlitzer organ. Much of this record has a classical feel combined with Alice's free and improvisational jazz undearneath. Really beautiful and unique album in her catalog.

**Masahiko Togashi – ""Spiritual Nature""**

Label: East Wind, Year: 1975

Genre: Spiritual Jazz / Free Jazz

Tune: Spiritual Nature - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sUUlOv0ZFI

Masahiko Togashi was a Japanese percussionist and a child prodigy, performing as a professional drummer in his teens. This album has a quiet, contemplative feel with nuanced percussive tones and drones. Most of the tunes slowly build into a groovy spiritual jazz. Fantastic record from the Japanese jazz label East Wind.

**Matthewdavid's Mindflight – ""Trust the Guide and Glide""**

Label: Leaving Records, Year: 2016

Genre: New Age

Tune: Unfolding Atlantis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_rqWSBNm2I

Brand new album from Matthewdavid under his Mindflight moniker, released on his label Leaving Records. Gorgeous, modern new age. Expansive otherwordly synth drones full of shimmering leads and carefully constructed atmospherics. Anyone interested in modern new age or ambient should check this out.

**Georgia Kelly – ""Seapeace (Music for Harp)""**

Label: Heru Records, Year: 1978

Genre: New Age

Tune: Chinese Sunrise - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4krBz_6_40

Georgia Kelly is a new age harpist, probably most known for her collaborative work with Steven Halpern, notably ""Ancient Echoes"". This is her first album, this pressing is her self-release on Heru Records. Mostly solo harp, the album is the perfect kind of ambient; unobtrusive as background tunes but also beautiful and intricate enough for close listening.",1462061371

It doesn't necessarily cover your mid/late game needs but it should be somewhat helpful.

Anyways, it seems like you lack the necessary peel to be effective mid/late game. If you've done well as Azir you're generally going to be the primary focus of the enemy team.

Attempt to alleviate these issues prior to the game even starting by talking it out in champ select with your team.

If you can't resolve the issue proactively then the best way to prevent from getting flanked and dove are:

1. Proper warding. This helps prevent/telegraphs flanks. You can generally get an idea of which champs are going to want to do this on the enemy team as well before the game starts. Stuff like Quinn, Rammus, Zed, LB, Maokai, Ekko, etc. will want to do this.

2. Buy Zhonya's. Even if there aren't any real immediate AD threats that would want to dive you, the active on Zhonya's can and will save your life and facilitate safer Shurima Shuffles if that's what you need to do.

3. Play to your surroundings. Azir has some incredibly long range. If possible, fight on the other side of terrain during fights. You can still do effective DPS and can traverse the terrain if needed with your E.",1462061372

I had one crazy game against a druid where I shadowcasted shadowcasters and brann once (for a total of three branns, so always assured shadowcast proc with  a 1 mana brann to pop on a turn if needed) and I had mini thaurissans, mini twin emperors branning into more big taunts and the c'thun rogue card that eats stats i kept shadowcasting. my c'thun had nearly 50 in both stats by the time I dropped him on the poor guy. good god almighty. i was also shadowcasting apothecary repeatedly. games ont hat scale were rare, and the double thaurissan proc are what enabled it to that degree, but i do manage shadowcaster shenanigans often on a smaller scale and twin emperors is one my go to for that especially if I can manage to turn 7 against agro with enough health to make it past poppes like kill commands by then. the first day or two, people were often hitting the duplicate emperor, which made it easy to shadowcast the main the next turn lol.

I can't imagine how you could have been more measured or reasonable--you're just dealing with the worst OP I've seen on this sub (across multiple threads). Your responses really were a model for anyone else looking to create a useful conversation.

I'd say it's not too surprising that top-level scientists would turn to a more abstract variety of mysticism for their spirituality. It's likely a manifestation of the human urge to assign meaning filtered through a sensibility that makes the embarrassingly naive, heavy-handed and literal beliefs of mainstream religions unattractive (Kurt Gödel's wife said he read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning, but it's hard to imagine someone that brilliant reading the Bible for anything but a laugh).  Of course an [overwhelming majority](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html) of top scientists are atheist/agnostic/doubting, but for those that don't outright eschew spiritual beliefs it seems natural that they'd gravitate toward a more abstract, Deist, ground-of-being conception of god.",1462061373

In the games I watched, I only saw him get honestly beat one time, and it was Robert Nkemdiche with a bull rush transitioning to an inside move that Rees just looked like he wasn't expecting. He's strong at the point of attack, seems to have good body control and balance, and his testing numbers are probably not accurate because he wasn't fully healthy. Willing to reserve judgement on this one; there are definitely a lot of positive things to see on his tape, although the injury history is worrisome.

The fact that Julia voted for Debbie doesn't mean that she would just as easily vote out one of the guys. We saw her tell them the plan, so even if she does vote with the girls (like she thought she was doing when she voted for Tai during the Scot boot), the guys could just play both their idols before the vote and be able to vote out whichever of the girls they want to.

&gt;Tai explained it at the previous TC.

He said there was a super idol, but did he ever say what it did? No one in the girls' alliance ever said anything to indicate that they knew what the super idol was, IIRC.

&gt;He would still have had his idol. He could either tell Scot to use his idol, or he could just use the double vote to send Aubry home 4-3-2. Either way he keeps his idol and if he uses the doubler, his trio still has the super idol at 7 making them invincible.

The plan was for them to use the super idol on whoever needed it, and Tai didn't have enough influence to change that. Sure, he could have used his extra vote, but he'd still be down an advantage and still in an alliance that was going to vote him off sooner or later.

Wait till the npc with the bomb come to you before killing then communicate and coordinate the delivery of the bomb. Two to the left and two to the right. Bomb carrier to the left.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","I put a whole house filtration system in my house and i think including installation i spent around $3500 to do it. I'm not at home right now, so I can't get you brand names, but I can describe the system. There are two large fiberglass tanks. They are probably 5 feet tall and maybe 12"" in diameter. One if filled with activated charcoal. All the water for the house flows through here first. This pulls out chlorine and any other odiferous compounds. The other tank is for the water softener.  
All the water in the house gets filtered and softened, and it is awesome. Drinking water out of every faucet is great. I also really like showering in filtered water. I didn't realize how drying the chlorine in city water is until I had the water system. 

Our house is about 3k square feet and it's a family of four. Unless your house is huge and water consumption is high, you'll be able to put a system together for under $5k. I bought the parts over the internet and had a local plumber install it. This was a bit cheaper than having a local company specializing in water systems. I checked into Culligan, that was the most expensive option of all.

  &gt;I've heard the argument against proof of stake; a person can trivially maintain his coins on multiple, competing chains meaning there is little financial pressure to arrive at a consensus.  ""There is nothing at stake.""  My question is, why is the current system preferable?  

&gt;There is obviously substantial financial pressure to maintain and mine a single chain in a proof of work system.  But this shifts all the responsibility for maintaining the protocol to a handful of people, the pool operators.  The rest of us have...nothing at stake.  This is completely contrary to the idea of a decentralized protocol.  We are essentially users of a system maintained by several people.  With a proof of stake system the costs of maintaining a full node at any block/bandwidth size would be a fraction of the current costs of maintaining a relevant percentage of the hashing power.  This would allow for hundreds or thousands of full nodes all deciding on a protocol.  Or, in the event that a node operator decides to transmit all of his transactions along the numerous branches of a potential fork, the users of that node would then have to decide what they want the protocol to be.

&gt;This is a messy solution, but protocol changes are, inevitably, messy.  That's why they should be limited and decided by the people they effect.  It seems to me that a proof of stake system, even a pure proof of stake system with no proof of work component, would allow for all of us to have far more of a say in what we want the rules of the network to be than the current system.

&gt;(I know there are limitations on SPV wallets in a proof of stake system, but I think it's reasonable that those who help maintain the network by bearing the mild extra risk of maintaining their coins on a networked device should receive the inflationary benefits of the mining process.)",1462061381

If I felt like a person was trying to hurt me and my adrenaline was pumping, I wouldn't be surprised if racist shit came out of my mouth. Me and some friends also ran around my campus yelling ""white power"" once because we were drunk and thought it was fucking funny.

It appears to me that the racial remarks didn't come out until Alsaleh had already started shit and caused a situation. Given that he was drunk and provoked, and society is so eager to point out racism at even the smallest sign, I'm not calling this a racism-fueled incident.

I'm calling it the way I see it: this guy did everything he could to pick a fight with another guy, and the other guy hit him. There is a grey area between whether Higbee felt he or his gf was threatened or just lost control. I feel it was a combination of both. Yeah he shouldn't have hit him, but I'm not judging his entire character off one incident where alot of other guys his age would react in a similar fashion. Only difference is most guys probably wouldn't have been to knock him down in one punch. 

If he makes the mistake again, or does other terrible shit, then I'll label him a terrible person. But I'm not judging him based on an isolated incident where he was pushed so far and adrenaline kicks in.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You may need a brief refresher course on what NATIONAL elections and LOCAL/REGIONAL elections are.  The Democratic party was 100% irrelevant in NATIONAL elections.  You can deny that and you'd be wrong.  Clinton changed that.  

Some of Clinton's changes were likely demographic based.  Clinton gets credit for flipping California in 92 (Republican for multiple cycles before that) but that has as much to do with California changing as anything else; similar to how the party lost the South in 2000.  That's just a factor of demographics.

But your line about ""Republican to call himself a Democrat"" just shows how myopic and sad your world view is.  Clinton moved the party to an area where they could stand on their own nationally.  If not for Clinton changing states like the northeast/rust belt, the party would still be getting killed locally and be as completely hopeless nationally.  Clinton saved the party.

A brief list of states that Clinton flipped in 92 that have stayed blue since then

California

Connecticut

Delaware

Illinois

Maine

Maryland

Michigan

Pennsylvania

Vermont

Other states Clinton flipped that went red once or twice.   Like I said California flipping was more a matter of demographics but states like Pennsylvania?  Illinois?  Changing the party and bringing in more voters gets credit there.

For the first dozen decades or so, Jump technology was not well understood and so only large carriers had huge and hungry engines, but as time went on the engines became smaller, more efficient, to the point where small cargo ships offered the flexibility and speed to move people and goods from place to place. The Year, old style, was 3988.

Everyone called her Jade, after the necklace she wore constantly. In the shower, under an EVA suit, even while being romantic, and most people on the base had experienced her in at least one of those situations. Someone had found, in the vast store of humanity's knowledge, video documentary of the Antarctica Science stations, before they were abandoned at the end of the Late Fossil Era. Snowed in for months at a time, unreachable and self-sufficient. Even though the Pluto SETI group numbered in the hundreds, instead of the dozens who over-wintered at the Pole, the culture between the two groups was very similar. And they shared obsession, the ancient group for cold, the current group holding alive the flame of that ancient hope that maybe, Humans were not alone in the Universe.

* * *

""So did you plan for us to Jump at the proverbial stroke-of-midnight?"" There were still Pilots and Co-Pilots even though Semi-AIs did most of the thinking, and automatic systems did most of the work. They were proud of their little ship, the *Buckaroo Banzai.* ""I thought it would be cool,"" the Pilot responded to his Co-Pilot. ""Our way of ringing in the next millennium, especially considering our destination."" He turned back to his console. ""T-Minus 50 Minutes, John, please activate the Ansible and begin scanning for Beacon Terra-One."" ""Beacon Terra-One, aye.""

* * *

Jade was at her workbench, in her lab. The facility wasn't as nice as when she was working at Mars Capital University, but it had her essential tools and the SETI group was happy to have her. All of humanity's efforts in space did nothing but reinforce the Law of the Universe that was commonly called *c*. It was the speed of space-time, the fixed pace of all matter and energy. But Jade ... Jade had a hunch. *C* could not be defied, but maybe it could be bypassed, at least for energy and information. The physicists and philosophers at Mars U thought she was wasting her potential; SETI welcomed her with open arms, a long bet but one that could pay of handsomely if they had a means to listen to the entire Universe at once.

* * *

""Mom, when will we get to Terra?"" ""Soon, honey, we Jump in about 40 minutes, and then it'll be another hour before we're docked with a tether."" Mom didn't know *for sure* that Earth had orbital tethers, but every other inhabited planet did so she spoke like she knew. ""Why are we going to Terra? It's so old."" ""You're right! It's the oldest, it's where we all came from. That's why I want us to visit, so you can see some of that history first hand."" ""Why are there only humans?"" An obvious question, usually asked by youngsters who had their first biology lessons. ""As near as we know, honey, we were the first, and we got lucky. There are good museums on Terra about just that thing, and we're going to visit--"" ""T-Minus 40 minutes to Jump. All systems nominal.""

* * *

It was as big as a sample box. It was hooked up to power, vacuum, cryo, waveguide that went to an antenna complex on the Heart Plain. Jade pressed a test button on the side, and a small panel lit up with green lights, like looking at the stars through a beer bottle. This was not the first time she made it to this step. Without giving it much thought, she issued a few commands at her workstation to activate the ansible. She would grab some lunch, she thought, maybe relax with a beer or three, maybe see if Ingrid or Ben had a little free time ... and come back to it with fresh eyes, analyze the failure modes, map out the next steps.

The pace on the bridge was picking up. The countdown timer was winding down and was showing tenths-of-a-second. ""Co-Pilot, please verify BEACON."" ""Go."" ""Verify SPOOL."" ""Go."" ""Verify TRANSVECTOR."" ""Go!"" ""Passing COMMIT line in 3, 2, 1."" ""We are committed, go for final run-up ... No-Go! No-Go on BEACON!"" ""What?!"" They scrambled, trying to figure out what was going on. Without BEACON they would Jump without a destination. Given the vastness of the universe they would probably Jump into empty space but... ""I've got a BEACON, it's not modulated Terra-One but it's in the right place."" ""What happened? No time. Lock it. --All Hands, Jump in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1--""

Jade was in Ingrid's quarters wearing nothing but her wrist computer and her eponymous necklace, her quarters were close to the lab and she needed a shower after working so many hours straight. bzz bzz bzz bzz - bzz bzz bzz bzz. Jade was a little annoyed at the timing, but she did need to keep an eye on the experiment. She brought up her wrist, and her eyes went wide. ""I found something. I found something!"" ""Jade, what's going on?"" ""My transmitter, it picked up a signal! I got a signal!"" She was grabbing clothes at random, her underwear, Ingrid's pants, a t-shirt from the floor. She was halfway out of the door when the intercom blared: ""RED ALERT, RED ALERT, UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT IN PLUTO ORBITAL SPACE.""

The Year was 2988. Humans had been in the Solar System for nearly 400 years. Super-efficient mass-drivers, fusion reactors, even a limited inertia-less drive; the eggs of life were no longer in the single basket of Mother Earth. Technology made the habitable volume of Sol's Domain vast, even though the Speed of Light was still the ultimate barrier. Nonetheless - Cloud City on Venus. Settlements on Callisto, Titan, and Luna, cities on Mars and Ganymede, resource camps on the minor planets. For now, the humans ""furthest out"" could be found on Heart Plain of Pluto, a curious small outpost of women and men, who's curiosity was not focused on the inside of the great Plutonian orbit around the Sun, but of what might exist beyond...

The *Buckaroo Banzai* was able to make an easy landing on Pluto. The SETI group's reaction was most unusual, that for all of the creatures to suddenly appear at their airlock, that it would be future-humans; more than a few were disappointed that their protocols and first-contact procedures would go unused. But after that initial shock, everyone had realized that something truly incredible had taken place. Jade herself made the case to keep it a secret, to protect the timeline; she never shared the configuration that allowed her transmitter to broadcast so broadly throughout space *and* time. Although she thought it was unsporting, she used *Banzai's* Ansible to improve and limit hers. For the next two years they would spend all of their effort reverse-engineering the ship's technology; and when they announced to the Solar System that they had Jump Engines and instantaneous communications, no one was surprised that it was the SETI group with their infamous eccentricity who had accomplished the feat.

Jade would go on to be famous, and she shared in the awards and accolades that befell the SETI group. And the secret held, with the *Buckaroo Banzai* and her original ansible entombed under the meters of ices under Pluto's Heart Plain, which was becoming a monument as Humanity's jumping-off point. People had started counting time from the moment that the her Ansible was first turned on, 1 year after, 2 years after, 3; it was headed towards being a convention. Jade even ended up marrying John, the Co-Pilot. It seemed like she had everything. Except for one thing:

She knew from the hour or so that *her* ansible was on, that it had heard only Human voices in the deep. For good or bad, the Universe belonged to Humanity.

Not everything in the universe is required to be ambiguous and not every post-modernist analytical exercise leads somewhere worthwhile. Some things are indeed black and white and some hotly studied questions in the humanities are utterly ridiculous.

Take Luce Irigaray when she decided to study Newtonian laws and differential calculus. All she got out of it was the idea that STEM is an evil male invention to oppress women, and modeling dynamic fluid systems was difficult for engineers, scientists, and mathematicians not because there are a lot of moving parts and complex equations involved to make the models accurate, but because fluids reminded them of vaginas and these nerds think vaginas are scary, and that [science is the rape of nature](https://skepticalhumanities.com/2012/07/16/can-science-rape-nature/).

"Patriots","t5_2rx57","&gt;It means you argue topics off point and go on tangents...to obfuscate and redirect. You're saying the same thing as me. I'm also not acting like anything. I made a factual statement that rather than keep Matt Cassel on the roster the Pats traded him. I'm confident that they knew they could trade him because...they did. That seems to suggest it was possible, feel me? Regardless of what I think happened prior to that trade, which was never a part of my initial statement anyway, all I said was ""The pats traded him rather than pay for him"". No straw man. No smoke screen. That statement is as true as ""The pats traded Ryan Mallett to the Houston Texans"".

The Pats didn't trade him rather than pay him. They tagged him possibly because of two reasons:

1. They didnt know if Brady would be Brady.

2. They wanted to trade him 

So they tagged him. In doing so, they took a risk that if a trade didn't happen and Brady did come back 100%, all that money would be a waste. This is a pretty similar situation to this year. We have no idea if Brady will be there to begin the season. This isn't Belichick skimping on a contract for a backup. Its Belichick drafting a dev project who one day might amount to something. 

&gt;False statement: ""I studied my textbook therefor I will pass my test."" This is a good analogy to you statement of ""Brissett is a project QB therefor he will be bad in the short term."" Neither of these statements are factually accurate. There is probability that they might be true, but zero guarantees.

This was in response to your statement about Leinart. Just because it didnt work in that case doesn't mean that tape is worthless. If you think it is, what is left to evaluate a player? A one time private workout and interview? 

&gt;True statement: ""I studied my textbook therefor I might pass my test"". This is a good analogy to my statement ""Brissett is an unknown commodity and may be better than the current available free agents"". I'm simply stating the possibility that something might happen. This is a true statement, and certainly not an example of me making any guarantees that I simply don't have the ability to make...like you have done repeatedly.

My bad. I assumed that you dont nitpick any and everything. 

Its obvious to anyone that we are talking about the most likely outcome, not the guaranteed outcome. 

&gt;Lindley was cut as soon as Brady's suspension was overturned.. The Pats haven't carried 3 active QB's in years. Now, to follow along with the logic I layed out above, I can't guarantee that it was directly correlated since I wasn't involved in those decisions, but there's a real high probability these things are all related.

The Pats haven't also been in a situation where their starting QB might not play the first 4 games of the season very often. ",1462061390

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","&gt; And yet DeS and DS1 did not need it...

And yet DeS, DaS1 and DaS2 are not very good action games, whether people were fine with that or not. Please don't misinterpret me, these are each some of my all-time favourite RPGs with some fantastic lore and character customization. But bosses for instance, and even regular mob combat is very, *very* boring when you compare them with other run of the mill action titles. Bloodborne is first time the enemies and mechanics felt like they were designed to properly embrace the series' action strengths. All of the best fights in the older games were the fast ones replete with combos and lots of moving around like Manus, Artorias, Alonne or False King, so tuning the gameplay to accommodate more bosses and enemies that fit that criteria isn't a bad thing in my book. DaS3 just seems to be following that example. 

&gt;Compared to the previous games, it is completely true. You could only roll 3 or 4 times in DS2 with 30 END, now you can roll 9 times with the same points in END.

Because if your character consumed as much stamina rolling and attacking in this game as they do in the others, it would render certain encounters incredibly unfair. Instead, we're mechanically equipped to handle the game as a result of this change. Rolling consumes stamina, it is not ""close to free"" regardless of how it was done in other games. It's still very possible to keep a mental tab on your opponent's stamina and punish accordingly. 

&gt;Nope, it definitely changed the system to prioritise anyone with co-op friends.

I hardly ever invade groups, but I'm not doubting it. That said, it's still not BB's system. There's a distinct possibility to invade solo players, as evidenced by my having invaded solo hosts almost exclusively. I don't see why it's an issue if you're invading groups of players though. You're there to kill the host and halt their progress, it's natural that you're taking a gamble on whether or not they have phantoms, or seeds, tranquil walk of peace, second chance, scraping spears, wheels, 8 casts of forbidden sun, a Heavy Darksword etc. That's part of the fun of invasions; you shouldn't be expecting one type of encounter, but *many*. Again, the invader has all of the enemies on the map available to them, so it puts the host on more even footing if he consistently has a buddy around when invaders show up. It's a design consideration. Lots of people don't like it,

&gt;Not really... In DeS, there were only 2 levels of HP: soul and human. Now there are three: Embers give you +30%, human is normal, spirit is -30%. Compared to the host, that's a 60 point difference.

Either way, health cuts were not necessarily a feature ripped from Bloodborne. They existed back in Demon's Souls, regardless of the differences between its system and the DaS3 one. I'll again say that it's a design consideration, because invaders have quite a lot on their side in the first place. It's not like phantoms haven't seen minor buffs though.

I have never had it fail to break anything loose.

Also they make Sili Kroil which adds a silicon type lubricant, which works 10,000 times better than WD40 for lubricating.

Having a discussion with someone usually involves their opinions and how they feel, if you take all that out and only provide facts then you remove much of the emotion behind it. It's just like reading a wikipedia article instead of talking to someone.

This is along the lines of, 

""What is the opposite of love?"" 

""Hate.""

""No, apathy."" 

If a person does not listen to me when they ask my opinion it means they do not care, so I will do exactly the same back to them and stop caring about their questions.

We are the only advanced country that does not pull teachers from the top ten percent of graduates. This is a huge problem. I went to the Ivy League, paid $50,000 for my master's, because I want to give children the best I can and an education they deserve. 

When I interviewed for teaching positions, I had many principals ask me, ""Wow, you went to _______ schools? Don't you think you're going to get bored as a teacher?"" 

That is, by far, one of the most insulting things anyone has said to me. Bored?? 1) Working with developing humans is a consistent changing variable. 2) The Achievement Gap is continuing to grow, with no end in sight, 3) These children are growing up in a time where depravity is the norm... and above all, I have to figure out how to teach them every day so they can grow up to be curious, and independent, and successful people.

For example, if someone fills out a single box form on the website of your choice, the bot will copy that text from the box and paste it into a Facebook status message immediately. The same thing would happen if somebody messages the Facebook page directly.

- Your wording: ""feel offended by and want removed"" seems to trivialize the issues, which are mostly related to the U.S. constitution. I'm not offended in the sense that ""wah, my feeling are hurt"" — it's an issue of rights violations and my tax dollars financing faith-based initiatives, public subsidization of religious schools and organizations, having ""In God we trust on my currency"", having us pay the House Chaplain $345,000 and the Senate Chaplain $436,886 (taxpayers spending $1600 per congressional prayer), religious ""freedom"" bills, police cars sporting religious decals, etc. Is it so much to ask for a government that works for everyone, endorses no particular groups and does not play favorites with particular demographics?

- Even if the government were completely decoupled from religion, I'd still be an anti-theist and speak out against the rampant fundamentalism that pervades our culture, the attempts to stifle scientific progress, the hindrance of civil rights (such as LGBT rights and those of other religions or no religion at all). Religion also undermines human rights, women's rights and impedes education and critical thinking. It drives irrational and dangerous thinking that, for example, causes people not to give kids hospital treatment, vaccinations, etc. It lends credence to terrorism and illegal wars (""God told me to invade Iraq""), causes half the country to reject evolutionary biology, compromises our media and blackballs one of the greatest problems facing our planet: climate change.

We had a horse named buck. Buck wasn't much. He was a palamino gelding quarter horse. You could saddle him, but that didn't mean he'd move once you got up there. He was super gentle.  There was one time (and I think we have a picture) where I took the girth, walked under Buck to hand it to my sister. My mom was freaked, for good reason, not a smart move.

Anyway, any time you asked my dad how old Buck was, he'd say ""Eh, he's gotta be about 40 years old now.""  

Like I said, we moved to town when I was 8, and we gave him to some family friends, and for at least 8 years, my dad would say that Buck was 40.

"languagelearning","t5_2rjsc","Lol. People like that make me laugh. The vast majority of people on this planet do not speak English. Of a population of 7 billion, approximately 1 billion, or around the same number of Mandarin speakers, speak English. Unless you're talking to very well educated people, good luck in most countries in Africa and South America. Same goes with Asia. 

I'm a native Chinese person. I'm fluent in English, as are most of us that are on Western websites and from China. However, if you were to assume that we were representative of the average from China, you'd be grossly misled. 

It's the same thing here. People are stuck in their bubble of America+Canada+Australia+Western Europe and think that the entire world functions in the same way. In reality, English is a great language to learn for travel but is still severely limited. I don't know how he functions in Japan without knowing any Japanese but if I had to guess, it's similar to how expats function in China? They huddle in an expat community where they can all speak a separate language without having to learn the language of the country, and then they speak ill about the country they currently live in?

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","You would do it like this:

    ln -s /mnt/users /home

or maybe just for some individual users:

    ln -s /mnt/users/username /home/username

I don't know if this works (it should), but to make this work, you would have to first copy the contents of /home over to /mnt/users, and would have to remove (or rename) /home to make place for the link with the same name. After you've done all this, you should just mount the filesystem as /home instead of /mnt/users.

Links are neat for something different. You could leave your current /home like it is right now, then create additional folders in /mnt/users/ that are owned by your different user accounts. Those users can then have links in their homes pointing to folders over there.

For example, if you install Steam for a user and download some games, that takes up a massive amount of space. Let's say the user that does that is ""weapong"". Home is /home/weapong, the Steam folder is /home/weapong/.local/share/Steam.

You now create a folder /mnt/users/weapong. You make it owned by weapong. The user weapong can now take ~/.local/share/Steam and move it to /mnt/users/weapong/Steam. Then next, he puts a link where the original Steam folder was:

    $ cd ~/.local/share/
    $ ln -s /mnt/users/weapong/Steam Steam

The whole moving and linking is done while Steam is not running.

Other good examples are movies, music, virtual machines. Those folders could be moved away to /mnt/users/weapong/, and their original location in /home/weapong/ gets a link pointing to it.",1462061402

Since the benefit adjustment is retroactive, he would have had a representative payee in the past.  If it was his father or mother and they live in the same household, the Commissioner's agents may still find that the NH is liable since the award letters come with a pamphlet of reporting responsibilities.  For auxiliaries, it has the same as the retirement and disability benefits, which includes reporting pensions or public disability benefits (assuming that the cause for adjustment was the Windfall Elimination Provision or receipt of a public disability benefit).

Also, it is worth inquiring to see if the reopening was permitted.  IF they had evidence of the pension in file at the time of either award, then they only have 4 years to revise the initial awards.  If your father never reported the pension until later, then no initial determination would ever have been made on the pension and the adjustment would be correct.",1462061403

I have a poli Sci and history degree and used to be a strong supporter of free trade till a man came to my school and defended being against free trade. According to most calculations we would need to import about 8 million more people a year in order for it to be effective. Importing more people from 3rd world countries puts a bigger strain on the government when it comes to health care and education than the trade will ever benefit you. That is why I'm against it and globalism in general. Ever heard that argument?  Because I hadn't.

He proceeded to the door, knowing he was entering the jaws of death and would soon join his fallen brothers.  He paused for a few seconds, but never looked back.  He went through the door and rounded the corner, knowing his time was drawing very near.  He looked up and saw one of the invaders coming with a shotgun.  ""Fuck this"" he said to himself as he ran back through the doors.  He turned around, shutting the door in hopes of stopping the invader from coming any further.  Aside from being born, his only mistake was failing to realize that glass is no match for a sawed off 12 gauge killing stick.  BOOM!  The shotgun called out, as if the very call of death itself.

That's interesting, but to address your question, what are you afraid of your doctor doing if you tell him about it? And honestly, I don't know why you wouldn't want to stop, I defintely would. My fingers are in absolutely atrocious condition. And the bleeding and pain is not fun. I've never brought it up with my doctor because I didn't realize it was an ADHD thing, but I'm not sure what he would do about it anyways.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","**What should I do as Taric in lane?**  
Taric as I've been playing him feels best as a counter-engage to whatever the enemy does. He only has one damage ability (excluding the passive), which is also your only form of CC. I find it much more effective to use it for quick damage then backing off or going for your stun after they've missed their (key abilities). He can keep the enemy ADC occupied with his own damage while simultaneously healing / shielding his own ADC.

**Should I be aggressive or passive?**  
Really depends on what the matchup is. As you have sustain in your kit you can win trades in the long term through your heals and the damage from your passive really adds up if you weave it in effectively. His mana costs are somewhat high early so I wouldn't look to constantly go in for trades and just go for the small skirmishes whenever you can. Like I said earlier he's much better as counter engage as his abilities have cast times that are somewhat lengthy.

**Who should I try to protect? Who do I use my W on? How does that vary in the different phases of the game? Should I use it on an engager or just keep it by the ADC for some protection?**  
You usually want the W on your ADC by default so you can instantly give them the heal, ult or whatever may be needed, but switching its link to the frontline is a good option to as it can give you extra reach on your Stun by shooting it off of them, and the shield scales off of their max health. Since it scales off max health the shield isn't as strong on squishies. Abuse the fact that the cast range on W is very large at the moment. There is really no best person to put your W on as you should constantly be switching it to get the most out of your other abilities and it's shield on cast.

**How do I use my Q / Passive effectively?**  
Use Q when it's at 3 stacks ideally, 2 at max as it's mana cost does not change based off of your stacks. The Q has a really low cooldown if you weave in the two auto attacks afterwards, allowing you to spam it for mini burst-heals if you constantly get the autos off. Your passive is your main source of damage outside of the stun so always try to follow up abilities with them. E &gt; AA is standard and once you're in there just remember to keep on getting the two auto's off after each ability.

**What should my build be like?**  
CDR and Armor is standard for Taric. CDR allows your heal charges to build up faster and is just good overall while all your abilities besides the heal and ult scale with Armor. Any Armor item is good on him but as he's usually in the thick of things Frozen Heart or Gauntlet are exceptionally good. Locket of course is a standard Support Item. Face of the Mountain or Eye of the Equinox is your decision and varies from game to game, but I personally like the potential of Face of the Mountain + Locket + W shield all on one person as it's a lot of extra health you can give to an ally.

I'm still in the midst of learning Taric myself but I've played Support since season one so I hope this helps :)",1462061412

For example, if someone fills out a single box form on the website of your choice, the bot will copy that text from the box and paste it into a Facebook status message immediately. The same thing would happen if somebody messages the Facebook page directly.

"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","So, I've mentioned numerous times that I'm a big pro wrestling fan. They had this concept called the Diva Search in 2004 and that pretty much put women's wrestling in the dark ages from that time until recently. It was the idea that you didn't need to actually be a trained professional wrestler to be a TV star, just a hot chick. Actual wrestlers started either quitting or getting let go for their model counterparts. They wouldn't be trained properly, and just thrown out on television to embarrass themselves. 

Similar to the anchor, their career trajectory was looks based. So the question. Are these women bad people for taking advantage of it, or is it an issue with the company and how they view women? Has the woman in question here been educated that she can get what she wants via her looks? Has she ever worked for companies or been in fields where, ok, yes, I'm a hot chick, so therefore I'll get this, that and the other thing. 

Granted, maybe she is this manipulative, evil person but it's important to ask questions and try and go backwards. Ask why.

"food","t5_2qh55","google reverse sear. It's absolutely awesome. if you don't have a thermometer or experience feeling out where steak is it can be a little intimidating though. The basic idea is to slowly cook the steak in the oven (where it cooks evenly throughout, but with no searing) and then finish it at extreme heat in a pan (since it's purely external so ONLY searing). A good way to start is normal searing. Get a pan super screaming hot and throw steak in for suuuper short til it has a nice sear on it. Then finish it in the oven at 300-350 - bonus points for throwing some butter on top when you put it in. Once you find that easy/second nature try a reverse sear. ALternatively, ignore all of that. steak is fun and easy as hell as long as you're willing to mess up a couple learning!! Don't be intimidated.

Edit: The way I taught my bf (who now makes epic steaks amongst many other things). All cooking methods are going to be either outside-in (the outside dries and crisps while the inside slowly cooks), or inside out (not as much crisping or texture producing on the outside, but everything cooks evenly).

A super hot pan is an example of extreme outside in. If you throw a steak in a searing pan you'll find the outside totally done while the inside is raw entirely. The opposite would be a &lt;400 oven. Cook a steak at 325 or so and it'll get done but with almost no sear. Oil on the outside will help because oil conducts heat and cooks whatever it's touched, but it's still not much. An oven at 400-425 is outside in, but nowhere near as much as a hot pan. Cook some chicken rubbed in oil at 425 and you'll find a nice crisp with zero  sear.",1462061415

The Mastery system is circular, a form of horizontal progression. You unlock Masteries which unlock more content to complete to get more Masteries, but at no point does a Mastery result in an increase in the power level of your character over another character.

It's an important distinction, because those increases in power that define vertical progression are essential to the experience of power fantasy that drives a lot of people to play other RPGs. I think a lot of people who bought GW2 and were disappointed didn't understand that the element of developing a powerful character just doesn't really exist in this game like most modern RPGs.",1462061420

"GlobalOffensiveTrade","t5_2y6r4","We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

As /u/FuckeryToday said, Champion.gg is a reliable tool for builds, masteries and runes. Although it isn't showing Trundle Jungle stats unfortunately. Here's the link for [Trundle Top](http://champion.gg/champion/Trundle/Top). Here's a link for [Trundle Jungle](http://euw.op.gg/champion/trundle/statistics/jungle) through OP.GG's statistics.

Trundle Top is pretty standard when it comes to your build. Titanic Hydra &gt; IBG &gt; Spirit Visage &gt; Armour/Health Item &gt; Armour/Health Item and Swiftness Boots or Mercury Treads. For runes, I use 9 AD marks, 9 armour seals, 9 magic resist glyphs and 3 attack speed quints. For masteries, I use [this](https://i.gyazo.com/9beae2514da5fb1814ade2e135dacecf.png).

When it comes to Trundle Jungle, if you look at the OP.GG statistics page you'll see there's actually no common build path, everyone builds differently and that's because of how flexible Trundle is. You can build Warrior, Cinderhulk or Devourer on him. The safest option is going Cinderhulk &gt; Titanic Hydra &gt; Spirit Visage &gt; IBG &gt; Armour/Health item and again, Swiftness Boots or Mercury Treads. You could also do this same build but with Devourer, maybe getting IBG before Spirit Visage so you can stick to targets better. For Runes, I go 9 AD/AS marks, 9 armour/HP per lvl seals, 9 AS glyphs and 3 AS glyphs for Cinderhulk/Warrior and Devourer respectively. Masteries will generally be something like [this](https://i.gyazo.com/d5db77fc9c4b5a23f925dfa53770e009.png).",1462061421

There are plenty of other things in the bible he could have chosen to blindly follow, but in the instance, he chose forgiveness. So let's just take a step back from the grand debate over the positive or negative influence of religion, and just appreciate how a man was able to forgive someone. ",1462061423

Throughout the sketch, a phone number—(888) 885-4011—was displayed onscreen: not a fake one for Schumer’s HSN-style network, but rather one that, if you called it, would connect you to a message from the gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. The message in question provides instructions on “exactly what to say to support gun control,” and helpfully offers to connect callers to the office of their member of Congress.

After the USSR/Warsaw Pact collapsed, we could have simply pushed as far East as we wanted.  We didn't want to.  Instead we welcomed Russia back into the community of nations.  

The West is a very open society which includes many people of Russian descent and can easily be infiltrated by anyone Russia wishes to send.  Simply put we don't want Russia and they have no excuse not to know that for themselves.  All of this talk of the West &amp; NATO encroaching on them is nonsense.  Every country that joined NATO wanted to.  Nobody either joined or stays at the barrel of a gun.  If other nations make different choices than Russia that is their right.  When Russia invaded Ukraine they invaded Europe.  This is not okay and if Russia wants things like that then they deserve to be punished and should pay all costs for both sides.  That is what frustrates me about this talk of Russia being the injured party.  Whatever happened in Ukraine was Ukrainian business not Russian.    ",1462061423

Of those 3 options my suggestion is New X-Men (2001) since it is the most detailed and did the most overall to change the canon

The problem with Astonishing X-Men (2004) is that it's so few total issues, like the actual arc with the original creative team is only 25 issues and yet it took them 4 freaking years to make. So basically when it ends in 2008 this comic bears no relation to the rest of the actual continuity lol.... it's just its own little story.

Obama's existance was a big part of that, but Clinton was the one flying around talking to world leaders.

The deal makes it almost impossible for them to secretly build a nuke for a few decades.  We can't get 100-year concessions from everyone.  Besides, we may be working with Iran in the region soon.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","From what I understand the cleave build is primarily utilized vs vikings and vs high exposed squishy comps (something like single tyrande heal with Valla and) where the extra damage can easily secure more kills. I believe every build uses rewind except shadow assault because rewind offers more damage and utility in every other case.

Vorpal is more of a utility role that let's Zera stick better to a target or reengage, but more importantly it's very strong vs falstad or heavy disengage (forcing a fight by vorpaling in with VP, or just securing that falstad kill after he uses his panic button).

Both are strong in their own respect, but the biggest weakness of cleave is that if they shut you down you will not utilize a lvl 4 talent and strain your healer since you lack regen master (letting a Zeratul flank without needing to constantly go to fountain/to his healer is pretty important)

If you want to see vorpal play [here's a cast from khaldor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_18wypfjkM), not time linking it since it's not in the first game if you don't want spoilers.

Alternatively vorpal Zera was used quite a lot in the spring worlds a while back if you want to look at that on twitch. MVP Rich occasionally streams and shows the strength of vorpal Zera in high mmr HL games (he plays Zera quite a bit)",1462061435

I just beat dark souls 3, I play a lot of video games. A lot. And you bet I have music in the background. 

I usually pass a lot of time just sitting and thinking. It kinda sucks but i spend a good portion of my time alone so I'm used to it now.

I want to perfect my French but frankly having absolutely 0 motivation doesn't help. I am doing pretty well though, I'm conversationally fluent which I'm pretty proud of.

Pelligrini was manager before him and broke Real Madrid's all-time points record. The season before Mourinho took over.

As for Inter, Mourinho's purchases of ageing players in their prime was fantastic for short-term success, but was always leaving a huge ticking time bomb for whoever took over.

No evidence of this. While it _is_ the most likely scenario, the _""tyranny""_ maintain they never heard of KGB until after it got griefed, and they have no reason not claim it. Also Bran claims that KGB was leaked, but refuses to share who it was, and who griefed it.

This is a huge pain in the ass if whatever you're typing in doesn't take this into account and translate  these spaces into non-breaking spaces.

"knapping","t5_2tj4y","Normally once I've removed the original surface and covered both faces of the slab with scars, and gotten the edges pretty straight &amp; centered I call it done (except for the notching).  Were you ONLY using an ishi stick?  If so, that might be why the edgework wasn't as sharp or fine as what you were hoping for.

Methods, tools, techniques, &amp; tricks may vary widely from one knapper to another, and this is just me &amp; how I see it and try to do it from my perspective.  Whether it's a spall or a slab, pressure flaking or percussion (direct or indirect) the first step for me is to shape out a preform with a good profile, and an even thickness (**and** all original surface removed if it's a slab.  Great job on that, BTW) using fat powerful flakes to shave off all the biggest and most irregular bulges. Even though my goal is to leave a good flake pattern in the end, I don't even worry about it or let myself ""sweat the small stuff"" at the stage.  I just focus on removing the spots that are too fat for the finer tipped tools and focus on staying focused, trusting that the less mistakes I make (like hinges and snaps and un-planned overshot flakes), the nicer the flaking will be in the end.  Then I switch to pressure flaking and do pretty much the exact same thing on a smaller, more zoomed in scale: sending medium-sized flakes along medium-sized ridges to remove medium sized irregular bulges and setting up custom platforms to give the tip of the tool enough of a bite to send the flake at the angle I'm going for. As I continue and get the point closer to completion, the flakes continue to get finer, the focus continues to zoom in, and I pick up and put down different tools even more.  More often than not I knap points that could have (and probably should have) been better, but then there's those other times when I find the right focus and things to work on for where my head is at, find the flakes coming off right and everything going surprisingly well, and end up following the white rabbit to see how far he goes.  For times and points like that, I do my finest (and most patient) edgework more by feel and sound than by sight.  It's a snap or pop (as opposed to a crackle or a crunch) that I'm feeling and listening for.  In times like this when I'm focused on nothing but the point, I've even picked up a flake and used it as a tool to serrate an edge (flaking inside the flake scars, in the valleys rather than along the ridges).

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","I think it's near impossible to justify the cost/commitments of Magic unless it's *your favorite thing in the world.* I think it's extremely interesting, I read about it every single day and I follow this sub, but I only play during pre-releases because there are just other things that I would rather be spending my money and time on. Not wasting your time in MtG demands so much money and time that it can't be a side hobby, it would just cut into whatever your *actual* favorite thing in the world is. Besides that it's actually kind of unpleasant to play Magic for me because the LGS here is hot, loud and smelly. I have to decide that I really, really want to be physically uncomfortable for 2+ hours in order to play Magic.

On a personal note, my day-to-day schedule just isn't Magic-friendly. I work nights, so I get out of bed around 7pm every day. My LGS hosts events at 6pm. If I want to play Magic I have to drag myself out of bed early and immediately go to the LGS, essentially I'm playing Magic for breakfast. Then if I lose I have all night to be haunted by it. That's another reason why I only play during pre-releases, because I can play at midnight. I know, you can play any time you want on MGTO but I'm not really interested in the game if I can't play with my hands and see my opponent face-to-face. If I'm just sitting at my computer then I'd rather just play a videogame.",1462061439

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked at a hotel in Vail Colorado for a couple seasons. My position was the night shift maintenance tech and one of my nightly duties was to  close the outdoor pool by putting a cover over it and inserting the divider between the indoor-outdoor pool. One night while closing the pool the Front Desk Manager came out and asked if I had seen a bear out here because some guests had reported seeing one. Being the smart ass that I am I told FDM, that if had noticed one, we would be having this conversation inside. He laughed but stayed out there until I finished, then we went back into the hotel. Now I'm not sure if all hotels have a basement hallway system, but this one did. It was a long continuous corridor that was a horseshoe shape. I closed and locked the access door to the pool area and we descended the hand full of steps into the basement. On our right was the purchasing cages and straight in front of us was my maintenance office about 50 ish feet down the hall. About that point we saw this big brown object head around the corner. We stopped in our tracks trying to comprehend what we had seen. Was it an animal or was housekeeping moving some linens through the hall... About 3 seconds later a bear peaked back around the corner and looked at us like an inquisitive dog would. It started moving towards us slowly from the opposite end of the hall. We took off running the other direction, into the purchasing area. FDM locked himself in one of the cages and I went into purchasing office to call 911. When I got on the phone in the office I had the door mostly closed and was looking through the cracks trying to see where the bear was. It was pacing back and forth through the purchasing area. While I was fielding questions to the 911 operator the bear came up to the door that I was hiding behind and was sniffing in the crack and the space under the door. Now this door was one of those cheapo wooden doors that's hollow. The kind that if you close it too hard it will break. It was so scary! At one point during the conversation the 911 operator asked me if it was a big bear or little bear... I'm like ""ma'am that's an excellent question to ask someone when they are at the zoo and the bear in question is on the other side of a fence. This bear is smelling the back side of my door, it's freaking huge."" Finally the cops show up and scared the bear out of the basement by making noise. They had paintball guns with ball bearings loaded in the hopper incase things got rowdy. Then they had an MP5 just in case things got real rowdy. When they chased it out, it went through the door it came in through, right next to the pool and it jumped in and swam across the pool messing up the cover. The hotel owner then told me to go fix the cover on the pool and I was so scared because a bear just swam through there and disappeared into the trees on the other side. The next day the guys that had access to the camera were looking through the footage to see what all went down. They found one frame where I ran into the purchasing office and this particular camera system took a frame every second or so to keep data low. There was only one frame that I was on, mid stride arms pumping... then I was gone, so I gained the nickname ""the flash"".

I mean, you can juggle in places like the control room on Kanal so it doesn't just need to be garage but with us, we usually have a 3 in, 2 out system. 3 in-objective room defenders and 2 roamers. It's usually Jager that gets taken to roam, as well as something else, it's a mixture really, depending on the preference of the player. Some use Pulse, some use Frost, sometimes people are even use stocky operators like Doc or Rook.

I do think Bandit as a whole operator, is glorious. The gun is awesome, if you can handle the recoil then it's impeccable. Range can be an issue at first but you get used to it. It is a necessity at times e.g. Juggling or Hostage (Shock wire on barbed wire.. lul) but I don't see it as being somewhat something you will need every round.

But yeah, if we're talking 80% profit, that would be more reasonable, but still the UFC is taking on all the financial risk here, and it also, the high star pay outs creates awful pay out structures for non-super stars in boxing.

In boxing, 2-3 guys get anything approaching that level of profit split, and it's often with promotions they have ownership with.

It also makes a really top heavy and awful system where the disparity of pay of guys on the same main card is appalling; a top guy like Cotto is making 1 mil, and the co-mains are making 6k, and some of the undercard guys are making couple grand to even a few hundred in some cases.

UFC pay needs to increase pay, but to be fair it has been, steadily, especially in the min. pay area, the lowest any fighter can make for a win in the UFC now is 20k, and 10k for a loss. That's far more than almost any fighter gets in boxing undercards.

Maybe it's because I'm a socialist Canadian, but I favour systems where top guys are making a less, but the rest of the roster is getting a more reasonable pay out, especially when you start to factor in the extra 150k in performance bonuses.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Vigorous competition is necessary to ensure the survival of the fittest. The DNC in general, and Sanders in particular, have combined into a perfect storm of failure that makes Trump POTUS.

The DNC failed to ensure a plurality of candidates for the primaries, to forge or incinerate each other's candidacy, so that only the strongest survives (who, by definition, will be most likely to win the general election). It is in the best interests of the party -- and *the nation* -- that they do that, and they blew it.

The only opponent is Sanders who, despite being well-intentioned, is a spectacularly weak candidate. *And Then*, Sanders*completely* fumbles the ball, and fails to do his job -- namely, to provide the strongest-possible opposition.

Hillary is a walking scandal-factory, and her most-recent is the worst. The last time she worked in the Exec Branch, she exposed national security info to America's adversaries *thousands* of times. For the utterly ridiculous purpose of evading FOIA law. Ability to safeguard national security info is not only germane to the duties of POTUS, it may be THE most important duty. If she protected national security info the way she protects her Wall St speech transcripts (which probably violated Federal election laws), she wouldn't be the subject of an FBI investigation. Instead, she screwed it up *so* bad, she might be facing *thousands* of counts of violating the Espionage Act and life imprisonment. By any standard, Hillary can *never* be allowed to access national security info ever again.

BUT, Sanders refuses to talk about it. Kid gloves, won't touch her. Not only does this show his shameful weakness to win a political competition, it shows an amoral wllingness to subordinate national security interests to political expediency. His willfull weakness is a slap in the face to his supporters, to his party, and to the rest of the nation.

So Trump walks in, and annihilates Hillary, because she is an inconceivably weak candidate.

Mostly, because he's *not* a weak candidate. He's an economy-focused anti-war political centrist, he's shockingly social-liberal to sell himself to the GOP faithful but hot-damn if he didn't pull it off, he's an energetic and relentless fighter, he's candid and authentic to a fault, he's not an ideologue or religious zealot, he's put tens of thousands of people to work, and his specific expertise is persuasion and obtaining cooperation between otherwise non-cooperative parties. Those are really good qualities for a President.

Well the whole point of it being progressively structured was that those who, for example, only own a house wouldn't see any tax at all, and therefore wouldn't be disincentivized from owning property

&gt;I don't believe people owning property has a huge social cost on everyone else in, say, the US, 

As i've said other places here, there might not actually be a problem. It does however appear that there is since people claim that they can't ""escape the system"" which would insinuate that there is no way to create a community without having to pay and pay and pay. If that is the case, I think it'd be interesting to look for a solution

&gt;I believe property ownership in most cases is a good thing

Me too

&gt; If you're looking to tax something, why not a sales tax on luxury goods that don't last?

Because we can produce another luxury good but we can't magically produce another acre of land if it's all owned

&gt;I don't want to prevent people from using their own money as they wish, but utility-wise products that dissolve over time are much less useful to the economy than property.

Then she decided to cover the keyboard up and see how badly I'd miss up using my ""stupid"" method. I did just as well considering I didn't look at the keys anyway.

My niece and nephew on the other hand all suck at typing. they are 8 and 11 you'd think being raised in a world with computers they'd know how to do it. But they're of the generation of touch screens so typing class may be needed again soon.",1462061445

Usually an independent investigation into possible war crimes is called for to be conducted by an internationally recognized body such as the ICC when the country at interest refuses to conduct its own proper investigation or is incapable of doing so. 

**NOTE:** MSF will only get the independent investigation it wants if there are legitimate reasons (other than just simply dismissing it) that the US Military investigation is inadequate or not done properly.

1mg of adrenaline cures bullet wounds?

"fixit","t5_2rf27","I'd get a mini hacksaw and cut the nuts.

You have two ways to approach it with a saw: You can slice up the bolt and peel the nut off. Two cuts should do it. Or, you can cut flush with the toilet and cut the bolt. Since you say the nuts are plastic, I'd opt for #1 since they'll cut easily.

When I started writing this post, I was thinking about this:

The price of homes in Shenzhen has increased by 50% in one year, especially as money has flooded in after the Chinese stock markets crashed. In Shanghai an article I read was talking about how one guy's apartment increased by 11% in two weeks. The fear is, exactly like what happened with the stock market, that any kind of panic would see values crash.

""The two main induced earthquakes in Lancashire in 2011 were very small. To put them into context, they were less powerful than some of the earth tremors that have been associated with coal mining in the 1950s and 60s and that occur today""

And:

""There are two potential impacts on groundwater. The first is associated with the supply and consumption of water for fracking as groundwater may be considered as a source of this water. The second is contamination of groundwater. In both cases the regulations that apply to shale gas extraction will require a detailed risk assessment before any authorisation or permit is granted. Before granting a permit the relevant regulatory authority (e.g. the Environment Agency in England) will need to be satisfied that the activity will not cause pollution of groundwater or lead to unsustainable abstraction. Once approved, monitoring of the environment will be required as part of permit conditions to demonstrate that no impact is occurring. To provide an independent environmental baseline against which this compliance monitoring can be compared, the BGS is undertaking a baseline survey of methane concentrations in groundwater ahead of any shale gas development as there is currently no UK baseline. The baseline study is not only restricted to methane. A wider range of chemical indicator parameters are also being measured and the results will supplement the data already published by the BGS and used to set groundwater threshold values (standards) for the EU Water Framework Directive.

Understanding the risks is a very important step in the design and approval process and very strict controls and regulations are in place to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.""

I don't know how much I can help, but I can share my experiences and what I find helpful. I find myself abstaining from sex with my boyfriend because I struggle with the dysphoria, and experience an emotional cycle where I enjoy myself while I'm aroused, but feel shame and dysphoria afterwards, and have to hide my tears because I don't want my boyfriend to feel guilty and blame himself. I guess that if it's not possible for you to take steps to alleviate your dysphoria during camming sessions and all you can do is distract yourself through sexual arousal or putting on a persona like an actor or dissociating, you'd instead need to focus on aftercare, and finding ways of alleviating the dysphoria after the fact.

When I'm struggling with dysphoria I find it helps to journal, and also to do a little bit of masculine self-care - apply men's deodorant, put product in my hair, put my binder on, wear my guy clothes, and draw self-portraits of what I think I might look like after I transition.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm late to the party, but reading this thread, and ones like it before gives me so much ""heartburn"" of discouragement for the future of society and science. So much close-mindedness.


There are so many commenters that throw out anti-science like science is dichotomous, right or wrong. Anti-vax, anti-GMO, anti-nuclear, pro-homeopathy, etc. ""Burn the witch!"" You're either correct or incorrect based on what you support. While that can certainly be true in some cases, I think there is alot of dogmatic, hivemind going on in here, and that is dangerous. History is riddled with this behavior. There are definitely good reasons to oppose those positions, but dismissing them outright is again, dogmatic. 


For example, I am a scientist by training and I was raised on a conventional farm that relied on GMO products and the lots of medications and vaccinations for our cattle. Over the years, and learning from multiple disciplines, I've realized that it isn't so clear-cut, but rather a spectrum. Personally, I think we over rely on GMOs and for the wrong reasons to boot. Vaccinating is something that I'm not overly educated on because I'm not close to any decision that would really require that knowledge, but I'm not gonna blindly dismiss or accept them before I really research things. I bet anyone that visited our farm for a day or two and was able to actually see firsthand and have it explained to them would sway to the other side of the anti/pro-GMO spectrum as one example.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; Since you're big on statistics and leagues, check this and look at Kassadin's win rate in Diamond, Masters, and Challenger.

He has a bad winrate in dia and lower. In masters it's 50% with 100 games played.

In challenger, it's 93% with 13 games played, which you can only assume it's someone who mains Kassa.

&gt;The fact that he's been picked at least half a dozen times or so in the last few weeks in competitive means that he's working in scrims in some situations. I'm going to have to assume that pros and coaches know more than a ""masters"" player on reddit does about his strength.

Who has really picked him that often? From all of the regions I've watched I have hardly seen him picked.

&gt;His laning is supposed to be bad wtf?

Which is fine, but right now it is in the worst state it has even been because they nerfed the shit out of his base damages.

&gt;I'm fairly certain a ""Masters"" player should know that scaling champions need to have a tradeoff early game to make up for their strength late game.

Except, he doesn't scale at all right now. His late game is pretty bad because his damage is so low.

&gt;I can name other champs with poor laning phases that make up for it in the Late game if you're having trouble thinking of any. Just let me know.

Wow, there are bad early game champions??? No way dude! You really taught me something here!

1911s need good magazines. The controlled feed design relies on three things to work: proper feed ramp angle and depth, extractor tension and magazine spring/lips.  When they all work correctly the 1911 can be surprisingly reliable, even compared to modern designs.

I'd love too see an in depth review of the norinco with pics of: feed ramp, barrel lug cuts in the slide, barrel lugs, barrel feet and slide stop.

Norincos imported into the U.S. In the 1990s used good steel for the frame and slide, bu the machining was often rough (sometimes extremely so), the barrels were made of soft steel and often the barrel lug cuts in the slide were off resulting in timing issues.

I would be curious to see what modern versions look like. I would expect them to be far better made with the nearly universal use of CNC machining.

After proving your worth, you meet Mushin at his tower and he tests your abilities. You defeat him, and he has Yura send you to Sky Petal Plains, in the Siliverfrost Mountians, because that's where everyone is at now. You land in Grand Harvest Square and see the Lumang Syndicate is attacking, yep those guys connected to the Dusk Adlers back in the Viridian Coast are from here. The leader Yunsang is here and he means buisness but so does the handsome Yu Chan who helps you repel the thieves. You need to desperately get into the city because Jinsoyun is about to do the Divine Mandate Ritual in Zaiwei, expect technically you are more interested in revenge then stopping that but your determined. And  Yu Chain says till Yunsang is in custody no one can enter the city. You meet up with Juwol who is here for personal reasons, you also meet and rescue a sailor cursing grandma. You learn that Juwol and Yunsang were in love once till she found out he had a daughter he didn't tell her about, who is Yunwa.(Sidenot: back in the Viridian Coast one of the side quest on Songshu Island mentioned this love story just with out the names) Yusang is looking for her and well you don't tell him cause your kind of evil and you just want to kill Jinsoyun and Mushin's a bit off but hey he let you train in that tower everyday so why stop a good thing. Well you evantually capture Yunsang and Juwol (you finally betrayed someone congrats). 

Yu Chan lets you into the city, you look around get almost shot by one of the eight masters who is Soha's brother, you create a plan to get close to Jinsoyun at the palace. You enter a contest fight some random people, and some familiar faces like Captian Gwon and Dochun. Both want to get close to Namsoyoo, who is living life like an Empress. You pick Princess Yumma Fei to guard and find her and your old pal Jungahdo with Yu Chan. You stop a corrupt politician guy who gives you intel on Jinsoyun. You help Madun summon the eight masters into Zaiwei to stop a ritual. You find loyal soldiers and make your attack on Jinsoyun. And you fail miserably. Guess all that dark chi talk from Mushin was empty bravado. Yura delivers Yunwa to Jinsoyun, and while she is pleased she has known all long that Yura was working with Mushin, and has plans for Yura. Jinsoyun slices you up like pepperoni and leaves you to die in prison with your friends. But your friends rescue you, you all escape and find the real Talus Emperor, though now your mortally wounded.

You decide to be overly dramatic and kill yourself but the eight masters stop you, and try to heal all the dark chi you have accumulated. Well with the Mark of the Black Rose and the dark chi you learned from Mushin, it's to much for them to handle and they sacrifice their lives to save you. (This will have consequences much later in the game but don't worry about it now). You meet up with Dochun who reveals his past, and how Namsoyoo is the Empresses daughter, he took care of when assassins tried to kill her. (Essentially Namsoyoo and Yumma Fei are half sisters, and Namsoyoo is the one with complete royal blood of the Stratus Emperor) You need to find the seal of the Talus Emperor to prove Yumma Khan is the real Yumma Khan. On your way you meet up with Dordi the young Lyn from Hogshead pasture who had boy troubles, she needs you to help your friends (from the Wizard of Oz). You help Yumma Fei get the seal, and you return with  the others in the snowy peaks of Silverfrost. A lot of side plot happens here, everyone makes a cameo along with some Yeti's and Banshees. At Silverfrost Citadel you find the real truth, Mushin attacked and orchestrated the death of Jiwan, and blamed the whole thing on Jinsoyun. Jinsoyun decided to get her revenge on Mushin, but had to do a lot of awful things to get it done. You realize that your quest for revenge could end up like hers unless you seek justice instead of revenge. You meet up the Talus Emperor and drink his blood to become BFFs and go back to training till everyone is ready to invade Zaiwei to stop Jinsoyun. Only problem is Jinsoyun is very close to starting the ritual so will we get there in time? Well find out soon?",1462061462

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","1.) He defines empathy mostly as 'putting yourself in another's shoes' - he distinguishes it from action, but holds it to be a basis for such. 

2.) This is true, but you're rebutting a different point. It is harder to feel empathy towards global warming *even if* it is indeed possible to be empathetic while remaining rational. 

3.) Wouldn’t a very empathetic person have more motivation to see that their giving helped the other person, rather than helped them have a nice image of themselves? Not necessarily. Empathy is merely, as he defines it, putting yourself in the shoes of the other person and using that as a basis for action, which may result in simply feeling good about what you've done rather than *actually doing* good.

4.) You should look at his wider argument because the 2min clip really doesn't colour it in well. Nationalistic motivations for war are driven by ingroup/outgroup associations which are easily created and swayed via empathy - much more so than be rationality. It can go either way; so you can be motivated to topple a dictatorship on account of putting yourself in the shoes of citizen there, just as much as you can be motivated to defend your own by empathy towards your fellow kin etc. Obviously he's talking about the former. 

5.) I think he's merely saying that it is *less likely* for both to operate. It's of course not impossible, just not likely. 

6.) You should watch a longer talk or read his book. I linked to a lecture that goes in to the studies, empirics and general other detail that fleshes out his thesis.  

&gt; Why would a cold blooded person try to figure out how to help people, why is someone going to be convinced by his arguments?

Don't take it so literally. He means simply to be more calculating and logical as to how you will actually go about helping someone so as to make this the principle basis for your action, rather than just putting yourself in another's shoes. 

&gt; I see not the slightest bit of evidence that empathy should be reduced, let alone lobotomized.

You are really great in the game and I am sorry you had to leave it this way. I can not understand the reason behind this, as the reasons you pointed out are not bad enough for this in my opinion. Using Shuffle Move should not be a reason to ban someone. To be honest, there must be people who are really slow and like to think a lot before doing a move, so it is not that certain to detect someone who uses Shuffle Move. That trick to slow the game down might have better chance to be the reason I think. I say that because if you slow the game down, you basically take out one aspect of the game which is the timed stages. They become so easy that you do not need any items to beat them with a good time. That is what I think reading others' experiences, I never actually used that to see for myself. That would maybe be more critical. Expert Stages and Timed Special Stages or EB get ""manipulated"" to be easy. I still think they should not ban for that, but I was trying to imagine what they might have thought about it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I'm late to the party, but reading this thread, and ones like it before gives me so much ""heartburn"" of discouragement for the future of society and science. So much close-mindedness.
&gt; There are so many commenters that throw out anti-science like science is dichotomous, right or wrong. Anti-vax, anti-GMO, anti-nuclear, pro-homeopathy, etc. ""Burn the witch!"" You're either correct or incorrect based on what you support. While that can certainly be true in some cases, I think there is alot of dogmatic, hivemind going on in here, and that is dangerous. History is riddled with this behavior. There are definitely good reasons to oppose those positions, but dismissing them outright is again, dogmatic.
&gt; For example, I am a scientist by training and I was raised on a conventional farm that relied on GMO products and the lots of medications and vaccinations for our cattle. Over the years, and learning from multiple disciplines, I've realized that it isn't so clear-cut, but rather a spectrum. Personally, I think we over rely on GMOs and for the wrong reasons to boot. Vaccinating is something that I'm not overly educated on because I'm not close to any decision that would really require that knowledge, but I'm not gonna blindly dismiss or accept them before I really research things. I bet anyone that visited our farm for a day or two and was able to actually see firsthand and have it explained to them would sway to the other side of the anti/pro-GMO spectrum as one example.
&gt; I'm just advocating for more open-mindedness. It's more complicated than I'm seeing it portrayed on here.

I cannot describe how comfortable I felt in a setting where I very clearly did not share the experience with them.  More comfortable than I have ever felt at a Christian event, even if it was secular.

The Seder was quite relaxed (we had a drinking game where you took a sip of wine anytime the word ""Egypt"" was said), great conversations were had.  First class chicken Marbella, potato kugel, gefilte fish, matzo ball soup, and a ton of dessert that didn't feel non-dairy.  I guess it helps that everyone there was reform/recon in the level of comfort I felt.

The next day I helped the local temple prepare their Seder in the kitchen.  Boiled matzo balls, made mashed potatoes and everything.  All of the people helping in the kitchen were wonderful, and made me feel immensely welcome in a house of worship that isn't mine.

* All your bottom components can come up to the top.
* Try to avoid daisy-chaining your power distribution
* Use wider traces for power distribution.  In addition to being lower resistance, wider traces also have less inductance
* I don't see any ground plane pour.  It seems as if your grounds are all traces.
* Double check the annular ring constraints of your fab house with your vias
* Your TSSOP part might fail minimum dam size.  Check your soldermask constraints with your fab house.
* U$3 doesn't have sufficient mechanical clearance for mounting a heatsink.  Even if you didn't need a heatsink, I would move it further away from that connector.
* Where are you going to find a 60 Ohm resistor?

You can indicate component values in more of a standardized and compact way:

* Resistors take the form 2K00, 270R, 60R0, etc. 3 digits of precision cover up to 1% resistors.  Use M,K,R to indicate radix.
* Capacitors are typically indicated in pF, with the last digit signifying a power of 10 and anything preceding is the mantissa.  E.G., a 103 Cap would be 10nF and a 105 would be 1uF and a 224 would be 0.22 uF

I've been bitten before by open source projects that have no support, documentation and are possibly even abandoned. And I'd have a tough time trying to convince my bosses+legal to allow use of code from a hobby open source project instead of something industry standard like OpenGL itself. Especially if it's GPL.

That said, if it was someone reputable with a stake in Vulkan like Valve or Google, then I completely agree! I'd love to see what they come up with. I'd still have trouble convincing higher ups because we target Macs too, but it would be easier.

I can't say I agree with the idea that driver manufacturers only have one API to focus on. I mean, now they have OpenGL AND Vulkan to focus on. And I doubt nVidia would like the idea of handing over responsibility for OpenGL from their optimized drivers that they've spent an ungodly amount of money on, to a third party library that's just a wrapper. For the simple reason that they wouldn't be able to release drivers optimized for particular games.

"DerekSmart","t5_391j7","Consider that Lizzy's first story referenced Derek Smart repeatedly, the second not at all but contained several very suspicious earmarks (talking points, Glassdoor posts, extremely nebulous anonymous sources that turn out to have been ""verified"" to a farcically bad standard), several sources contacted Lizzy unsolicited within a short period of time on her private number, and Derek claimed credit in public on Twitter and tagged Lizzy and The Esc., but he's supposedly... not a source or behind the sources.

The next day, Lizzy went on an Escapist podcast and repeated the story's allegations as fact, which is the real trouble.

I can think of two (three) more likely situations than a court decision:

- The lawyers for The Escapist and CIG are still negotiating the issue in private. If this is the case, SOP would be that lawyers for both sides would instruct their clients to say *nothing* in public because any of it could be used as ammo in court if the situation did reach a judge.

- The lawyers have finished negotiating in private and there is a private settlement of some sort in place. One which we can assume includes The Escapist not talking about Star Citizen since it has a problem with talking shit. This seems less likely, to me, but a possibility.

- The lawyers have finished discussing in private, if they talked at all, and there is no formal agreement. Instead, CIG has no reason to discuss The Escapist because it's too busy making a game to worry about dumb drama from months ago. The Escapist, then, is not saying anything either because it does not want to risk any more legal threats (especially in light of the downsizing it did recently), or more likely, because its publisher took one look at what was going on and threw a fit and started threatening knives in peoples' backs if they printed allegations of federal-illegal  discriminatory hiring practices based on shoddy-doesn't-begin-to-cover-it evidence or other such insane clickbait again, which included a ban on discussing Star Citizen in hopes of leaving them alone so that they don't press charges based on the documented incidents.

Seeing as CIG's legal demands included removing the story and posting an apology, and the story remains online, it seems likely that if the result was a negotiation between the lawyers, it broke down to ""how about we agree to just both leave each other alone and leave everything just the way it is until it goes away"", leaving foolish actions on both sides on the record but in the past.

At any rate, Lizzy and The Escapist ignore every attempt Derek makes to rope them into whatever his latest narrative is, so it shouldn't be a problem going forward at minimum.",1462061486

After the initial shock (funeral, visiting relatives,etc) wears off, maybe text every few days and just let him know that you are still there for him. Don't ask 'how are you?' but more stuff like 'Thinking of you' or 'let me know if there's anything I can do'. Depending on how he's doing, asking him to hang out/do whatever you normally do together. 

From personal experience, when my grandmother (who I was very close with) died, most of my friends didn't know how to react. I immediately got tons of messages saying ""I'm so sorry/I'm here for you/let me know what I can do"". But there was a ton of chaos, and it wasn't until a week or two later that the whole thing sunk it. Everybody seemed to be tiptoeing around me, Nobody knew what to say, and I didn't feel like I could message any of the random people who were ""there for me"" the day it happened. My two good friends were a godsend. They would text me randomly (""thinking of you"", emojis, etc) and when I was ready, hung out with me. This meant they skipped a couple parties when I didn't want to leave the house and instead ordered pizza with me. They were happy to listen to me cry/rant but they also would talk about random gossip/whatever when I just needed distraction. They also invited me to random social outings when I felt ready and helped ease me back into a social life (as I pretty much didn't talk to anyone else at my school for a month).

Also, most importantly, don't make it about you!! Little wording differences ie ""I wanted to know how you are?"" can come off as self-serving and put the onus on him to respond to you and consider your feelings (""what will C4pt4in_Hydra think/do if i say ____"" etc). Really just follow your friend's lead. Also, yes sometimes it will be awkward for you. That's ok. If you don't know what to say/do, be honest. ""I'm not sure what to say/do, what can I do?"", ""Do you want me to try to distract you?"", ""Do you want me to respond or just listen?""

Best of luck. You are doing an amazing thing. Thank you. Also, I'm a female so you might need to adapt the above accordingly.

Furthermore, you misunderstand what the use of a monopolized force can do to drug companies. It's not deal or no deal; if there is no deal then companies go out of business because the government holds a monopoly on purchasing/distribution. 

We can pretend the government will always be ambivalent towards drug companies and offer them a good deal, but what about the more likely reality that we get a bad deal because our government is so corrupt? 

Much better in my opinion to free the market up and let drug companies compete with each other. End the FDAs bullshit policy on validation for established drugs. If chemical A performs function B and a companies 20 year patent monopoly is up, there shouldn't be a need to go through the same rigorous testing. Just let any company produce chemical A and place regulations on purity.

Piano is something to talk about, but unless you're a renowned pianist or won a bunch of competitions, it'll just be a footnote that people wont really pay attention to. 

As far as undergrad goes, getting into a Top 10 college has a negligible benefit for med school admissions. Yeah, your school's name might impress someone in the admissions department, but if the rest of your application isn't that strong, your undergrad institute wont mean anything. The majority of people that go to a state medical school go to public undergrads. 

And obviously, numbers are something to get your foot in the door [mix of GPA and MCAT score], but again, unless it's just a spectacularly high number, it's just one component of the whole application. The most important thing is your reason for wanting to go into the field of medicine. Everyone's reasons are different, but let me warn you, they can tell from a mile away if you're being disingenuous when you say you ""want to help people.""

"witcher","t5_2sebi","&gt;Meta studies without structured control and measures are not evidence of causation.

Meta-analyses are just various studies that measure the same thing being combined and their results looked at. 

&gt;I cannot stress enough the dangers of setting out an analysis with an assumption of outcome.

Obviously, but assuming that everything was above board, they didn't initially set out to find that there was a link, just looked at a conglomerate of studies that examined the issue. I trust that the APA knows how to conduct good research. From the article:

&gt; The goal of the task force was to ensure that APA’s resolution on the topic continues to be informed by the best science currently available and that it accurately represents the research findings directly related to the topic.

So yeah, at least no official agenda. Damned if you want to figure out if the individual researchers are biased or not, you have fun with that. Also, their inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis explicitly looked at peer reviewed and non-biased sources, in case that worries you. From the article again:

&gt; Although the task force initially included gray literature in its screen, in part to answer concerns about the potential for publication bias in evidence, we ultimately decided that peer review would be an inclusion criterion.

Continuing:

&gt;There is a reason no formal single structured study of a group on the matter has ever demonstrated a causal link.

No applied psychology causal link, of course, since that study would be impossible and/or unethical, or post-hoc by nature. However, experimental studies have done stuff liiiike take randomized control groups and then expose one to violent video games, one to non-violent video games, and one to no video games, and then ask them to perform a task afterwards that allows for some aggressive tendencies. In those studies, the group exposed to violent video games acts more aggressive. Causality. Of course, we run into the ""How the fuck does this translate into real life"" problem, and figuring out that answer is really difficult.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","&gt; All rather subjective really

&gt;Low skill level class allows bad players to have an out when they can't compete with the rest of the playerbase

&gt;He's supposed to emphasize gamesense, but he takes less gamesense than the other classes because he can win DM fights he shouldn't just because of his extra health

&gt;He also invalidates the engineer and pyro classes when playing outside of low skill environments because he fills the same niche but is usually better

out of those, #3 is the *least* objective. 

heavy requires the least gamesense because he's the least complicated class. You never have to worry about positioning because there's never any chance for heavy to out position people by being smart, unlike the other classes. He's just too slow to actually punish dumb players. 

&gt;So then why on Earth would a class that's already so susceptible to counterplay need nerfs?

because even if he's easy to beat, beating him is never fun because he's such a boring class to fight. Until heavy is actually fun to play against, people are going to want him nerfed because every situation where heavy is present is less fun than if the heavy hadn't been there.

&gt;I don't agree that he's a low skill class

Well, you're going to have to disagree with the entire ESEA and most of the UGC community then, not me.

Heavy, spy, pyro, and engi being full time is less fun because they take very little skill to actually frag, and most of their killing ability is based on baiting enemies into a bad area. The other classes have more depth because they posses DM as well as rewarding smart plays.",1462061492

You may already know this, but I wanted to remind you that the official campaign made a specific donation-link so that we can track how effective our fundraising is! With every donation you make on our page, that little thermometer in the sidebar rises more and more!

Please go to www.BernieSanders.com/reddit or click this link right here to be taken to the donation portal! (Unless you're not a citizen, permanent resident, or dual-citizen of the United States. You cannot donate legally, nor can you ask someone else to donate for you).

Thanks for your contribution! Please share this link whenever someone asks about donating to Bernie! And if you're not actually talking about donating to Bernie, forgive me! I am just a simple robot. Blame my creators. Silly mortals, they are.

But, hey, while I have your attention, please read the following wiki page called 'Phonebanking 101.' It is chock-full of important information, and serves as a must-read primer for anyone interested in joining the call team. Phonebanking is THE most important thing we can do to help Bernie win!

My tactic is to talk to them, and keep talking to them. Eventually they will realize I am talking to them because I like them and give me some indication of whether they like me or not. Usually the second day I try and start a conversation with them they know I like them and they ignore me, brush me off or tell me they don't like me.

I want a girlfriend because a lot of people I know have a girlfriend, and I want to have sex with something other than my hand. I don't want a girlfriend as much as I used to though. After the first time I got rejected all I would think about is the possibility of a girlfriend, an actual female to talk to that wasn't my mother or my sister.

Eh, they seem to be really happy together. I've known him for 10 years, and I've never seen him get this excited about a girlfriend before. And he's told me before that he wants to have a family -- hence his ""family starter kit"" comment.

It's just that this is the point where our lifestyles are diverging, probably for good. In a couple of years, he's gonna be a husband and stepfather (and possibly an actual father as well), and the good old days of boozing and goofing off with him will be gone.

I did not expect this to get as much attention as it did. I just wanted to share. Misery loves company, after all.

I applaud Pebble on making the Time a GLASS screen instead of a plastic one from the first version. I do enjoy the design, features, and battery life of this thing more than the ""Version 1"".

I must admit I am fully aware of the amount of scratches the device will receive without any protection. On the Version 1, I tried a variety of screen protectors. ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THEM STAYED ON. They would always end up with an edge looking like someone's old booger after a few weeks. I retired the watch before I found a solution.

I would certainly buff the screen on the Time to get rid of the two scratches left by the wall, but I would be afraid of sacrificing the coating the glass has on it. I am a little paranoid with putting a screen protector on it. Though it is not a touch screen (who cares, right?), I fear that I will have the same issues I did before with the others. I will relent and try one of these gadget wrap condom things. (Edit: I may try carefully applying car wax to this area. It worked for my glasses a few years ago)

I have been VERY surprised at how resilient the glass screen has been so far. I have owned this watch since the day they were available at a retail store. There have been many times when I had *believed* I scratched it (something that would have been hell on the plastic Version 1), and it has come away with no incident. I don't think any one of us would expect the watch the come away from a brush with a brick wall unharmed with most materials. 

I am unconcerned with the bezel. I knew that was going to be scratched from day 1. You can see the other scratches from 
""lighter"" incidents. If it gets bad enough, I will carefully polish it and put one of those stickers on it. I have to admit I enjoy the anodized look. ",1462061500

Most often then not when I see this issue arise on here, people recommend you take a look at how you're hitting the cymbal.

If you follow through too much, or hit too hard, that's usually what's gonna cause cracking. When you hit the cymbal, you want your stick to come back and not follow through, if that makes sense. When you do it right, the stick kinda throws itself back.

There's a bit of technique to it, but you'll know when you get it because it feels right. It's hard to explain! Check into a few videos about how to/how not to hit your cymbals, there's some good ones out there.

I use this technique almost exclusively while crashing. All of my cymbals are completely flat or tilted away from me. I sometimes hit quite hard. I have cracked one very thin cymbal in the past 3 years.

Also look into the sweeping motion, mentioned by the other user. This is also very useful. I use this motion on the crash ride!

Hard to explain the dynamic between those two languages without giving my location away, but the French were oppressed for quite a while, and they finally got their territory and decided to keep firm and proudly French. Some decided that it was time to give it back as good as they got it. 

Some of my teachers were in that group. I didn't realize it at the time, but at one point they definitely risked my life when I was just ten years old because of it. I was on the school soccer team, and the (volunteer teacher) coaches deliberately left me behind in a strange *big* city. We were supposed to be walking to a soccer field, that I am certain they knew I had never been to (I was the new kid) I was alone, crying, scared, and this was pre-cell phones.

I accepted a ride from the first stranger claiming to be a parent of one of my teammates. I still think back and wonder what would have happened if they *hadn't* been my teammates' parent, or what would have happened if they hadn't seen me.

I'm an American and the only place I've ever seen an electronic kettle was, um, New Zealand. I have never seen one anywhere in the US, even after I got back from NZ and was aware of what they are. This also means I never saw one before going to NZ, I guess.

Also, as for garbage disposals... the hell? I've seen one house in my entire life (and I'm 41) in America with a garbage disposal. Yet I've seen tons of other people in this thread mention they're everywhere int he US. The fuck. This is so weird. Why don't I ever see any?

Of course, nowadays Spotify and similar services are convenient (and, more importantly, unobtrusive/benign) enough that I don't really feel the need to pirate anything (and if I did, it's trivial enough to get DRM-free music with `youtube-dl` and similar tools).  That doesn't apply to everyone, though; for those living in countries where such services are not available (whether partially or entirely), such services aren't an option unless they additionally pay for a VPN connection to a country where they *are* available (and even this doesn't address things like payment methods).",1462061508

I've looked at immigration standards for getting in to some other countries. Seem like they want people who are going after it. I'd hope we have a reasonable standard as well, and again, good quality footwork on the application process. 

I don't like anything about illegal immigration. I don't know if I agree with what some people claim are the specific burdens of it but, for the most part, it just leads to shitty situations (for example, a car accident and no insurance). 

I don't PERSONALLY know any other liberals  who are for people streaming over the borders. But they're all fine with legal and measured immigration practices, as I am. And it doesn't appear to be the argument. 

So far as illegal immigrants already here, I've not been compelled to a strong opinion either way regarding an amnesty plan or the like. I didn't have a position on the death penalty until my 30's. Sometimes it takes a while.

A few things:  
- there's a LOT of jitter if reprojection is disabled in SteamVR  
- things are smoother, but framerate seems low when reprojection is allowed  
- jitter is most evident when rotations happen (turn your head or turn the camera using the stick), motion is much more smooth when going straight or strafing  
- everything works smoothly on my LCD wether VR is running or not; unsure how to check for framerate / frametimes  

Running this on a i5-6600K + GTX 980ti + 16Gb DDR4, in seated mode. I needed to take breaks quite frequently due to the jitter.

I've been to a few places, talked to a few ponies, completed Twilight's and Trixie's quests, zapped a few parasprites, found a changeling in disguise, and a bunch more stuff. Fluttershy's cottage has some great attention to details and feels cozy. Rarity's boutique works especially well in VR and makes for a fantastic environment, I'm guessing it's at least a bit due to the ceiling height.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Yes it is an issue you should address.

It is a form of motor behavior that is very similar to a motor tic, and it is a common thing that occurs both in ADHD but also OCD.  (Furthermore if you have signs of both, the ADHD stuff that is impulsive make it more likely to be a habit and once its a habit the OCD stuff can make it into a compulsion, unconscious ritual even when everything is going fine and that you can do the compulsion even if you are not impulsive or stressed due to it now being an unconscious habit the OCD is implementing)

If it was not causing any downsides in your life than that would be different, but it is one of the things your doctor should be monitoring with your ADHD medication use for an increase of this behavior can tell the doctor that 

* Either your meds are not just right and need to be fine tunned or you put on a second medicine, (like Intuniv an ADHD med, or an anti anxiety med or an anti ocd med such as an SSRI)

* Or that you are having a greater amount of stress in your life, sleep deprivation, or a couple other things that can effect motor tic occurrence and severity for several networks are involved in the fine tuning of your unconscious ability to control this.

Besides meds to treat it, two of the other things that are recommended to treat this but also many other problems that cluster together and co occur.

* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the ADHD, motor behavior, and anything else you may have like some of the signs of OCD or some of the signs of anxiety.

* Finding a better outlet for this ""fidgety energy"", things like fidget toys, stress balls, etc, something to keep your hands occupied and your hands busy so it is not affecting your grooming but also because these things can help you focus, calm down, etc.",1462061516

So you draw this guy in your bronze/silver elo placement games... As someone who has played many games at that elo, a game or two with him is no different than the norm. You actually couldn't tell him from your average, do-my-own thing, player. At least he doesn't tell you how much you suck and how good your mother tastes while he does it. 

The clincher for me is that he only gets down to the shitlo so he can lol at people who freak out in game over how bad he is going to be. I bet he gets so much satisfaction smashing on people who try and shit talk him, and enjoying as people who think they're much better due to his accounts elo do foolish things.

My guess is that they having crime fighting pets has fallen out of fashion among superheroes, especially for serious vigilantes like Batman.

Subconsciously he does, and it isn't just for women. Power is ultimately maintained by the application and direction of violence. Violence is also used to acquire resources. 

You remind me of the stupid Western tourists who can't grasp that Asian Chad can use unpredictable violence to smash your head in, take your nice iPhone, your money and articles of clothing if he feels like it. You hamster on Chad can't do that, it is against the law. If Asian Chad is feeling in a charitable mood, you just lose a few teeth and he lets you live.

I came from a retail X100 LE and then had a brief affair with a pair of Mako IIs that I'm currently trying to sell but I couldn't get the heel lock I was looking for in retails and I work at a shop, so customs were affordable.  The retail Vapor 1X is labeled as a D width and considered to be an A heel.  I measure at about a 7 3/4 on my right foot and a 7 5/8 on my left and I'm between and B and a C width on both feet, so I went with C and a tighter AA heel and ankle.  Rather than getting the Injected Stability Lacing System, I opted for traditional facing/eyelets that are similar to the X900.  Like you said, the liner is different too.  I had them use grey clarino.  I really like the grip that it gives, but it does hold water a little bit, so I've been drying them with a fan and the footbeds pulled out.  The tongue is the black pro stock 1X tongue, which has a bit thinner felt than the retail stuff and is a 2 piece rather than 3.  The metatarsal guard in the pro stock tongue is actually the same one that's in the retail X900 tongue.  It's made of a poly plastic rather than Curv composite.  Finally, I chose LS3 steel and a 272 Light Speed Edge holder, and for whatever reason, it came unstamped. ",1462061520

There were two coming up the sidewalk so he called her into a sit and did some touches as they passed, and released her when they had barely passed. Too soon. Luna was on her harness and immediately turned and nipped the closer jogger. My husband said it looked like a front teeth only, pinch the pant material kind of bite, but definitely made contact. The jogger kind of went ""huh?"", realized what happened but then waved it off without even stopping. My husband was apologizing profusely. So that's fucking great.

She's shown this kind of behavior once before which we didn't really think about but now makes sense: she nipped at my husband's pant leg the exact same way once when he jogged past her during the relaxation protocol. We feel so stupid that we didn't think much of it when it happened. At least now we know it's a touchy thing for her and can take more precautions. There aren't a lot of joggers around here and she didn't react at all until the jogger was right on top of them AND my husband had released her, so management shouldn't be too bad.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I'll also point out that music (and indeed most art form) does not have a straight linear progression. There are always extremely innovative musicians who do things before they're popularly done. And there are prominent musicians who do things ""antiquated"". Some good examples of this:

Gesualdo was a nobleman during the Renaissance who explored chromaticism that wasn't really done again for about three hundred years.

Mozart (in a scene somewhat famous in the movie, Amadeus) used languages that were not Italian in his operas. He also broke so many sylistic models of the classical era towards the end of his life (check what he wrote in the Requiem, and The Magic Flute). 

Mendelssohn was enamored with the music of Bach (someone who died a hundred years earlier). It's possible that without his influence, we may not really know of Bach today. 

Charles Ives....my hero, check him out.

Louis Armstrong took a popular form in Dixieland jazz and pioneered improvisation on a sophisticated level that wouldn't be matched for 20 years. 

Stravinsky and the Rite of Spring. Unheard of uses of orchestration, dissonance, meter, rhythm, etc. 

Charlie Parker was instrumental to the development of bebop...most musicians at the time couldn't keep up with it. 

The Beatles explored unique recording methods and studio work that was unheard of in rock and roll.

There are some places that claim to be scary, but they're not that bad. They're more family friendly, if you want to terrorize your children, haha!

The Burial Chamber has two haunted house type things, each in half of a small warehouse. They're very disorienting, with false exits and animatronics that are pretty realistic, they're hard to distinguish from some of the actors. The scariest part for me, though, is the haunted woods part. The actors don't just creep around and pop out, they get you in so many ways. They don't touch you, but it's not uncommon to feel something brush against you when you least expect it, or to see someone up in a tree. Once, someone randomly quickly crabwalked across the path in front of us. We all screamed like babies. Then there was the chainsaw guy nearby. We definitely booked it out of there.

The only thing I haven't done at this place is the burial simulator. They had to tone it down a bit because people were peeing themselves in it, which isn't fun.

There are a few upper division (junior/senior) classes in the CS department that you may like (ECS 124 and ECS 129). I took ECS 124 and it was a cool class, a broad overview of bioinformatics/computational biology in perl.

There is also a [minor](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Computational-Biology-Minor.pdf) in computational biology. I can't exactly tell you all that much about the minor overall (I didn't have enough free units to make it work), but I've taken a chunk of the courses it allows as biology electives and I'm happy to answer questions about them.",1462061523

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","There's no way in hell we can have an LCS style league system. There is nowhere near enough money to get everyone in the same place for long enough. 

My guess (read hope)  is that next year they will go back to something close to 2015, utilising MLG fully in the US to make it so that they only need someone else for Europe. The real issue for 2016 was that there was no way to get a league setup because nobody would run it every couple of weeks.

My ideal would be 3 seasons, online group stage in Challenger with 1 or 2 groups per week and then Premier offline over 2 weeks followed by a season finals pretty soon afterwards. The main issue I had with 2015 was that it was a week of foreign sc2 every day followed by a month with nothing, then a week again, then 3 weeks then the season finals, then a long qualifying process, then the whole thing started over again. It was fractured and disjointed. This year is just as fractured and disjointed, but in a different way, I'm not sure if I prefer it from a viewing perspective, I definitely don't prefer it from a common sense standpoint, they gutted Challenger and drastically reduced prize money for players outside the top 16.

Blizz would need to sink a lot of money into keeping DH and IEM running sc2 tournaments if they return to the older system, though. From what people like Adebisi said there could have only been 2 or 3 Dreamhacks and probably the same number of IEMs had they stuck with the old way.

I think you need to recognize that what you have to express is valuable. It might not be valuable to anyone else (hopefully it is) but it sounds like it's valuable to you, and maybe to her.

At the same time, imagine that your project is a little egg, or a larvae. You can't cast it out into the world before it's ready. If you show it to me right now, I'll probably hate it. If you ask me whether you should continue, I might say no, because it's not mature yet. That doesn't mean it won't grow up to be something that can stand on its own legs.

On top of that, I think that you need to do it for yourself. It sounds like this has real therapeutic value for you, which means it's worth doing. (And hell, maybe you'll save yourself a fortune in therapy!) You can also show yourself what you're capable of. If you see it through to the end, you'll know you can do that. All of that is true regardless of whether it sells.

My completely unqualified advice is this:

* Do it. Keep writing. Finish it and then make it better and get it out of your system.
* Don't let other people discourage you when your project is still incubating. They might like it if it's well-crafted and personal. They won't like it if it tries to please everyone. They might not like it in any case. They definitely won't like it if they see it before it's done.",1462061525

My more distant circle of friends don't know much at all about my illness but that also means they don't tend to make assumptions so if I say I'm sick and can't hang they just have to believe me/deal with it and I never give any real info. My closest friends however were a lot harder to deal with. I have chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia (among other things) and at first they thought that meant I was just tired a lot. But their ""tired"" is very different from my ""tired"" and it took a serious conversation for them to understand that. They'd always make me feel bad when I had to cancel/turn down plans, I don't think it was their intention they just weren't being very sensitive. One friend in particular just never got it and she wouldn't stop pestering me every time she wanted me to come out. At the time I was mostly house bound so it was obviously not ideal for me. They knew I was really sick, but she just thought I could suck it up and deal with it, like it was my choice to stay home. She'd say stuff like ""you don't even have to do anything just come for a drive and we can do chill stuff"" but the fact was that I couldn't even sit up in bed without immense pain. If I politely explained and left it at that she'd blow up my phone with texts and calls. I eventually had to have a pretty stern conversation with her and told her it was about time she accepted the fact that I was really sick, I wasn't able to do everything I used to do, and maybe I'll be up to it sometime in the future but for now she had to just be ok with it if I couldn't join in. I said I'm sorry, it's not my fault, I've actually been having a pretty hard time dealing with everything and it doesn't help me when she puts pressure on me to do stuff I just can't do. I told her I appreciated her trying to help and get me out of the house but it would be more helpful to me if she tried to be a bit more understanding/supportive. After that she apologised and really chilled out, and never made me feel guilty for that stuff again. I made sure she knew it was ok to invite me to stuff, because occasionally I will be up to it, but if I told her I couldn't do it she just had to be ok with that. 

Some people just don't have that natural understanding/knowledge or they can't take hints/social cues. Those people are the ones you might need to be firm with, if you go about it in a positive/constructive way it can be the best way to get through to them. Usually people are like that because they were raised with other blunt/outspoken/black and white kind of people, so they might not always pick up on subtle social cues. or even obvious social cues. You gotta speak their language and get on their level, you know? Say it in a way you think they might understand best. It's not easy, but sometimes necessary.

My grandfather for example did a lot of travailing before he finally settled down in his 60s, and due to his prominent rank in the Scottish Right was allowed lodge access almost everywhere he settled, and along the way he met many a loose lip senator, Thomas Gerstle Abertheny and Bruce Alger being two of them. he only told my dad the stories when he became a Mason, and only told me a few before his death, but he took the really interesting stuff with him to the grave.

"technology","t5_2qh16","1. The destination server does ""think"" you are actually the exit node. If you're in Canada and your exit node happens to come out of Germany, the site you visit will see the German IP address (and some sites will adjust their language settings accordingly ;) ).

    If a site wants to, they can tell you're coming from an exit node in most cases by doing a DNS lookup. It generates a hostname that combines the apparent user's (exit node) IP address, the server's own IP address, etc. and a DNS lookup will tell the site whether that IP address was an exit node. That's how the Tor check site (that tells you whether Tor is working for you) works. [More info about it](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12395/how-does-check-torproject-org-know-if-youre-using-tor).
2. The exit relay doesn't know the original computer. It instead talks to the middle relay. Each relay doesn't know whether the previous or next computer is another relay, the original computer, or the exit node. It just has encrypted traffic to send from one to the other. If you do something silly like log in through a non-encrypted website with your personal username and password, the operator of the exit relay could read that information. They won't know your IP address, but they'd have your username and password.
3. You don't gain any additional privacy for running an exit node, it just benefits the rest of the network. More exit nodes = people can surf the clearnet over Tor faster.

    I've heard that if you do run an exit node, you should be careful with it and preferably run it in isolation from the rest of your network (on its own IP address, if possible). For example, don't do regular non-Tor web browsing from the same IP address that runs an exit node. It damages some of your plausible deniability that 100% of the exit node traffic is from Tor and it wasn't *you* who was looking up CP or anything.",1462061531

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Team had it's ups and downs at the start but since we were knocked out of the Champions league, the team just stopped giving a shit. 

We're playing dire football and we can't counter attack because we're too slow on transitions and we can't defend counters because of the same reason, we rely on our wingers' technical abilities to get past their markers and create something which usually leads to nothing. Our defense is awful and we rely on a 19 year old kid that had a good game against Benfica and then (as expected) showed that he's still too green. Our midfield runs a lot but that leads to nothing, our attack can't finish chances even if their lives depended on it, Aboubakar barely makes any runs and can't finish worth shit, Suk is just mediocre and not the quality we need and André Silva works a lot but just has too much pressure right now. 

The Méxicans have been the bright point of this team, Herrera is now the captain since Maicon fucked off and Hélton doesn't start and has been having his best season since he's joined us with 9 goals (our top goalscorer), Láyun is an assist machine but lacks defensively sometimes and Corona started off well but like I said, sometimes tries to do too much on his own and either loses the ball, or when he actually can create something, no one takes advantage.

3. Again, same issues. I had to back off some things such as handstands and anything that flexed my wrist too much. Do more work on wrist stretching and strengthening routines. Till then, I used small parallettes/push-up bars for most of my wrist work (LSits ,pushups, handstands). You can also do it on fists, but I found it too uncomfortable. You could also try just doing headstands instead, to help strengthen your core while your wrists improve.

 - St. Celestine

Troops:

 - Battle Sister Squad w/ Simulacrum, flamer, heavy flamer, superior (power weapon) [x4 squads]
 (one squad in a Repressor, fill the rest up with sisters for bullet sponges)

Elites:

 - Dominion Squad w/ 4 melta, superior (combi-melta)

Fast Attack:

 - Seraphim Squad w/ hand flamer, inferno pistol, superior w/ power weapon and plasma pistol [x2]

Heavy:

 - Exorcist

 - Retributor Squad w/ 4 heavy bolder,  superior w/ combi weapon

 - Retributor Squad w/ 4 multi-media, superior w/ combi weapon

If they don't let you use the repressor, you can field it as a rhino. You can also use basic sister models as combi-weapon superiors for specialty squads, and let your pile of sisters fill out battle squads. You'll have a few specialist girls left for your command squad, and you could cut down to two blobs of ladies if you wanted to throw specialist weapons elsewhere. I'm a fan of having a field of special weapons on this. Tuck the heavy bolter rets in a ruin and get a prometheum relay for all the flamers, and you should be good to go.

Also quite a bit of money comes from materials that drop off those silver areas. For example Demon Prison floor 2, the Harugals drop leather that are used for high level recipes which are worth approx 150k in Orsha right now. People are farming low level mobs that drop Battle Bracelets worth 3m.  Dungeons are good silver but you can only run them 3 times a day and usually they'll run it solo to get the maximum amount of silver for themselves however that requires high level + decent gear since mobs are like 10x hp/dmg.

If there really were 19656 (or even 3,276) variations then it is safe to say that it would be nearly statistically improbable for me to get several M4 with the same talents. (two were exact dupes, two had two of the same and the last one I got shared one)

That is not 19656 (or 3,276) variations.

I am not sure if this PSA is valid.  I believe the system is weighted.

This is how bad info propegates.  One guy thinks he knows how it works, writes out a lengthy post that sounds logical but it misses one elephant in the room and for the next week(s) or so, everyone jumps on it and makes it ""real"".

I have also found 3 M1a's with Balanced. Two were shitty otherwise, but still.  My Black Market AK's and my SMG's rolls often have Brutal. That's also not really statistically possible with that many variations.


***You really should edit your post before people start spreading unconfirmed and untested information***


I believe it is combinations, not permutations. 3 slots, 28 varients

A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement.

A combination is a selection of all or part of a set of objects, without regard to the order in which objects are selected.

Slot 1 has 1:28 (one chance at every variation)

Slot 2 has 1:27 (one chance at the remaining variations -1)

Slot 3 has 1:26 (one chance at the remaining variations - 2)

But slot 2 cannot be slot 1 etc..and it makes no difference the order.

Slot 1, 2 and 3, regardless of how they are ordered count as ONE possibility.

Brutal, Vicious and Balanced is exactly the same as Balanced, Brutal and Vicious and cannot count as a possibility as it's the same.

[Louis CK sums up pretty well how I feel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcja4WFFzDw) 

To me, a fag is just someone who's really annoying and pretentious. (Just like the ""Film Actors Guild"" in the movie *Team America*, actually.) 

That being said, I'd **never** use it in public because I know how hurtful it can be. And I actually feel really offended when I see [those conservative religious protesters](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nmekb4k-ZeM/hqdefault.jpg) using it because I feel like they're misusing ""our"" word! 

But I think if we could all agree on CK's [definition](http://7770647a14b0867efc75-b939f832d8cd9c860ce8909163419528.r92.cf2.rackcdn.com/67609.jpg), the world would be a better place. 


Edit: I guess it's kinda similar to how black people use the ""N-word"" as something friendly. And I can definitely see how that has helped transform the word into something less harmful, although it's still controversial.

* **Steal the Sky** by Megan O'Keefe.  A fun heist story in a steampunk setting, featuring a classy conman out to steal the biggest airship in the world, a straight cop who finds herself in a political dogfight and forced to use the services of said conman, and a murderous doppel (a person who can use the magic system to appear to be any other character).

* **Rogues** anthology by George RR Martin.  A collection of short stories (fantasy and other) featuring Joe Abercrombie, Scott Lynch, Neil Gaiman, Patrick Rothfuss and a whole bunch of other people.  Also, there's a short story by Martin that is dryer than the Silmarillion.

* **Hellblazer: Original Sins** by Jamie Delano.  John Constantine is one of those comic book characters that I've heard mentioned a lot, but haven't really seen any good adaptions for.  However, if I'm going to keep reading graphic novels, then I think I'll need to upgrade my old kindle to something that can handle them.

* **The Gunslinger** by Stephen King.  This one is actually a lot more sedate than I was expecting - there is a lot of time spend on characters and scenery, but less things happening than I'm used to.  I've felt that before with old books/movies, so I think I'm just used to a different style of books.  Anyway, the concept of the Dark Tower is interesting, so I'll definitely keep reading the series.

* **Prince of Thorns** by Mark Lawrence.  A 13 year old kid with no moral compass is out for revenge on a king, and intends to become the undisputed emperor of the broken empire by the time he's 15.  Is it possible for a book to be both Young Adult and Grimdark?",1462061539

Blow it out of your ass Shyamalan.  Your career has tanked for a reason, and it's that you feel entitled to waste people's time with stupid bullshit like this piece of garbage, and the downward spiral of even more putrid refuse that has followed it.

_________________________________________________________
And on topic with the ""doesn't depend on"" thing, I think you need to dial it back and think.  Because the series does have some of those, as does pretty much any shounen.  For example, [Manga Spoilers](#s ""Izuku getting saved by the ghost of One for All's past is definitely main character shielding, even if it wasn't life or death."")  It makes some sense as to *why* it happened, but that doesn't take away that it happened.  And there's no fault with it happening either, that's just the method of shounen.  If you want something different, don't read shounen.

And we're not even 100 chapters in, it's pretty hard to say anything much about something like insane power ups.  The main character hasn't even really had a chance to stake his claim yet, obviously he's not gonna get a power up for it.  He's not up against an enemy that requires it, yet.

_____________________________________________________________

I'm not trying to say Horikoshi is just following the standard method, but people have been getting a bit out of hand with the ""he breaks so many tropes"" thing.  You're comparing it to much more established, longer shounen manga, so of course it's not going to have some insane power creep (power creep needs an established bracket of power for it to start creeping, something we are more or less just now getting to).

All I'm saying is, think about it more before you talk about all the tropes he's breaking (and not specifically you, that's a general statement).  There are a few here and there that he's broken, but it's almost like people try to ignore it when he does.  He still follows shounen tropes, and there's nothing wrong with that.",1462061542

They would probably never do this, because they're terrified of suddenly having so many Arab voters.)

Golan Heights: Become part of Israel, return to Syria, or form part of a new Palestine state. Gaza Strip: Choose between Israel, Egypt, or Palestine. West Bank: Israel, Jordan, or Palestine.

3. The UN patrols a demilitarized zone between the former occupied territories and Israel. Israel, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Palestine are free to close their borders to each other, or to have normal relations.

4. Each nation is responsible for its own citizens. If someone from West Bank sneaks in and blows up people in Israel, or if an Israeli shoots up some Arabs, the nation the attackers came from pays insane amounts of reparations to the other nation.

I had made really good friends with my roommate (anti-frat) and other friends within the dorms (mostly anti-frat), male and female. I could've become very close friends with all these people, instead I would ditch them frequently to do Fraternity activities and parties. 
I never really became close to any current brothers. The one brother I did click with, all we did was smoke pot. Go out on joy rides and smoke. He eventually dropped out of college. 
So the years go by, i drifted away from my close dorm friends and took priority with the Fraternity.

When the game started it printed off an ASCII map of the shape of the track.  It told you how far you were from the next corner, how tight the corner was and asked for your input.  Your input was just a single number, positive for acceleration % and negative for braking %.  Then the game came back with what speed you were doing, how far you were from the next corner, and how tight the corner was, and asked you for your input, as before.  You put your acceleration/braking number in, and so it went.  If you went too fast through a corner it said you had crashed.  If you got around the track it told you your time.

That's it.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I think three things are mainly at play here, causing most people to play all, or mostly, standard.

1) The legendary quests. 10 packs is a pretty big incentive to play the format, and once you have won nine games you have deck that you are interested and invested in.

2) The new set is very good and interesting. Playing standard right one allows you to maximize the impact of the set on the decks you are building. New formats are interesting, and this is the newest of the formats right now.

3) people reading this sub are going to tend to be a little more competitive than average. Standard is a soft target right now where if you come upon a successful deck, you can expect higher than average success.

 This has made me interested in playing it. I seldom ladder when is don't have quests, but I already went down to level five when I did not have any quests, and I would drive for legend if I didn't have real world stuff I need to do.

They are producing artificially (or humanly) enhanced apples, and the package describing them should clearly represent this fact. An apple (or any food product) being labelled as 'natural' is inherently oxymoronic, by nature of being in a fucking package that labels it.   And yes this is furious line drawing, but in the broader context, the word natural on food products is a huge draw, and it doesn't actually mean anything/what it is meant to. 

A package is meant to be informative of what it contains, not just  draw consumers in large numbers. The latter is obviously a part of marketing, and this post is not to say 'corps are evil', but rather we have failed to properly regulate food. Our nations obesity rates seems to indicate that this may be an issue.

There is this liar and swindler named Comet Scotia, who has the brilliant idea of impersonating the Stable Dweller in the wasteland that encompasses Southern Equestria. 

Seems like a profitable scheme until you take into account all the powerful factions that take an interest in the hero who ""fights the good fight."" Then the gambits pile up and bullets start flying.

So Comet makes a trek to the bustling city of Baltimare, outrunning mercenaries, lying, cutting deals, breaking promises, lying, jumping into disguises, getting involved in a four-way regional conflict, lying, and gradually becoming a major player in the wasteland herself.

Are you sure about that? Chuck doesn't have anything to do with meat quality or the fat content. Chuck is simply a cut of meat.

So Ground Chuck comes from a Chuck Roast, Ground Round from the Round, and Ground Sirloin from a Sirloin Roast.

Ground Beef and Hamburger are basically made from the scrap cuts and don't have to come from any one piece of the cow. The only difference between the two is that Ground Beef cannot have fat added to it, the only fat that is allowed in must come from the cuts of meat themselves. Whereas Hamburger can have fat added.

Well now that you mention it this was included in his last political testament also written in April 1945.

&gt;I have left no one in doubt that if the people of Europe are once more treated as mere blocks of shares in the hands of these international money and finance conspirators, then the sole responsibility for the massacre must be borne by the true culprits: the Jews. Nor have I left anyone in doubt that this time millions of European children of Aryan descent will starve to death, millions of men will die in battle, and hundreds of thousands of women and children will be burned or bombed to death in our cities without the true culprits being held to account, albeit more humanely.

The last sentence of the testament was this:

&gt;Above all, I enjoin the government and the people to uphold the race laws to the limit and to resist mercilessly the poisoner of all nations, international Jewry.

Hitler wasn't psychotic he was just ideologically devoted to a mind boggingly evil belief system. It doesn't surprise me that after spending years of his life obsessing over the Jews and ensuring their destruction on a continental scale he would mention them in his last will and testament.

There are a lot of reasons why someone might choose to say ""I identify as a woman,"" rather than just, ""I am a woman.""

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","The MG34 is nowhere near as good as the .50 cal especially with the .50 cal's recent buffs. There are also a lot of extremely good players who can't squeeze out wins with OKW when matched against players of equal or similar skill.

Taking out Panzerschrecks may have dealt with OKW AT blobbers, but it also took out a huge utility for higher tier players who didn't rely on blobs or a-move into FOW squads. Jove, for example, who is known for being extremely good with every faction and having huge win streaks with each has yet to win with the new OKW. When he plays against OKW with the same players, he utterly smashes them. Says enough for me.

Regardless, it was a huge mistake to remove Panzerschrecks in this fashion as it balanced the game around lower level play and not higher level play.

Edit: In regards to people thinking removing schrecks is a good change, I also agree in that removing the ability to blob Panzerschrecks is a good move for the game, however the way they are going about it is detrimental to OKW overall and isn't helping to make the faction better in a different way, simply because the faction design practically requires AT infantry.",1462061568

We know Asha and many of her supporters fled the kingsmoot when it was clear Euron had won. 

Euron moved to declare himself king even before the kingsmoot, demanding homage from the other ironborn. He only arrives the day after Balon's death - which itself is reported by conventional means, remember Melisandre claims credit for it.

It is not unreasonable that more ravens flew a day later when the notorious pirate arrives a day later and claims the crown. If qyburn is basing his knowledge on pre-kingsmoot intel that would actually work out fine, the kingsmoot ended up only confirming and strengthening that status quo",1462061568

The 700,000 arab civilians who were banned from Israel were over half of the arab population of Israel at the time. The population of arabs was reduced from around 40-50% of Israel to like 20%, and the homes and property's of arabs were given to jewish immigrants. Its clear that Israel viewed this as a way to increase the ethnic hegemony of Jews in Israel, and solidify it as an exclusively Jewish state, which is the goal of Zionism. The policy of banning over half of the arab population wasnt a lucky accident. ",1462061569

"madmen","t5_2r7l7","Betty' remark to Carla wasn't merely ""insensitive"". Black people were miserably oppressed, brutalized, disenfranchised and kept as a permanent underclass since the founding of the country. To suggest that this should continue just because white racists are inciting violence is profoundly racist. 

It's always hard to parse class/race issues. We don't have solid proof either which way on what was motivated Betty more- class or race. However, all of these other examples, lead me to believe that it was also partly racism that drove Betty's insult to Carla. As for the silver, Betty wouldn't be the first racist wife dating back to the plantations who trusted a black nanny with the kids but not the silver. In the '60s, people were a lot of more innocent about a nanny brutalizing or kidnaping children because most people don't do that kind of heinous crime or crime without immediate profit. However, stealing valuables is much more common crime with an immediate benefit. 

IMO, Betty was the second most racist main character after Roger. I can say that she was more racist than a number of the other characters. Like Don/Pete/Megan who really didn't do anything racist and actually seemed to step out of their zones to relate to and respect black people. Or Joan who had that racist exchange with Paul's girlfriend but seemed to have evolved on the issue when she was fine putting Dawn at the front of the office as a receptionist and then, promoting her office manager. Peggy was hard to parse where I think she was open-minded and tolerant in theory but Peggy is always going to look for an excuse to aggrandize herself and some of that is going along with societally-influenced ideas that black people's struggles don't mean as much as her struggles as a white woman. However still, Betty and Roger stood out as the most purely racist. The fact that Betty interacts with black people as just her servants doesn't excuse her. ",1462061572

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Hey all! I did some searching and couldn't find anything too similar to my situation:

**TL;DR - I have a CS minor, am entry-level, and I want to become a Software Engineer.**

About me: 1 year out of college. Graduated with a B.S. in Economics and Minor in CS from a top tier school - top tier in general and top tier for CS. 

Currently working at a ""Big 4"" company, but not as a Software Engineer.

I did a not-very-legit software engineering internship during my freshman year summer. All my other internships are not CS-related. I also don't have too many side projects - read: my resume is barebones when it comes to CS experience.

What's the best way to transition into a Software Engineering role? I'm currently sharpening up my algo knowledge, but am afraid my resume isn't strong enough to get my foot in the door (for other companies or my current one).

Also, how would you all split your time in my situation, between interview prep &amp; working on projects to make my resume more appealing?

I don't know how much they'd get for the crushed car, but he would probably have had to share it with the business.  Whereas selling the car he could get all the money for it.

When that rock is lifted, the earth is lighter; the hand that bears it heavier. When it is thrown, the circuits of the stars respond, and where it strikes or falls, the universe is changed. On every act the balance of the whole depends. The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth an light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale's sounding to the fall of a dry leaf an the gnat's flight, all they do is done within the balance of the whole.

But we, insofar as we have power over the world and over one another, we must learn to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature. We must learn to keep the balance. Having intelligence, we must not act in ignorance. Having choice, we must not act without responsibility.”

Also, the scenes behind the stage and after... not emotional enough for ponies on verge of crying.

Also, Twilight keeps going really stupid when she tries to please Celestia..... and I find it believable, there are people who really do that to their parents. But lying about Cranky and the others seems a bit too much. I guess I'm glad she still has some personality flaws after becoming a princess.

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","I think the Shout &gt; Wall ideology is a bit of a logical fallacy. Yes, you take less damage oberall, but the problem with choosing Shout over Wall is that you take more damage at once. Attacks that a character might survive under Wall can kill them under Shout. Obviously, being able to use both is best, but I think being able to survive the per-hit damage is more important when you have to choose between the two.

Anyway, as for dead horses, my personal dead horse is the idea that anything non-optimized isn't worth using.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two hours a day sounds like what my friends, high schoolers in stuff such as all county, youth orchestras, hochstein, etc do.

Now here is where we diverge- my source is experience and music theory books. You come from the internet. I have absolutely no idea how your experience has informed you on music, so I don't know if you actually know any classical musicians. I'm also assuming your pedantic and worry waaay too much about being right.

It also sounds like you are thinking of proficient musicianship. I am talking about absolute masters. Master classical musicians devote their life to music. They bleed, cry, and love for their music. What I've read for a classical musician is: wake up, breakfast. 2 hour practice session. By noon or so eat lunch. Do stuff. 3 hour practice session. And no, rehearsals, auditions, and performances don't count, at least not in the teachings of my teachers.

So there's 5 hours. Why do high level classical musicians need so much time? Because they don't make mistakes. An instrument is part of their body on this schedule. An orchestral musician goes to a rehearsal, which there is often only one before a performance, and is expected to completely and successfully sight read a piece. That does not mean 'play right note on right time', it means 'play right note on right time while taking care to follow signals by conductor and also play with feeling, intonation, and importantly, listen to what the piece says- 'gusto, sadly, forte, crescendo-decrescendo''.

Ya. I would expect a classical musician to spend 5 hours on music. It's their career. I would expect a master to spend probably even more. I would also expect a programmer to spend at least five hours at their job.",1462061587

"formula1","t5_2qimj","&gt; He was on his 2nd season and was close enough to Ricciardo to outscore him. Ricciardo and Kvyat were the closest teammate fight on the grid last year.

In terms of pace so far this year they have had one of the largest gaps between two team mates. ",1462061589
