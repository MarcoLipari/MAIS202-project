It does require you to open another port, but that‚Äôs only so it can do its job in development. Also, you can configure the webpack server to proxy requests to your actual backend on whatever port it serves from.

In production, you‚Äôll compile your React code ahead of time and serve it from a static directory or from a CDN. No need to worry about additional ports for the React stuff.

Don't really get why they replaced monkey with a newt, though.

Main two to three champs for your main role and 1-2 for your off role. If you get auto filled dodge until you feel like you have enough experience to adequately manage an off role lane. When it comes to champs you want to main find high elo streamers that one trick and learn from them they are usually very informative. I will say jng is probably one of the hardest roles to main however because you have to be so flexible in your picks you cannot have just one or two, but mid you should have no trouble with that.

(Here's what I sent them below)

I'm wondering if I link my sentinel to my bridge at home, then take it away from the bridge if it still functions. In your support article you mention for an example, placing the sentinel in a train station, to do this I obviously can't just hook up a bridge in the train station without violating a law or two, so does this mean my sentinel if left alone (after being paired) will still collect geo mines for me even though it's not near my phone or bridge? How does the data get passed along stating I own part of that mine if my bridge and phone are not near?

My assumption is that the Sentinel has a procedure where through bluetooth it identifies itself and uses the miner's data to relay that part of the geomine is owned by the sentinel owner. But I'm not really sure. Could you give me a more detailed breakdown?",1567296002

Using latest AMD drivers too, it worked very well, smooth and even got same or better FPS with more perceived smoothness at max settings CS:Go.

"ELINT","t5_2vmfq","&gt;The Bible is calling out rape and male prostitution, not a loving relatiomship between two men.

Actually no, it is quite clearly not.

&gt;The term Paul used that is translated 'homosexual(s)' came directly from the two Greek words in the Greek translation of the Levitical passage (i.e. the Septuagint, which Paul quoted regularly) condemning homosexuality. Paul ""coined"" the compound word, but it did not come from a vacuum. The Septuagint's translation of the Levitical passage says, in effect, ""Don't 'bed' [koite] a 'man' [arseno] like you would a woman."" Hence, arsenokoites.

&gt;Neither did Paul contextualize the act confining it to prostitution or child abuse or pagan idolatry. If he did, and if the author of Leviticus did as well, then a consistent hermeneutic requires that the neighboring sins these texts condemn would only be prohibited in the same context, but would be acceptable otherwise. So incest, murder of a child, adultery, and bestiality are permissible as long as they are practiced outside of the context of prostitution or pagan idolatry. This is obviously an untenable position.

&gt;See Romans 1:26-27 where the condemnation of homosexuality does not depend on the translation of a word coined by Paul in his other writings. In the Romans passage, Paul lists men and women abandoning the natural sexual act (heterosexuality) for what is unnatural (homosexuality) as an example of man's abominations resulting from abandoning the truth of God in exchange for a lie, as Paul describes it.

&gt;Some have suggested over the years that Paul was referring in Romans to people abandoning their sexual orientation, and that the word ""natural"" refers to what is natural for those individuals and not natural in the context of the created order. But this notion is defective, since the plain structure of the Greek words Paul chose forces the translation of ""the"" natural function rather than ""their"" natural function. In other words, there is no possessive usage (i.e. ""ho autos physikos"") which would translate ""their natural..."" but instead a direct non-possessive syntax (""ho physikos"") is used.

&gt;Furthermore, the idea that in the Romans passage Paul was describing ""sexual orientation"" and therefore what is natural to the individual as opposed to the created order, is defeated by the claim coming from the same sources that sexual orientation as we ""know"" it today is a concept Paul was unfamiliar with.

&gt;Paul clearly condemned homosexual practice singularly regardless of the context in which it may be practiced. Paul may not have been aware of the concept of loving committed same-sex relationships, but that is only relevant if you reject the claim that he was writing God's Word under God's wisdom, inspiration, and guidance. If the Christian claim that Paul was writing what God intended is true, we must consider whether God in his omniscience was aware of the modern concept we are discussing. If one regards the Biblical text as the eternal Word of God as most Christians do, it is reasonable to give credence to the idea that the text would address future possibilities and clear up what would certainly be a potent question for our day.",1567296004

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I mean, would you want half of a stranger's burger? I get what you're saying, but it really makes homeless people feel less than human when offered food no ""normal"" person would consume. 

I understand the mentality of ""if I give them money, they'll just spend it on booze or drugs"", though I don't fully agree. And honestly, being homeless is shitty, I don't mind being the one that allows them to forget that for a few hours. That's a totally different subject, and I do fully understand the other side. 

But don't offer half eaten food. Seriously. That's more insulting than saying no. If you have an extra burger that hasn't been touched, that's fine to offer. But don't offer something you yourself wouldn't accept from a stranger. The homeless are people too.

Edit: The homeless are a huge target for hate. I mean, who wants them hanging around? Food that has obviously been opened and consumed, is not only dehumanizing, but presents a real risk of being tampered with. 

I've seen insulin needles, spit, semen, dirt, urine, shit, and any other horrible thing being put in obviously opened or half eaten food being offered to the homeless. People are awful, and no one knows that better than the homeless population. They're right to be wary, even minus the feeling of getting scraps meant for the dogs.",1567296005

In addition to the other suggestions, you might try simple mindfulness meditation.

Ok, now for a rant. 

You mentioned you‚Äôre a software developer and your having to work in noisy environments. So I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre working in an ‚Äúopen office‚Äù Agile‚Ñ¢Ô∏è workspace that is supposed to ‚Äúincrease productivity‚Äù and ‚Äúreduce development rework‚Äù. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm so sorry. The research shows that‚Äôs this is all bullshit, but companies continue to build these ASD-hostile environments because it reduces their rent cost by cutting space per employee. But telling developers they‚Äôre being packed into veal pens to save money so management can reach their bonus targets doesn‚Äôt go over well. So the snake oil continues to flow and we continue to suffer. And BTW, did you ever notice that the people making the decision to implement these human-hostile work environments still keep their private offices?

If you can find a place that‚Äôs taken this cost cutting strategy to its logical conclusion and allows devs to work from home, that might be a good place to work. Even if the pay is lower.",1567296005

I‚Äôve been a supporter of UBI since I got into politics and for me it‚Äôs THE policy that would do so much for everyone regardless of circumstance. It can singlehandedly end poverty and the existential dread that comes with it, it will drastically strengthen minorities and workers, it separates human worth from salary earning occupations, it will significantly cushion any effects of future recession, it will give the average person true economic freedom, and it will let people take needed and necessary risks like starting families and businesses. 

There isn‚Äôt another policy that does so much while at the same time being so simple in operation. 

For me personally it would mean me and my wife could without financial fear start a family like we‚Äôve always dreamed of; we could take time off to go back to college since we both got shafted by local universities; buy our own home; cut back on our work hours since we‚Äôve both had to work overtime just to meet the basics",1567296006

"Vaping","t5_2rg4n","Both are Vaporesso mods, the one on the left is the Vaporesso Gen.
It takes two external 18650 batteries and if you are looking to go from pods to a box mod, this will serve you very well. The default mode on it is basically set for a ""plug and play"" kind of setup, where you really dont have to fiddle with any settings to get a solid vape. It includes all the other traditional features that you will no doubt get curious about and will want to try out as well.

That being said, I reckon there are going to be many more experienced people on here with other, possibly better suggestions when it comes to a first box mod when first switching from pods, but as far as build quality and overall user satisfaction is concerned, I personally stand by vaporesso products, and this one in particular is one of their best to date in my opinion.

If you are completely new to vaping with box mods I would suggest you just look into how your juice, particularly nicotine strength will change; as well as proper battery safety, as these will be your two biggest variables.

As a P.S. for your purposes, you may want to look into the Vaporesso Podstick as well, maybe watch a review, just to see if that kind of thing is not more in line with your current needs.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Um it wouldn't work if you used it on police... I think you may not be understanding fully the strategy being discussed here?

The point is to tag people that they don't want to arrest so that they won't arrest people. Police are already going to obviously be assumed to have gotten blue dye on them at the protest where dye was being launched... that doesn't change anything.

It ONLY works if applied to innocents who the police will think twice about and thus abandon persecution of.

In the process saving lots more innocent people, hopefully. In the meantime, any wrongdoing would still be on the police's hands for each and every person they do anything to without actual evidence and due process. Blue dye is not harm other than ruining a shirt. DECIDING as a CHOICE to round people up with non-evidentiary blue dye is harm. The police are and would be doing all of the harm there either way.

Blue dye in this context is textbook nonviolent resistance

--------

Your argument is the equivalent of saying ""Back when black people got lynched regularly in the American south, having your parents move in with you from another state, as a black person, should be considered a violent act tantamount to attempted murder or extreme negligence toward your parents by exposing them to possible lynching""",1567296008

I, too, have seen fairies. 

I lived in Georgia (still live super close by but now in Florida) and we had a lot of woods surrounding the house. 

The first time I saw one was while swinging over at the property my father owned across from our house. I was on the phone with a friend one night and I saw this ENORMOUS orange colored ball of light fly through the trees at the edge of the woods and disappear. I don‚Äôt remember it as well as I would like but I know it was huge. I remember staring speechless at the woods while my friend kept talking but I wasn‚Äôt listening because I was so stunned by what I‚Äôd seen.  I‚Äôm sure I told her about it but I don‚Äôt think she thought much of it. 

The second time was even more amazing and you‚Äôll understand why I‚Äôm sure. This sighting happened in the woods at my house. I was walking up our driveway and saw a tinier orange orb of light floating above the ground near the edge of the woods. It was like the first light, just a lot smaller. Miniature. I was tempted to try and grab it (I read in a storybook once that if you catch a fairy it will grant a wish) but scared because I‚Äôd also read that if you touch a fairy it will curse you.

This is the part that makes this experience so much more amazing- a black cat that we had at the time  ALSO saw the fairy. It was watching it and reached up to swat at it. Right before it‚Äôs paw could make contact the orb disappeared. It instantly VANISHED. Gone without a trace. 

It‚Äôs so wild that I almost can‚Äôt believe it happened but it did. 

I‚Äôve also seen a will ‚Äòo the wisp. I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it even was until a friend suggested it and I looked it up and it totally fit the description of what I‚Äôd seen. We had a swampy area at the edge of our property so it made a lot of sense, that‚Äôs that also the direction it headed in.

I haven‚Äôt seen a fairy like the one you have, but I don‚Äôt doubt for a second that the orbs I saw were fairies. I think maybe the big orb was a group of them or a Queen. But I have no idea. What I saw definitely weren‚Äôt fire flies, because I‚Äôm sure someone might think such a thing. What I saw was totally different and a light that was almost blinding and intensely colored.",1567296008

Withstanding stupid amounts of things, a glutton for punishment like an ashbitten for instance, due to their tendency to both get hurt and shrug off said injury. Civilized barbarians is a nickname for their race, amongst others. Outside their race, your generally left guessing. To them, it‚Äôs relatively obvious the goal generally, not necessarily the means, unless the two ashbitten know each other a bit better. One notable example while he was still alive(relatively recent history), gained the nickname as the Drone‚Äôs Blade. A bounty hunter, with a ship with tech stolen from a brief war, giving it lasers meant for closer to a (forgetting ship classes, uh, what‚Äôs smaller than a capital ship, but larger than a personal fighter craft? Like mid teir size) akwardly mounted to the bottom of his craft, and a stolen reactor to power it. The reason for the drone part of his nickname, is unlike most ashbitten who will fight with a bone knife or shorter range when out of their ship, he has drones. (If you‚Äôve watched guardians of the galaxy, remember that arrow?). Well, these ones shoot lasers normally, however he has some built for repair or disassembly of whatever he attacks. And they are effective. Couple with an actual sidearm instead of a knife, and an effective killer. 

Later on, however it seemed he got a little...erratic. He would go and help here, on a planet he‚Äôs never set foot on, halfway across the galaxy, while a similar mess is far closer. The bounties? He‚Äôd occasionally leave before being paid. Not all that abnormal for an ashbitten getting enough scrap out of the wreckage, except he left that too. Rare at most for ashbitten. Other times, he‚Äôd demand far more money. Pirates? Sometimes he‚Äôd go out of his way, seemingly with an old grudge, no matter how far out of his way it was, not that he was lacking reasons. To outsiders, they aren‚Äôt known to always seem to have the clearest train of thought, but he was worse than normal. I mean, he generally seemed to be doing good, but it was random how he seemed to. Now he never had clear logic truthfully, but, it generally had seemingly some reason. This planet was closer/worse off/I‚Äôve been there before, so I‚Äôll help them. Or some vague train of thought.

"ableton","t5_2re1a","I found one workaround right after posting, but it's not ideal (and not really the type of solution I was looking for), but:

Switch to session view and type in a new tempo (different than the tempo at the current timeline position). This will cause the ""Re-enable Automation"" button to light up and the tempo automation to be disabled. Then adjust back to the original tempo, work in session view, and press ""Re-enable Automation"" when finished to restore the global tempo track.

I was hoping for something more along the lines of a preference/setting, single press of a transport mode/button, etc, so I hope there's something that's more of a single step. Switching the tempo when going back to Session view each time, switching it back to work, and then returning it is a little slow/cumbersome.

I spoke to a manager and know his name, at the customer service desk where i'm sure there's cameras (and I'm sure there is footage of my fall as well). My roommate went back to take pictures of the area when I was talking to the manager but they already had wet floor signs up.

But if Sony hires the same creative team (they have Holland &amp; the writers, so hopefully they'll get Watts again too) and leaves them alone that would help. 

But I fear that Sony will try to bog Tom's third movie down with a dozen tie ins to their SMU verse and future Sinister Six plans.

&gt;In the Gospels while in this universe for sure. However a physical body would not be taken to the level of Heaven where Jesus would be.

I suppose we don't really know, but that seems like an unnecessary box to put God in to say that His deified body is not able to do as such. 

Another reason why I think it is unlikely is that we are being who will both be physically resurrected and live on the new earth, while also partaking in the divine nature. If we can do it, I'm sure that Christ can do it as well right now.",1567296016

&gt; It wasn't clear if all the passengers were protesters. Police said they entered the station to arrest offenders after protesters assaulted others and damaged property inside. The TVB video was widely shared on social media as another example of police brutality during the protests. Angry crowds gathered outside Prince Edward and nearby Mongkok station, where police said they made arrests after protesters vandalized the customer service center and damaged ticket machines.

1. Getting beaten with clubs and pepper sprayed is not the penalty for vandalism. 

2. If these people did something illegal, why not arrest them?  The police left when the subway doors were closing.

"Cricket","t5_2qhe0","&gt;Fuck me are you joking Wade averaged 60 in the shield, hit 1000 runs, hit a century in the first match, and has a better average this series than all the openers and Khawaja. He's genuinely earned reselection and doesn't deserve to be dropped after 3 tests.

Averaging 60 isn't unusual, plenty have managed it for a season. He's looked shit, even for his ton, and lowered his abysmal average. Unless he can open, comparing him to the openers is silly. Given an opener is likely making way for Smith, the argument is pointless.

&gt;Mitch Marsh hits a 70 against nobodies and suddenly he's in contention even though he's done nothing in the shield and always fails in tests bar 1 series on roads.

TIL that 96 against SA was actually against England...

&gt; What was his last recall in the MCG against India where he got out trying to whack a spinner cause it looked like he had no confidence in his defense? And then got dropped after 1 test

They picked him as they wanted a forth seamer. He did better than Wade's managed for the most part here...",1567296019

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt;or metaphors about ""It's like if you paid the bill but they turned off your heat in winter"" to explain your fury, perhaps the situation is not as dire as you say.

I can't tell if this is calling me out or not because it sounds vaguely similar to something I wrote yesterday. Which, to be fair (although I said Matt was *unintentionally* implying the community was trying to tear Anet down) was an uncharitable interpretation,  I think kind of misses the essence of what I was getting at. It wasn't so much ""we paid you, and now you're not giving us what we want so I'm going to throw a tantrum"", but more ""we can tell you're doing you're best, and we love you for it, but this isn't going to fix our long-term problems."" 

Maybe I'm reading too much into the tweet but I tried to be fairly surgical in my language to make it clear that, at least for me personally, yesterday's announcement was the result of my deep love for the game and its future, and not a sense of entitlement. I've legitimately seen my closest friends quit the game and I've had to stop raiding because of it. This announcement isn't bringing them back; they specifically told me so. This is just as much about the community and the hope for a secure future for the game than anything else. Any kind of hate or vitriol obviously has no place in the discussion, but I think it's okay to express fear or doubt when people you care about are quitting the game. And, yeah, it's just a game in the end, and it's nothing compared to real peoples' lives and careers which were suddenly disrupted - but these are real friendships and communities that hinge directly on Anet's ability to prove a future for the game. I've met three of my best friend through the game. Any disappointment or criticism I level isn't as banal as ""I want especs"", but is more deeply understood as ""I want the game to bring my friends back."" That's hard to convey through reddit posts, but I hope isn't entirely lost or misunderstood.",1567296019

Maybe it's because Jewish culture consists of didactics and dialectical discussion, combined with a sense of humour, and a strong emphasis of education and inquire? After all, such traditions are bound to arise from thousands of years of persecution, deportation, pogroms, ghettoization and genocide. Still, I'd much rather have the Jews' scepticism than any Christian or Islamic dogma.

He failed to show they retain those advantages. Trans women are not the same as cis men. 

&gt;Therefore, it's a disadvantage. Why you can't understand simple terms like this is the reason why you fail at basic biology.

I'm getting a PhD in microbiology. This doesn't make me an expert at this topic, but it *does* give me the intuition that if you see this topic as simply as you've laid out that you have a very basic grasp of biology that reads ""men=stronger"", without accepting that trans women can affect that greatly by taking hormones for a year or more. 

&gt;Woodford putting up a video talking about his own opinion does nothing to ""negatively affect a community.""

It spreads misinformation and has resulted in the harassment of a fair few people. In the same way that arguing that black people have lower IQs, spreading misinformation is harmful to trans folks.

"theydidthemath","t5_2x23b","You're assuming that the number of passengers scales linearly with the length of the plane. If you had a plane with the same number of aisles, but was as long as the plane in the picture, it would hold 5199084 people. An airplane that large would have multiple levels, so the capacity would be proportional to the length cubed. 

However, this isn't simply a matter of cubing the length and multiplying it by 396 passengers. That would assume a rectangular fuselage. Because the fuselage is round, the upper and lower levels would have fewer aisles than the middle levels. To make that correction, we'd multiply by the ratio of the area of a circle of radius R to a the of a square of length 2R. That ratio is Pi/4.

The capacity would be 396 passengers \* (13129)\^3 \* Pi/4  ‚âà 700 trillion passengers.

That may seem ridiculously high, but remember that the fuselage is as high as it is wide, and you can see on the map how wide it is. A Boeing 777 has a fuselage width of 6.2m (which I've also assumed is the height). The passengers would be stacked about 81 km high.

Doing a more mathematical check, we can calculate the volume of the passenger compartment and divide by the capacity to find out how much space passengers get to themselves. The length of a 777 is 63.73m, and scaling that up to the one in the picture gives us 837 km. Now just do volume of a cylinder for a rough approximation.

V = PI\*(40,500m)\^2\*837,000m = 4.3E15 m\^3.

Dividing by 700 trillion passengers gives 6.16m\^3 per person, which is a reasonable ballpark estimate. This estimate should be slightly high since I assumed the fuselage to be a cylinder instead of the more streamlined shape, and that the passengers occupied all of it. Neither of those errors reduce the volume per passenger to an unreasonable amount.",1567296024

"news","t5_2qh3l","From the way she says ""I'm a *nurse*"" when someone disagrees with her, I'm assuming she wanted the positive social status associated with the medical profession but knew she was too stupid to be a doctor. So in the 90s, when they lowered the entrance requirements for nursing school, she was finally accepted. (She had been rejected any other time she applied before that change.)

TL;DR - Doctors gets lots of respect, but that's too hard. ""I know, I'll be a nurse and then everyone will think I'm awesome without me having to actually *be* awesome!""

Disclaimer - Not all nurses are like this, I'm pretty sure my Mom is in the minority of RNs. 

Person to person - Even with my Mom's crappy attempt to poison my perspective, I'm really proud of you and anyone else who's struggling to get past an opiate addiction. So many of us recognize the work, effort, and pain you are going through that people like my Mom can only be described with two words: ridiculous and despicable. She's a very weak/sick person.

"TheVampireDiaries","t5_2sctw","Nah i belive by the time he returned to mystic falls his switch was already on. Off switch damon behaves different (albiet similar) but still different than regular damon. Like it was said before its a quick transition turning it on like it is turning is off. Damon wasnt old enough for his switch to be less defined. Ex. Stefan and damon are the same age and look at everytime stefan turns his switch off and back on.

Also if his switch truly was off he would have never returned to mystic falls for katherine when the comet came back around and also if you remember when damon first met elena (the time he compelled her to forget) his switch was most certainly not off or else why would he have been so kind to her ? So ""oh i know what you want in life"" and such or even compel her to forget it ? A vampire with the humanity turned off doesnt act like that. Not any that we have seen anyway. You call it an obsession i call it love . albiet unhealthy and toxic to his the girl of his dreams was alive and in a tomb and before then stefan and damon had no real idea of who katherine really was. They didnt really get to know the bitchpire till after she appears on screen and then they realize her true colors. Until then damon was in love and not a ""childhood"" abuse that you say because he was a grown ass man when he met katherine. 

Damon being an asshole doesnt mean his switch is off . it just means he's an asshole. And if what we see is true than its pretty obvious his humanity was on when he returned to mystic falls.


Imo i belive his humanity turned back on in 1994 when he killed zachs pregnant girlfriend i.e the worse day of his life his own personal hell. Killing her in that moment i belive he felt so bad it pushed that switch all the way back on. Imo anyway. Who know he could have forcibly turned it back on right in time to ""release katherine from the tomb"" out of fear that he would lose her if she saw him like that cus remember they didnt know she was really an evil bitch.

Edit : also please tell me where it was that he was offered a way out and jumped on it. Because from what i saw is he jumped through hoops to open that tomb he would have done absolutely anything to see katherin again. He only gave up on her when he realized she was alive and well and never came back for him and even then when katherine was reunited woth the brothers there was a moment of weakness he had where he asked her if it was real if she really loved him in which she responded no it was always stefan. Or whatever. Idk the exact scene but they were making out and he stopped to ask her and he said answer it right and its all back to fireworks and whatever lol. So yeah .",1567296028

"oculus","t5_2uni5","I just bought it and had a quick play-through, the graphics are nice albeit a little rough (clipping models, bad rain texture), melee combat is pretty good and encourages you to properly block and move your weapons. The general way you interact with the world is a little clunky though, I feel like the game could do a little more to prompt on interactions (maybe making the hands glow or something). The biggest problem I've had so far is that the sweet spot for quick slots is very small, I'll be trying to shoot an enemy with an arrow only to find that my hand is empty. When that's coupled with the limited arrow quivers (which can be mitigated using the ranger class) I ended up switching to the pistols instead. Magic in the game looks pretty cool although I found it way too slow, I couldn't figure out how to use the staff properly (it's meant to have 2 spells, only could use 1) but that could have just been my setup. The sounds used in the game need a lot of work too as a lot of the enemies I encountered seem to move silently despite the ominous background noises, it's an often overlooked part of VR games but good sound cues are essential to helping the player know what the enemies are doing (see the game In Death for how it's meant to be done).

First off, plagiarism is a particular thing. In art there's degrees of acceptable copying -- references and homages are thing, works of a particular genre are naturally going to have similar elements. Likewise, artists cover each other's works all the time. 

Doing a quick listen between Hero and Papercut, the start is similar but that sort of thing isn't uncommon (The Offspring use a Nirvana riff in Self-Esteem, but it's meant to be a little homage) and I'm unclear if Linkin Park is sampling that from another source (so Skillet might be going to that same sample if Linkin Park is sampling that intro from somewhere). The main hooks are different, the style is different, and the lyrics are different.

None of this is to say that you cannot plagiarize another artists works, it happens. But things that matter when making that claim are (a) fair use; (b) credits; (c) licensing. Without going into too much detail, the usage could be considered fair use. Likewise, if the original artists are credited and if an agreement was made to use the material, it would be tough to call it plagiarism. 

Artists do stuff like that all the time. It can be minor and I'll use one of my favourite bands, The Offspring, as an example. The Offspring's classic single Self-Esteem includes a short riff from a Nirvana song, uncredited, as a little reference to the band that was making it big at the same time. It's just a cheeky reference for amusement, a short riff, and it's not a major component of the song. The Offspring are also known for their parodies. For example, they did a parody of Feelings (a love song) and reworked it to be about hating someone. They reuse elements of the song to make it clear it's a parody. Reusing these elements is transformative -- it's part of the process of reinterpreting a song. It's still an original work. Their song Pretty Fly (for a White Guy) starts with a sample from Def Leppard's Rock of Ages -- the audio is taken straight from the original track (presumably with credits given in the liner notes) -- and was presumably chosen because they felt it fit the tone of the song -- include a silly German-sounding intro in their song making fun of people white for appropriating a culture they're wholly unfamiliar with. 

None of this is plagiarism because plagiarism in art is a matter of degrees. An homage to another band isn't trying to take credit for work they produced, it can even be transformative (a well-done homage can shed new light on a familiar piece). Reusing elements significant elements of another track isn't plagiarism if it succeeds in being an original work, rather than a mere retread. Even the blatant use of samples can be done because it might help strengthen the message you're trying to get across.",1567296029

This enabled defenders to limit and control enemy movement, creating killzones that armies would have to march through in order to advance. In some specific areas, the flooded areas would be purposefully shallow enough to allow an army (but not boats) to pass; which would slow them down. These areas would also be littered with traps that became impossible to detect when the area was flooded.",1567296031

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","Weighing in as the mono-amorous partner &amp; casual domme of my polyamorous sub wife: Not every monogamous partner is flexible, or open to, their partner having multiple relationships - romantic or otherwise. Everyone has different expectations for their relationships, and it's important that you don't expect your partner to change what makes him comfortable for you - though, nor should you change what makes you comfortable for him. 

 Being okay with my wife having multiple partners (she currently has 2 partners outside of our relationship, 1 of whom is also a potential second Dom) required the following for us:

\- A good long talk about **her** needs - not as a sub, but as a polyamorous person  
\- A good long talk about **my** needs as a monogamous person, and whether those could be compatible as part of a poly/mono relationship  
\- The setting of expectations: what she would need to be able to feel free to do in order to explore and maintain other relationships comfortably with my support and, by proxy, whether those needs were something I could offer her without being a detriment to myself or my own comfort  
\- A constant but casual touch-base to make sure everyone is on the same page at all times, and that the needs of a relationship have not changed

What those needs are vary greatly person to person, even within poly/poly relationships. Adding in a monogamous partner is no more or less complicated than adding an additional partner to an existing poly relationship, but does require the same: knowing what your partner needs to feel accepted and secure in your relationship. I would suggest seeking advice from or reading similar situations from other poly-specific sub-reddits like r/polyadvice or r/polyamory \- and then, sitting your SO down and asking him, very seriously and openly, if this is something he can see working with your relationship. You will also need to decide if his answer impacts your own wants and needs in either a positive or negative way, and how you need to proceed from there.

Good luck!",1567296031

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Here are my thoughts on these Metamagic ideas:

**Enlarged:** This could be useful for specific spells targetting only foes, or for spells which are a general effect like Major Image to create larger illusions than normally possible. It has its potential uses, but I couldn't see it being picked up until 10th/17th level in most cases unless parts are designed with the metamagic in mind.

**Re-Polarized: This one is a bit of a double-edged sword**, in that it could be the weakest Metamagic of them all, or the most powerful by a LONG shot. Let me explain:

Under most circumstances, being able to change the damage type isn't that great. Sorcerers usually will have multiple spells of different elements to be able to cover most elemental resistances without needing to worry about Sorcery Points. Sorcerers are one of the most versatile casters due to their Metamagics, and so being able to change the element can often be... underwhelming.

However, the moment you begin to look into Multiclassing, the true potential of this metamagic could shatter some sense of balance. More specifically, I will give Tempest Cleric as the prime example. At second level, you receive your Subclass Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath. By taking just two levels, you now can max the damage of any Thunder or Lightning Damage that a spell does once per short rest.

Are you seeing where the problem lies? By taking this metamagic, now any damage spell now can deal Thunder or Lightning Damage. At 7th level (to account for slower spell scaling from the multiclassing), you can now do a max-damage Fireball which deals thunder damage, for the cost of 1 Sorcery Point, each short rest. Much easier to blast numerous foes than a Lightning Bolt.

At 13th Level, you can either look to a 100 Damage Disintegrate if you want to ruin the day of a single target, or substitute it with Chain Lightning for 80 damage against 4 targets if you accidentally used your last sorcery point for the day.

Skipping to the sheer maximum possible, when you gain your 9th level spells at level 19, you can now look to a cozy 240 Damage in a single attack against numerous targets in an area, theoretically allowing you to wipe out a large portion of an army with little effort. 

If we put this into further perspective and crank the potential close to its max, if you manage to slap in Vulnerability to Thunder or Lightning Damage, and wear out the Legendary Resistances that a Tarrasque has (along with a little bit of luck for it to fail the save at advantage, not too hard since Tarrasques have +0 to dex saves), it would be possible to deal around 2/3rds of a Tarrasque's maximum health in a single blow. For the cost of a single Sorcery Point and Channel Divinity. Without that Vulnerability, you would still look at 1/3rd of the maximum health of the most powerful single creature in DND. You would look at one-shotting quite a large portion of monsters in DND with this, and with a large area and a group of foes, it wouldn't be too hard to see a total damage reaching over 1000 spread among foes.

It is a Metamagic which at base is a simple one which helps cover the versatility of a Sorcerer a little more so that they can handle almost any foe. But it can be abused significantly with specific builds to just nova harder than any build that I can think of to just end encounters before they can properly ramp up.

**Effortless:** Hit-n-Miss. Concentration is a powerful restriction, and being able to subvert it by concentrating on two spells at once can be extremely powerful, but the restrictions in place both keep it closer in balance, yet also restricting the usefulness.

It is a metamagic which you'd either really want to use in order to just Buff the everliving hell out of the rest of the party, or to concentrate on a big blast: 3 Hastes at once, or maybe keeping your Twinned Haste or Fly while channelling a Delayed Blast Fireball. The continuous cost as well as restricting you to just Cantrips keeps it quite balanced since it is difficult to maintain the better combos for more than a few rounds, but sometimes it just isn't worth it.

**Shared:** More geared towards a support sorcerer than being a blaster. Often, the other casters of the party will prefer to keep the use of their slots for themselves, and keeping their reaction for spells such as Shield incase they are about to take a blow and don't want to lose their concentration. They won't really be able to afford the cost compared to you, as you can make lower-level slots yourself. I see this mostly being used to pass slots to a Wizard who is out of certain slots which you'd need for a specific spell. You can afford the cost of the metamagic more than they can, and the versatility of the Wizard may be needed more than the limited spell selection of your Sorcerer.",1567296031

If there was something I wouldn't know, I would rule it in favor of the players then I would take notes to remind me to read it at home.

I would agree that giving a buffer of one and a half letter grades of extra credit and then refusing to give an additional 0.8 percentage points to a student that shows up to office hours and literally tried on every assignment doesn't make sense, but I think that just means OP should re-evaluate their EC system and why they are giving the points. I don't think it necessarily makes them TA.

I think NTA; the student should be grateful for receiving a B+ when they are a C student, especially in a mid-level Calculus class. Scholarships can be a little more understanding of those courses, as they are considered more difficult than other 200 level courses.

But TBA, if anyone receives (or understands at) a C or lower level for a Calculus class, and that course is a pre-req for ones they will need later (DEQ, Mechanics, E&amp;M), they should straight-up take the course again. Not understanding that material early on is really going to make the courses down the road more difficult.",1567296033

The Khoikhoi launched an invasion on the Dutch port and the Dutch farmers defended the attack and pushed into Khokhoi territory.  The Khoikhoi believed the Dutch were trying to steal their land but the Dutch were only using unoccupied land.  Two more wars took place in which the Khoikhoi caused the outbreak and it resulted in military annexation of more land.  Settlements always allowed for the Khoikhoi to be treated well.

It was the [British](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/smsajms/article/viewFile/109902/99640) and not the Boers who were mistreating the locals and it was British policies towards Xhosa and Zulus that lead to the system of segregation in South Africa.

&gt;Are you saying that it's not gay if a woman does it to herself?

I was wrong and too high to not forgot that lesbians also penetrate themselves with dildos, my bad.

&gt; What if a guy wanted to penetrate himself with a dildo? 

then IMO he cannot be 100% straight, 99% sure but not 100%. Lemme be clear: in my eyes 100% Hetro is an extreme that very few men are, a 100% hetro male could never enjoy being penetrated, since hes being acted upon and not the reverse, again just my opinion if you can prove me wrong id really like to hear.  


&gt; Those studies used very small sample sizes (...) male homosexual behavior is a little more taboo than female homosexual behavior. 

You have a point but over the years i've read a bunch of surveys and articles about similar studies of femla sexuality and almost all come to the same conclusion, that females are more open to same sex experiences than males, which IMO is due the the fact that men and women evolved differently with different purposes and sexual tendencies AND of course their social environment. So if there was no taboo or social stigma and we somehow reshaped what it means to be a man, the amount of Hetro men giving handjobs and blowjobs would still be significantly smaller than Hetro females eating pussy. 

I guess will have to read some books about human sexuality, do you by chance have any recommendation(s)?",1567296035

Make the architecture more complicated than it needs to be, as it‚Äôs just an app for you to learn on.

A hole-in-the-wall scenario. This'd be particularly fun, you could have a button that sends a random wall with a hole in it and sends it at the T's, so you can press it as many times as you want to make it more or less frantic. Perhaps have it push toward a pit so that you can decide what to do with the T's that fail to get through. 

You could do falling bricks - like that part in HL2 E1 on the elevator where you have to dodge the falling debris, although I suppose this'd be more of a reverse-hole-in-the-wall sort of thing. 

How about a fitness gram pacer test, where they have to race back and forth between two points against an ever decreasing timer, and the slow people are eliminated? It'd encourage a bit of good movement, probably through an obstacle course.

"Animemes","t5_2w6fe","Yeah, Rimuru definitely comes out on top in the end. Let's just look at what he gets just by the end of S1

* A human form
* An ability that lets him steal the ability of anything he defeats (exceptions may apply) and bypass the bad sideeffects of giving a monster a name
* Another ability that's essentially a highly knowledgable AI that tells him anything he needs to know
* A massive village with a massive army following all his orders
* Positive relationship with the strongest being currently alive and a massive dragon that's among the strongest beings alive
* Some ties with a bunch of influential nations

Now lets see what he's likely gonna get by the end of S2

* &gt;!Demon Lord powers!&lt;
* &gt;!The evolution of his 2 most broken skills!&lt;
* &gt;!Inclusion in the highly elitist Demon Lord circle!&lt;
* &gt;!An immortal army!&lt;
* &gt;!A bunch of demon underlings (including some REALLY powerful demons)!&lt;
* &gt;!What is essentially an orbital bombardment spell capable of being launched from anywhere and barely consuming any magic!&lt;
* &gt;!Power over almost any nation in the world!&lt;
* &gt;!Several demon lords under him!&lt;

Now how about we look at what he gets by the end of the series?

* &gt;!Literal immortality!&lt;
* &gt;!Manas:Ciel (basically think of Great Sage, but on a much, much higher level, and also granted sentience)!&lt;
* &gt;!Control over spacetime!&lt;
* &gt;!True Dragon (one of 6) and Great Demon Lord (only one) powers!&lt;
* &gt;!The ability to take any skill from anyone and to give any skill to anyone!&lt;
* &gt;!The ability to straight up create skills!&lt;
* &gt;!Literally every skill in existence (because why not, am i right?)!&lt;
* &gt;!The ability to create anything!&lt;
* &gt;!Unlimited Magicules and Stardust Energy!&lt;
* &gt;!Turn Null (the ability to casually create and destroy universes) with basically unlimited amount of uses!&lt;
* &gt;!Predicting the future!&lt;
* &gt;!Resistance to pretty much anything!&lt;
* &gt;!A sword created from the power of THE LITERAL GOD THAT CREATED THIS UNIVERSE!&lt;
* &gt;!Power exceeding the god that created this universe!&lt;

Now what drawbacks does Rimuru have to this? Oh yeah, he can't have children ""the natural way"" (but he can essentially create them in a lab, make clones of himself or have sex no problem) because of reasons (not like he could anyway, because by the time S2 gets to like ep 3, Rimuru's gonna &gt;!be sterile!&lt;)

Meanwhile, Ainz is stuck being a skeleton with no way to get stronger, and if he were to ever want to be a human, he'd have to lose most of his power. Oh, and he can't bone his harem because no boner",1567296043

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Oh jeez I made so many mistakes on this thing. I've never really worked with wood or stain or anything since middle school, but I had a TON of fun!

So first, I started taking everything apart. Removed the lid, drawer (the bottom part with the handles is a drawer), stripped everything with paint stripper (we don't have Citristrip in Canada unfortunately.) 

Then starting sanding the pieces down with 80 grit, then 120 then 220. I only applied a very light sanding of 220 grit on the front, because it is veneer and as someone on here previously suggested, I didn't want to sand through it.

I applied pre-stain conditioner on the sides, drawer, lid and back (everything except the veneer front basically), then a few coats of Minwax Gel Stain in Walnut (It looked much darker than it is). 

When it wasn't going as dark as I wanted after 4 coats, (my boyfriend wanted it to be dark brown to match our other furniture) I used an espresso color stain and applied that as well with 2 coats. I did wait the 24 hours between coats as well, which is why this project took so long.

It wasn't really making much difference in color so I decided that must just be the way it wants to be, so I let it go. Let everything dry, then applied Minwax Antique Oil, buffed it out, waited 24 hours, applied the final coat, let it dry, brought it in ( I did this whole project on my condo balcony ) and put everything back together.

There were definitely a lot of hiccups, instances where I had to re-sand and start again, figure out which materials worked best ( I mostly used old tshirts from the thrift store, but it didn't always work perfectly ) 

Overall I'm super happy with the finished product, and even though it's not exactly the darker color I wanted, it looks a million times better than it did, and I get to give it a new home and I get a useful unique looking chest to store [my blankets, yoga mats and meditation cushions](https://i.imgur.com/2yIKVa7.jpg)

We all know this stuff. It doesn't mean that LGBTQ+ ""culture"" makes up more than 1% of world culture though, does it? Besides, no remnants of Graeco-Roman homosexuality remain today, as that concept died out following the collapse of the classical era. Also polari was, as you said yourself, used pretty much exclusively by homosexual men, and now isn't. That doesn't make it ""world culture"" now, or then, and even if you want to argue that it was/is, it's such a tiny proportion of the cultural history of the world that my original point still stands. Same goes for Sappho. She wrote poetry that focused on female homoeroticism, but it isn't known whether she herself engaged in these activities (many ancient Greek sources firmly attest that she didn't, modern critics don't know/can't apply modern ideas of homosexuality to ancient people/cultures), and once again, she is a miniscule part of history.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Student loans are treated differently because banks would not give out large unsecured loans to unemployed 18 year old's without some guarantee that they would be repaid. The entire mess was created by government creating a new form of loan in order to encourage more people to go to college. This caused the price of a college education to skyrocket while decreasing the economic benefit of getting a degree. This is also part of the reason for 'qualification creep' where a college degree is required for more jobs. If almost everyone has a college degree why not make it a requirement.   

Without government secured education loans colleges would be less expensive, people with degrees would be less common causing a college degree to be worth more and forcing companies to lower the requirement for jobs that to not actually require a degree.",1567296045

So they hide their true intent with jokes and memes and esoteric symbolism. The more confusing the better. If they can get someone to laugh at a Holocaust joke, they've planted the seed. They've co-opted the ""speak truth to power"" ideology of standup comedians because they know people will entertain a new, distasteful idea if it's presented as a joke.

From there, there exists an entire radicalization pipeline that railroads a tiny percentage of people from laughing at edgy jokes to live streaming themselves shooting up mosques.",1567296046
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My mom got scammed out of $5k.  It was a variation of the ""Pigeon Drop"" con.  

Two middle aged lady picked up a bag next to Mom's car, asking her, ""Is this yours?""  They opened it, and it was full of money.

""If we turn it in to the police, they'll confiscate it.  But we work for a lawyer.  He can hold it for us, and if no one claims it in 30 days, we will split it with you, and it will all be legal.

""But there's a deposit to hold it.  He'll return the $5000 deposit if no one claims it.""

Since she didn't have any money, they very generously offered to take her to the bank  so she could get a cash advance on her credit card (on *my* credit card.)  Since I pay all her expenses, she was thinking how proud I'd be that she'd secured this windfall, to help us out.

To her credit, after she got home, it only took her about half an hour sitting there before she started to actually think about what had just happened, and she called me right away.  ""Unkilbeeg, I think I just did a very bad thing.""

The bank said if it had been a fraudulent use of a credit card they could have done something about it, but since it was a cash advance, and she was the only person who had contact with the bank, there was no way to recover anything.  

Worse than that, they refused to disable the ability to use that card for cash advances.  I was able to reduce the maximum withdrawal, but I couldn't disable it completely.  Bank of Fucking America.",1567296046

I've never seen all conservatives = these lunatics. What I have seen is a notation of the strong similarities between the shooters intention thats left behind online or in a document and trumps or other far right figures rhetoric. Which is a fucking fair point.

&gt;.remember Dayton? I‚Äôm sure no one does because as soon as it was found out the shooter was a leftist it was swept under the rug.

I remember dayton, mostly because the media pounced on it as being a left wing shooter which sticks out like a sore thumb in the vast ocean of right wing shooters. The thing is as far as i know it wasnt proven to be politically motivated. The guy shot his sister, her friend, and a dozen black people, not exactly the typical target of a leftwing political terrorist trying to 'harm the other side'.

It‚Äôs the same thing. If you are solely responsible for paying for your healthcare, then you are solely responsible for paying the costs of that healthcare. You shouldn‚Äôt be complaining that drug prices are high - to a limit, that‚Äôs what it costs.

A lot of US drug prices are egregious, perhaps. There‚Äôs no economic reason insulin should cost you so much.

But I‚Äôm everything else, you are okay with a you broke it you bought it mentality. Why should I pay an extra 60 cents at the cash register just so some chick can get an abortion?

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","An acquaintance of mine had her wedding at a public lake marina. The officiant was called last minute the day of, showed up about 45 minutes after all the guests and promised money to drive to perform the ceremony. He pronounced the brides name wrong and no one corrected him. He said it about 5 times. They also gave him $30 and the groom complained that the officiant has to ask for the money (I guess bride &amp; groom were annoyed the officiant has the audacity not to feel entitled to perform the ceremony? Also complained about the name thing but neither corrected him so). They had put the food in one of the shelters and another party who was BBQing were on the other end. The shelter has about 8 picnic tables so imagine 60 some people from both parties mingling but never speaking to one another and us getting dirty looks a lot. My sister accidentally went and got a plate from the other side because she has no idea they weren‚Äôt part of the wedding. So you can guess how everyone was dressed. Except the bride, who picked her dress up from the thrift store. Bright ass red prom dress. She called us in a panic to come 2 hours before the ceremony because she said all her family has abandoned her and she needed help setting things up. When we got there, all 5 of her sisters and mother were in the public bathroom helping get her ready and there was zero conflict. Bride asked me if her dress looked like a prom dress and my best friend was behind her furiously shaking her head no. I answered yes (I can‚Äôt lie well) but added it looked good which it did for her. I think the entire budget of the ceremony went towards the grooms tux and her 3 sons tuxes as they were the only ones dressed super nice and matching. On the way from bride getting ready in the bathroom to walk across the marinas parking lot to the shelter, bride brought up some random thing about how fat women are probably looser vaginally than skinny women. It was out of nowhere and I remember wondering wtf? Cause she had 4 kids, was 35 and I thought she was aware of her own genders anatomy but I guess not. i believe it was a direct dig at me as she was a size zero and I am a size 10 and she wanted me to fall all over and lie about the dress....definitely believe she set it up that way and had the entire bizarre rude comment planned in advance.

After the ceremony, she cornered my 16 year old sister and asked if she would babysit her 4 kids so they could honeymoon, which consisted of them driving to her mothers and getting drunk. Sister agree so i volunteered to help my sister and the next day, instead of paying my sister the $60 she owed her, gave her a handful of pain pills and told her she could probably sell them to make money. But before they left that might at like 11, they had incredibly loud sex for all to hear and she sounded like she was screaming as loud as possible which was so embarrassing, 

They ‚Äúseparated‚Äù a few years ago but still live together because groom wants to leave and make a better life since our town is dead and jobs are hard to come by. But he never left and she brings home guys to do drugs with and often get their asses beat by the groom when they think he‚Äôs just a family friend baby sitting her kids. She neglects to tell them that he‚Äôs actually her husband.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","Looking for some help here. I have a 75g community that is heavily planted. Nitrates stay pretty low, plants grow like crazy, everyone happy.

I do water changes about once a month, something like 20%. I probably fall behind schedule from time to time, but definitely top off more often than that.

Recently I had someone come reinforce the stand because it appeared to be bowing. To do so, I drained ~2/3 - 4/5 of the water. The handyman was very late, so the tank stayed at this low volume for ~12 hours. Silly me did not circulate air at this time, and the filters were off due to the low water level. (The heater was too, but I don't think the temperature fluctuated since my house runs warm)

I filled everything up (with dechlorinator, of course) and have had lots of die-off today include my upside-down catfish, a dwarf gourami, 4 loaches, and some Endler's.

I assume the large water change was too much of a shock to the system, though it could also be a lack of air while the water was lowered.

My question is: What can I do to make sure no-one else dies. I have a 10g shrimp tank that I could put them into, but I can't imagine that would much help things. I tested water quality and got good marks across the board: ~7 pH/0 ammonia/0 nitrites/~10 nitrate. 

Any and all advice appreciated.",1567296050

I've been trying to find a B-movie I've seen in the 90's, featuring modern Army vs. fantasy creatures in the desert, that looked like Goblins. I was a child and there was a love scene in a hut in the middle of the movie, so that part stuck on me. Also I vaguely remember the VHS cover having a solder girl with her erect nipples poking under the shirt. 

This thread led me to that movie, Hell Comes to Frogtown (1998)!! 

The creatures were frogs, so that's probably why it's been so hard for me to find it thinking it was goblins or even aliens. I thank you so much for this! LOL",1567296050

On the other hand, [Democrats' policies would see us developing much more sustainable practices involving renewable energy that would eventually pay for itself.](https://www.gp.org/green_new_deal)

Trump's policies on immigration are indiscriminate - to use ironic word choice - [when it comes to those with exigent circumstances requiring medical attention they can't get in their own country.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-low-trump-immigration-policy-seeks-deport-sick-dying-children-n1047901) And if you're wondering why they don't just go through the legal process of immigration, [the process can take an unrealistically long time](http://immigrationimpact.com/2019/02/04/uscis-processing-times-slower-trump/) if you're in need of immediate treatment. [Sometimes it takes even longer.](https://twitter.com/e_cmch/status/1146884741771087877?lang=en)

Democrats just want there to be a bit more empathy, more humanity for those without help. This is done from two angles - immigration reform *and* medical reform.

Speaking of medical reform, Bernie Sanders' healthcare plan [benefits all citizens in the United States, including you and your family, at lower overall cost.](https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-healthcare/) Democrats are fighting so that *your* family doesn't lose all their money just because one of your family members happened to develop a debilitating disease through no fault of their own, that's costly to treat under the current system.

Yes, very much so. Especially the more rural you get.

This really depends from person to person. There are certainly people who see themselves as just Quebecois, and people who see themselves as both equally and then also just Canadian.

&gt;When Qubec people speak English is it in a French or Canadian accent?

Well that just depends on your level of English immersion. If you are super fluent there is a good chance you have a very minor accent, but most people i've met have French accents.

&gt;What is the relationship like between Quebec and the rest of Canada?

The correct thing to do would be to fix the age limit, much like the Romeo and Juliet laws that were passed in the late 2000's in response to everyone being shocked that a football star got arrested for getting a blowjob from his girlfriend who was a year younger than him. (Fun fact: Georgia specifically passed their law to be non-retroactive and refused to pardon the boy who started all of this.

So you'll find that most courts just auto drop the ticket when you bring it up because it's too much time and effort to enforce. [edit 2] let me clarify, radar/lidar are most inaccurate when in motion NOT THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS INACCURATE IN MOTION. There's a ton of things that can affect the readings and once you can establish that any of those things existed during the instance, they have to show that their equipment overcame those issues... which is time and effort that they typically won't spend on you. [/edit2]

Edit: So many butt hurt people... even people with degrees with published research! And yet I'm so wrong nobody has been able to prove otherwise. Not one shred of evidence. Well let me dispel your ""your wrong"" arguments.

While moving there's virtually 0 way to record any of the possible method to introduce inaccuracy into these speed detectors. Batching, scanning, panning, shadowing, etc... errors. Forget angle of incidence and other possible errors which can easily be affected from the normal movement of a vehicle.

If it still dont perform well, you might need external battery or new internal battery after a while.

Also if you are running a custom firmware for better torque etc.. you might want to re-flash it back to stock settings and see if that helps.. If the fw is spoofed higher than v 1.5.1  then you need to reflash custom firmware without version spoofing, before you can use Ninebot app to update.",1567296056

Barely any mosquitos, warm-ish nights, and all the fresh water you could wish for.  I overpacked on food (help me r/ultralight! You‚Äôre my only hope!) but felt good about my other gear, especially given the 3lbs of bear canister that is required.

I can understand the frustrations felt by most people when they voice dissenting views on how our government handles certain things, and that's their constitutionally guaranteed right to do so.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Best advice I can think of kind of echoes what other commenters have said - read up on actual organisations or individuals. It might also be worth looking into similar regimes that have existed and how they operate / operated, and considering how their methods, ways of enforcing the law, monitoring citizens or whatever could affect the daily lives of the ordinary folk, and how this could lead to resentment or frustration. 

One thing I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs really worked for me in my political-ish fantasy novel I‚Äôm writing at the moment and my sci fi one that‚Äôs sitting waiting to be edited was to focus on individual characters, their histories and how they would get caught up in the resistance or protests. What personally happened to them to make them come out of their normal routine and want to fight? 

In terms of actual cases etc to look at, my specialty is Central and Eastern Europe, so I‚Äôd say look at likes of Czechoslovakia under the Communist regime and the run-up to the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Is really recommend V√°clav Havel‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower to the Powerless‚Äù, which is available in English translation, for some views on how people react to oppressive regimes.",1567296057

Passing is to move past *slow moving* vehicles.

It's not to pass someone who's nearly the speed limit, only to slow down (after speeding up to pass them) to the legal speed limit and proceed to drive basically the same speed as them. 


If they're already going basically the same speed as you, just slow down an iota and keep driving behind them. That one minute you lose isn't worth it, or the likely pass game that might follow when the other car gets butthurt and decides ""no, I'm not slow. I'll prove it by passing you back!""

My family looks like this. My brother (M55) and I (F40) share the same Dad. His mother died when he was 5 and my mother came into his life when he was 10. I was born about 5 years later. My Mum is still alive. 

Our Dad passed away almost two years ago at 80. He still had all his marbles but is body was a mess. My brother took his death extremely hard and was in depressive grief for almost a year. I, on the other hand, seemed to not grieve at all after the funeral. I‚Äôm as confused as anybody as to why as I spent my whole life fearing his death. I don‚Äôt know why it hasn‚Äôt hit me so hard - possibilities include knowing for at least 3 years before hand that his time was coming and the fact that, although I loved him, we weren‚Äôt really as close as he and my brother were. I feel guilty but I don‚Äôt know what I can do about it. My brother was very angry at me for a long time for not grieving enough but he eventually got past it. 

Which brings me to now. Last year, when he was still really angry at me about it, my brother informed my mother and I that he would be hosting a Father‚Äôs Day lunch for his wife‚Äôs family but that we were not invited. His reasons were that we never enjoyed these lunches anyway (true), his father in law was unwell (true) and that it wasn‚Äôt really relevant to us anymore. I was furious because it felt like a slap in the face - and almost a punishment for not being upset enough. Yes, we don‚Äôt have a father any more but it doesn‚Äôt mean we couldn‚Äôt have celebrated him. 

I figured once he got over it, things would go back to normal.  Nope. This year - no mention of Father‚Äôs Day, no lunch invite. We‚Äôve always been a close blended family but I feel like this is also a message that we‚Äôre no longer his ‚Äúreal family‚Äù. I‚Äôm trying to not be angry about it but it feels like an asshole move to me but maybe I‚Äôm over-reacting?

I can‚Äôt tell who, if anyone, is the asshole here.

"KeanuBeingAwesome","t5_axiz7","**Irresistible force paradox**

The unstoppable force paradox, also called the irresistible force paradox, shield and spear paradox, is a classic paradox formulated as ""What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?"" The immovable object and the unstoppable force are both implicitly assumed to be indestructible, or else the question would have a trivial resolution. Furthermore, it is assumed that they are two entities.

The paradox arises because it rests on two incompatible premises: that there can exist simultaneously such things as unstoppable forces and immovable objects. The ""paradox"" is flawed because if there exists an unstoppable force, it follows logically that there cannot be any such thing as an immovable object and vice versa.

JiME does not compare well to Gloomhaven from the standpoint of a huge amount of content, but it is still a very enjoyable game.  The two games have some similarities and many differences, and JiME is quite a bit simpler and takes less time to play plus the campaign elements (carrying over information from one scenario to the next) are relatively light.  JiME has much less strategy but there is still quite a bit of strategy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Your assertion assumes free will is about controlling outcomes. Perhaps it isn't about the results, but about the choices themselves. Do people make the most moral/least selfish/most constructive/positive choices regardless of outcome? If there is a judgement, perhaps it is about what you choose in each situation regardless of the results rather than only making a certain choice when there is some sort of personal gain.

Personally, I think people believe free will is about a much larger freedom than it really is. My cat doesn't have free will. She is biologically programmed to operate based on her instincts and doesn't have a prefrontal cortex in which to debate choices. My free will comes from my ability to have an internal debate, but it isn't totally free. It is influenced by a multitude of factors and the decision I make can be seen as being more or less challenging based on my personal circumstances. 

If I give someone $10 for medical expenses when I am poor, that choice is different than a choice that is made by someone who is very wealthy. We judge the context of choices all the time and weigh the hardship caused by a moral choice for each individual, but we rarely consider that that the entire complexity of that choice may be what is ""judged"" by any entity that we feel oversees ""us.""

"keto","t5_2rske","Started well over a year ago at 210.  Hardcore keto got me down to 160 (which I think might have been a tad low).  Anyway, a year later and I've fallen off the wagon, getting back up to 190!!!!  This is my second week back on and I'm at 181.  I'm avoiding the laffy taffy and beer this time, and have picked up some weights to work out with my son which we'll start on Monday.

Lessons Learned:

1) Set an ""upper"" limit.  When you hit this weight, time to buckle down again (don't be like me and let it be 30+ lbs, it's a LOT harder to take off than it is to put on.  BE STRICT ON THIS!!!!

2) Think about WHY you want to lose weight.  In my case I want to fit in the new clothes I bought myself as a treat when I hit my lowest, and more importantly, I want to be there for my kids.  Beyond this, looking around the office, most successful folks are in shape, so there is a bonus there as well as a clear mind and more energy.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are like me and fell off the wagon, it's never too late to get back on!

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck!",1567296062

"Tierzoo","t5_3ns27","Fish were likely the primary food source of Spinosaurus, but that really wasn't an issue as they could rely on a pretty constant source of large, freshwater fish in their habitat. Grizzlies don't rely on fish year-round in large part because they *can't.* During salmon runs though, it's a very reliable source of food.

Animals that hunt fish without being capable swimmers or divers isn't unheard of. Osprey for example rarely submerge themselves entirely, as they aren't strong swimmers. Spinosaurus' likely method of hunting fish whilst wading in shallow water or walking along the shores seems to have been very effective. To be frank, they would not have reached the sizes they did if it was a poorly-optimized strategy. Large predatory builds have to be effective in order to remain viable for tens of millions of years. Otherwise, they tend to disappear very quickly.",1567296063

Yes, but there's a bit more to it than that. There are at least 2.2 billion Christians and 1.6 billion Muslims (adds up to 3.8 billion, half the world pop.) but no one calls Judaism a cult, although there are only 15 million Jews (many of whom are entirely atheist). Same goes for Jains and Zoroastrians, both considerably smaller than Judaism.

Cults take the BITE model (controlling Behavior, Information, Thought and Emotions) to a distinctly higher level than the major religions. Perhaps because the size of the larger religions lends them a credence that other religions have to ""encourage"" by other means.",1567296063

I think of this as a professional business relationship. I am their customer they are my service representative. Try and treat them with the same respect that you demand. It's fairly simple. 

It's also not the fault of the Devs much at all. Their job is just like your job. You are told what to do and you do it even when you disagree. If you dont you are fired and they replace you with someone who will do what they want. They have executives, managers, supervisors just like the rest of us. 

They have good days and bad days and they feel good and feel bad just like us. 

Treat them as you want to be treated. If you want to speak out about the stuff that's going on decisions made etc. That's NCsoft and Anet. Devs are doing what is assigned to them.

Unfortunately, at this point, I am guessing, there is a good chance she's gonna get fired for her tweets.

Since nothing that happens here is in any way comparable to eternal damnation in hell or eternal bliss in the lords embrace in heaven all that matters is how we behave and believe in god.  This life is your one tiny chance to prove that you're worthy to go to heaven.   The suffering of a child with cancer or the holocaust are little compared with hell. God doesn't interfere because all of it doesn't matter compared to the offer he makes us.

So the child -given that it has lived a good life so far- could be happy to be on the fast-lane to heaven. Just keep the faith until the end.

The most accurate skill spread within 2 teams will be duped by people only yoloing to complete mission objectives, bad players having the match of their life by sheer luck, super unicums leaving their console unobserved and in reach of their 6 year old sisters, and average players that simply don't care about any form of statistics and woke up that day with the firm intent to troll. 

Those are very real variables that no algorithm can process. The outcome of a perfectly balanced match is perfectly random. In that light, why bother with the perfect algorithm? I mean, RNG is built into the game mechanics, a division of super players might be screwed by the cosmic forces of random spread.

In a way, this is reminiscent of the greater debate on this sub that has played out many times. I've never understood the position that when the media reports on the government's shady as hell behavior, that's the media's fault. Sorry, it is not realistic to expect media covering public corruption to be totally fair to the government's side, to not edit for length, or not use music in their productions.

So yeah, when the government acts in a suspicious manner, the media will pounce on it. When the government gives out private information to the public, that information will not stay private.

&gt;The ""Contagion Effect""  
&gt;  
&gt;Sherry Towers, a physicist at Arizona State University has studied the contagion effect of mass shootings.¬†   
&gt;  
&gt;Read more of her interview here :¬†[**https://asunews.asu.edu/20151005-contagion-effect-mass-shootings**](https://asunow.asu.edu/20151005-contagion-effect-mass-shootings)  
   
&gt;  
&gt;**Q:** What is the news media‚Äôs role in this? Do they push up the numbers?  
 **A:**¬†It appears that yes, national  media coverage does end up increasing the frequency of these tragedies.  However, the U.S. Constitution ensures freedom of the press ... we  cannot legislate restrictions on the press to avoid this. It has to be a  voluntary move. In fact, most press agencies will not report on  suicides for exactly this reason ... suicides have been shown to be  contagious. The sheriff in Oregon made the decision not to mention the  killer's name. Perhaps his choice will be the beginning of a larger  national conversation on how we can choose (or choose not) to cover  these events.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Im from a very rural podunk town in West Tennessee. No internet...no wifi...no cable. You use satellite for TV like Dish Network and the two internet choices are satellite internet which is AWFUL or a Mobile Hotspot Box like with Verizon.

Everyone out there that wants 100% reliable cell service and Mobile Data/4G has either Verizon or AT&amp;T. Those that have Cricket, Boost, T-Mobile, etc. never seem to have reliable service. Dropped calls, roaming, 3G only, etc. I live on the Atlantic Coast in SC now so I dont have those issues. But When my daughter moved back to TN to go to school I made sure to keep her on Verizon. I dont even want to think about her traveling home one night on the backroads and have a flat or something with a phone that wont work.

We overpay with Verizon...I know we do. Ill change that when my daughter is done with school. For now Im paying for peace of mind. üòÅ",1567296070

Removing the guns from circulation has been done before for example in Australia. Many countries demonstrate that gun control is effective and can be maintained to make mass shootings become non-existent as a direct result of the gun control. How many more lives will be lost before action is taken?

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","getting enough nutrition, water, and sleep are super important to muscle recovery and overall well-being.

regular stretching and foam-rolling also helps with muscle soreness and stiffness that comes post- exercise. 

depending on your body's history with exercise will also be a determining factor with how quickly you ""get used to it""

for me even i was super inactive for almost a year post ACL surgery when before that i was training at the gym 5 days a week and playing football (soccer) a few days a week as well. I started training again in the past couple months and i've not been super consistent yet BUT after a few sessions, despite the soreness and huge awareness of the drop in my strength and flexibility and endurance my body was like ""oh heyi remember this, it's not so bad"" and i'm able to push through the mental hurdle of soreness and tiredness. So part of it is just mental as well. You gotta pump yourself up and get excited for all the things you can do each day, including the privilege to go to classes and get an education and hit the gym or group exercise class and move the way you do. a little caffeine and a good snack helps too.

Can I just say your parents and brother are truly awful people and I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this at the hands of your brother only to be betrayed again by your selfish toxic parents. I fear you‚Äôre still in the fog with your brother, and you haven‚Äôt worked out how nasty he is.

You said yourself that your brother is into shady stuff that he doesn‚Äôt tell his wife. That‚Äôs a strong indicator that he is not reformed and his character has not improved. He is a liar and a manipulator. He‚Äôs offered no sensible explanation for what he did. His childhood was confusing? Really? That‚Äôs not an apology. You didn‚Äôt mention him expressing any real remorse. I‚Äôm not here to diagnose, but have you talked to your therapist about signs of narcissism and sociopathy and how to spot them?

He got away with what he did to you and your cousin, so for him there have been no consequences, and no opportunity to change. Do you really think he could ever be safe around other kids? He shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near your child, and he certainly won‚Äôt be safe around his own. Just today I read a story where a child was assaulted by someone while her parents were in the same house, after she nipped to get something from her bedroom for two minutes.

His wife has a right to know about his past. If I had married someone like this I would want to know. You don‚Äôt know what he could do in the future. Imagine how you would feel if the worst happened and you hadn‚Äôt spoken up.

I know this is really hard, but you have to be brave. Speak to your husband and get him on side. He married you and loves you for you, not what happened to you in the past. You might want to go to therapy together to work on resolving your feelings. You haven‚Äôt fully processed what happened to you yet, which is why you couldn‚Äôt tell him. This may be the impetus you need to get through it.

Once your husband is on side speak to your brother‚Äôs wife, preferably in person while your brother is away, so she has time to gather herself together.

Be prepared for a bad reaction. She might accuse you of lying because she can‚Äôt accept the truth, but once she calms down she will thank you for her lucky escape. If she doesn‚Äôt come around, it‚Äôs on her. But if they stay together and have children you need to inform child protective services.

You might need to take action to protect your family once he finds out. It might be worth giving the police a heads up in advance, in case he reacts badly.

But it must be done, you can‚Äôt let harm come to innocent children. No one should ever have to go through what you went through. Your journey is to be better than your parents, and make sure your brother isn‚Äôt allowed to harm anyone ever again.",1567296080

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","To get a menu item going in a restaurant chain you need to research the market to know that the product is a good idea in the first place. But suppose you know that already.

You need to know you can get the product to be sold in the first place which means contracting with suppliers; you can't just wave your hands and have breaded chicken in freezers across the country. Suppliers will also need time to fulfill your new demand, they don't instantly spawn chickens out of nothing and will need to set up processing lines to apply your desired breading, portioning, packaging, etc. Speaking of which did you get your boxes for the base product printed and distributed? How about the customer product packaging?

You also need the appropriate training materials produced so employees can make and wrap it properly. How is it cooked? How is it held at temperature before serving, for how long, and *where* in your kitchen? Are there unique sauces or anything else which needs special attention as well? All the food safety checklists and procedures need to be updated, passed by legal, and management trained on them.

What about marketing? Just slapping it on the menu won't do (oh, we need new menu placards printed, make a note there), so we need some sort of announcement. A TV spot at least, probably a different one per region, unless you are a global chain so you need multiple languages, etc. Print media needs some attention as well, maybe some coupons to be sent out, maybe radio? Of course we need decals, posters, stickers, etc. for the displays inside the stores, along with instructions of where, how, and for how long to display them.

So yeah, it might seem easy to fry a chicken piece to you, but it isn't simple and easy for a business. A year prep is pretty quick actually!",1567296080

"bristol","t5_2r52c","Well the article says:

&gt;The interior ministry rejected her request for permanent residency last year, saying she did not have enough evidence to document her status.

So there not saying someone who was here side they were 2 can't stay here. Just saying someone who can't prove they were here side they were 2 can't... Which is a small but significant difference. Interestingly the article makes no reference to what evidence she provided or what they felt she was missing, or mention the evidentiary requirements as being unreasonable. Could be she didn't send much in because she obviously lives her life here. Could be they wanted signed statements from 14 people who knew her when she was 2, or video evidence of her arriving into the country showing at least 78% of her facial features.

Hard to judge without that kinda info.

(Still pretty nuts that people who've come here and set up a life have to prove themselves to a system that seems to take great pride in showing no flexibility, sense or humanity just has a seemingly endless desire to remove 'non-British people regardless of any logic or obvious integrated situations.)",1567296081

I speak of personal experience. I have (sometimes) trouble with the 'switching on' of emotions....i have had people stunned by my lack of sensitivity....luckily i was, and still am, very much able to not care...at all...LOL...so it can come in handy, but if you become good at the neutralizing of feelings you may have to get ready to deal with the consequences of it.

"askatherapist","t5_3bhkf","Okay. Having read through the other comments, I‚Äôm going to take a stab here and hey if it‚Äôs not helpful, so be it.

You have to choose to love yourself. Every single day, every single meal. Ask yourself: will eating this now make me feel good in the long term? Just because it will make you feel better *right now*, does not mean that it is what you should do. And you know that. So instead, choose your future self and happiness. ‚ÄúI want this entire cheesecake, but I care about my health and how good I feel, and I know my future self will regret this choice. I love myself, and I love my future self, so I will only have a slice (or, if it feels doable and not too restrictive, none at all).‚Äù

I put on a lot of weight through university, then dropped it rapidly via a relapse into my restrictive eating disorder. It‚Äôs only been in the past year that I‚Äôve been able to get food (and a general healthy regime) under control for myself - and it‚Äôs entirely because I learned to love myself. 

You *can* love yourself and want to change things at the same time. You can approach your body, your mental health, etc., with non-judgement and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy with what we‚Äôve done so far, now let‚Äôs do even better.‚Äù

If approaching yourself with kindness and compassion seems too difficult, begin with showing that to others. Practice empathy. Compliment strangers when you like their outfits. Congratulate a friend or coworker on something they worked hard on. Listen to your friend‚Äôs favourite album that you know you probably won‚Äôt like, just because they‚Äôre your friend and it‚Äôs their favourite so it must mean something to them. Call a store‚Äôs manager to express how grateful you are for a particular employee‚Äôs excellent service.

"ufc","t5_2qsev","I guarantee there are women who can beat most men in many of those categories.  Everyone keeps looking at averages and doesn't seem to understand that this is literally a middle ground number on a WIDE spectrum.  There are going to be *some* women who are stronger than the *average* man, faster, better endurance, etc.  My argument is a lot of those women could arguably end up in very physical professions such as a UFC fighter.  If they have natural gifts that give them well above average strength, speed etc etc plus they have trained all their lives very likely right along side men probably grappling and sparring with them too... I don't see why they shouldn't be able to take money to fight a man if they want.

The real question becomes, how much more exceptional than the average man are the men in the UFC.  Because if they are *much* much more exceptional (we are talking raw strength and speed here not skill that's a given) than the average man and a female UFC champion is just on par with or slightly stronger than the average male... then maybe it wouldn't be good.

"serialkillers","t5_2s9td","I originally agreed, because there are rough parallels in the 'age of x' idea, but I think I need to disagree.

My reasoning is that in the US (and elsewhere) these mass shooters are, by a huge margin, young right wing boys being radicalised online by alt right YouTube and connection to alt right chat boards. They channel feelings of disquiet and young rage into an urge to kill. Either an urge to kill minorities or an urge to just cause a shooting in an effort to force people to push gun control because they believe that a push for gun control will spark the second American Civil War.

I personally believe that serial killers need some kind of biological component, an in built urge to kill, and generally some kind of a live which pushes them to act on that urge like a drug.

Mass shooters are generally not born that way, I believe. They are being radicalised by a concerted effort of modern day fascists attempting to cause some kind of major war in the US.

My major sources for this are both free, Robert Evans podcast series 'It Could Happen Here' and also his other recent work 'The War On Everyone'.

When I was still hooked I read a study about Vietnam veterans who had used on deployment but had no lasting addiction when they returned to the states. After further research the my concluded that cutting off supply wiped out the disease with minimal cravings.  I sat on that for awhile, then woke up one day, decided I was done, found a detox and called the cops on my dealer. That was 4 years ago as of 8/7 and I have zero lingering issues.

It makes you a part of your city or town, even tho no one knows who drew it but they all recognise it when they see it and to me thats the best part, its not about making a name or popularity its purely about the art form, for someone to look at it and appreciate it even tho i'll never know it and they'll never know me it's still a point of influence. But if your planning on going out and getting up and spreading ur name then just have a moral code and respect for things, our crew would never paint someones private house or car or something that effected an individual or business, we only got up on council property coz basically i helped pay for the shit so i can decorate the shit how i want haha.

So this morning is Fathers day in Australia and I got my gifts from my kids. A watch, key ring, shirt etc. Now I never expect any great as they buy stuff from the stall at school and only have limited money. One gift from my daughter has pissed me off, I don't fault her one bit as I know she bought it with the intention that I would like it. It was this little golf game, it's a little plastic game where you flick the balls into some holes. It's something you'd get from a $1 lucky dip. No adult would want this. I feel like they have taken advantage of my daughter and forced me to fake my appreciation for this gift. I think they should be regulating what they sell at the fathers day stall and not selling toys.

Let me give you a much more apt metaphor; try not to think about them too much, the last one clearly hurt to such an extent it gave you even more brain damage. You‚Äôve been having an epileptic seizure on the ground, spazaming and drooling on the ground, I kicked you, and then you started shitting yourself and screaming even louder. 
And then you claimed you were correct. Pretty strange from my end. And that‚Äôs really said given my metaphor is like, actually accurate.

I mad a claim, you were too stupid to attack it. And I‚Äôve just been roasting you with my actually talented use of the English language, whilst you‚Äôve been making commies look progressively more retarded. Fuck off back to r/enoughlibertarianspam

A place were, somehow, dipshits, and your dipshit ideology and reasoning are accepted. I know your ego is hurt and I know you‚Äôre experiencing some cognitive dissonance, but at this stage you really can‚Äôt come out of this well. Try and be a big boy for me and cop this L on the chin. Okay?

You tried to troll me, you didn‚Äôt know how. Being fucking stupid isn‚Äôt a troll, I‚Äôm sorry. You went for this weird tactic, and you fell headfirst. Nice one fuckface. You lose, try again some other time, but this, wasn‚Äôt a troll. You fucking suck. Now get the fuck out of my DM‚Äôs you greasy little fucking degenerate. I win.",1567296092

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt; I realise that 100 percent of Tory voters won't go for No-Deal, and similarly, 100% of Lib Dems won't back Remain. 

That is a bizarre and frankly disingenuous equivalency. The Tories *explicitely* fought the EU elections for May's deal and implicitely against No Deal; those who wanted No Deal defected to BXP. The LDs were *explicitely* remain. Assuming those who voted LD who be more or less 100% remain is a reasonable first-order assumption (key words: first-order, and assumption). The argument that 100% of those who voted Tory would back No Deal, especially when based on trends that *includes the majority of BXP voters*, is just silly.

If you'd presented this a fun, albeit heavily contrived game to find a way to get to 48/52, that would be fine. But it shouldn't be presented as anything beyond that, and it's sort of academic malpractise to pretend to have precision to 1% just to get the desired 48/52 when you fully well know you're jumping through hoops to get there and the uncertainties are through the roof.

Anyway, I don't feel the need to carry on down this road. But you *really* shouldn't defend your analysis by revealing you're an academic; it doesn't do you any favours at all to play that card, it just invites basic scrutiny the analysis can't support at all. Present it as what it is: a fun game you came up with to find a way to get to 48/52. 

Anyway, sorry if this comes across as overly aggressive; have a good night.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I‚Äôm 17 and not an expert, but I‚Äôve only gone one year of my life without a cat. I‚Äôm typing this with a cat on my feet. 

Having a permanent home will help her settle sooner. Cats are good at getting a sense for things and she probably knows that sooner or later she‚Äôll be moving out of where she is. Knowing that she has a home to find her way around and treat as her own will naturally make her more comfortable. She‚Äôd be able to find her own private spaces and have room to explore safely. 

You‚Äôre already doing the right thing with letting her come to you. That‚Äôs perfect. This lets her get used to your smell. If you are sure you will adopt her, performing tasks with her in the room will help her get used to your actions. Things like cleaning the room, reading a book or doing any paperwork will help. She‚Äôll get to know how you do things and can work around you. She‚Äôll be able to predict your actions and will feel more comfortable with you going about your day when she does live with you. Reading a book out loud will also help her get used to your voice. Owners always talk to their cats and I‚Äôm don‚Äôt doubt that you talk to the ones you work with. Hearing your voice will, overtime, relax her when she is used to it. She‚Äôll also be more likely to listen to you telling her to do something. 

Giving her treats in moderation will show her you are friendly and want to get on with her. Sharing food shows that you care about her. If she sees that she can eat in front of you, or even from your hand, she will see that you are no threat. Just don‚Äôt try to touch her at all while doing so as she may read this as an attack. 

I don‚Äôt know very much about cats being blind, but I do know they are very good at making ‚Äòscent paths.‚Äô When they rub themselves on furniture they do are doing this, and they are able to smell where they have been. This is why they generally follow the same path when rubbing themselves on things. When she has a permanent home she‚Äôll be able to do this and it‚Äôll help her find her way around. She‚Äôll learn the layout anyway and will be able to remember it soon enough. 

And can take a lot of time for cats to really warm up to a person, but it is one of the most rewarding experiences ever. Having a cat that shows you love and appreciation is such a good feeling. Morning cuddles are the absolute best. If you do go ahead with it, it will be quite difficult at times, but persevere and know that it will be so worth it in the end.",1567296092

If you want something more formal like it being posted on the door you might, in reality, end up with less notice.

The 6-hour window kind of sucks and is a bit inconsiderate.  Not sure if you can do much about that.

So really, unless you really want to force the paper service, you might be better off with e-mail.  If they bother with paper then they really don't need to e-mail.

"books","t5_2qh4i","Yeah that was... yeah no.

Edit: this is being downvoted so let me expand on it. That scene came out of nowhere, and to this day I don't get it. I've read a few King before ""It"" and nothing could have prepared me for that. It's bad enough reading a scene where children are having sex, it's even worse when they all do it with the same girl.

The only ""logical"" explanation that I could come up with was that it was some form of ""coming of age"" moment, or making their bond 'stronger/deeper' but I can't accept those because 1/ plenty of other methods to achieve those 2/if you take out the scene from the book, nothing changes.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""higher"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

The team that owns the service owns the repo, and if they feel they need to adjust those files for some reason they should be able to without affecting another team's work. Central control would impede their ability to do what they need to do.

Now, I'm not a big fan of chaos either. So for these types of files there should be some sort of org-wide best practices that teams are highly encouraged to follow. And when those best practices change teams should make time to update the files in their services to follow them.

Shit , it's almost as if a totalitarian regime is very bad at innovation because all the dissenters or ~~innovators~~ enemies of the state, get jailed or killed.

If they had allowed free speech, democracy, and freedom of ideas, then they would have been much more flexible and much more robust in facing the challenges, much more adaptive to the circumstances, if they would have been truly ""Sciencific socialists"" as they claimed themselves to be, then they would have used scientific measures, not ideological ones.

However if they had done that then they would have no longer been a totalitarian regime.

That why i take issue with the statement from the previous poster that said we know know precise capabilities based on this shared image.  That is just not true at all.

Typically,  the record label will claim ad revenue, but allow your video worldwide.  Some will block the video in many or all countries. Songs on the policy  page should give you no problem if you accept the conditions, and while  you are free to dispute the Content ID, you could get a warning or  strike for a rejected dispute. Songs that are not listed could also lead  to a warning or strike if copyrighted. The best choice is music that  you created, or that is in the public domain, or that you licensed for  use on YouTube. (Monstercat is an example of the latter.) If you use  short clips (a good guideline is 20 seconds or less) for Fair Dealing or  Fair Use purposes, such as commenting about the music, you can appeal  the Content ID, though it's the record label that gets the final say.

For a lot of the fighters no matter what they get payed it's still better than what they would make as a doctor in their country so why would they think to unionize?

A lot of these nations like Brazil also have strong anti-union sentiments.

A lot of these people come from countries where unions not only don't exist, but there are no worker protection laws so if you try to unionize it is completely legal for the employer to just sack them. 

Then of course there are the American fighters who SHOULD understand the value of unions, but most are uneducated and they don't understand unions so they don't want it. 

AND then there is the fact that the UFC pays all the fighters with power (Conor, DC, JJ, etc) pretty great wages so the fighters that could lead a unionizing effort are led to believe that they are special and that all the under card fighters just aren't. That the undercard deserves the shit pay, because they made it with the same pay. They have an I've got mine mentality. 

Basically. The UFC's pay system is fucked and we need the government to force the UFC to pay their fighters properly.",1567296105

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","‚ÄúThat live within our borders.‚Äù The Argonians didn‚Äôt annex Morrowind, there are just tribes that live there. Practically bandits.

The Argonian horde was defeated at Mournhold, they didn‚Äôt have the chance to cut a bloodly swath across Northern Morrowind.

The Argonians were killing everyone they came across, I doubt they would have allowed the Dunmer to stay while they were at war with them. The Argonians made them leave and become refugees due to invading their homes and attempting to kill them all.

I don‚Äôt understand how Black Marsh, the homeland of the Argonians could be lost to the Argonians especially since they became independent almost immediately after the Oblivion crisis but that‚Äôs not important. The line about southern Morrowind is contradicted by maps and the writer is, let‚Äôs be honest, a fool. He speculates the Thalmor caused the Red Year, blames them for everything and despite not being a member he somehow knows the Thalmor caused basically everything. Even then the author never states the Dunmer didn‚Äôt take it back.

Why is it that people keep ignoring ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt live here.‚Äù? The Argonians don‚Äôt literally control Vvardenfell, they just perform a ritual there or used anyway. We are also told in Dragonborn that the Dunmer rebuilt Vvardenfell, the Argonians don‚Äôt own it and last time I recall Vvardenfell is way past Mournhold, where the Argonians were defeated. To get to the Valus mountains from Vvardenfell you would have to go through what is certainly Dunmer territory. They don‚Äôt own the Valus mountains, they are practically bandits.

Read my comment, Tear was rebuilt according to the East Empire map, which is backed up by dialogue with Erikur.

Here is what I think happened.

1) Red Year

2) Accession War

3) Argonian tribes settle around the southern regions, not officially taken by Black Marsh.

4) Argonian tribes are either wiped out by Umbriel or driven out later once Morrowind has at least a century to recover. 

I‚Äôd say Lady N‚Äôs map is accurate, the Argonians have a small amount of Southern Morrowind but Tear is still around and so is Narsis which may or may not be the capital of Sadras, since they replaced Hlaalu. But even then both of us are basically speculating due to Bethesda not giving us a solid answer.",1567296111

A laptop, Bluetooth device or something like an Alexa will create interference and cause weird turning issues mostly. I solved the issue by removing the Bluetooth mouse dongle from my laptop and putting it to sleep while playing.

As for loot and build, arcane is only effective very late game. Until then an effective arcane build is very reliant on molotovs which is incredibly expensive long term as it's more points not going into your stats.

I suggest a strength build. Start with the hunters axe, I find it's the easiest weapon to start the game with. Play through the opening streets and push through to burning crucifix. Up and to the left there are many boxes at the end, if you roll through you can access a hidden route. Cross the small bridge and on the right there is another path you can drop down behind some boxes. This should put you on some scaffolding. Go to the right to meet Eiline the Crow. Talk to every box several times until they begin to repeat themselves. then knock the items down from their chains. Then drop down safely yourself and then drop into the central canal in that room, at the end where there are many rats kill them and get the item. It's a madman's knowledge. You need to maintain at least 1 insight to level up so now that you have this you use the doll in the dream to level up.

Now you can start speccing into whatever you like. I always suggest getting to about 20 Health before switching and dumping into your damage stat. 

Arcane can be a great build but it's really struggle street until late game unless you're already familiar with the game as many of the 'spells' are locked to late game items. Arcane also influences elemental damage but not by enough to be your most reliable main source of dps.

I suggest going pure strength them speccing into arcane for Ng+.",1567296112

You can run a positive offset that will increase the voltage the CPU gets or a negative that will decrease the voltage.  On auto my chip will pull over 1.5V on the low load boosts by using the offset it stays around 1.4.  The lower voltage helps the chip run cooler which results in higher and longer boosts even under a full load.
The Wraith Spire is a decent cooler but it needs the fan running at higher RPM's to keep the chip cool. It's worse if you have the newer version of the spire it lacks the copper core and vapor chamber of the older version.  The newer version has a different fan too.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","[From the announcement:](https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/460733-shop-changes-in-golden-eagle-packs/)

&gt;	Golden Eagles packs for 500, 15,000 and 20,000 have been withdrawn from the shop as they were redundant.

&gt;	Discounts for large amounts of GE will be now be displayed in the Gaijin.net store as well as in the purchase menu in the hangar in game.

They aren't having a ""fake discount"", they are just clearly showing what the bulk discount is. Prior to this change, the online store just showed the flat price without showing the bulk discount that would normally be shown in the in-game GE purchase menu. Now it is showing both the ""normal"" price you would have to pay to get that amount of GE by just purchasing the 150 GE packs, and the ""discounted"" price that shows the discount you get for bulk purchases.

However, it appears that there is an issue when trying to access this through Steam:

&gt;	Today we have implemented bulk discounts for Golden Eagles in the store. So far they have been shown only in hangar all this time. We‚Äôre doing this to better demonstrate the value you‚Äôre saving when purchasing larger amounts of GE.

&gt;	However, it doesn't work for Steam (yet). Primarily for technical reasons. There is no ETA on when we will be able to address this. You can purchase GE from the store even as a steam user (and get the discounts).

The workaround right now is to not purchase through the Steam browser and just use a desktop browser of your choice. While on Chrome it is showing the correct ""discounted"" prices, and that is the price it should be.

Basically, it‚Äôs the same Nigerian prince shit, different day. Except, instead of a Nigerian prince, it is usually an attractive female telling a usually male a sob story. She needs cash, she has PayPal. She transacts the amount on PayPal, he gives her the cash.

So far so good. Eventually, it happens again, with larger amounts every time.

The coup de grace is when she asks for a large sum, he obliges...and she retroactively cancels the PayPal transaction. He literally watches his PayPal balance disappear. Because that is something PayPal let‚Äôs her do with a certain timeframe.",1567296114

An ETF doesn't typically generate capital gains, so if that ETF's expense ratio is less than 3%, then it makes more sense to buy the ETF instead of the mutual fund.

I'm not sure how much capital gains FZROX will generate, but the taxes associated with those capital gains will probably be more than the low expense ratio of ITOT.",1567296114

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I may be the wrong person to answer the question because I don't see myself someone who overcame great odds and did have some help along the way. 

I feel the opposite though that people who grow up getting everything tend to be less prepared when things get difficult and they will either in personal life, professional life maybe both. People that didn't didn't grow up in privilege may be more used to the fight so they see an obstacle and they have no doubt they will smash as long they are inclined to that thought process. 

I think you might want to start by looking at yourself rather than your sister and ask yourself if you could have worked harder or smarter to have advanced and if yes then you know you still have a lot of upside if you start doing that. I don't know you but I am sure you have special skills and I am sure you have intelligence in some aspects that are valuable but if you give up on yourself you'll never get the chance to use them.",1567296115

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA: she messaged you because she probably was interested at a first glance but got put off when you had the view point she didnt like. Though you didnt need to make the comment about her broadening her dating range to include people who have different view points. Having different view points is fine and good to always see the other side. But not really something people want in their partner. So making that comment does make you sound a bit pretentious. It would have been fine to just say ""hey, just wanted to let you know I hold [viewpoint] but am open to getting to know each other. Totally cool if you aren't though"". And she sucks too for calling you names, she could have said ""sorry, not interested. Good luck"". She doesnt owe giving you a chance nor do you owe giving her a chance. Political stance, moral stance, are easily deal breakers so dont be surprised if it happens again in the future.

"Shinypreciousgems","t5_169dmv","Well shit, I just noticed that the question was about designing and not cutting. Yeah, still true. For designing, just like in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery, there's a lot of creativity, working around pre-existing issues, and backup option planning that I do. Let's say I'm designing for a piece of kunzite that has a great orientation for colour, but has a few suspicious brittle areas. I'll try and come up with two designs that can use that orientation, but help avoid the area of concern; will preform and try to reduce that area down beforehand; and will have backup plans in case something breaks or cracks or otherwise causes problems. (In reconstructive surgery we always have ""lifeboat options"" if your first reconstruction fails.)  


There's also a lot of 3D visual-spatial planning skills involved. Where exactly are inclusions located in the stone, and how can they be best avoided? Where are the cleavage planes? In surgery, it's more of stuff like where are important nerves and vessels or aesthetic landmarks, where are places that are most likely to cause issues, etc; but similar principles apply.",1567296117

The party's problems have very little to do with Sanders.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

Of all the ways to destroy that we know, there is:
Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre.

I would suggest two more  
- Canon : Protego Diabolica as it seems to act similar to Fiendfyre  (FBAWTFT screenplay and movie)
- Non-Canon: The Dark Energy Voldemort uses in the movies. In OoP against Dumbledore and in the DH when he destroys the basilisk fang with it.


Other suggestions would be:  
- an Obscurus. 
- Dementor kiss (after the recipient is open or the soul is active - I don't know how it would work against the cup or the diadem for example)
- Nagini's own venom (it seemed to be special)


And the last.... Is love!

The locked door in the Department of Mysteries contains one of the most powerful magic to exist, one that is very dangerous. I believe, if you threw a soul that is incapable of loving in that room, it would either die, or actually feel remorse (probably dying from remorse...).",1567296119

Also, I agree completely that it is a riskier move and makes more sense to use Two of a Kind, which is why it makes more sense for someone to only need two cards to do it, rather than three.

Reading the rules again now, it is never stated that you need three cards instead of two ([https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/ExplodingKittens-rules.pdf](https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/ExplodingKittens-rules.pdf))",1567296120

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","So you are suggesting that women can't ever have sex unless they are willing to be mothers? I'm sure it sounds good to you on paper, but you realize there is no way this can ever work when applied to the real world right?

You are saying that I should NEVER have sex within my monogamous relationship of 9 years because I am not mommy material? Yeah that's a great practical plan there! Very realistic and totally natural! I'm sure no couple has ever drifted away and broken apart because one party was no longer interested in sex. 

No you don't need to have the mental capacity of an 8 year old to not understand the risks of pregnancy. Many Christian schools focus on abstinence only programs, which can not only leave teenagers in the dark but also enforce misinformation that can be costly. There are quite a few teenagers out there who got pregnant because they truly believed that ''you can't get pregnant your first time'', or that its impossible to get pregnant if the guy withdraws. The mentality that ''sex is sinful and every female needs to abstain from it or face the punishment of pregnancy'' only encourages misinformation and lack of proper sexual education, which in turn increases unwanted pregnancies. These young women are thus double whammed! Their society failed to give them the knowledge they needed to make enlightened decisions, and now tells them that they are sluts who need to accept the punishment of losing contingency of their own bodies.",1567296120

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt;That's the point. With suspension of Parliament there may not be time even with a majority.

There is no 'may' about it, if there is a majority in Parliament, then there is time to act, or to put it another way, the amount of time being lost doesn't meaningfully change anything at this point. If there had been a legislative attempt kicked off in June that was being slowly fought through the Commons and Lords, with scrutiny and so on you'd have a point (the additional time could matter), but given anything that would be viable at this point assuming no prorogation, and no recess would be rapid (along the lines of Letwin Cooper, so 5 days or so) it doesn't make much of a difference at all.

There was always going to be a point at which there wouldn't be enough time to get legislation through, but we haven't passed it yet for a narrow, emergency approach with a majority behind it. We had passed it for everything else already.

&gt;What compromise between leave and remain is there? You either leave or you don't.

It'd relate to how we leave and the direction taken afterwards. You are right, it's binary and after the referendum, the GE and the approach Parliament has taken it was always going to be a compromise around leaving with a closer relationship than not. By sticking to a staunch remain position (and by some on the leave side pushing an uncompromising leave position) that obviously becomes impossible. No majority is possible other than leaving without a deal in place is possible if remain supporting MP's don't support a softer leave position (and many did..), conversely, remaining is impossible without leave supporting MP's completely changing directly.",1567296122

These may include increasing pain, redness, warmth, purulent discharge, swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck and under your jaw, fever, chills, nausea/vomiting and muscle aches and pains.

"entitledparents","t5_358dh","Read this comment in its entirety or get banned. Consider checking out /r/entitledredditors instead. If you contact us with a question that can be answered by this comment, you will be banned permanently and your internet will be revoked.  

Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. Go to https://old.reddit.com/u/YOURUSERNAME to see both kinds of karma.  

The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.

It is literally hell inside of my head sometimes.

I dont give a fuck about some rando feeling good about MY struggle because they prefer for it to be constant fighting and suffering for me. Being in pain and turmoil isn't a better/stronger recovery than those like me, who just want to have some semblance of a normal life.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Part of the problem is when a non-swimmer sinks the first time, they often panic, which makes things worse. Once you've been swimming for 10 - 15 years you realize there are a hundred different ways to slap your arms and legs around to keep your head out of water. (When I was a kid, the ""corkscrew"" stroke was all the rage; you rolled, alternating forward crawl with the right arm, backstroke with the left.)

But, swimming isn't intuitive. if you've never been in water deeper than a bath tub, it can be frightening. Just treading water isn't intuitive either.

I know it is hard for you to believe. I live within 30 miles of three different  reservoirs. Every year or two someone who doesn't know how to swim decides they will be safe without a life jacket, gets on a raft or air mattress or canoe,  heads out for deep water, falls in and drowns.",1567296125

"exbahai","t5_2sae9","I'm only half way through the video and am not planning to finish it today. Here's what I've got so far.

1. He claims to have been a Christian but apparently doesn't believe in the resurrection of Jesus. The gospel records are clear in stating that this happened. Abdu'l-Baha was clear in stating it didn't.  Choose one. You can be a Christian or a Baha'i . . . you can't be both. 
2. He says nothing Jesus said can be altered, but as a Baha'i he doesn't believe that Jesus spoke with Satan (Matthew 4) and Baha'is don't believe in demons so I guess he discounts every time Jesus spoke about casting out demons. He's trying to make us believe that he believes the Bible is true, and most people hearing him wouldn't realize the Baha'i teachings are not in alignment with the Bible. 
3. He doesn't say anything about his own salvation (if that ever really happened). He does give a long story about how he was courting a woman who turned out to be a Baha'i, and he was sucked into the religion that way. It reminds me of how King Solomon was corrupted by his pagan wives.

I've discovered that a lot of the people who claim they used to be Christians are really speaking about being raised in a Christian family... not accepting it, and as young adults, going off into some other belief. I see that over and over. Of course it is okay to pursue your own path toward truth, but if you haven't been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ and don't believe in the resurrection of Jesus then you're not a Christian.  Romans 10:9 - ""...if  you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart  that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" 

So while he's trying to say Baha'i is the same as Christianity and can supersede it - I'm thinking he's a bit of a deceptive hypocrite and isn't addressing all the pertinent issues. His intentions may be good. His heart seems to be very sincere in what he believes... but there are some issues. Like many if not most Baha'is, he is saying what he hopes people need to hear in order to abandon their own beliefs and accept his. 

I may watch the rest another day. Right now, I have to leave.",1567296126

Theres a lot of challenges to overcome, and the martian regolith is a huge part of that challenge. I'm by no means an expert, but this is what the experts I've heard from have to say...

Theres a number of potential causes for the sandy and dusty conditions on Mars. One is asteroid impacts from long ago in Mars' history. This quite effectively pulverizes large areas of rock into fine dust. Add the frequent sand storms which slowly break down rock into more sand (imagine sand blasting a piece of rock until the rock had worn away. Now you have both the dust you started with and the dust made from the rock).

Recent studies also suggest that millions of years ago, while there was already life on Earth, Mars may have had a dense enough atmosphere to support liquid water on its surface. It may have actually had entire oceans at a time when dinosaurs were here to look up at it. But as the atmosphere slipped away and the climate changed, that water was evaporated or sealed away underground as ice. A substantial amount of today's dust may have been a byproduct of water erosion.",1567296128

Everything that isn‚Äôt currently broken is on its way to broken, so by that age, they‚Äôre all unique. 

It could be on its first engine or its third rebuild. The wiring harness could be completely pristine or spliced to pieces for a car phone in 1987, a radar detector in 1995, and a stereo head unit in 2004. Maybe the fuel lines were replaced 10 years ago or maybe they‚Äôre original. The tires could be out of date by a decade or only six months old. It may have been repainted one or more times. It could have a wreck or two in its history. By a lot of metrics, the whole car is a red flag. It‚Äôs going to cost way too much to go way too slow. Nobody needs this car. But you already know that and still want it. So what you‚Äôre actually interested in are green flags, i.e., those things about the car that at least make you want to take the step of spending $150 to get a PPI. 

It starts and runs strong. 
There are service records and receipts as far back as possible.
The owner is forthright about the car and its history as much as is known. 
It is being offered for sale by a PCA member or has some type of provenance.

I run a full ranch of 8 hatches and 8 stone hatches. in the late game you'll be able to get a ton of regolith which can be melted down to molten. this heat can then be used to create steam turbine power and then once cooled turned into igneous rock that you can feed the hatches. 

&amp;#x200B;

as for your glum problem. this just means they werent groomed. to keep them unglum you just need to groom them and keep distance in mind. the smaller the confined space they're in, the quicker they are to get to the grooming station and get groomed. the trick is to keep them in a small area while still making the room large.

This is why Three of Coins didn't work on Aksis, because on the Backend, he wasn't an Ultra, he was just a vehicle with a massively inflated health pool. It's also why weapons that deal bonus damage to Fallen didn't deal bonus damage to him, because Spider Tanks aren't affected by that weapon attribute.

As for the fact that thr raid gear is reakinned eververse stuff from almost two years ago... So what? It still looks pretty cool, IMO, and who does this actually hurt?",1567296130

"squash","t5_2qs3d","The serve is a crucial part of the game as you obviously know. There are several technical elements - tough to type it all out. I have a free video on my website I can direct you to if you're interested that covers different types of serves (with examples). Just let me know and I'd be happy to share.

Your second point is a good one as well. Most people think that there is one way to hold the racquet, and one way to swing. In reality there are many variations to technique, and top players are always changing their racquet face angle, contact point etc to hit different shots from different positions. When the ball gets behind us, we have to manipulate our wrist to still hit straight, with an open racquet face. One thing most people miss here is to still follow through on their shot, even if the ball is behind them! There are some elements of movement and flow involved in this as well, but you'd have to watch a video (very difficult to explain - high level, we should be looking to maintain flow/continuity in to our shot, and out of our shot). Most people pause in between that breaks the energy flow, causing weak shots to be hit.

Regarding your third point: from what part of the court is your opponent often hitting this shot? Once you identify the hitting source, you can determine what shot you hit in the first place that gave them that juicy opportunity, at which point you can focus on hitting a better version of that shot (or eliminating that shot entirely!).

Please let me know how the advice pans out. I'm sure it'll help :)

Also you might become an engineer or scientist and hopefully not an anti-vaxxer.

Same reason: ""Basic"" scientific vocabulary - you just owe it to society and yourself to know, in the 21st century, what an atom, a molecule, an ion are. What a chemical element is. What is meant by nuclear fission / fusion and where the energy comes from in that process. Basics about electricity, possibly batteries. How genes, proteins and cells relate to each other and differences between bacteria and virii.


Foreign languages (might be more applicable in europe) I'm writing this post in my second language and organized and spent a holiday using my third language, french, just this summer.


Literature. It introduced me to a lot of ideas I wouldn't have sought out otherwise, refined my enjoyment of books, gave me tools to understand ""hard"" or ""more complicated"" literature - and especially by analyzing poetry, showed me how a writer can plant an idea in a reader's head without ever stating it. Catching that effect has often come in handy when reading newspapers and catching ""snuck-in"" value judgements.

Math. Because abstract thinking and disassembling problems to solve them is a great skill. It practiced the basic mode of thought i needed to start teaching myself programming. it helps with close to all the sciences. and the actual math came in handy in everyday life, too.

How government and legislation are structured in my country and how they are elected and roughly what is done at the state level and what at the federal or eu level. Which helps with, you know, voting and knowing what to be angry about. 

Typing.

Sex Ed.

I'm sure the ones who had economy classes found those handy, too.

I'm sure some learned that they are cherished and valued and attractive...

I learned that I'm probably smart but should be less arrogant about it. (And quickly un-learned the smart part at university, but that's normal.)

So yeah, I have actually used A LOT of the stuff I learned and i feel i missed out on a lot of art and music i could have learned more about - just to appreciate it as much as literature.",1567296132

I played a double shimmeron low-life Tinkerskin EB crit lightning trap build this league.  50% crit chance and 5 power charges up constantly after the first few packs in a map, so I'd be constantly under the 2k lightning degen from the shimmerons.  


In PoB with no traps detonated recently, my net regen is -397.  With 20 traps detonated recently, my net regen is +247.  To go from negative (degen) to positive (regen), i need 13% regen from pyromaniac.  Guess what?  I never had an issue with degen after the first few packs in a map.  Thus I had more than 13% regen from pyromaniac (will spell that out for you).  


After this nerf, my maximum net regen on that character will be -75.  Shimmeron degen will kill me regardless of the regen from pyromaniac.  That build is dead.  It wasn't a good build, mind you, Demi's one I based it off of is better, but it was my build and i liked it.",1567296133

* **Prep:** None  
* **Brush:** Lancaster Fly Fishing w/26mm SHD  
* **Razor:** Rex Ambassador  
* **Blade:** Voshkod (1)  
* **Lather:** Southern Witchcrafts - Sandalwood - Sample soap  
* **Post Shave:** [Australian Private Reserve - Torchwood - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1154/?product_type=aftershave)  


It was a late Saturday morning shave today. This shave was another from Southern Witchcraft&amp;#39;s single-note line. I&amp;#39;ve got one more tomorrow (grapefruit) and then I&amp;#39;m on to my next artisan. Southern Witchcrafts has a pretty straightforward sandalwood scent. I find it pretty dry, but not in a bad way. It doesn&amp;#39;t smell inauthentic to me, but it smells like a classic, manly scent.

Torchwood is amazing. 

On the hardware side, this was my first shave with my new brush from Lancaster Razor Works. It was made in collaboration with Talbot for the Chattanooga Creek release (which is still en route...). As a fly fisherman, this jumped out to me. The handle is set with a 26mm SHD knot from Maggard. 

(Pics!)[https://imgur.com/a/dGPiogq]

The handle fits great in my hand and the knot feels great on my face. This knot doesn&amp;#39;t feel like it has quite as much backbone as my other (also 26mm) SHD brush from Dogwood. It probably sits higher in the handle. It feels like it splays more and isn&amp;#39;t quite as dense as the Dogwood. I don&amp;#39;t have a strong preference either way at the moment, but I&amp;#39;m glad they feel different. I was a little skeptical about owning the same knot in the same size.

It&amp;#39;s college football, formula 1, and lounging today. I might do some work and cleaning, but we&amp;#39;ll see. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to this long weekend.",1567296133

Easterners, even if their beliefs differ, they just absolutely know there is something bigger and need no proof. They can see, hear and feel without knowing how or why.

The problem of evil, classically, isn't that god (or gods) *causes* those things, but *allows* those evil things to happen.

A strictly omnipotent or even merely 'very strong' god could stop most or all evil from happening. The only reasonable explanation is that god opts not to intervene, and thus allows those things to happen. *Qui tacet consentire videtur*.

There are versions of religion where god determines and causes everything, and they are even more obviously problematic, because then god really did decide to give your 8 year-old cousin bowel cancer.

What I find odd about most of these answers is that they ignore that the geopolitics would still be very similar. Rather than the continent and people not existing I see things differently. There would likely be a push for a commonwealth status very, very early to give autonomy while still remaining a part of a larger whole. Canada and the US would likely be together. I expect the Napoleon wars would be the last straw so to speak for full autonomy if it hadn't already happened, but again within the Commonwealth.


This would lead to an incredibly strong Commonwealth. It's interesting to think what would happen in the world wars. In WW1 with such a strong potential, Germany may have not invaded through Belgium. Then it'd be a great debate whether or not to enter. Apparently it's still a debate in Britain now whether or not they should have gotten involved in world war 1. This is hard to say because it really gets into specific mentalities.

As for technology and development, I see that as very much the same. This comes down to the geopolitics of the North American continent being quite rich in resources, farmland, etc. Now North America and Britain would share intellectual ideas, education, have a common currency, etc. If anything I expect development would actually be even faster. Let's keep in mind the British education system and general development was far more advanced than the US until about WW1 or WW2 era.",1567296134

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","There isn't a single fighter in the world that would have beaten Orlando Salido in their second pro fight. Forget about all of the low-blows/dirty fighting by Salido... Lomacheko still managed to almost KO him at the end of the fight and just barely lost a split decision. 

To be able to even make ANY adjustments on the fly like that in your second pro fight against that type of fighter and hurt him at the end is pretty unreal. it was on the job training, at the highest level, and he got better and better as the fight went on. Its probably safe to say that if that was a 15-round match-Loma would have won that. Not that it matters anyway, I'm hypothetically speaking of course. But that's an asterik over a loss if there ever was one.

Nobody is unbeatable anyway. Even Floyd could have easily had a loss on his resume with a different group of judges against Castillo.",1567296136

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","People don't seem to understand the difference of selling naked and selling spreads..

When you sell ""naked puts"" or sell ""naked calls"" - that means you have the unlimited risk of loss..

When you sell ""put spreads"" or sell ""call spreads"" - that means you just capped your profits and losses.

So you when you sell ""put spreads"" you have the ability to make money if they expire worthless, and if the stock goes completely against you, you will only lose :

- The maximum loss is equal to the difference between the strike prices and the net credit received.


So if you sell 1 put at $10 and buy 1 put at $9 and you sell them at the same time together netting you 0.10, 

and then  the stock goes against you and closes at $7, you lose maximum which is = $90

"Steam","t5_2qwis","His indian friend actually took a screencap of G2A to prove it works and I was shocked when I realized he paid over 10 euros for a 10 USD card. The euro is currently stronger so they actually charged him more for the code than it would have been worth for in the steam store. They are both students at a medicine school in germany so I don't understand why someone ""bright"" would still trust these shady sites. His logic is that gift cards can't be chargedback because they are activated at retail stores. I looked up stuff regarding revoked steam wallet codes and the only case I could find was of a SEA person who got his wallet funds revoked due to the SEA regional lock. I still wouldn't trust a site where several people complain about getting used codes on top of them charging more for gift cards.

&amp;#x200B;

btw the indian dude has been doing that for years and no game bought with G2A's steam gift cards has been revoked. So is he just lucky or are their wallet codes more legit than the game keys sold at half the price? It might explain why they charge extra for  cards compared to retail stores. It's still a shitty practice due to the cards supporting the rest of the criminal activity. I just looked up the recent articles with indie developers bashing G2A's practices.

&amp;#x200B;

"asmr","t5_2sbyc","Isn't the app a little redundant considering the alternatives? When you go down the subscription model you have to consider the competition which in this case is; YouTube Premium, Spotify, Patreon, and the Tingles App. The app benefits creators but there's little for the consumer. 

If you don't want adds then there's YouTube Premium which is slightly more expensive (the student subscription is actually cheaper than Zees) but it offers so much more content. There's also Spotify at the same price but it has literally millions of songs as well as a tonne of ASMR content. If you want to personally support a creator then there's Patreon. Zees doesn't really have any benefits other than some exclusive content but that's also the same for Patreon. 

Speaking more broadly, there's A LOT of subscription services out there now. Not to mention that Disney+ and AppleTV+ will be launching later this year. It's a crowded market. Even if people are willing to pay $9.99 per month, they may ditch the app in favour of other subscription based streaming services.

I don't want to sound mean or overly cynical because I know people have worked really hard on the app and they have nothing but the best intentions for the community but I think this will struggle to take off. Especially at that price point. I'd love to support it because I respect the content creators and it's a very ambitious project but I just can't justify the price.",1567296139

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","For bio females: one way to go is men's clothing in neutral or earth tones with less-noticeable patterns (like window pane) and a boxy fit. This looks which a bit clunkier and masculine. Men's shorts and a hat looks surprisingly good for androgyny but this tends to highlight the female side a bit more. Also experiment with long flannel, big boots, and suit jackets

For bio males: Always make it fitted, if you're big and broad, then make it overly-fitted. You might try overalls, too. Experiment with showing some shoulder or back. Any tops made for females that don't fit uncomfortably will work for the look. In general, try to find thinner or fitted male pants, never female pants since they just fit awkwardly on a male body. Also: a good tip is to have a neutral tone jacket over a complimenting bright color tone and something eye-catching at the chest. This will draw more attention to the center of your body and your chest making you look thinner and with a slight chest.

For either: Baggy/fitted (depending on your body type) clothes in faded primary colors looks pretty decent for both. Scarves will hide your neck well if it looks masculine or feminine and you don't want it too.

For both: Minimal makeup no matter what you look like. No heavy eye shadow, but a little is a good idea if you're a male with a masculine face.

Your face will kind of control how feminine or masculine you want the rest to be, a male with a feminine face has the broadest range in what they can pull off, a female with a rounder, softer face and a male with a boxy face have the smallest-but this doesn't mean you can't look androgynous by any means.

For hair, a quiff works for either, but generally better for female. Males might try pixie or even bob cut, but these can be hard to pull off if you don't have the face for it. In general, males should just keep it neat, styled, and not-messy. Men's Long hair will look very feminine when down and to the side

Source: androgynous/drag queen brother, that styles for other androgynous people and drag queens. So I know what I'm talking about somewhat, but take what I say with a grain of salt. In general, because of my brother's specific drag queen niche, these tips are a lot closer to cross-dresser than purely androgynous. But I'd experiment with some of the ideas

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","She manipulated me left right and centre. She always needed to be the centre of attention. 

She ditched me at a party because ‚Äúthe guy she was going to have sex with started jerking off in front of her‚Äù and I got sexually assaulted that night. I told her this, and she switched the topic back to her weird sex story. She used that to justify why she ditched me at a party without even texting me or trying to find me. 

I was still there for her. But after I had a surgery and she called me to rant about her sex life (she did this exact move 5 years ago- the hypersexuality, ranting, not giving a shit about anyone but herself)..... and I was still willing to give her another try because she baited being suicidal. I came and got her and I listened to her complain about her extremely marginal problems for 7 hours. She‚Äôs never once listened to me for more than 4 minutes without her making it about herself. She wasn‚Äôt suicidal. She wanted attention.  I needed to be studying but instead I poured all my attention into comforting her. 

She sent me some forwarded texts from her mentally ill mother, who accused me of being a bad friend for leaving her in the past.
If someone babysits you all night, takes you out of harms way and supports you- you don‚Äôt forward them nasty texts from your mom. 

I told her i was hurt and she tried to throw in my face/managed to complain to me that my mom ‚Äúwas looking at her like she was a pariah‚Äù 
My mom knows about the 500 plus sex partners, the drug use, the shitty choices, and her spoiled/entitled attitude. But I saw how my mom looked at her and it wasn‚Äôt with significant disdain. Though my mom did tell me not to bring her home. I still did because I was worried about my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù


At that point, she had shat on me too many times, and I was done. It‚Äôs always a bit odd when a narcissistic self-centred asshole runs out of people in her life to abuse and starts offloading onto you, while treating you like shit. 


Anyways, we don‚Äôt talk anymore. Some parts of my life are better left in the past. I‚Äôm learning more and more that I can‚Äôt save everyone. Even though I want to. 

I especially can‚Äôt save those who are offered every privilege in life but instead piss it all away, do hard drugs and then come crying about how their life is a mess and then go and do more drugs in the same night, and do nothing for anyone but themselves. 

I could go on forever about the shitty things she did to me. Probably because I was the only one who cared enough to look after her. 

I‚Äôd try to set boundaries in place but then she‚Äôd send me serial messages, following ‚Äúeveryone always does this to me skdieixidis I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. (Slurring her words intentionally to seem like she‚Äôs done drugs and is in danger)

Turns out the most unselfish thing I could do is to let her go. I tried to be compassionate and selfless and supportive, and got shat on every step of the way. 

I‚Äôm not even going to get into the fact that she would sleep with furries, let guys bring elastic bands to put on her chest, and never used condoms EVER. I‚Äôm also not going to get into the fact that her father is worth millions. If she had a brain or any semblance of work ethic, she could have had a paid for education. I think that‚Äôs one of many things about her that I found enraging.",1567296140

"Celiac","t5_2tnai","Basically it boils down to that they would like to have their cake and eat it too; they want to obtain the potential profit from widening their market to gluten-free people without assuming the risk of actually complying with the rules. Saying ""well it might not be 100% safe"" is a ridiculous statement because nothing in life is 100%. A more helpful statement is to describe what protocols are or are not in place to allow people to make their own decisions based on comfort. I personally eat some foods that are not ""guaranteed"" gluten-free by companies because I suspect that the risk of CC is non-existant (ie. product almost certainly has its own line and contains low risk ingredients only).

I think another element of it particularly in ""woke"" circles is that gluten-free has entered the halo of being some sort of politically correct food choice offering that MUST be offered, even if you have no idea what it means or desire to do it. You'll notice that ""dietary restrictions"" forms or menus are usually organized with vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free/religious restrictions separate from allergies/medical issues. I think that this demonstrates that gluten-free is viewed by many as an ethical/personal choice (where CC is not a concern) which should be accommodated in order to be inclusive instead of being a medical concern that requires thoughtful management (which it is).

While I think that both are reprehensible/wrong, the last one is more dangerous. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.",1567296140

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","It's still a fun game, but it wasn't finished properly at launch and ...I don't really know how else to explain it but it was *lacking* compared to the other FF experiences. Like it was a good underlining story but told very badly. It felt like they ran out of development time and had rushed it through.

For example: you go on a mission to capture a General. It's a stealth section that takes quite some time because it is easy to fail. You *finally* capture the guy--and then right after the mission ends one of your guys basically says ""oh he escaped by the way."" WHAT?! The guy we *just captured* seconds ago escaped offscreen and all they gave us was a throwaway dialogue line about it?! And that general never comes up again. There was no point to capturing him OR him escaping plotwise.

That's one of the worst offenders, but there are lots of little moments like this that make the game feel disjointed and unfinished overall. They patched the game quite heavily for over a year post-launch, and it's much better now (""better."" The plot is still disjointed). But to a certain extent I don't want to support ""just fix it after"" that as a development practice either.

Loved the main party, it's genuinely one of the most tightly knit ones of the FF games, love teleporting around for combat, had a lot of fun with the game and put over 120 hours into it before I started running out of content. But the plot is told very badly. Just so you know.",1567296142

i originally thought they were more about opposing religions with harmful and oppressive teachings or practices within them 

TST  are not even really speaking up against the other oppressive Abrahamic  religions or even the practice of baby circumcision and  ritual animal  slaughter within them

its no good TST just calling out Christianity when the other Abrahamic religions are no better

also in this old vid Lucien Greaves takes with an ex Muslim about Islam

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op6hr\_txSlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op6hr_txSlE)

Manjaro is definitely not the first rolling release I've used. That honor goes to PCLinuxOS.  I used PCLinuxOS for a very long time, upgrading it at every turn and never had a stability issue. The only reason I left PCLinuxOS was because the maintainer, Texstar, decided not to jump on the KDE Plasma 4 bandwagon when it came along. He foresaw the issues with KDE Plasma 4.0 and didn't want to subject his users to that turmoil, so he decided to stick with KDE 3.5 until Plasma 4.x was stable. I was so used to having everything up to date and I loved KDE, so I decided to leave PCLinuxOS for Ubuntu. Fast forward a little bit and Texstar was right to wait! I would have went back to PCLinuxOS if I hadn't gotten spoiled by Ubuntu/Debian's **huge** repository of applications. 

I realize that, besides having a huge repository of apps to play with, what I really wanted the most was to have the latest and greatest from KDE. There were two distros that gave me both: Manjaro KDE and KDE Neon. I tried Manjaro KDE first, just to get back to a rolling release. However, when the updates started to break, I decided to give Neon a try. KDE Neon is essentially a combination of a stable base release with a rolling desktop release. I just recently decided to give Manjaro a try again for the reasons I listed before.

I updated to the latest kernel (through UKUU) and graphics drivers in KDE Neon on all of my machines and haven't had any stability issues before. I don't know what's going on with Manjaro/Arch. I suspect that there is an issue with the latte-dock package that needs to be fixed.",1567296144

If you're going to keep arguing that a child, baby, fetus, and embryo are all the same, you will gain a lot more traction if you also insist that they deserve ALL the same US rights. Not just the right to nurishment from the mother.

Allow pregnant women to claim their pregnancy as a dependent and recieve tax benefits, child support, and maternity leave from conception, as well as after.

Require that unborn children must still have federal documentation like born children. 

Criminalize any harm done to the unborn child under child abuse.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Exactly which part felt like a unique gameplay experience; the second, third, or fourth required playthrough of a five-sequence endgame with the exact same character, fighting the exact same bosses, with the exact same mechanics? 

This is actually absurd. You're claiming that automata mechanically ""feels like a game you've played before"", in comparison to a game **that literally makes you go through mechanically identical replays of its second half 3 more times**.

Not a new character with new movesets and abilities. Not parts of the old story with new interactive segments mixed in. Not a repetitious interlude with brand new content after it.  No, an actual, straight up, ""play the exact same thing again and this time we'll add subtitles"" experience.

"brexit","t5_33mm8","Glasgow is complicated. Historically its population was a mix of Catholic migrants from ireland and home grown protestants. The religious hatred between the two has taken many forms over the years but the most notable modern incarnation is the persistent violence between the old firm teams - Rangers FC (protestant) and Celtic FC (Catholic).

This hate tends to sublimate in weird ways. The two sides like to sort of 'roleplay' republicans and loyalists to piss each other off. For example, It's not unusual to see Irish flags flown by celtic crowds and union jacks flown by rangers. Note: The union jack is not popular in Scotland where its far more common to fly the saltire (Scotlands complicated relationship with england is a story for another day). 

This may have started off as a few people genuinely demonstrating support for Irish unity. However I 100% guarantee that a massive proportion of both sides were actually old firm hooligans looking for an excuse to fight.

Frankly I think its rich that everyone is wringing their hands and pointing to this now that brexit is a thing. I didn't see the same concern when cunts wrapped in union jack flags were kicking the shit out of wee girls and burning the saltire in front of them on the night after the independence referendum.",1567296150

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","When it comes to autism (being autistic myself), the diagnosis being made on a boy is more common than girls being diagnosed with it. Boys are raised to be vocal about their passions and whatnot, which can lead to some going on detailed tangents about their interests which can be of uncommon ideas/subjects (i.e. a little boy knowing literally everything about something really obscure unlike his neurotypical counterpart who could possibly not know anything about the obscure subject). Meanwhile girls are raised to be quiet about the interests, and from what I‚Äôve seen nowadays, girls tend to have similar interests (i.e. horses, Barbie, Disney, super heroes, etc.) since girls have been raised to only like female targeted things. However, there are cases, like myself, where a girl can have special interests that don‚Äôt fit society‚Äôs standards: for instance even as a toddler, I loved sci-fi, meanwhile sci-fi was more geared towards males (i.e. most crew members of the ship a Star Trek show was focused on were male, the main group of protagonists of the original Star Wars trilogy were mainly male). The argument on how girls are raised compared to how boys are raised is applicable to ADHD, I don‚Äôt have ADHD, so I can‚Äôt really structure an argument for it.

Take all the post-WWII countries that became developed nations: SK, Taiwan, HK, Singapore, Brunei, Saudi Arabia etc. The total population is less than 100 millions, while the combined population of developed nations before WWII is already around 400 millions. Let that sink in for a moment: the population of developed nations grew by 25 ~ 50% at most over 70 years. 

Because of the size of each country is small, they have a small domestic market and have to rely on exporting and competing on the international market. To do that, specialization from the division of labours is inevitable, and all the small countries are cooperating rather than competing with one another.

Now enters China, which will increase the population of the developed nations by 200% at least if it succeeds. 

China does not do **global division of labor** and competes with **every one**. Because of its huge size, it can afford to have **all the industries** and **the entire supply chain** wthin each industry internally to service the domestic market alone.

The animal control officer explained that no, they could not save the raccoon. Long story short, the raccoon was tested and came back positive for rabies. Animal control called the woman to inform her that she needed to bring her dog in for a rabies booster but the woman didn't take her seriously and waited a week. Back and forth, animal control was getting pissed, health department had to get involved, the state veterinary lab had to get involved and she finally brought it in. She was totally nonchalant about the whole thing, she said she gave the dog a bath and thought that would be enough. \*sigh\*

There is definitely an asterisk next to his 2016 Spring title where he played 17 games out of the 52 games SKT played in season + playoffs, not seeing any playtime past the halfway point through the split.  
I personally tend to not consider substitutes who barely get any playtime on the winning team as champions (i.e. promisq being an ""LEC champion"" despite playing only 2 games and losing them). It's obviously subjective but I've chosen to count Bengi's title since he did play a fair amount of games. If you don't, he is then tied with Bang, Wolf, Pray and Khan at 4 LCK championships.

Also the Federalists weren't explicitly the good guys. The anti-feds/DemReps were the original pro-immigrant party for example, and Adams and Hamilton had some authoritarian streaks that I don't know if I want the US endorsing at that stage in its history.",1567296153

"nrl","t5_2qn90","Nathan Brown was not the only one missing in Newcastle on Saturday.

After last week‚Äôs sacking of their coach and subsequent 46-4 flogging from West Tigers that saw their team slammed as soft, the most loyal supporter army in rugby league was nowhere to be seen.

Knights fans reacted to the latest crisis to engulf their club with only 8274 turning out to watch Newcastle attempt to save their season ‚Äî their lowest crowd since 1997 and fourth worst in their history.

A solitary family sat on the McDonald‚Äôs Jones Stadium hill in a sad sight.

On what was supposed to be a day of celebration for the club with Newcastle‚Äôs greatest players honoured as part of Old Boys Day, Mitchell Pearce and Kalyn Ponga were greeted by empty seats and stands.

The silence was deafening.

Not even Danny Buderus could blame bad weather, with the club legend admitting infighting, a sacked coach and a performance Andrew Johns slammed as ‚Äúweak‚Äô‚Äô had combined to turn fans off.

‚ÄúI have no doubt the fans are upset,‚Äô‚Äô club legend Buderus said.

‚ÄúIt has been a tough week for them and I am sure (those events) have contributed.‚Äô‚Äô

The Newcastle no-show should be a major concern for the club that famously averaged a crowd of more than 15,000 people in 2017 when they crashed to the wooden spoon. Not even coming last in both 2015 and 2016 could keep the fans away as the limped their way to a third consecutive spoon.

Driving rain and dark skies no doubt contributed to the worst Newcastle crowd in 22 years. So did the words of Johns with Newcastle‚Äôs favourite son accusing his former club of ‚Äúsabotage‚Äô‚Äô after alleged infighting cost Brown his job.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no coincidence that this hammering happened on the back of what happened during the week,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe way it‚Äôs been handled, is really confusing and disappointing.

‚ÄúThe politics which has gone on behind the scenes ‚Äî you hear whispers of what‚Äôs going on and you‚Äôve gotta shake your head. But what‚Äôs happened now is that it gives people with a weak mind an excuse not to turn up.‚Äô‚Äô

The ground formerly known as Marathon Stadium was not completely empty.

Among the fans that braved the weather and the controversy for the clash against the Gold Coast were some of the club‚Äôs greatest warriors.

Newcastle legends such as Mark Sargent, Tony Butterfield and Michael Hagan were among more than 100 former Knights at the clash to mark ‚Äúold boys‚Äô‚Äô day.

‚ÄúI have been a disappointed observer,‚Äô‚Äô Sargent said after the 38-4 win over the Titans, the competition‚Äôs bottom team.

‚ÄúThe season hasn‚Äôt finished the way I would have liked. The message is for them to stick their heads down and their bums up and play some rugby league.

‚ÄúEveryone asks me what they have to do to get back to that ethos of the club from the early days.

‚ÄúI am no footy coach but it is simple to me. They need to get back to ‚Äúd‚Äô‚Äô. It all starts with defence and that is what we were always good at.

‚ÄúThat is where we have lost our way a little bit. The club needs to have a focus on defence as the rebuild and turning this place back into a fortress.

‚ÄúIt needs to once again become the place nobody wants to come to. People used to fear this place and we need that back.‚Äô‚Äô

The Sunday Telegraph can reveal another ‚Äúold boy‚Äô‚Äô was brought to Newcastle in the lead-up to the clash by caretaker coach Kristian Woolf.

‚ÄúI was lucky enough to be invited to address the team earlier in the week,‚Äô‚Äô said dual premiership-winning Knight Billy Peden.

‚ÄúI told them I bled for the place and that is what they need to do.‚Äô‚Äô

Peden used stories of the past in attempt to inspire the Knights after the week of controversy.

‚ÄúI told them about the old boys and what they mean,‚Äô‚Äô Peden said.

‚ÄúAbout all the tough people that have been at this club. There are a few of them in the new team that haven‚Äôt been here before and this is there first year.

‚ÄúIt was a good opportunity to tell them about the history.

‚ÄúThey have heard a fair bit about that performance from everyone. We all have bad performances here and there and it can‚Äôt become the norm. I think they are all aware of that. It is about what happens now and moving forward, not back.

‚ÄúThat sort of thing can‚Äôt happen again. I looked into the eyes of the boys and I saw a bit of steel.‚Äô‚Äô

Dean Smith, 39, had been a Knights fans since day one. The Kurri Kurri resident braved the weather to watch on as the Knights kept their season alive by flogging the Titans.

‚ÄúI attend every game rain, hail or shine,‚Äô‚Äô Smith said.

‚ÄúRegardless of what is going on we show up. This is the town‚Äôs club and we will rise again. We can see that it is hurting the boys too and they are playing for a bit of pride.

‚ÄúNothing will keep us down and the club will always bounce back.‚Äô‚Äô",1567296154

Few suggestions!  

Remove your back seats, even if bolted down. Lay a layer of gym floor matting down followed by a really nice 4"" mattress topper, feel free to cut it all to fit! Then use a room darkening curtain or a light sheet on a tension curtain rod to make a ""canopy"". This is better than blocking your windows which is very obvious. With the canopy the car looks normal but looking down and into the car you only see the blanket or curtain. Which just looks like you are blocking view of your belongings. Also, I recommend emergency poop bags and bottles for urine (if female buy a device with a funnel to help). Try to use the bathroom in the stores but sometimes it's an emergency. Keep your windows cracked, maybe get those car wind deflectors. For winter, get a mummy sleeping bag! 

I sound experienced because I am, saved tons of money in a short period of time so I could get debt free. Ask me if you need any other advice.",1567296154

Two years later, terrorists managed to bring down both towers of the empire state building, and hit the pentagon.  The resulting reaction by the government led this country down a disastrous rabbit hole or war  which continues to this day.

This isnt a judgement on your whole sub, or guns/weapons in general. Its purely that I believe college students shouldn't have to be armed at college as a matter of course.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; You would be wrong. There is escape from* ideology, it is called skepticism. By using a skeptical epistemology we can ascertain factual knowledge. 

This might sound strange, but I don't believe in objective truth or morality. Anything that humans call truth is simply our perception of reality. I'm not bullshitting you.

&gt; Buddhism is predicated on not believing things that disagree with your common sense, and on not believing anything so willfully you will kill or die for it. Thereby, your argument falls apart. Can Buddhism be said to have motivated those monks in 1930's Japan? No, not unless you can prove it by doctrine. 

Again, we are operating from different views on ideology. I hold a much more broad view of what can be considered ideology, while you hold that ideology is only what exists in a canon. Not really sure where to go from here, if you disagree with me about this then that's fine.

&gt; There are Buddhists, and there is Buddhism.

You could say the same about Feminism and Gender Critical Feminists, and yet we still classify them as Feminists even though they go against the central principles of Feminism. 

&gt; I appreciate your honesty, and I apologize for my own former condescension, but accusing anyone's religion of genocide when you're nearly fully ignorant of it is a touch triggering itself.

Sorry about that, I tend to get into a certain mindset when arguing about religion on /r/atheism and I apologize. 

&gt; It's a point I tend to agree with, however, when that ideology expressly, consistently, and routinely admonishes against a thing and they do it anyway, what possibly causal link is there between the actor and the ideology? 

In the Pali Canon this may be true, but we have gone over two examples now of Buddhists not expressly, consistently and routinely following the non-violent aspects of their religion. Again, it doesn't matter what a book says about how an ideology should be conducted by it's followers, all that matters are the actions people do in real life in the name of said ideology. **I do not think that you can separate ideology from the followers of said ideology in the way that you want to.** If we use your definition of ideology then you are logically correct, but I am not operating under your definition of ideology, and I have laid out my thoughts on ideology in this and previous comments.

&gt; In 1981 John Hinkcley, Jr. tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan because he thought Jodie Foster would be impressed with him. Jodie Foster is not responsible for that, we agree on this?

I agree because in this instance Jodie Foster did nothing to motivate John Hinkcley Jr. other than existing. However, the toxic misogynistic culture present in the United States during this time can be said to be partially to blame for this.

On less than 3hrs of bad sleep, [this morning's temp belongs in the LP](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/C_e_baby/) (very decidedly), not the FP. And like... I can't rule out ovulation yesterday. But I think it was more likely I ovulated today. But I can't know now. And, given that I was due to ovulate today, tomorrow's temp will do absolutely zilch to confirm or deny ovulation today, because I expect it to be in my LP range regardless.

That's obnoxious.

Ugh.

Also seriously? CD12 ovulation maybe? Ovaries, why you gotta do me like that? We did *not* hit all the best days for FW because I thought the best days would be a bit later than they turned out to be.

After DevBio linked that super cool Nature paper about women's actual cycles, I feel even more of a weirdo - ovulating normally between CD11-15 (CD13 and 14 most common) with a 15-16day LP makes me an outlier. Wtf. I thought I was pretty average. Turns out my cycle is weird. Great.

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","Comments directed towards thin people and comments directed towards fat people don‚Äôt carry the same weight (lol excuse the pun) because being thin is still considered positive and attractive. 

Jokes should ‚Äúpunch up‚Äù not ‚Äúpunch down‚Äù. That is, people can laugh about people in ‚Äúbetter‚Äù positions, relative to them (the poor can make fun of the middle class, the middle class can make fun of the rich, the rich shouldn‚Äôt make fun of the poor, everyday people can make fun of politicians, etc.)

Like, if I was a dick and kept saying to a tall person ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the weather like up there hurr hurr‚Äù, and other things that poked fun at his tallness, but then he turned around and made a jab at my shortness, it‚Äôs not necessarily tit-for-tat. 

He can reach things and I can‚Äôt. His body objectively has better functionality than mine so my joke about him is (annoying, unnecessary and unfunny but) less offensive than his joke about mine. And of course it is rooted in my jealousy of his height. 

Same when fat people joke about thin people‚Äôs bodies. It‚Äôs someone in a less functional body making fun of someone in a more functional body. Just enjoy your more functional body and laugh off the comment. 

(FYI while I am insecure about how short I am there is actually nothing ‚Äúmedically wrong‚Äù with my height, had a paediatrician confirm that I was within the expected height range given the heights of my parents, who are both short. Unfortunately unlike weight, can‚Äôt do much about my height except get used to perpetually wearing high heels).",1567296160

That‚Äôs because reading/watching anime or manga and analyzing the plot is perfectly normal, just like reading a novel or watching a movie.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I mean to be fair...it's all about the game of average. If you go to a bar and scope it out. You may see anywhere from 10 to 20 women...depending of the size of the bar and the day. 

So lets say you see 20 women, of those 20, at least one in 5 is bound to talk to you. Guarantee it. You just have to figure out which one, which sucks dick...but hey getting a few rejections before the landing is necessary...then you also have body language to consider...if a woman is clearly looking your way and you two smile while exchanging eye contact...that is a clear sign to approach. There is also your own body language. If you have your head down and just have this grim look...no woman is going to want to talk to you...that just screams lack of confidence and beleive me, women can spot that from a mile away...so if you just actually look confident you might have better luck. 

Also figure out your best physical features and dress accordingly. I can't give good examples here but surely you must have a wardrobe of sum sorts. 

Also when you approach a woman, actually be creative and say something she wouldn't normally hear. Don't be creepy about but just put some thought into what you are going to say if you feel like you can approach a women. 

Also don't be afraid to go for the ""not so appealing"" one. Sure she might not appeal to you but chances are she lacks confidence just like you so she is more likely to talk to you and also, you would make her day, boost her confidence, and when you take her on that dance floor, other women are gonna see that and be like, ""well shit."" At that point, you have their attention at least. 

But hey at that point I would just take the woman I danced with home cause who knows, maybe she might be cool. Also I am not an asshole like that personally but I have seen guys do that and then ditch the first woman for the one they want. It's shitty but it works. 

This is all if you decide to go to a bar. Play the sum of Average game, know that it's not the end of the world if you get rejected, and just be confident. 

(P.S. I agree that dating apps suck and yes it seems that most woman seem like they don't want to be bothered but let me tell you secret, women want to pick up men just as much as men want to pick up women. They are just lowkey about it compared to men. Most women at bars want to go home with a guy and if any of them say otherwise, they are lying to you. Even women that get together for a girl's night, I guarantee that at least one of them is looking to hook but is shy to try on her own so she goes out with her lady friends to feel more secure. You can meet women if you put affort...and yes dating suck but I two people who met their spouses on Tinder so it can work...again you just gotta try and if your fed up with dating apps, the bar scene might be right for you) 

Also dating in the workplace is not a good idea if you want to make it your career. There can be some serious ramifications so keep that in mind.",1567296164

&gt;I don‚Äôt dislike people of any religion. I dislike people who claim to follow a religion and then don‚Äôt follow any of its teachings, and I dislike people who refuse to recognize how much harm their religion had done and is currently doing. But if you follow your religion, and you can recognize it‚Äôs harm without excusing that harm or claim that it‚Äôs not as bad as it really is/was, then I have no issue.

Oh here we go, please tell me more about the near impossible standards Christians are held to because it's somehow only in Christianity that every follower is expected to be a literal saint or else they're a hypocrite.  Just so you know, the entire premise of following the teachings of Jesus is that humanity is flawed and it is only through god's forgiveness that we can be saved.  It's literally a religion FOR SINNERS.  Everyone that walks into church on Sunday morning is a work in progress and the ONLY reason that any good comes from being part of Christianity is from god.  Besides, people today have misconstrued Jesus's message of love and compassion into one of ""if you aren't okay with EVERY SINGLE THING EVERYONE DOES you're a bad person"".  It's totally wrong.

The GVLDEN RETRIEVER doesn't worry about silly things like ""red flags"" and ""children"" and ""boob size"" and ""weight""; They see a tight, wet opening, they stick their dick in it, it feels good so they keep on going. They pound into your girlfriend with such force she is moaning, begging for more doggy cock. She is damn near pissing herself, but the GVLDEN RETRIEVER doesn't stop. His knot swells. Your girlfriend, mind blanked by orgasmic bliss, is bound to the GOLDEN BVLL for up to an hour while his Chad knot shrinks down, and her vaginal muscles milk every drop of GVLDEN RETRIEVER spunk. She will never look at you the same way again. Sex doesn't feel the same. She is ""tired"" most nights, yet you can hear the whimpering and moans from the bathroom when she takes Sparky in the bathroom to ""take a shit with company"". She tells you to go in the other room and ""jerk it or something"". You are ashamed. You are weak. You are crushed. But she will never love you again. Sparky plays with his chew toy.

Her stomach is swelling. That is strange, you think, as you two haven't had sex in about 4 months and you had just gotten a vasectomy, per [r/childfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree) advice. She tells you it's hormones, but you see the worry in her eyes, the fear lying behind her nonchalant expression. Fucking Sparky, looks up at you and almost smiles. The fucking MUTT, having the nerve to smile at you. In a time like this? Why are you so fucking angry at this dog? What did he do?

5 more months has passed. The ""bump"" on her stomach is huge now. You worry it may be a freak-case tumor or something of the like, but you now are pretty sure she cheated on you at some point. With who? When? But most importantly, why? Sparky looks at you again, but this time, his face is blank. He shits on the floor.

It is now obvious she's in labor. She decided against going to the hospital, for reasons you were unsure of. Probably read a Reddit post on tub births or something. In any case, she is in pain, and you are doing as much as you can to help her birth the baby, even though you just know it isn't yours. That's okay though. When you find out who the father is you will kill them. How could he do this to your girlfriend? Why did she let him? Where is he? What is his race? Is his cock bigger tha-

The baby is born. Or, rather, 6 babies are born? They are... furry. And yellow. And their ears are quite large. Holy shit. The fucking dog. Sparky. They look just like him! Except, they have human characteristics. They are grotesque to look at, you are sick to your stomach. You want to scream, to cry, to beg her to kill them, but she doesn't. She isn't doing much of anything actually. Just staring at them, with cold, dead eyes. She holds two up to her swollen breasts. They suckle, and whimper. They are alive.

Were you in a geographic area that prohibits ""out-of-network"" medical care vendors that are operating a separate business within ""in-network"" facilities from balance billing emergency medical care customers?

 If you were, the vendor *probably* would have eventually taken the $xxxx amount this/your insurance seller offered as reimbursement and that's the end of the vendor's billing attempts toward you. Because the other option is the same $0 from the insurance seller as the $0 from you.

If you weren't in a geographic area with balance billing protections for emergency medical care customers you can contact the vendor if you can figure out who it was and have more than a billing entity's PO Box to go on, and ask if you have a balance due.

&gt;My parents say to wait it out and that they'll find a way to contact me.

True. They'll do that by selling their receivables to a 3rd party medical debt buyer and the debt buyer will contact you.",1567296164

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","the evolutionary lineage of Giraffes is actually fascinating to look at. We know that giraffes essentially had longer necks, but when the world warmed up around the time the great old world apes descended from the trees into the plains of africa, that trees also went through major evolutionary changes. The co-evolution of flora and fauna is absolutely fascinating to research. 10/10 recommend. But essentially, when the umbrella trees of the plains of africa began to rise up to avoid their leaves being eaten by the newcomers from the former arboreal niches, the early ungulates with longer necks began to diverge into a new species that selected for this trait while others saw different adaptations, much like Darwin's finches.",1567296167

Ammonia build up causes severe confusion and you would be combative, unable to reason or make sense at all.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","It isn‚Äôt great. As others have said, any time you feel down or depressed or defeated, there‚Äôs no one to talk to. On the other side of that, if you ever have an incredible day or you got to experience something that made you feel excited and happy, there‚Äôs no one to share that with. If you ever get sick, you‚Äôre on your own.

There were two car acing series I used to follow religiously, and I remember when there would be an amazing race where something totally unexpected happened, or someone made a huge come from behind win, or I felt like penalties called during the race were unfair and frustrating, there was never anyone to share any of that with. Just had to go to work the next day and keep all of the positive and negative emotions to myself.

I used to have a best friend a few years ago that I was able to meet up with every Monday evening for coffee, we would chat almost daily, both of us worked for the same car manufacturer so we would be able to relate and share ideas and frustrations together. Without having that outlet, everything just gets bottled up. I don‚Äôt even look forward to weekends anymore. Now, anytime I‚Äôm in a position to make friends at an event for something I‚Äôm passionate about, I just keep to myself because I feel like no one would want to be my friend anyway.

It also makes those greetings ‚ÄúHey, how are you doing?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow was your weekend?‚Äù weigh so... so heavy. That‚Äôs the closest I get to someone peeking inside my life and being like ‚Äúhey, you okay? something you‚Äôd like to talk about?‚Äù and knowing all they want to hear is ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm great!

"malelivingspace","t5_2v70p","&gt;Think a tan leather chaise sofa with blue pillows would be a good fit?

That was my fist thought but that would be out of your price range I would expect to pay over 3 grand for one that was well made and comfortable. I would encourage you to go with a dark blue sofa with light woolen/tan pillows and throw and maybe a large tan leather ottoman, and the bench and consider that to be your under 2 k .

I'm doing a little floor plan based on the dimensions guessed from the photos, yes, that was basically what I gathered was your layout.

The biggest mistake that novices make is to not use a tape measure, a tape measure and color wheel is to a decorate what a baseball and glove is to a catcher. I don't expect you to know how to use a color wheel, but you need to measure before you purchase anything.

I am guessing they have a 74"" sofa and there isn't much more room than that from the photos. Google [74"" sleeper chaise blue](https://www.google.com/search?q=74%22+sleeper+chaise+BLUE&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the style update, that will make it easier.

If you can right now, ring up some local furniture stores and ask if they have a 74"" sleeper sofa with a left hand (window side) chaise in blue. Then go look at it sit on it and make a note if you like it or not.

I'm going to post this now, but I will add to it below this line in a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: continued.

I am going to encourage you to try and measure the distance in that space where the sofa is, right now if you can get in there. Because this is maybe the major weekend for furniture sales (Labor Day) and a great time to buy a sofa. There will be many sales on Monday that may or may not extend beyond. It would be a good time to shop as well, I ran across many sales on line. and take a tape measure with you when you shop. Seriously furniture stores will fuck up measurements just so you buy it.

I am not finding a lot of chase sofas in 74"" and I am hoping an 84 might just squeeze in.

Here is what I ran across

[Hephzibah Reversible Sleeper Sectional](https://www.allmodern.com/furniture/pdp/zipcode-design-hephzibah-reversible-sleeper-sectional-a000491080.html?piid=829809868) is 84"" comes in blue, $559.99 42% Off $969.99 AllModern

[Bozeman Reversible Sleeper Sectional](https://www.allmodern.com/furniture/pdp/bozeman-reversible-sleeper-sectional-a000642831.html?piid=281156836), 84"" I like the grey  $619.99 44% Off $1,109.99 AllModern.

LABOR DAY SALE (ends Thursday) up to 30% off\* + an EXTRA 10% OFF\* WITH CODE: LABORYAY10 online, Ashley Has local stores to try out the furnishings. It looks like the best one for the price.

[FRIHETEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S69297560/) Sleeper sectional,3 seat w/storage, Skiftebo blue $599.00, has 3rd party slip covers But it's just over 90"" wide. see the [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwjFD6romAY).

I do not suggest overstock, the company is cwap. The contact and help is where they save you money: the customer care doesn't. overstock review.

Now with the bookcase, I made a mistake. I thought there was an easy option for a 4 seating dining and after looking closer there isn't just for a pull out desk (which is still an option)

I liked the idea of a cube bookcase repeating the square transom windows, and I know some come with desk variants.

Instead I would like to see a bookcase, or set of two or three and a dining table pushed up to it when fewer than 4 are dining, that could be used as a desk. The space ""looks big enough for a dinning table, but not much. You could try a round table, which doesn't look as big when not in use, I fear that a square or rectangle table would dominate the entire space.

So that is why I made the suggestions I did, It really depends on the exact measurements. We like to have 3' between the edge of the wall and the table top for dining.

I am suggesting you get the smallest rectangle table possible for 4 person: 48"" long by 30-34"" wide. Then use it as a desk or console table when not dining and pull out [the bench](https://www.google.com/search?q=modern+upholstered+bench&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch) for two people's seating, and have two dinning/upholstered side chairs for the other two pieces.

If I didn't make clear, the current two club chairs do not work, They would work less with a chaise sofa, they don't have enough room and crowd out the entrance to the bedroom. An upholstered bench would create a better sight line and make that corner seem less crowded. It is possible you could fit two small round swivel chairs instead.

Room and Board has the Otis swivel chair in indigo or grey, or any of the Maxton textured at $800 ea, They have a low back and are 32"" wide, probably narrower than the current chairs.

&amp;#x200B;

Their are also the [office type](https://www.google.com/search?q=dervish+swivel+chair&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch) usually not cheaper but you might find something like that used on Craig's List or at Reuse stores searching for swivel chair, you don't want desk chairs.

Another option would be looking at bucket dinning chairs.

West Elm had the [Quilted Tub Chair](https://www.westelm.com/products/quilted-tub-dining-chair-h2145/), that was the perfect size and height.

Again from Ashley are [Centiar dinning chairs](https://www.ashleyfurniture.com/p/centiar-dining-room-chair/D372-01.html) in brown, at  $90.00 Sale Price $53.99 each ($107.98 set)

This compares to the [Milania](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Milania-Leather-Dining-Chair/dp/B00A50Q324) (corrective grain) Leather at Amazon, $126 for two in white.

Or the [Giantex Leisure Armchairs](https://www.amazon.com/Giantex-Leisure-Armchairs-Leather-Reception/dp/B07CZBCN98/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=tan+leather+dining+chair&amp;qid=1567308719&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sr=1-4) PU Leather composite, sturdy? at $155,

You might find something you like in leather at [Amazon,](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tan+leather+dining+chair&amp;i=garden&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1) but mostly I'm finding faux.

[Hennessy Upholstered Dining Chair](https://www.allmodern.com/furniture/pdx/hennessy-upholstered-dining-chair-wlsg1388.html) in brown @ Allmodern $175.99 was $599.00 71% Off, Is insanely priced for the hand stitched quality and should last you a life time. It may seem pricey, but if you save on the sofa these chairs would be a stand out. They are certainly classic modern and won't last at that price, Of all the chairs I looked at tonight, these are the ones I would buy on impulse.

In summery, my picks are two of the Hennesy chairs (last above) and the blue Hephzibah sofa (first in the list) if you have 84"" to work with for a total of $1322, leaving you room for accessories, lamps, etc. I think that is good on your budget.

Last, [here are the plans I drew up](https://imgur.com/a/NnkMROC). I would be surprised if the dimensions are too far off. mostly this is just the lounge and dining.

For the bedroom I was suggesting, I'm going to have to comment more on that later, as well as curtains.",1567296176

We had sex in a few rooms including the kitchen, their sofa and their shower but not on their bed, he took me to a spare bedroom instead.

My name is Elizabeth (07/26/1996) I am currently in a stressful situation where I felt that I had to move out of my stepfather‚Äôs residence, as I won‚Äôt be open about things in my life (Joseph, 10/14/1960) I don‚Äôt want to be secretive, but he can be quick to judge, and becomes angry with me when I don‚Äôt tell him things. It‚Äôs just that the way he reacts (thinks crystals and tarot cards are evil and that I shouldn‚Äôt use them) makes very sad and unhappy. He gets angry when I don‚Äôt do things that he demands me to. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that due to trauma and how he reacts, I‚Äôm unable to open up with him yet and that I don‚Äôt want to live in a way that goes against my beliefs. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, as I‚Äôm currently staying with family members who I feel are careless and bad hosts, which makes me feel unsupported. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be an easy way out of this situation. I try really hard to be kind and explain things to my stepfather, but due to external stresses in his life, he‚Äôs become angry a lot. 

Is there any way to heal this relationship so that I can move back in? Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",1567296177

Other terms that come up in psychological writing related to it are caretaking and self-abandonment.

A more abstract concept that I'm really in love with because it covers so many weird relationship dynamics is that this can be a form of projective identification.  It's one way that a person who doesn't trust others to stick around and care for them can disown their own excessively vulnerable needs, imagine placing them in the other person on a very child-like and mostly subconscious level, and then try to control those feelings of care and availability in the other person.  It's generally not overtly clear that this is going on, but you might be able to infer it.  If the ""codependent"" person gets more agitated as you get closer to saying something that might point out a dynamic like this, that could be one sign.  Another is that if you succeed at guessing and verbally acknowledging the apparent need in their behavior, like ""it must be hard to find people who can give you as much caring back as you give to others"", the behavior and the apparent need behind it may temporarily die down.",1567296179

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A
 little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your
 career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet
 technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told
 us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make
 too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you
 surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe
 I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady.
 Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky,",1567296181
"UCSC","t5_2r3oq","Well, make an appointment for the DMV in Santa Cruz, and give yourself some time to study (or just go in like an hour to 30 minutes before they close, you'll get seen). You have to just take the written test and pass at like an 80/85%. I know this bc I was too stubborn about all the rules before you turn 18, to which yes you would have to be driving for sometime before you could take the test. But assuming you're over 18, you honestly have to take the written test, pass, and you will be given a permit which will allow you to drive with someone else who has a license present. You can find the booklet with all the rules and information online. You can also take a few practice tests if you google ""California DMV written test"".

Even if everything was put off until the very last second to give the child the best chance at survival the mother would still survive more often and the risks would still be greatest for the infant. This doesn't mean that we're valuing of life more than the other it simply means that there is no viable way to both maximise the good outcomes (saving as many lives as possible) while equalizing the risks.

Steal and modify some quests from the Cata revamp of, especially, the incomplete and borderline dead zones from Vanilla. Maybe add just a few more graveyards to each zone.  Fix pet pathing. Basically, fix classes and specs that to anyone's assessment were just straight bad, finish quest content that clearly was abandoned because of the time constraints in the development of Vanilla, and add just a couple QoL additions.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Sword coast... I feel like it makes more sense when you realize it's a hyper-focused slice of a larger setting that isn't touched upon all that much. It'd be like if Golarion was focused entirely on one country. 

So the same world with Sword Coast has places like Al Quadim (a sort of Arabian Nights area with a radically different magic system due to genies sort-of monopolizing magic in the area,) Mulsantir (A dark fantasy land of barbarians ruled by witches and hag covens,) the Underdark (A vast underground labyrinth of evil creatures with occasional quirky allies like beetle people and flumphs) and Chult (A King Kong-esque Lost World full of dinosaurs and african-inspired empires.) The Sword Coast and Neverwinter proper are just sort of the most generic Tolkieniesque fantasy section. So it's kind of like, the Sword Coast as the generic setting is rather boring, but the Forgotten Realms itself is really interesting.

But I get what you mean though. Golarion presents a bunch of wild ideas and lets you sort of pick the ones that appeal to you. I'm a big fan of that northern area based on Russian folklore, with walking huts and monster races like Winter Wolves walking the streets. I'm also a big fan of the Mana Wastes... Oh, and that one half-orc colony is super clever too. There's something to be said about having a lot of modular variety, for sure.",1567296185

Cersei still fantasises about him sometimes even though she's with Jaime (who is staggeringly beautiful himself -- weird incest aside).

People tend to be attracted to those who are roughly as good-looking as they are (not an ironclad rule by any means, but a rule of thumb all the same) and Cersei herself is said to be gorgeous. Even so, she makes the incredibly foolish decision of making Aurane Waters her new Master of Ships because he *reminds* her of Rhaegar. She even tells herself that Aurane only resembles Rhaegar, but that's enough to influence her decision making.

Cersei was used to being the most beautiful woman in *any* court in her youth, so if a dude could affect her in such a manner he must have been mesmerising -- granted she's romanticised him a bit because their betrothal fell apart and he's now dead and therefore unobtainable.

Maybe (if R+L=J) she'd feel a weird connection to Jon if she ever laid eyes upon him.

Rhaegar had the total package for a king on paper: beautiful, charismatic and intelligent, but it all fell apart just the same. It just goes to show you that even if you're dealt pocket aces, if you don't play your hand well and the other cards don't go your way, you can end up with nothing in the end.",1567296185

* The novel adaptations of the films (eg: Matthew Stover's *Revenge of the Sith* novel) that were released prior to April 25, 2014 are only canon where they align 100% to what was on-screen in the films
* The LEGO Freemaker series are their own thing and not part of the larger Star Wars continuity

Any shows, books, comics, short stories published after the aforementioned date would be considered ""canon.""",1567296185

Some Arab countries approve of honour killings.

Viking societies approved of murder depending on your status and who you murdered.

Spartan society allowed one night to murder anyone who was a potential problem.

What kind of society did you grow up in, may I ask?

&gt;That sounds like war.

Not if it happens over decades. You might not be alive and the society at that point would have a majority approval, assuming it is still a democracy. As much as I have some faith in humanity, I am not blind to the possibility that society could legalize a one night purge. Ancient Sparta did it...who says it can't happen again?

&gt;What about rational thought?

Rational thought does not equal moral thought. Rational thought is based on logic or reason not good or bad. Morality influences those rational thoughts. A man who has the opportunity to get a promotion through connection at the detriment of another may rationalize that that promotion would help him pay off debt faster and help his family be more better off (now he can send his son through medical school) while not taking the promotion would still leave him in a good place. Meanwhile the other who deserved the promotion because he was hard working and did well loses his child because he needed the promotion to help pay for an expensive medicine that would cure the child. How do you approach this situation purely from rational thought?

Morality extends to more than just murder, even though I like to use the most extreme example to try to wake people up. Other societies find it rational and logical to divorce their wives because they didn't make dinner right, which divorce means cultural disowning and poverty, potentially prostitution for survival. Where do we draw the line? With the people in a society...who change every generation.

&gt;That's different from killing ""anybody you don't like."" And I don't even think anyone except maybe a few fringe groups thinks like that.

I'm drawing attention to the extent that depravity takes people. Get enough of them as a majority in a society and monstrous acts become legalized. Abortion is already legalized in many states and in Canada. Why is it rational to murder any innocent, unborn child on the grounds of inconvenience? If the murder of the unborn is legalized, if euthanasia is legal, what's next? Parents are already aborting children with down syndrome or other genetic anomalies. Where do we draw the line?

&gt;I'm not and I don't see why anyone else has to.

No matter how you look at it, without a law greater than the agreement of society, anything can be legalized and anything can become illegal. A moral standard is *needed*.",1567296187

I‚Äôd compare the sensory and sensation I feel when eating that sandwich. That‚Äôs my own subjective view on the sensory details I‚Äôm experiencing. Another good one I literally just saw was in Naruto. Pain/Nagato thought that Itachi was going to use his Amaterasu Jutsu against Naruto because he felt that same feeling before when Itachi used it in the past. He didn‚Äôt predict it based on the current situation and the overall concept of the use of the Jutsu (Ni), but based on how he felt when Itachi uses Amaterasu.

"artificial","t5_2qhfb","Virtually nothing in the real world has one single cause. Of course, it's a ""contributing factor"" and probably a big one. As for work hours, everyone knows that means squat. Government employees may ""work"" 8 hours a day (based on clocking in and clocking out) but that doesn't at all mean they are as productive as someone working even 4 hours on an assembly line at a factory. The only way the ""pie grows"" is if there are more people who need services/goods and are willing/able to pay for them. Ironically, beyond a sweet spot, as populations get larger, people tend to get poorer. 

Say you have one really good plumber who charges $X an hour for his services servicing a list of 100 people; the only way for an equally good plumber to be able to charge the same amount in a sustainable way is if there are now 200 people in that community and the other guy doesn't get better or find some way to take on more clients.

"flytying","t5_2sfbh","Oh man...this is potentially a very serious rabbit hole...

There are really 2 choices.  The first choice is a kit. This is a good way to introduce yourself.  Most kits will have a few basic patterns that are useful to most trout fly anglers.  The cost of entry is usually less than $100.  If you are committed to fly tying, you will almost inevitably upgrade your vise, get a couple extra bobbins, and invest in more materials than you will need.  This is the lowest cost of entry, but probably not the best long-term value

The second choice is to buy a good vise, a tool kit, and the materials for 5-10 flies that you use (and lose) all the time.  This is a more expensive investment, but will bring better long term value to your fly fishing, and overall better value to your actual time on the water.  Just beware, trout dry flies can be a very expensive investment.

So, depending on how well you intend to stick to your hobbies, this sub can give advice on how best to proceed.

Good luck",1567296189

What's the point of epic items when you get them everywhere? What's the point of going for something when catchup mechanics make it the everyone will get it one month later as well? Everything is so streamlined and soft on retail that many prefer the ""bare bone mechanics"". Leveling for most classes was actually difficult and a challenge. It was actual game content. On retail it's just a drag past the first time. Leveling on retail is basically playing a story. Which, once you know it, gets dull. You don't feel stronger with leveling up. You don't open up new areas by leveling up.

Some quality of life features are definitely missing in classic wow. Some things are just unfair and unbalanced. But at some point blizzard just went way overboard with the handholding.

I'm in the U.K and for some reason is seems to be very rare around here (south west England).  Crack is very popular though - it hardly existed here 10 years ago (just cocaine then) but the county lines phenomena has exported crack down here. I have heard the rush from meth cannot be beaten so I am somewhat glad it is not easy to get around here because if it was in front of me I would not trust myself not to at least try it.

You mentioned everything is on auto and you enabled XMP.  I have a strong feeling xmp might be pumping upwards of 1.35v VccSA/VccIO, which is almost always unnecessary.  The excess SA/IO voltage could be one reason why you are getting so much heat.  The other reason is because you may need to reseat the cooler/paste again/tighten cooler screws if they are loose.

First, I recommend opening up hwinfo64 and see what your vccsa/vccio voltages are at.  If they are anywhere near 1.35v, I recommend manually tuning both.  What frequency is the ram kit are you using and how many sticks is it?

If vccio/vccsa is at a reasonable level, then proceed by seeing if the screws can be tightened a little on the cooler.  If they were loose, tighten, then test again.

Last thing on the list is repasting and reseating the cooler and testing again.",1567296191

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","It's not pointless because the question now has an answer. It's *leave like this* or remain.

The original ""leave"" was so fuzzy some people were voting to leave but stay a member of the single market, some wanted customs union, some wanted hard no ties brexit.

Many wanted things totally impossible like no free movement but to still be in the single market.

Yet we can only do ONE of those. Which so people want? You don't know. Because that wasn't the vote.

How many people ticked that box wanted to leave *at absolutely all costs*? How many people would prefer to remain than fall out with no deal, but still want to leave and be in the customs union?

A second vote asking ""remain or leave"" like the first one doesn't make sense, you're right. We're still in this mess if the vote is leave.

But a second vote that's ""THIS deal, or remain""? That answers the question.

And if people HAVE changed their minds, WHY still leave? Just out of... I don't know, duty? Spite? Do something people actually don't want because they did at some point? It just seems silly.

At the end of the summer last year, I found four pairs of the C9 stuff on the clearance rack at Target for 70% off. Totally worth it.

Probably one of the most off the rails and unleashed anime there is.  Its beyond crazy and nonsensical and because of that you really never know whats going to happen next.  It just keeps busting into other tiers of story every few eps and it just pulls it off really well.  

For those that dont know, this is an anime about a model who grew up dreaming of becoming a superhero, but in our modern day and age, there is no reason for superheroes to exist.  But he still decides to put together a hero suit and go fight crime at night, even though hes just a guy in a suit with no abilities and very little combat capabilities.  The story follows him on his quest to be a Hero.

Shining a light on survivors of abuse, showing evidence Ollie is a criminal, on and on, yet it is all about her,   we must continue to speak out against Ollie by showing of facts, letting others know of the many people he caused great harm to.   btw GREAT VIDEOS, awesome job!! &lt;3   sometimes it takes a small group of caring people to bring about  the greatest change.  Every thing we speak of on here is in the hopes to protect other survivors, before they fall prey to Ollie's abuse like so many already have, we are here to support the revictimized/retraumatized from the savages",1567296199

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Bee Movie Script
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A
 little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your
 career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet
 technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told
 us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make
 too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you
 surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe
 I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady.
 Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky,

He wants Jess out.

If Jess stays, Nicole and Cliff can easily turn on Jackson/Holly during the DE and side with Jess to create an easy threesome to get to the F2 with.

Keeping Christie/Tommy allows those two to continue to be a force Nicole (and by proxy Cliff) want to get out before getting out one of Jackson and Holly.

Jess fucking sucks physically but she's an easy person to drag to the end and good at mental comps.

While his reasons for getting Jess out are dumb (he doesn't realize how close Tommy and Christie are), it's Snackson's best move to keep himself safe during the DE.",1567296199

"YangForPresidentHQ","t5_j1rvz","Good question!

Rising prices are typically associated with inflation - which is when the value of the dollar (or any dollar on Earth) becomes lower, making the need for more dollars a necessary thing.

Inflation has been seen numerous times in countries that go into debt suddenly, and are forced to pay it back. Their solution would be to print more money, easy right? Wrong. The value plummets if you just print tons of money, resulting in inflation.

Yang will simply add a tax on corporations and overlap from existing government programs to recirculate the money, not print more. So basically, Yang doesn't want to print more money, he wants to use the money we already have by forcing it to be circulated.

However, it might not look good when they review your SF86 prior to releasing it to NBIB that you disclose drug use on the SF86 but not on their form.  However, they can't fire you for that.  NISPOM 2-202A says they will review your SF86 for thoroughness and completeness, and they can't fire you for not disclosing something.

AITA for losing a homeless, mentally-ill woman's valuables?

ME:  56, Male, White, homeowner

About 2 months ago, a homeless, mentally-ill woman appeared in my neighborhood located in a working-class suburb of a very large city.

After a week or so of sleeping on the sidewalks and staircases by local businesses, she began to talk to herself loudly, sit in puddles of urine, and pick through trash-making a general mess wherever she went.

In this state she broke into a neighbor's home, ate some food, and urinated on the floor.  She was still there when my neighbor returned home after work...scared the crap out of my neighbor, poor gal.

The police take the homeless woman away and she's gone for a couple days but returns, so one day I find her up by my house in my driveway...urinating.  I run her out of there and call the cops who give her a trespass warning nearby.

Apparently before I had spied her by my home, she had hidden two small hand-bags filled with her documents and family photos.  

I found the bags a week later.  I was scared of possible lice/fleas/bedbugs and I wanted NOTHING TO DO with the bags or the mentally-ill woman.  So I put them on the public sidewalk about 25 ft down from my property line.  By that night, they were gone.

Well about a week after that, I get a knock on the door and it's a ""social worker"" from a nearby church which has taken in the homeless woman.  She asks about the bags and pointedly asks if I know anything about them.  I lie and tell her ""no"" and that's where it's been left.

Now I'm getting crap from my family and some friends.  My family second-guesses my decision to put the bags on the sidewalk.  My friends criticize my treatment of the  so-called ""poor"" homeless woman in general.

I'm not responsible for her stuff and, as I stated above, I want nothing to do with her.  

Living on the street isn't doing her any good, why don't the police do something?  They just charge her with some petty misdemeanor and she's out in 48 hours...even after breaking into a house!

So I feel I was justified in running her off of my property and having her trespassed...SHE BROKE INTO MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.

So what do you think?

Is it possible to tear muscle from bone? Sure. But your strength would fail you before you do that. More likely is to dislocate something because joints are the weak spots. I've seen ego lifts pop shoulders out of sockets, leg presses fold a knee and bicep curls tear an elbow tendon. The most common injuries are over exerting leading to joint or tendon damage, which requires a lot of healing time.

The moral is, lift what you can lift and keep your pride and ego out of it.",1567296202

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma.

Augusts' arc was tragic, but there are too many hard to believe things, such as how he survived as a totally abandoned infant, how his incredible magic power was able to give him memories of his parents and their curses, as well as how he isn't consistent in his killing mentality. He also for whatever reason dodged all of Cana's attacks, when he could have just used magic against them. Would have hidden his weakness. But it was still a good twist.

A little. But it's a point of view thing. He's already a random villain that just showed up this arc, and then he only has one moment where we'd feel bad for him. It's just too sudden.

Humans are the same. An entire museum of our genetic code is dedicated to having sex. And humans simply have better self control than Chimps or dolphins. But not all of us.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Forgive me for stating the obvious here, but my dude, you have a LOT of anger going on. And you know what? I kinda get it.

From what you've commented, it sounds like you've been through a hell of a lot. I can't imagine how hard it must be dealing with your father and stepfather and their behaviour towards you. That combined with being a teenager? Ouch.

Honestly, being a teenager is rough. Your brain's going through a complete remodelling and it's relying almost entirely on the part that's linked to emotions, impulses and aggression. It's a lot harder for you to stay calm when you're upset or pissed off because your brain's not wired the way an adult's is.

And now you feel like you're being pushed out for a younger model. Of course you're going to feel angry and hurt.

Thing is, though? It seems like all your anger is focussed on Connor. And none of this is his fault. He's just a little kid. He didn't ask for any of this either.

Try to talk to your grandparents about how you're feeling. Write down bullet points, but avoid direct accusations. Use a lot of statements beginning with I, like ""I feel it's unfair if you say good morning to Connor and not to me"". And don't worry if you fuck it up and get angry ‚Äì doing this stuff is hard enough for me at 28. I would've sucked if I'd tried it at 14.

Also, I know you said you have a counselling class, but I really think you could do with some one-to-one support rather than a classroom setting. Is anything like that available?

And finally, don't give up. Please. Things are awful now, but clich√©d as it is, they do get better. My teenage years were the worst years of my life but now I'm nearing thirty and I'm genuinely happy. It can happen for you too.

Take care.",1567296208

But she was brutally honest about how bad my hair was and how I needed to stop ruining it. She cut it dry, just blunt cut a few dead inches off of it and put a note in my file on the computer that said ""no layers""...which I'm grateful for, my hair does better without layers, it's too lightweight/thin/fine/feathery/whatever for layers, especially *curly* layers that are all over the place.

I reccomend watching the ""knockoffs"" S2E4 episode of Broad City. One of the main characters ends up in a situation with a man she's had a crush on, where he wants to be pegged. Shes freaked out at first but it all plays out wonderfully. It should make you feel better about everything. Maybe even watch it with her! It's very funny and light hearted so I think you both would enjoy it and help her laugh off her negative feelings she has about it. Hopefully it will give you both a new perspective on everything and bring you two together. Bs

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Some of your responders have muddied the water.  In a true self-defense situation, where I have the capability to kill and walk away unharmed against an attacker intent on killing me, a situation I actually have faced ... and defused, I would consider it a sin for me to kill in self defense.  To clarify, a ""pure"" self-defense situation is one in which I am the only person in danger.  I have never, and hope I will never, given someone a righteous reason to kill me.  If someone is threatening to do so, it is for an unrighteous reason.  In such a situation, with no other person endangered beside me an my attacker, I can and will act in a Christ-like manner based on concrete reasoning.  I am supremely confident that, if I am unrighteously killed, I will immediately find myself enjoying God's eternal presence.  I am fairly certain that, were I to kill a person who is in the act of intentional unrighteous murder, that person would immediately begin to suffer eternal torment.  Given sufficient opportunity, I would assure that person that I will not kill the attacker to save my physical life.  I would explain my reasoning.  I actually have done so, and obviously am alive to tell about it.  Had the attacker been more impetuous, and not given me the time to do so, I gladly would have gone home to Jesus, and left him one more opportunity to repent.  I recognize that God's Word leaves room for self-protective killing.  I will not condemn another person for taking such action.  I simply know from actual experience that I am able to see the bigger, more eternal, picture, and act from compassion and grace in such a situation.  Because I know I am capable of so acting, and that so acting is a very good thing, for me to kill in self defense would be a sin because it is sin for him who knows to do good to not do it.  Taking extreme action to prevent the murder of someone whose eternal future is unknowable to me would be another story entirely.  I would have to take each such situation on a case-by-case basis, and trust God's Holy Spirit to lead me into all truth.",1567296209

&gt;there had never been a true socialist revolution in Poland; rather, the PPR was established by means of external influence from the USSR

This is problematic and, in my opinion, only a half-truth. Although it is unlikely that Poland would have established and consolidated socialism without the presence and assistance of the Soviet Union, this is not to say that there wasn't a genuine working class revolution which brought the communists to power. To prove this, I will quote heavily from [*Class Struggle in Socialist Poland*](https://archive.org/details/ClassStruggleInSocialistPoland), a book written by Polish-American Marxist sociologist Albert Syzmaski which outlines the history of the Polish People's Republic and its various crises. To avoid any accusations of bias or propaganda, Syzmanski deliberately only cites western academic sources in the book.

&gt;*As with my book on the USSR, the principle of using almost entirely pro-Western, anti-Communist sources to establish the facts, then interpreting these facts within the framework of Marxist class analysis, is utilized. The historiographically sound principle that if those who are arguing against a hypothesis provide evidence in favor of it, such evidence has a high probability of being true, underlies this method. We are lucky not only in having a rather rich literature on Poland, as is the case with the USSR, but also in having a well-developed sociological establishment in Poland that for years, and especially during 1980-81, has produced objective information on Polish public opinion. The fact that Poland has been relatively open to Westerners since the mid-1950s has also greatly facilitated the accumulation of facts about that society in the West.*

Syzmanski begins the book by laying out his contentions, firstly that the implementation of socialism in Poland was popular, indigenous and authentic.

&gt;*It will be shown that, contrary to the impression of many in the West, the Polish working class has a long revolutionary tradition, and that Marxism has deep roots in this class. Further, it will be demonstrated that there was a genuine working-class/peasant revolution in Poland in 1944-48 that was protected, but in no way caused, by the presence of the Soviet Army.*

Secondly, that the various incidences of discontent in Poland, while many in number, were not caused by anti-communist sentiment, anti-Soviet sentiment or the perceived anti-democratic nature of the ""regime"", but instead were pro-socialist movements aiming to reverse specific policy mistakes of the government.

&gt;*It must be stressed that neither the mass membership of Solidarity nor the bulk of working-class participants in previous public manifestations have been opposed to socialism, nor have their protests been directed primarily against the Communist Party's general leadership of Polish society. The thrust of working-class participation in strikes, demonstrations, and ""independent"" trade unions has, rather, been focused on two issues: an increase in living standards and the institutionalization of a more decentralized model of socialism. However, working-class discontent on these two questions has been manipulated by strongly anti-Communist intellectuals who assumed leadership of Solidarity in the fall of 1981 with the intention of overthrowing the regime. The consequence of their success might well have been the destruction of any form of socialism in Poland.*

He goes on to provide an overview of the Marxist working class movement in Poland prior to WWII, in order to demonstrate that the People's Republic manifested naturally. As it turns out, this history is rich, stretching back to the 19th century whilst the Polish people were subjugated under the Russian Empire. Thereafter, he details the process by which, during WWII and the Nazi occupation of Poland, the remaining progressive forces within the country began organizing a resistance movement, independent of the fascistic pre-war Polish government exiled in London which refused to cooperate with the left-wing. Communists formed the Polish Workers Party in 1942 and, together with the Peasant Party, the Social Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party, formed a provisional government in 1944 known as the National Council, which acted as a representative body for the various committees and councils springing up across the country. Due to the Popular Front policy of forming a broad coalition and advocating democratic reforms rather than a full-blown socialist revolution, the communists were able to amass considerable support, which solidified their legitimacy as opposed to the now unpopular exiled government.

&gt;*The London government in exile was deserted by the three non-Communist mass parties. Retaining its base only among the most right-wing and anti-Semitic forces abroad and at home, it was reduced to a virtually irrelevant rump. Immediately after the reconstitution of the provisional government, the United States and the United Kingdom officially recognized the new government as the legitimate government of Poland.*

In fact, the communists were so committed to democracy during this period that, when the Red Army liberated Poland and the National Council became the legitimate government, the Polish Workers Party agreed to re-shuffle the cabinet to include the exiled London Poles, as well as reducing their own influence down to just 5 of the 21 ministries, whereas before they held 7 out of 16. In the next section of the book, focused on post-war Poland, Syzmanski shows how the country became socialist predominately due to popular demand rather than state force or Soviet influence, starting with the industrial workers taking over the factories.

&gt;*Not surprisingly, given the devastation wrought by the Nazis and the preceding decade and a half of military dictatorship, the Red Army's liberation of Poland in 1944 and 1945 was enthusiastically welcomed, especially by the working class. In most cases Polish factories had been managed during the occupation by Germans who were evacuated with the retreating German Army. As the German Army left, the workers generally continued on their own, forming workers' councils and electing their own supervisors. As was the case throughout almost all of occupied Europe, a spontaneous socialist transformation of the economy took place, with workers taking over production. The principal difference between Eastern and Western Europe in this regard was that the Red Army did not restore the factories to private ownership, instead (at least at first) allowing the workers to carry on.*

Although the peasantry were initially skeptical of a potential communist takeover, they too were won over by the government's unprecedented land reform program.

&gt;*One of the regime's very first actions was to implement a radical land reform, turning all estate land over to peasant families. The regime distributed 10 million acres to about 1.5 million landless and virtually landless peasants. The state kept about 5 million acres, mostly for state farms. This reform neutralized political opposition to the regime among the peasantry and won the government considerable support in rural areas.*

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Socialist pioneers like this young hero, Greta Thunberg are the founders of Global ""Green"" Socialism. ""Green"" Socialism stands on two pillars, Leftism &amp; Ecological. We believe that an unfair, US Western based Capitalist world society like ours is very wrong, and that a society that destroys its own environment for profit, is doomed to decay and eventual destruction.

Humankind depends utterly on the environment which supports our Human life. Capitalist industrialization led by the USA and other Western governments has been degrading this ecosystem - grow, profit, grow, profit. US based capitalism has been instrumental in the destruction of the global environment, and is a threat to ALL biological life on the planet. The biggest current threat is global warming, which Capitalists and the US and Western governments deny and other ""free market"" governments ignore. The Imperialist Capitalist has now ushered in the 6th extinction event.

Many of you support Socialist change but are not willing to make the final leap to a Green Socialist Revolution. Why wait?

Our society is increasingly unequal. Capitalism exploits us all - well, 99% of us. Our lives under Capitalism are built around having more and more ""stuff"", and ""I want"" not about trying to be happy and trying to fulfill ourselves with what we need and helping the planet survive under a new Socialist State. People are addicted to ruthless unequal competition and endless material growth under Capitalism and fear sensible Socialist style cooperation. This fear comes from unrelenting Capitalist propaganda that more is ""good"" and less is ""bad"".

The current economic crisis was created by finance US Capitalists going back 100's of years in an orgy of greed and criminality. It's made most 1% US capitalists very rich while those below suffer. Their crimes now extend to the global community and is affecting the health of the Planet.

Socialism rejects Capitalism in any form because it exploits workers, consumers and the environment. We need a radical transformation to a Socialist society that values both people and the natural ecology on which people depend for life. The Capitalist drive for endless growth, endless consumption and HUGE inequality is destroying our ecosystem, our Human society and the entire planet.

Green Socialism would mean a better, fairer, happier life for all of us.

"Browns","t5_2s1wh","I'm going to go out on a limb here and this post may blow up in my face, but I'm going to say that in many instances those QBs you mentioned only had ""elite"" lines because the QBs are elite and not necessarily the lines.  From what I've seen, Wilson has always had below average lines but is very mobile, Rodgers likes to run around and extend the play looking for the perfect pass and the other QBs are good at making quick decisions and get the ball out quickly.  Let's see what happens to Tunsil's numbers blocking for Watson.  Last year Watson held the ball on average for 3.01s  Wilson 3.02s,  Rodgers 2.95 but led the league in throwaways. Brady was 2.62, Brees 2.59, Luck 2.63 and Wentz 2.66.  Baker was 2.79 but I'm betting it was better in the second half.

If your QB is good at making quick decisions and is mobile enough in the pocket to extend the play a bit, you don't need an elite line at the expense of skill positions.  If you have a QB who can make a quick decision and his skill guys get open quickly, then you are better off than trying to wait for a play develop with lesser players trying to get open.

Last year the Browns had the #2 ranked offensive line.  Look at the difference between a slow decision maker (Tyrod) and a quick decision maker (Baker).  It was the same line except for the left tackle but you seem to claim the second left tackle was weak anyhow so it shouldn't have made THAT much of a difference (plus Baker had the original guy blocking for him for 4-5 games or so).  Also, spending a ton for a Left tackle at the expense of other more important positions like EDGE rusher doesn't make sense because your rusher can move around and attack a weak spot in the line while your tackle is stuck defending one spot on the line.",1567296213

If you plan on keeping your table **outdoors**, I would advise purchasing one with an aluminum surface. Wooden tables are designed for indoor use. They will not be able to survive the heat, humidity, and moisture from the outdoors as they are prone to warping.

As for a **garage**, it isn't directly exposed to sunlight, but  might be somewhat humid so just keep that in mind. Though I think you can go with an indoor table - many people have a table tennis table set up in their garage so I'm assuming it's fine.",1567296213

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","There are plenty of options in the under-$30 range! 

* My first pen was a **Pilot Metropolitan** (\~ $20 US), which has been a solid workhorse. The downside is that your ink options are either proprietary cartridges or the proprietary converter, which holds very little ink. You can refill the cartridges with any ink using a blunt-tip syringe and a steady hand. 
* I also often carry a **Kaweco Sport**, which is a fun pocket-sized pen that comes in a ton of colors. It has a converter or takes short cartridges, which greatly opens up your ink options. 
* A lot of people like **Twsbi** pens--I just bought the Eco and the Go models. They weren't my favorite pens out of the box, but they're growing on me. These run \~ $20-30 USD, depending on the model. 
* The ultra-budget option would be a **Platinum Preppy** (&lt; $5 US), which can easily be converted to an eyedropper pen. I have a small stash I use when I travel, because I don't mind much if I lose one. The writing quality is very good. (This pen is my top recommendation for students, because if you convert it to an eyedropper, you can easily write a week's worth of notes on a single fill!)  
* The **Platinum Plaisir** (\~ $15 US) puts the same nib as the Preppy into an aluminum body. I haven't tried this one yet, but I imagine that it feels similar to the Pilot Metropolitan (in the sense that it is an inexpensive aluminum-bodied pen with good writing quality). 
* The **Pilot Plumix** (\~ $10 US) is a fun way to test out stub nibs and more ""decorative"" writing.

"classicalmusic","t5_2qhyq","I would definitely agree classical guitar is the best option in terms of volume, a lot of my classical lessons were spent trying to make the sound *louder* without getting a harsh tone. 

It's also a good choice if you don't want something horrendously hard, it's definitely not easy but you can get an okay sound much sooner than a bowed string or wind instrument. 

There's also the cost - a passable beginner guitar is not super expensive, but should be set up properly so it's as easy as possible to play and doesn't have buzzing strings.

I played as a kid, what put me off though was the lack of repertoire that interested me (I wanted to play Mozart, Beethoven etc.) and relative lack of ensemble opportunities.

Communism is popular because capitalism is failing.



Communism only occurred to begin with because Capitalism and Colonialism had been so destructive for hundreds of years.

 If communism becomes popular in our society, that means something's wrong with our society.


 





I don't disagree that people  temporarily  flirting with Communism are naive.   


 But they are not a threat.  

 

 Now when I heard that communism was being flirted with again, I was surprised as well.  But I understood it:

 Climate change, 2008 crash, high cost of health care  education and housing, limited job prospects,war, Consolidation of wealth, criminal &amp; economic injustice....






You hear communism is popular and the 1st thing you think of is Stalin.  



That shows you actually don't understand communism.


  It's really not too hard to understand why communism is popular.

 Considering this is what America is currently offering the world:  war &amp; madness:

Please share with everyone, (without a doubt or Prejudice, Our only True  
Holy Grail), @AntonKnebenson @GAC8717 My Dear Beloved Friends, God   
Loves You! Why? A New Revelation with the Spirit of Truth is here Today

The Urantia Book, Revelation 2:17,Free, Online, in all international   
Languages, and Guided by Archangel Michael, His Trusted Angels, and the   
Holy Spirit ).A prayer and Blessing for all Good Loving Believers who   
Wish to share the Truth about Jesus, The Son of God and the Holy Spirit:

For all the Children who are Ruined by shame 

Mirror child

The image of a precious dove  
Dancing barefoot on the beach  
Drinking in love and sunshine  
full of smiles   
never having to die.

Mere child 

Dreaming awhile on a school title   
Learning to carry books for miles.   
Crayons, pencils, stencils   
Nothing you need to do  
but Sing and carry the wind on Your wings.

Mirror child

Like daddy or mommy  
Carrying so many burdens  
for A little person  
All the time  
Not able To catch the spies and Spiders.   
Go back to the skies, 

Little dove

And play with the eagles   
who tamed this land   
Until you are a spirit so good and pure  
That you will truly guide   
the directions of our   
Bloodied hands.

Temptations of Evil 

Muscles of Clay,  
Eyes of pitifully empty bliss,  
Teeth of dragons never begotten,   
You stand alone   
Praying to brainless demons  
Praising power empty Of Spirit,   
Goodness or Hope. 

You shall reap no Glory  
But only Mortal death   
and baptized Shame  
So as to Die without Jesus   
Or any Holy Name. 

Stained by lust,  
Broken tears and stardom,  
Born of evil and deviltries  
Ill conceived 

Raise Your Heart to God Jesus  
and The Holy Spirit,  
And He will Remove Your Pain,   
Stop your foolish self destructive reign,  
And bring you Spiritual Relief   
You could never possibly or individually   
Humanly gain.

To Have Peace, Love   
And Eternal Happiness and Justice  
For All People,  
Believe in Jesus,  
The Son of Mary and God,   
And You Will Be Immortally  
Saved For ever more,  
And Be Loved  
By Our Holy Father God   
For all Eternity.

I Am a Divine Messenger, ( Described in The Urantia Book as The   
Solitary Messenger), Working Directly with Guardian Arch Angel Michael J  
Christ and His Angels, and I come To Share Good News, and the Facts   
about our Only True Holy God from The Heavens with Everyone: Our only

"rangers","t5_2rnpb","I think it depends on his line mates. Obviously, Panarin will help. But who‚Äôs on the other side?

I think it would be smart asset management to play Namestnikov on the wing on the first line. He‚Äôs shown in the past that he can be a complementary piece to elite line mates, and it would then become a no brainer to trade him with Kreider at the deadline, for a better return. I think this line would probably lead to Mika having a similar season, maybe slightly improved, over last year. It would also give Kakko time to move up the line scheme and graduate to the first line at the end of the year. This might pull down Zibanejad‚Äôs production a bit this year, post trade dead line, but would be a good move for the future of the team *if* Kakko earns the spot.

I think we already have a homegrown Namestnikov-type option in Buchnevich, though. In a vacuum, I think Buch is a 2nd line scoring winger, but with complementary pieces (harder physical play and/or good playmaking, basically) he can punch above his weight. He plays too much on the perimeter, and he‚Äôs not helpful enough on defense, but he can put up points with the right line mates. On the first line, I think Buchnevich would help Zibanejad rack up some assists, and with a continued effort on his own part, I think a top line with Zibanejad centering Panarin and Buchnevich probably leads to a modest but noteworthy increase in his point total at the end of the season.

TLDR: I think it‚Äôs partially dependent on line mates, but I see more scenarios where Zbad increases his point totals this year than regresses.",1567296220

if you get your very first warrior or hero streamstone from tempered investigations(Rank 30 or Rank 50) you can augment all your armor to upgrade it further. use health boost 3 as well. lunastra legs &gt; decos &gt; charm.

augmenting + upgrading is expensive so get ready to hunt a lot of things for selling materials. hold on to at least 20.  and belive me low rank materials become more valuable at this point because you don't want to farm them if you're out of low rank materials.

One good thing about UWorld is that you get really hard questions, so you get practice answering questions you don't know the answer to. You NEED to be using nursing process to answer the questions (ABCs, chronic vs acute, what will kill your patient first etc). You WILL get questions on NCLEX you don't know the answer to but you still need to do your best to answer them.

"wholesomememes","t5_3gcwj","I am actually thanks! I hit my lowest point a couple months ago to be honest. My dad found out about something fucked up I did as a teenager and kicked me out of home so I was homeless and I didn't know if I'd see my family again. The same day I tried to kill myself by stabbing myself in the neck 6 times. 

I shoudlnt have survived but luckily I chose a small knife and so I didn't hit the artery. There was a shit ton of blood though so I thought I was going to die. It was actually quite peaceful. I lay on the grass in the backyard listening to music while watching the birds fly overhead and my sister's kitten run around the backyard. I was completely ready to die at the time but I've since found reasons to live again and am so glad I survived.

Anyway the ambulance took me to hospital, they stitched me up, gave me an x-ray and sent me to the psych ward for 3 weeks. Within an hour I met this amazing South African girl and we became friends really quickly. She was there until I was discharged so I actually had lots of fun. Here in Australia you're allowed your phone, laptop etc  and the hospital has free wifi so we'd watch Netflix together all day and play pool or just talk and get to know each other. 

They even had a PS4 so I got my mum to bring a few games from home (some bastard stole them though and even though there's a security camera pointing right where they were the hospital couldn't help me).

I've been out about a month and we still text most days and we hang out at least once a week. The social workers found me a place to live and except for the much tighter budget I'm loving living independently. I never would have guessed food shopping is so fun! 

I slowly made up with every single one of my family members, seeing my nieces and nephews that I absolutely love for the first time in 2 months a couple nights ago which was quite emotional. The first thing my 4 year old nephew said was ""are you all better now?"" and when I told him I was he ran to his older sister exited to inform her I was all better. We're good buds. My mum said when I was away he would bang on my door and ask to see me and when they said I wasn't home he would cry.

Last night was my dad's 60th and the entire family was there and it was as if nothing had changed. Since me moving out he split up with my mum and moved out with 2 of my sisters but we still all get together for family dinner once a week. Their relationship has been terrible for a decade so were actually all glad it finally happened. The constant fighting wasn't helping anyone.

I've been staying at my mum's the past few days and mostly been playing Assassins Creed Odyssey on my brother's PS4 (which is so fucking good by the way) while he plays games on his computer in the same room and we casually chat about gaming. True brother bonding shit haha

Oh and I'm kind of in a relationship now, long distance though, with a French girl who lives in Ohio. I know these things often don't work (I was in one with a girl in Washington less than a year ago and it did not work out at all) but we're seriously crazy about each other and she wants to move here in a few months to be with me so I'm cautiously optimistic about where this could go. 

What's funny is I've always dreamed of marrying a French girl and having French kids so it's like it was meant to be (corny but whatever). It's motivated me to learn French again and I speak a few phrases that I remember here and there to her which she loves.

Anyway thanks to anyone who read this, its nice just be heard. For anyone who is interested my diagnosis is bipolar II, borderline personality disorder and I've had drug induced psychosis a few times in the past which I can assure you is no fun, but none of that means my life isn't worth living",1567296226

Now, Whitebeard brought a fleet. And they managed to fight 1v1 against the marines pretty well. The tension in before and during the battle was palpable. 

Given the preparations the marines had to do against Whitebeard, on their own turf, it is unlikely that they will send one admiral to Wano against two Emperors. This is regardless of them knowing about the alliance, because they already know two Emperors are there. Alliance or not, it is still two emperors.

No idea either on how they'd find it on a hypothetical journey, but hey.

Japan is about 100 miles from Korea at its closest. You could find a way to sail 500+ miles across the sea of Japan, but in any case, I think that the distances to Japan and across the Pacific via island hopping are close enough to the same magnitude to find both plausible or neither.

"ApexLore","t5_wgh6o","Checked out the thread. He's got some really interesting thoughts and ideas. His speculation and extrapolation of the lore is always fascinating. I just don't feel there's enough to really lend hard evidence either way and I think FrozenFroh knows that too based on how he phrases certain things. 

There's no ""proof"" that I've seen at least. The only evidence, is evidence to the contrary, on all sides ‚Äî theories, speculation, and ideas that if you dig deep enough, begin to cancel each other out. When one makes sense, there's something over here to say ""Well then how do you explain this?"". 

There's just too much contradiction coupled with mystery about the lore and gameplay ‚Äî which is both something I love and find aggravating at the same time lol

In the end, it's all just fun speculation. Sure it's just a game with fun gameplay mechanics, and maybe I'm overthinking things. But I really enjoy the idea that it all flows and has meaning.

Especially when it's clear Respawn really cares about the characters and the lore. I think they enjoy their audience going through these mental gymnastics and creating all these theories because it shows we care too and are invested :)",1567296233

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","No. The definition of socialism is an economic system in which the workers collectively own the means of production, in opposition to capitalism where the means of production are private owned. That's it. It doesn't matter what you've been taught or think is associated with socialism, that's the definition. There are many many different kinds of socialism and there are even some where there are still markets, but the thing that binds them all together is that the workers collectively own the means of production. I can't make it any better or clearer for you.

And it's not semantics, you used the word socialism to say a bunch of things about other things and their effectiveness, and I'm just telling you that those conclusions don't mean what you think they mean because you're reasoning from the wrong base assumption. If you say 2 + 4 = 5 you have made a factual error somewhere and assumed that either 2 has the value of 1 or 4 has the value of 3 and that's not correct.

A lot of people have the completely wrong idea of what socialism is so I'm not saying you're stupid or anything or attacking you personally. I'm just telling you your information isn't correct. And that it would beneficial for you to learn the right definition so you can make better judgements and reason better about extrapolations of it. But if you refuse to accept that you've had the wrong information and adopt the correct definitions, I can't help you, and this conversation is over.",1567296234

I never had more than 2 friends at the same time throughout school, and the friendships tended to become uncomfortably intense before blowing up. By the time I was 20 I was not in contact with even one person I went to high school with.

Now that I'm an adult, I rarely meet new people. My workplace is small and has minimal turnover. My hobbies are all things I can do alone. I am uncomfortable in social situations and actively avoid them. It's just as well, I probably shouldn't inflict myself on anyone else.",1567296234

It's not possible for us to properly identify this from a picture or description and it would be irresponsible to try. This is because many drugs look alike (e.g. 99% of synthetic drugs are white powders).

If you want to know, you'll need to buy a [**test kit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_testing). A list of test kit suppliers can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/test_kit_suppliers).

Less common substances will require analytical testing, provided by the likes of [**these organisations**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/wiki/knowledgebase#wiki_laboratory_analysis).

I have removed this post but you are welcome to ask questions about the various testing methods :)

Check out the [**rules**](/r/Drugs/about/rules) for more information.

Mueller came up short on not explicitly stating that Trump committed crimes, and that Trump should be criminally charged or impeached and removed for those crimes.

He just didn't say it, or recommend it, and he should have known that in today's political climate, with as far as the GOP has gone to protect Trump, he needed to state that Trump should be indicted, but for that ridiculous DOJ policy that a president is above the law.

It simply means your rib has slipped from it's designated spot and needs to be popped back and usually wrapped while the muscle inflammation goes down so it doesn't come out again.  


With most musculoskeletal problems people have, they need two-part therapy in order to solve the issue. Physical therapists are trained in more result-based manipulation practices (as are DO's), and they also make sure to do the soft tissue stuff to keep everything in place. On top of that they usually have a solid treatment plan that will actually make you better instead of making you keep coming back for more ""pops"" like chiros do.

Your choices in life aren't limited ""become a high school teacher OR a stripper"".  Very few people have their lives figured out at age 21. I'm 30 and have only JUST figured out what I want to do. I think you should look into burlesque dancing rather than strip clubs.

Assuming a standard adventure's pack (the pack itself, some rope, torches, rations, a sack, and a few misc items like pitons or a mirror), you're at max speed up through Light armour, 2/3 through medium, and 1/3 through heavy. Up you pack wait noticeably and you drop a category.

If you work on the assumption that everyone has that base weight and don't even consider armour, you can just say ""you're keeping [x item]? Drop a speed level"" You don't have to know anything about the PC - just whether the item you're handing out is heavy.

It gets all loosey-goosey when it comes to holding a lot of light items, but as long as you don't let them buy, say, 100 pitons it's mostly fine.

I believe it also says what amount of coin would drop a speed level, but I'm blanking on that at the moment.",1567296237

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","  &gt;I had a very long argument about this yesterday. It boils down to, the growth only significantly changes if you tax households. Yang's primary funding comes from a VAT tax on corporations. And before you say it, yes I understand taxes are passed on to the consumer, but the average European pass through rate is only around 40% for VAT, meaning we can expect somewhere between a 4-10% increase in prices, which is relatively small in the grand scheme of things.

As long as we can agree that the 12.5 percent growth rate is not applicable in this case.  According to the study, that only happens if you borrow all the money.  

&gt;This assumption obviously isn't something you can prove, but its well documented that giving people money doesn't make them less productive

Increases in cost usually result in people buying less.  There also does seem to be evidence that people work less given access to a UBI.  In Alaska, part-time employment increased under their fund while full-time employment remained consistent.  It was only a few thousand dollars, but it seemed to lead to increases in part-time work at the expense of full-time work.",1567296237

If it is illegal to get married in Colorado then making a cake does not make you an accessory to a crime.  You can have a ceremony but it is just play acting.  To be legal you register with the state.  That is the ""legal"" part of which none of this was at issue since you couldn't at the time in Colorado.  A cake has no bearing on that whatsoever.  You are literally making shit up.

In fact the couple was just celebrating their very legal marriage with friends and family in Colorado.

"television","t5_2qh6e","I've thought that soft reboots are great for these kind of shows, which is why I really like your idea there. This is Us is a broad enough show title that it fits to any cast of characters. This show could be like True Detective in a sense to keep stories fresh and deal with different topics per character sets. 

Families dealing with racism, wealth class, immigration, same-sex marriages, murder of a brother/sister/dad/mom/etc, careers, religion, etc, etc. Possibilities are endless that keeps shows like this afloat for many seasons if you do soft reboots every 2-4 seasons. And restrict time hopping to like 2-3 time periods or so (present/some time ago/beginning). 

The downside to this is that once you get attached to a specific cast, it can be hard to move onto a new one. So, it's pretty risky game to play for executives unless if there's quality writers and showrunners involved.

"tifu","t5_2to41","# Original post for those curious

&gt; My husband is a triathlete and cross trains doing HIIT classes with me. I have been trying to sculpt my body as he suggested by increasing overall muscle tone and with a focus on developing abs, obliques, triceps, and deltoids. He got me a HIIT studio membership so I can work on my body and spend a little time with him training to improve our relationship.

&gt; He trains with a few people at the triathlon club, one of whom is also an instructor at the HIIT studio. He is friendly with many people but I thought he was acting especially differently around her, to the point that I asked him whether something was going on a few days ago. He exploded with anger that I would even suggest that and left, and spent the night at the condo we sometimes lease on airbnb.

&gt; I apologized and begged for forgiveness. And he said he would consider it if I finally agree to some of the bedroom acts he wanted to try but I had previously refused. He wanted to do anal and to have me pretend it was not consensual. He said if I can find a way to accommodate his fantasies he would reconsider the damage I‚Äôve done with my accusation. So I frantically read up on these, even went to the adult store to buy the enema device to make sure I‚Äôm clean.

&gt; I told him I‚Äôm ready and consented to his request for anal and to pretend it was not consensual during sex. He finally came home this morning. He didn‚Äôt start slow like guys were supposed to from what I‚Äôve read. I didn‚Äôt have to pretend I was sobbing because the experience was not enjoyable for me one bit.

&gt; After it was over I tried to cuddle with him but he just pushed me over. He got dressed and told me he just couldn‚Äôt forgive me, ever. He told me to expect divorce papers and told me to start looking for an attorney. He told me the most forgiving he could be is to make the separation as amicable as possible and warned me not to do anything stupid or drag it out unnecessarily. And he left.

&gt; I‚Äôm honestly still in shock. I haven‚Äôt cried about this. I haven‚Äôt told anyone about this yet since he left an hour ago. I still can‚Äôt believe he wouldn‚Äôt try counseling to see if we can save this. Mostly I feel numb.

&gt; TL;DR: I falsely accused my husband of infidelity and I was not good enough to have his forgiveness.",1567296240

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","He s not ""very"" underpowered. You might want to play him for 1 more than one game. I ve already talked about this in the Caitlyn buffs thread.

He needs a bit of love, but I'm afraid if Riot would listen to Reddit after the next set of buffs (which might as well be in season 15 as they don t really seem to mind him being so underwhelming) he might become really op.

You can win a lot of the match ups or at least  go even, but he s too team reliant, a lot of the times game s over before you finish laning, no carries = useless tank.

I m feeling like since he s no longer ""roll your face on the keyboard"" and win people play 1 game of him, see that they have no idea of utilizing his kit, call it a day and call him trash.

Dont get me wrong, I'm really expecting some buffs but rather to the tank items and maybe some small number tweaks. (also tenacity in his kit would help a lot to not get bursted before you can actually use your passive to survive)

Played close to 400 Maokai games this season all of them in D2-Masters EUNE / D4-D2 EUW hovering between 55% and 60% winrate. 

He s not as weak as you d think. But not as powerful as people would like to be to make it a pick worthwhile to learn. 

I'm sure that with 400 games of a carry in this meta would ve brought me higher in the rankings. But smacking klepto laners that think they can just farm you up and make you their bitch is a wonderful experience.

Being so underplayed makes him so good in a way that the enemy will always underestimate you unless he saw what you already can do. I ve gotten solo kills on Darius/Renekton/Kennen/Vladimir at levels 1/2/3 just because they don't respect me and the minion wave (and the power of corrupting pot). 

I admiteddly barely seen any Maokais besides me (maybe 2? in the last 600 games), but they were awful. 

Remember kids. Perma plant sapplings in the bushes and you ll be surprised. With good placements double kills 1v2 are a very viable option or at least trading 1 for 1.

Also btw conqueror doesnt shit on Maokai (but it is very annoying on certain champs). 

Darius takes it but he should win with or without conqueror. Yet when Jax takes it i destroy him 9/10 times. Tryndameres seems to always underestimate me and take lethal tempo. 

Fiora has so much true damage that conqueror is not the deciding factor but if she can parry your cc in time and how well you trade and kite with each other with the skillshots.

Urgot can be tricky but after bramble tabi and bush sapplings its really doable, remember you can dodge his ult with W on minions since the cast time kinda long.
 
He s not that bad into Aatrox either, even though its favored towards him, he can easly hit Q1 and Q2. But what you can do is walk towards him to dodge the Q1 sweet spot, if he continues with Q2 let him hit, because at the Q3 you can dodge it with W and there goes a big chunk of his damage, while you, being a smart tree, you savded your Q, have sapplings in bushes and Q him towards them and your Q and another sappling will be available by the time his Q is back again, so if he wants to fight in the bushes he ll lose.Still this is really easy to fuck up and if he gets 1 kill you ll not get to play league of legends afterwards.

He s decent, people just forgot that. Still itemization sucks and he gets bursted easly before he can use his passive. Items changes and number tweaks is what I'd ask.",1567296244

Dear sister, my Veronika, I'm greeting you nicely, also my brother-in-law and your dear children. And I'm writing to you that I've got your letter and the dollar too. My dear sister Veronika, thank you very much that you don't forget me. If you didn't send me anything, I would be laughed at among people and my children too. 

You wrote to me if aunt Ivanova (or of Ivan) is still alive. She still does live, but she is already very weak. So at least as long she lives she sometimes gives me a slice of bread. 

My sister Maria has bread to, but she wouldn't give it to my child, a stranger gives it to my child rather than she. And because her daughter who is at Homoƒæa (probably a name of something) and now they have threshed 35 m of wheat, but she wouldn't give me anything from her hand.

And I have no bread here with such a stepmother. When some holiday comes, then I buy a bread and I eat it when no one sees. So I have a very great sorrow because I have nobody here, only God in the high sky. 

My dear sister, I rejoiced greatly that your daughter got married and that she vowed in a Ruthenian church (probably Greek Catholic). I was even crying from happiness. It has been very hard that we are so far from each other that we can't see each other.

Our father did very ""well"" to both of us, he cursed both of us and beat our mother to death. When she was dying she told me everything, that she was passing away because he kicked into her. But one shouldn't even touch her and when he is arguing with her, she is quiet every time he scolds her. (I'm confused by the subjects and tense in this sentence, so maybe it isn't accurate)

Now I'm writing to you that Greek Catholic missionaries came to ƒåiƒçava on the 1st of June and now, on the 1st of November, for 5 days, very big (something like) church services have finished. There were sermons always in the morning and in the evening. So many people came every day that there was no space left for an apple to fall on the ground.

Three Lutheran girls and one boy converted to Greek Catholic / Eastern rite religion. The missionaries baptized them and prayed with them in the Greek Catholic / Ruthenian way in ƒåiƒçava church. People were even crying because they had a great sermon.",1567296247

Conversations of privilege aren't necessarily meant to place guilt on people, or to suggest that they need to give everything up. The point is to build empathy through the understanding that not everyone is given the same benefits/opportunities in their lives as others. 

It's ok to have privilege. But it's important to acknowledge that, and not have a ""everybody can get what they want if they just do what I did"" attitude.

Unfortunately, vanilla WoW raids are insultingly easy by today's standards (and to be fair, WoW raids in general even mythic+ are very easy compared to some other MMOs out there). Designers didn't quite know what they could or could not get away with and gear was far more difficult to acquire so bosses had to be designed to account for a huge multitude of setups. Add to the fact that all these are all old bosses untouched, which means they've been studied and tested to hell and back and perfect strats for getting them down are very easy to find.

It's about that time when people slowly start to realize that Classic WoW raiding was never difficult. It was just very time and patience consuming. The only two reasons people died back then was because they either just had no gear or they weren't used to mechanics that by today are very common -- for example, standing in front of a boss is going to get you cleaved or standing behind a dragon is going to get you tail-swiped.

I see no reason not to look my best no matter what but I missed some time also due to some events in my personal life and certainly went through a bit of a rejuvenation at one point. To be honest it will sound terrible but I am almost embarrassed to tell people my age especially at the gym because the response is a big yo-do about how young I look and I don‚Äôt know what to say (I‚Äôm also athletic.) And haha I also used to be a runner. At high noon. In Florida. With no sunscreen or glasses or hat. I also smoked when I was younger. 
So I have crows feet pretty badly and you can see in that photo some pigmentation on my forehead that I don‚Äôt care about myself but FYI it is pretty hard to control so prevent it if you don‚Äôt like it.
But otherwise that‚Äôs my skin in direct sunlight with no filter or makeup (just eyeliner no foundation) at 45 so all things considered I‚Äôm ok with it. 

Your regimen is off to a VERY good start except that you DID NOT MENTION the most effective skincare active, SUNSCREEN. Elta MD SPF 43 (?) makes you actually love putting on sunscreen.
Good for you for doing your research.
Keep up the tret, use Vitamin C stabilized with Feurlic acid in the morning and Niacinamide morning (depending on how you feel about mixing Vit C with other acids) and night. When layering acids you have to layer acids of similar pHs together otherwise high pHs and low pHa kill each other.
Do some small peels like glycolic or salicylic every six weeks or so and do a big TCA 2-3 times a year.
You Shiism be good with that and it‚Äôs a simple but effective routine. I consider anything else I use to be just for fun. The ABCs (tret is Vit A, Niacinamide is Vit B and Vit C) are the workhorses along with sunscreen. 

Microneedling‚ÄîI love it and do it every week or two. I should do it tonight actually. I am aggressive and will needle with Vit C and follow up with tret. Or sometimes just like Matryxl or EGF. Love my Dr. Pen.
Botox as needed and Sculptra is the best filler but by the time you need a filler something else will be out.
But wear your sunscreen! I wake up early and do my morning routine immediately so I often have sunscreen on before sunrise and then I just wear it to the gym but hey, no sun is getting on my face.",1567296248

"communism","t5_2qolz","The Polish Workers Party initially continued their wartime policy of appeasing the non-communist parties and were content with a system of liberal democracy.

&gt;*Before October 1944, Communist Party policy, however, was the eventual restoration of most factories to private ownership in order to create a broad ""democratic front"" of antifascist forces that would carry through basic ""democratic"" (not yet Socialist) reforms.*

However, the plan changed when it became abundantly clear that the majority of the working class favored both nationalization and land reform, hence these policies were implemented.

&gt;*Abandoning their broad popular front strategy, which had been designed to win over progressive small and medium capitalists, the Communists adopted an aggressive strategy designed to win over the spontaneously politicized workers and peasants, who were seizing the factories and land on their own.*

In addition to these policies being implemented due primarily due to the initiative of the people, they continued to be supported in the immediate aftermath as well, whilst the capitalist class simultaneously became increasingly illegitimate.

&gt;*The nationalization of large and medium industrial enterprises was as popular as the land reform and was supported by all the major parties, including the Polish Peasants' Party, as well as by the bulk of the bitterly anti-Russian/anti-Semitic underground. The old wealthy bourgeoisie and aristocracy had been discredited by their leadership of the interwar state and then decimated during the Nazi occupation. There was no popular support for a return to the old economic system. Thoroughgoing socialism was in the air and had, in fact, been spontaneously put in place by the workers immediately upon liberation. In a popular referendum held in April 1946, 77 percent of the population declared they were in favor of the recent economic reforms.*

In fact, such high levels of support for socialism was maintained for decades.

&gt;*A summary of attitude surveys by Polish sociologists, reported in the Scientific American in 1981, concluded: Our surveys in the late 1950s and early 1960s showed that ""the experiment in social learning on a national scale"" conducted by the new regime had succeeded to a certain degree. The great changes in the social and economic organization of the society‚Äî the nationalization of industry, land reform, economic planning, the abolition of the pre-war class structure‚Äî were accepted by the people.*

Despite this, the communists maintained their Popular Front doctrine geared towards a pluralist democracy for a number of years, whilst many of the other parties were gradually won over by Marxism.

&gt;*The Polish Communists, following the Popular Front logic of the international Communist movement, which was heavily emphasized from 1941 to 1947, made every effort (as did the USSR) to build as broad a left-center coalition as possible. Coalition governments involving the Communists, Social Democrats, Peasants' and middle-class moderate parties were the rule throughout most of Europe - France, Italy, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary - as well as Poland. Even officers from the old army were allowed into the new army unless they were clearly rightists. Boleslaw Bierut, the head of the new coalition government, declared, ""We are ready to include in the new government the widest circles of opposition which fully share the decisions of the Crimea \[Yalta\] Conference"". Through 1947 all left and center parties, as well as the Catholic Church, functioned with a high degree of freedom.*

Although a more aggressive policy towards the opposition was adopted later on, this was the result of a culmination of factors regarding the capitalists' reaction against the government's socialist policies. Firstly, the London Poles continued to agitate against the communists via their military wing, the Polish Home Army, which launched an insurgency that the government, assisted by the Red Army, had no choice but to put down violently.

&gt;*The Polish Home Army continued to function after liberation, taking orders from the increasingly rightist and anti-Communist rump London Poles, and fighting against the new regime. In October 1945 the government declared an amnesty for the rank and file of the Home Army. Most Home Army officers ordered their members to cease resisting the government and accept the amnesty. About 200,000 supporters of the Home Army did so. Some smaller rightist groups continued to engage in acts of terrorism, refused to accept the amnesty, and, in spite of the withering away of their popular base, focused on assassinating members of the Soviet Army and Jews.*

Secondly, the remaining right-wingers within the provisional government decided to split off from the coalition and form a new party, which was a direct violation of the Popular Front doctrine. This new development became more concerning as time passed since the remaining anti-Semitic elements within Poland, whom every country in Europe had made a collective commitment to get rid of, began joining the new party.

&gt;*In September 1945 the Peasants' Party split, with Mikolajczyk establishing a new Polish Peasants' Party (which took the majority) and a pro-Communist-oriented Peasants' Party (the minority). Mikolajczyk's Polish Peasants' Party favored not only radical land reform‚Äîland to be given to individual peasant families‚Äî but also the expropriation without compensation of all enterprises employing more than 100 workers per shift, as well as the nationalization with compensation of medium capital. In 1944-47 virtually everyone in Poland supported socialism. Both peasant parties participated in the provisional government through January 1947. However, anti-Communist forces in Poland began grouping around Mikolajczyk and his Polish Peasants' Party, while revolutionary forces grouped around the Socialist-Communist alliance.*

In the election that followed between the anti-communist Polish People's Party and the leftist coalition called the Democratic Bloc, the latter group, spearheaded by the communists, won in a landslide. Although it is often claimed that the result was blatantly fraudulent, the reality is far more nuanced, there was admittedly some foul play but it almost certainly wasn't enough to change the final outcome.

&gt;*Failing to reach an agreement with the Communist-Socialist alliance, Mikolajczyk's Polish Peasants' Party ran a list separate from that of the Democratic Front, in a clear showdown with the left. The Democratic Front was favored by the Electoral Law of September 1946, which disqualified about 1 million persons (about 8 percent of the electorate) from voting on the grounds of collaboration with the Germans or support of the fascist underground organizations, as well as by the fact that the elections were held (probably purposely) in the middle of January, when the rural roads were covered with snow and peasants scattered over the remote areas of the countryside found it more difficult than town dwellers to get to the polls. Beyond disqualifying much of the hard-core right and setting the time of the election to minimize peasant participation, the government engaged in a number of other measures to ensure the overwhelming defeat of Mikolajczyk's party, including disqualifying Peasants' Party lists in 10 of the 52 districts as being composed of rightists and almost certainly falsifying results in some areas where Peasants' Party observers were denied the right to oversee the balloting process. The announced returns gave Mikolajczyk's party only 10.3 percent of the vote (and 28 out of 444 seats in the Sejm), compared with 80. 1 percent of the vote for the Democratic Front. Mikolajczyk's increasing identification with the traditional right that was rallying around him during the election campaign caused many progressives in his party to break with him and support the government list. Although the Polish bishops instructed all Catholics to vote against ""atheistic"" Communism (de facto for Mikolajczyk), many peasants voted for the Democratic Front on the pro-government Peasants' Party/New Liberation ticket. It is not at all clear that given a completely open contest, Mikolajczyk would have replicated the success of the Hungarian Peasants' Party and won a majority of the vote. One Communist leader admitted, ""Had we known before the January election by what a large margin we would win, we would not have engaged in those pressures and minor dishonesties which did take place in many localities"".*

In Britain, where [they have done the research](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review), e-cigarettes are [sold in hospitals and fully endorsed by the National Health Service (NHS).](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/09/vape-shops-open-nhs-hospital-sites-bid-stub-smoking/)

So while we do not know if vaping is safe long-term, here is what we do know:

1. Smoking is absolutely dangerous and leads to serious health issues, including many types of cancer. 

2. Vaping is 95% safer than smoking.

3. [Vaping helps people to quit smoking.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808779?query=TOC) 

Vaping is harm reduction. It helps people to quit or reduce their tobacco intake. In turn, this can reduce healthcare costs related to smoking over time.

I personally am not for lifetime bans no matter the mental illness, but I'm open to restrictions, however some of those require changes to some existing laws.

I also feel different mental illnesses should be treated differently in terms of restrictions, as well as severity levels.

Alcoholism, PTSD, Bi-polar, schizophrenia- your guns and ammo are stored at the range, range master reserves the right to refuse access if you seem unhinged/intoxicated.

Depression, non-functional without medication/therapy anxiety- some kind of red flag laws should exist, people close to them can get weapons removed and the person help should the need arise.

I'm not a mental health professional just someone who loves the constitution, the 1A and 2A the most.

But the statement,

""There just needs to be a path so that other mentally ill people who are currently in possession of firearms can seek treatment without fear of losing their rights for good. Without that they won't seek treatment.""

Is absolutely true.

It‚Äôs stupid because you can see the twist from a mile away because it‚Äôs the same as every other horror story involving a child and a catholic priest, and the ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù foreshadowing isn‚Äôt exactly subtle, I mean come on, a fucking rape monster? What else could you possibly expect the ‚Äútwist‚Äù to be . It‚Äôs unnecessary because it doesn‚Äôt do anything other than pad the game and take you out of the real world which, in some instances, meant we missed out on really important parts of the game, i mean for god sake because of the school story line we didn‚Äôt even see val‚Äôs death, she was like the main villain of the climax and she gets an off screen death because of a stupid story line that doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere! It really feels like the devs only added it in because ‚ÄúWoW iTs ReAlLy ScArY‚Äù, in fact the entire game things just happen that make no sense at all, and you think to yourself ‚Äúwhy did that happen?‚Äù And the answer is almost always ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs scary‚Äù. Why  did I lose my glasses? Because it‚Äôs scary, why did a school hall flood with blood? Because it‚Äôs scary, why did a tongue come out of a well and drag me into a catholic school? Because it‚Äôs scary, why is it raining blood? Because it‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô scary, why am I being chased in a school swimming pool by a rape monster? Because it‚Äôs scary, WHY DID THAT FUCKING GUY, WALK INTO THAT FUCKING LAKE? because it‚Äôs scary, nothing happens for a reason and the school scenes are a perfect example of that",1567296253

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","&gt; the way he designed the human reproduction system there is no difference between woman who suffers a miscarriage and one that causes a miscarriage

Yes, there is. The difference is intent. If I grabbed a pillow and suffocated my husband in his sleep, that's murder. But if he (on his own) rolled off the bed and broke his neck, that's an accident. The result is the same, me being widowed before I even turn 40. But in one situation, it's my fault, and in the other, it isn't.

Also, let's go back for a second to the materialistic way you described human value in your post and say God owns the copyrights of each of us, and he can recall his product whenever he wishes. We, on the other hand, don't own anyone, so any attempt to take a human life is a copyright violation to say the least.

Any abortion is equally wrong, because we don't own our copyright, God does. And when you get an abortion, you are depriving God of what was rightfully his, that child's life.

I didn't know what was going on either so everything seemed new and fresh.

The best moments in the game were spent chatting to strangers who became life long friends or trying to tackle that first raid. I'm hoping some people get something out of classic WoW and it's great to see my nephew, who I introduced to the game during Vanilla when he was still a kid, now playing it as an adult.

I played since vanilla and I completely understand you. The game was magical for me when I was young, I didn't expect it to give me back that feeling. The one thing I have to say about Classic is that watching my friends play, it does still have some of that more immersive open world feeling to me.

I've got a few online pals (Who probably wouldn't ask for money either way), but I prefer spending my time alone, and the only hobbies I have are IT / homelabbing and reading. I don't drink (at all), I hate parties, don't really like even going out for supper. I had a few people I hung out with when I was in school, but even the handful where we ever did anything outside of school have been out of contact for years and I doubt they really remember me (I can remember one guy's name, that's it).


I also did reading on how most people who win end up, and so I know ""give it to all my friends!"" is a great to end up penniless in a few years and still lose all your friends, assuming you aren't stabbed and left in a ditch somewhere.


So don't worry about the dipshit who's getting really invested in saying you are a bad person, because while he says all this shit if one of his friends won he'd be one of those fucking leeches who assumes if he doesn't get what he considers is his fair share you are literally the worst person. And it's totally OK to tell people like that to go fuck off, since they effectively doing nothing less than emotionally abusing you for personal financial gain.


Oh, and also if you ever win as others have said if possible get a legal firm (A good one!) to claim it for you, and then leave as quietly as you can. You'll miss out on telling off your enemies, but you can always give them a call from your phone that they'll never see you again and they'll never get a cent before you disconnect it for a new phone number.


Also, don't claim it immediately: plan your shit out in private without telling a soul for at least a month, talking with a lawyer (remember that legal firm?) and the lottery reps. They might offer planning and legal advice as well. Like, I'm in a good place with my family, I still wouldn't tell them for a month or two while I plan things out and slowly get things going, and then I'd give them a heads up to see how long they need to bug out.",1567296257

"Swimming","t5_2r0po","Your distance per stroke focuses on both kicks and stroke count. But people also forget about the long strides per pull you compose. If that makes sense.

Three days a week I will swim a DPS set, I go 10x100s focusing on counting my strokes per lap. Keeping up my momentum so that I don‚Äôt fatigue in the middle of the workout. This will make you kick. 

I count out loud or in my head every even 100s, kicks. Then count every odd 100s, strokes. Something I do to (pre evaluate counts) is pulling with a buoy for 1x50. Then 1x50 without. 

A couple warm up drills You can do,  fist pulls (trying to catch water with your forearm), sculling drill with or without a buoy (sculling out in front-not crossing Y shape) and pulling with paddles (help to pull more water). You can also do the pause technique, after each pull you do (recommended with a buoy) pause for three to five seconds.

If you swim a season with breaks, count and keep in mind your starting pull count. Feel free to set a goal for yourself. It should be a couple pulls less than your starting number.  Practice long straight strides, not slapping the water, and pulling strong. Once the season is to the end, count your pulls again and see if you‚Äôve achieved your goal!

 ""Hans Rausing tinha uma for√ßa excepcional e, at√© o fim, um compromisso com o empreendedorismo na Su√©cia e em todo o mundo"", afirmou a fam√≠lia em um comunicado.

 Em 1929, seu pai, Ruben Rausing, fundou no sul da Su√©cia uma f√°brica especializada em embalagens.

 Quando estudava na Universidade de Columbia, Ruben ficou fascinado com o que os engenheiros americanos faziam com embalagens.

 A lenda da empresa diz que, na d√©cada de 1940, Ruben estava assistindo sua esposa, Elizabeth, fazer salsichas amarrando as pontas, e se perguntou se um sistema semelhante poderia ser aplicado a embalagens de leite, de acordo com publica√ß√£o do jornal The New York Times, de 2000.

 Ele foi mexendo e elaborando a embalagem at√© desenvolver, na d√©cada de 1950, um pacote barato feito de papel√£o que podia armazenar l√≠quidos sem refrigera√ß√£o. Foi assim que ele criou o primeiro recipiente no modelo de um tetraedro ‚Äîforma composta por quatro lados triangulares, tamb√©m conhecida como pir√¢mide triangular. Esta √© a forma que deu nome √† empresa.

 O uso de caixas em embalagens de leite significava que os produtos poderiam ser facilmente empilhados e transportados, o que transformou a ind√∫stria europeia de latic√≠nios.

 A Tetra Pak foi se transformando em um conglomerado que vendia outros tipos de embalagens e produtos como purificadores de √°gua.

 Em 1965 a fam√≠lia Rausing vendeu esses outros neg√≥cios, mantendo apenas a Tetra Pak.

 Nascido em 1926 em Gotemburgo, Hans Rausing foi respons√°vel por expandir a companhia. Diretor-geral e depois presidente do grupo, ele liderou inova√ß√µes que renderam fama a Tetra Pak al√©m das fronteiras escandinavas.

 O empres√°rio sueco deixa sua esposa, M√§rit Rausing, os tr√™s filhos, Lisbet, Sigrid e Hans Kristian, e sete netos

 A empresa adquiriu a Alfa Laval em 1991, renomada fornecedora de equipamentos para ind√∫stria agroalimentar. O grupo passou a ser chamado Tetra Laval.

 Visando escapar dos altos impostos suecos, a empresa mudou sua sede para a Su√≠√ßa em 1981. A fam√≠lia Rausing, por sua vez, se mudou para a Inglaterra, em Sussex, em 1982.

 O empres√°rio usou sua fortuna para apoiar causas beneficentes, incluindo pesquisas em medicina, direitos humanos e meio ambiente. O valor total de suas doa√ß√µes desde 1998 superou ¬£ 1 bilh√£o   
 (R$ 5 bilh√µes), de acordo com o jornal Financial Times.

 A fortuna de Hans Rausing est√° avaliada em US$ 12 bilh√µes (R$ 49,8 bilh√µes),   
 segundo a Forbes.

 O empres√°rio deixa a esposa M√§rit, os filhos, Lisbet, Sigrid e Hans Kristian, e sete netos.

I've ridden many manual cars but had never experienced heavily engine breaking when I downshifted below 1000rpm and released the clutch slowly. So I think something is wrong with your car. I'm not a car mechanic so don't know about the details. 

But feeling heavily engine breaking when you change the gear from 6th to 5th while going 55mph(3000rpm in the 5th in your car?) is not unusual. It happens to everyone. So I usually rev up the engine when I downshift above 1000 rpm. But I just slowly release the clutch when I downshift below 1000.

&amp;#x200B;

The best way is to know the rpm of each gear at certain speed. Know the rpm in the 5th and 6th when you go 55mph. If 55mph is 2000\~rpm in the 6th and 3000rpm in the 5th, you just rev up the engine to 3000rpm when you downshift from 6th to 5th.  If you do it in a car that is not broken and feel jerky, then it's your fault. Y[ou just need to learn and practice the rev match and timing of releasing the clutch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8etqDZL5abU) There's a lot of videos about gear changes and rev matching so watch those and practice.",1567296263

"communism","t5_2qolz","Not long after this, the remaining anti-communist members of government were removed for counter-revolutionary activities, and the various parties within the leftist coalition formed a monolithic entity called the Polish United Workers Party, effectively confirming the establishment of a socialist state in Poland. Although this sounds rather authoritarian, it is entirely reasonable when put into the proper context, that being the escalation of the Cold War, the forced ejection of communists from the governments of Western Europe as sanctioned by the United States, and the threat of imperialist regime change. The following quote comes from [a biography of Stalin](http://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Deutscher_Stalin.pdf) written by Polish Marxist Isaac Deutscher who, despite clearly being a communist sympathizer, is also a Trotskyist, thus there is little reason to suspect that he is biased.

&gt;*Behind his military shield Stalin accelerated the revolution in eastern Europe. If America‚Äòs economic power enabled Washington to exercise an indirect and discrete political control over its western European allies, Russia could prevail in eastern Europe only by means of direct political control and naked force. The impression which the offer of Marshall Aid had made even in eastern Europe showed how favorable the ground there was for American penetration. The remnants of the Polish, Hungarian, and East German bourgeoisie and large parts of the individualistic peasantry were praying for the nuclear annihilation of Russia and Communism. The working classes were starving. Counter-revolution could still rally considerable strength. True, in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria Communism was still overwhelmingly popular; but in the rest of eastern Europe it was weak or, at least, unable to hold its ground by its own strength. Stalin now resolved to establish it irrevocably; and so, while the Communists were being ejected from the governments of Italy and France, he saw to it that the anti-Communists should be squeezed out of the governments of eastern Europe and suppressed. He installed the single-party system all over the Soviet sphere of influence.*

Additionally, Deutscher believes that the Soviets initially had no intention exporting socialism to Poland, or any of Eastern Europe for that matter, and only came around to it after these events.

&gt;*Nor did Stalin yet give any clear impression that he would sponsor revolution in the countries of the Russian zone. Communist propagandists there spoke a nationalist and even clerical language. King Michael of Romania was left on his throne; and he was even awarded one of the highest Russian military orders for his part in the coup in consequence of which Rumania had broken away from Germany. The Soviet generals and the local Communist leaders did honor to the Greek Orthodox clergy in the Balkan countries. In Poland they courted the Roman Catholic clergy. There was no talk yet of socialization of industry. Only long overdue land reforms were initiated.*

This position is also supported by many others, including writer, journalist and historian Alexander Werth, though his reasoning is slightly different.

&gt;*Finland, which no longer represented any danger to the Soviet Union after the Second World War, continues to be a Western-type democracy to this day, and so does Austria. It has even been suggested by one American historian that Stalin would have been perfectly satisfied if half a dozen ‚ÄùFinlands‚Äù could have been set up in Eastern Europe. But this was scarcely possible in a country like Poland, with its long tradition of Russo-phobia, nor very easy in countries like Romania and Hungary, once the Cold War, with its challenge to Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúsphere of influence"", had got going in earnest, which it did from the very moment the Second World War had ended.*

Finally, Nikita Khrushchev, despite being one of Stalin's harshest critics, refutes the notion that he had any influence over Polish affairs during the immediate post-war years, by providing an anecdote regarding the purges that took place.

&gt;*Then one day, when I was at Stalin‚Äôs he received a phone call. He listened impassively, hung up, and came back to the table where I was sitting. As was his habit, he didn‚Äôt sit down but paced around a room. ‚ÄúThat was Beirut calling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have arrested Gomulka. I‚Äôm not sure it was the right thing to do. I wonder whether they have sufficient grounds to arrest him.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In connection with Gomulka‚Äôs imprisonment, I cannot agree that Stalin was responsible. I knew for a fact, I heard it from Stalin, that he did not order Gomulka‚Äôs arrest; on the contrary, he even voiced doubts about the arrest. He trusted Gomulka.*

I will finish by providing two additional sources, those being eyewitness accounts of people who visited post-war Poland, witnessed the socialist transformation, and confirmed that it was a popular democratic process independent of the USSR.

What he went through was harder than what she went through, but pretending that she did not greatly suffer from this would be plain naive. Imagine raising that child on your own while still being married: the financial burden of raising a child, the social stigma that you face for being married to a violent criminal, the inability to see your spouse, the question in the back of your mind: 'did he do it? is the man I love capable of the things he is being punished for?'.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","People seem not to think about three important factors in a democracy:

1) Democracy in itself is not a very exact term, because there are many forms of democracy, and it is often mixed with other forms of government.

While in the US you essentially get to choose between two parties (though there are morw, but they don't have real influence), in Switzerland you have the choice between many parties which get seats in the parliament. Thus, the 51% are not always the same people or party which form the absolute majority, but a different combination of parties and opinions.

Thus the minorities get more representation, as there's not an absolute 51%


2) Democratic systems tend to be much more stable. When people feel like they had a choice in a decision or some kind of influence, they tend to be happier with their government.

Democracy trades efficiency against stability.

Dictatorships are probably the most efficient forms of government, but also the most unstable. If people are not happy with how your government handles stuff, they get vocal and violent. You get overthrown or can't control your country.

Essentially, dictatorships are dependant on the ones with power, eg the dictator/s.


3) People, who pay taxes and contribute to society with working have a legitimate right to partake in the governments course of action. The citizens are the states raison d'√™tre.

People, no matter how stupid, should have a say in what essentially affects their lives. I believe, that everyone should be able to vote. But people also should live with the consequences of their decision.",1567296265
"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A pouco menos de dois meses da [elei√ß√£o presidencial na Argentina](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/08/pesquisas-sugerem-vitoria-da-chapa-de-oposicao-nas-primarias-da-argentina.shtml), economistas e analistas pol√≠ticos afirmam que o [presidente Mauricio ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/macri-faz-pronunciamento-para-acalmar-mercados-e-alfineta-fernandez.shtml)[Macri](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/macri-faz-pronunciamento-para-acalmar-mercados-e-alfineta-fernandez.shtml) se enfraquece a cada dia e hoje tem menos chances de permanecer no poder, apesar das tentativas recentes de estimular o consumo e recuperar o prest√≠gio com a classe m√©dia.

 A turbul√™ncia que atingiu os mercados na √∫ltima semana e que teve como [ponto m√°ximo a morat√≥ria de parte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/crise-na-argentina-enfim-e-ou-nao-e-moratoria.shtml) da d√≠vida interna tem como pano de fundo um d√©ficit fiscal que, ap√≥s quatro anos de mandato, n√£o foi revertido como prometera Macri.

 Ao contr√°rio, nas √∫ltimas semanas, o [presidente acionou medidas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/bancos-argentinos-vao-precisar-de-aprovacao-previa-para-distribuir-lucro.shtml) para ativar o consumo: prometeu um abono salarial a todos os funcion√°rios p√∫blicos e cortou o imposto que incide sobre os alimentos, entre outras medidas.

 Na sexta-feira (30), ofereceu aumentar em 35% o sal√°rio m√≠nimo, para compensar uma infla√ß√£o que chegou a 54% nos 12 meses at√© julho. Os [trabalhadores pediram](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/aumento-da-pobreza-ajuda-a-explicar-o-declinio-economico-da-argentina.shtml) mais.

 Desde junho Macri mant√©m uma pol√≠tica que subsidia o pagamento em 12 vezes sem juros no cart√£o de cr√©dito em cerca de 200 redes do varejo do pa√≠s, o chamado Ahora 12. 

 O programa √© bancado por recursos que os bancos deveriam deixar depositados no banco central, mas foram liberados para inflar o cr√©dito por orienta√ß√£o do governo.

 O economista Fausto Spotorno, da consultoria Orlando Ferreres &amp; Asociados, afirma que os anabolizantes dever√£o contribuir com 0,2% do PIB (Produto Interno Bruto) neste ano, mas isso n√£o ser√° suficiente para tirar a economia da rota da recess√£o, com uma queda de 1,7% em 2019. 

 ‚ÄúS√£o medidas que n√£o geram impacto porque s√£o pequenas e porque o problema da d√≠vida deprime a economia. Quando capitais come√ßam a sair do pa√≠s, o cr√©dito interno cai e a demanda tamb√©m‚Äù, afirma.

 Para o economista e consultor Marcelo Elizondo, Macri assumiu uma [estrat√©gia econ√¥mica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/macri-faz-pronunciamento-para-acalmar-mercados-e-alfineta-fernandez.shtml) equivocada, que desaguou na atual crise financeira. Em vez de enfrentar o deficit p√∫blico, endividou-se, primeiro com credores privados e depois com o FMI (Fundo Monet√°rio Internacional). 

 A d√≠vida p√∫blica argentina saltou, em seu mandato, do equivalente a 52% para 90% do PIB.

 ‚ÄúO que Macri pode fazer com essa crise? N√£o muito, pode conter seus efeitos, mas n√£o resolver o problema. N√£o pagar vencimentos de t√≠tulos √© uma resposta. Mais adiante, pode ser que imponha restri√ß√µes de acesso ao d√≥lar. De todos modos, s√£o medidas acess√≥rias que n√£o resolvem o problema de fundo‚Äù, afirmou Elizondo. 

 A incerteza econ√¥mica casou-se com a pol√≠tica quando Macri apareceu bem atr√°s do opositor Alberto Fern√°ndez, que tem como vice a ex-presidente Cristina Kirchner. 

 As prim√°rias abertas obrigat√≥rias ocorreram no √∫ltimo dia 11, e as pesquisas apontavam Macri tr√™s pontos atr√°s de Fern√°ndez. No entanto, ele perdeu de 47% a 32%.

 O cen√°rio pol√≠tico muito diferente do que previam os investidores derrubou os mercados nos dias seguintes e aumentou a cobran√ßa sobre uma solu√ß√£o de Fern√°ndez, dado o favoritismo que assumiu na corrida eleitoral.

 O pol√≠tico peronista, no entanto, tem evitado dar respostas. Ap√≥s a morat√≥ria de quarta-feira (28), limitou-se a dizer que Macri estaria ‚Äúcontando os dias‚Äù para deixar o cargo. 

 ‚ÄúEstamos vivendo uma situa√ß√£o pol√≠tica in√©dita causada pelas prim√°rias, que definiram o ganhador muito antes da elei√ß√£o e muito antes da posse. Isso num pa√≠s de estabilidade econ√¥mica prec√°ria pode causar um erup√ß√£o a qualquer momento‚Äù, diz o analista pol√≠tico Marcos Novaro. ‚ÄúMacri n√£o tem mais chances de virar o jogo e n√£o quer aceitar.‚Äù

 Economistas, por√©m, se frustram com a falta de palavras de Fern√°ndez, que tem optado por criticar Macri e o pr√≥prio FMI porque, segundo ele, teriam jogado tudo pela reelei√ß√£o ‚Äîdurante o atual governo, o Fundo liberou um empr√©stimo de US$ 57 bilh√µes √† Argentina.

 Spotorno afirma que os economistas esperam por uma sa√≠da √† la FHC-Lula, em 2002, quando os dois negociaram juntos um novo socorro ao Fundo. 

 ‚Äú√â fundamental que Fern√°ndez diga algo. N√£o temos ideia sobre se ele e Macri v√£o acordar sobre os problemas mais s√©rios do pa√≠s, mas sem isso a economia n√£o funcionar√°‚Äù, disse.

 Elizondo enxerga outra estrat√©gia entre os peronistas. 

 ‚ÄúFern√°ndez n√£o tem de dar resposta √† crise, e √© essa a sua estrat√©gia, deixar que Macri desinfle completamente‚Äù, afirmou.

 As elei√ß√µes est√£o marcadas para o pr√≥ximo dia 27 de outubro.",1567296265

Therefore your spell save DC should be 14 and your spell attack modifier +6.
Also,you need to adjust a few skills: 
Arcana is now +4
Insight is now +7
Intimidation is now +6
Perception is now +7
Passive Perception is now 17.
Your Spell Points are currently 5 in total.

Your Hitpoints feel a little low,my Sorcerer has currently 20 on level 3 (my con bonus is higher,but you still should have a few more).

Question: what Ability Score Improvements did you pick on level 4?

Personally, I would focus more on Charisma instead of wisdom, seeing how it's ypur Caster ability and directly affects your spell attack bonus and spell sace DC, but that's personal preference.

A Bendix drive is a type of engagement mechanism used in starter motors of internal combustion engines.  The device allows the pinion gear of the starter motor to engage or disengage the flywheel of the engine automatically when the starter is powered or when the engine fires, respectively.  It is named after its inventor, Vincent Hugo Bendix.

"Flute","t5_2s7p8","If you only know 3 notes, how can you do a bflat major scale? I'm so confused by so much of this. It sounds like you're not actually even getting the proper tuition you need at all, let alone to be tested. If the teacher himself hasn't taught you the scale and gone through it at least once, he cannot expect you to already know it. This is bad teaching. Bad, bad teaching. 

I need you to understand that this isn't how an instrument should be taught, and isn't going to let you learn properly if this is what it's like and this is your first couple of weeks on the instrument! It's truly ridiculous. I'm horrified for you.

If you need I can link you to a fingering chart which will help you learn the keys for each note. If you really want to continue learning the flute for real, I'd recommend you ask your school for regular individual lessons, or try to talk your parents into getting you semi-regular private ones. I got a half-hour lesson once a fortnight, and managed to get up to ABRSM Grade 8 (in the UK this is sort of the lowest level of ""professional-quality-playing"" when you pass it well) within 2 years, but that itself took a LOT of work.

The real kick in the nuts was the realization that I could build a park I love to death, but the expansion of it only brought it to death. As in, too many guests for any normal gaming PC to handle realistically brought the FPS to a dramatic downward spiral. You can limit guests, yes, but that also limits your funds, so you just can't keep expanding. You'll run out of profits, won't be able to pay workers, and upkeep if there aren't enough guests for your size.

My depression turned into anger.

Anger for how I let my self go 

Anger for not getting the balls to aim for the stars knowing even if I don‚Äôt make I might land on the fucken moon 


And then ... 

I became a super sayan 

All fear left me.

Rejection mean nothing to me anymore 

And that became my greatest weapon as  I began to have sex with many woman as I would ask 10 out a day and get rejected by 7 but always have 1 or 2 who was interested in me 


I had won and surpassed the mental barriers in my mind

The cheapest way is to buy a battery that is of the same age/capacity as the battery under your hood and run an 8GA or larger (fused) wire from the positive of the battery under the hood to the positive on the second battery.  Make sure the second battery is grounded well and if it's a standard lead acid battery make sure it is vented. (buy AGM batteries if you don't want to worry about venting)

3. Trends with the elements, such as increasing/decreasing electronegativity, atomic size, etc. 
4. I would also familiarize myself with converting units, such as grams to kilograms, etc. 

There are probably a few more I'm forgetting, but those are good topics to start with! If you did decent in honors chem, then you'll be fine for chem 1A.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","You're not stupid! As a WoW refugee myself, I understand how overwhelming ESO can be at first. Hopefully I can answer some of your questions!

**Classes:** Throw out what you think you know about classes: In ESO, any class is viable for any role, and can use any equipment. That means a Dragonknight can be a lightly armored Healer with a resto staff, a Sorcerer can equip Heavy Armor and a Sword+Shield and be your stalwart tank, etc. you get the idea. Classes do play differently, and they all have their unique theme, but they're still all capable of fulfilling the basic needs of any given role (DPS/Tank/Healer).

*Templars are Paladins/Priests, Sorcerers are Mages/Warlocks, Necromancers are Death Knights, Nightblades are Rogues/Shadow Priest, Dragonknights are Warriors/Fire Mages, Wardens are Druids (Edit: And Hunters). That gives you a general idea of their theme.*

**Races:** It's very similar to WoW. There are different races that belong to factions, except in ESO there are three factions. When you make a character of a certain race, you are stuck in a certain faction along with your two allied races. If you purchase a Crown Store upgrade, you can play any race in any alliance, but this is only relevant to Cyrodiil (Open world PvP). Each race has their own racial stat bonuses that push them towards a certain role. For example, Bretons have reduced spell costs, increased magicka, and increased magicka regeneration, making them fantastic spellcaster. Redguards meanwhile have the same bonuses, but for Stamina builds instead. These racial traits are nice, but they do not make or break builds: You're free to have High Elf rogues and Orc mages if you wish\*\*.\*\*

**Leveling:** You level each character from 1-50. Once you hit 50, EXP you earn goes towards ""Champion Points"" which go up to 810. So, max level is Level 50 CP 810. Champion Points, once earned, are shared across your account, meaning alts below level 50 can still allocate them, it's very alt-friendly. CP can be used to improve certain aspects of your character, like how much damage they deal directly, how resistant they are to magic, and how exhausting sprinting is for them. Since the world scales, everyone (including the monsters you fight, and the enemies in dungeons) are scaled to Level 50, CP 160. So, as a Level 1, the game will hugely inflate your stats, but that will taper off the closer you get to the aforementioned standard. Due to this scaling, you are never rushed out of zone before fully completing it, and all content (including the drops you get from it) are relevant during the endgame. No content is ever left in the dust! Imagine being able to get Blades of Azzinoth at whatever the current Level Cap is right now in WoW, instead of them being useless at level 70. It's like that.

**Dungeons:** The dungeons in the base game are relatively simple and straightforward. The DLC dungeons are notoriously difficult, and they become even more complex with each new release. The mechanics are challenging, and extremely punishing of failure. Veteran Dungeons are the ""Hard Mode"" for regular dungeons, and they offer unique rewards at the end. There is an option to invoke a ""Scroll of Battle"" at the end of Vet dungeons to make the final boss even MORE challenging. Dungeons also have a storyline that is usually updated on, in a ""sequel"", such as City of Ash II, where you can see what happens after you complete City of Ash I. There are also Trials and Arenas, but those aren't dungeons. There are also Public Dungeons, which can be found in every zone. These are essentially dungeons anyone can enter, at any time, if they find the entrance.  The enemies inside are tougher than the regular enemies outside, but you may also encounter random players inside trying to brave its depths. It's basically just a non-instanced dungeon anyone enter.

**PvP:** There are three different types of PvP. Duels (Same as WoW), Battlegrounds, and Cyrodiil. Battlegrounds feature three teams of up to four players that fight in various minigames such as Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Domination (capture and hold certain points, like king of the hill) Chaos Ball (Hold a relic that does increasing damage to the holder and allies around him, I think WoW has a BG like that) and Crazy King (capture flags that periodically spawn in random locations and hold them as long as you can or until they expire)

Meanwhile, Cyrodiil is the ""open world"" of ESO. It features an absolutely gigantic map with Keeps, Forts, and Outposts. The goal is to work in a group (a huge group, AKA an army/zerg is extra epic) to siege enemy keeps. Ideally, the enemy army is defending with their Catapults, Trebuchets, and Burning Oils against your Rams and Ballistae knocking down their walls and doors. You can also capture resources, gank players, and even 1vX if you're really good (which means you're fighting multiple enemies by yourself).

**Endgame:** Endgame (for me) is considered Veteran DLC Dungeons and Trials. Trials=Raids, I barely raided in WoW so I can't compare the two. There are also Veteran Trials, which after 1 year of playing I'm still too scared to try. You reach endgame at Level 50, CP 300 (at least, people may want much higher CP 300 is bare minimum) when you start doing Vet DLC dungeons and normal trials, and when you have a complete set of gear.",1567296270
"MortalKombat","t5_2robf","I actually don't like Fatal Blows period.

I know it's a game where people get shot at and stabbed numerous times only to fall down to that last crouching jab on their knee, but SEEING all that unreal damage in detail just breaks the immersion for me.

X-Rays were a damn good idea, nothing too fatal, but some serious damage to one's body.

Then came along MKX with ridiculous ""unsurvivable"" moves and Fatal Blows was only a logical progression.

I would be happy if each of them was only one flashy move (not three) and was shocking by it's realism (not absurdity). But I guess there's only so many bones you can break in cool and original manner.",1567296270

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Ap√≥s a capital paulista anotar a tarde mais quente do inverno neste s√°bado (31), com m√©dia de 32,1¬∫C, a aproxima√ß√£o de uma nova frente fria muda o tempo na cidade. O dia ensolarado vai dar lugar a rajadas de vento, nebulosidade, chuvas isoladas e temperaturas mais baixas.

 De acordo com o CGE (Centro de Gerenciamento de Emerg√™ncias Clim√°ticas), √≥rg√£o da prefeitura, na esta√ß√£o de Ja√ßan√£/Trememb√©, na zona norte, os term√¥metros ficaram ainda mais altos, marcando 33,3¬∫C.

 Setembro come√ßa com previs√£o de chuva em v√°rios momentos do dia no Vale do Ribeira e no oeste do estado. Os ventos podem chegar a 60km/h, por causa de um sistema de baixa press√£o associado a uma frente fria do mar.

 O sol ainda aparece no domingo (1¬∫), mas entre nuvens. As m√≠nimas oscilam em torno dos 16¬∞C, enquanto as m√°ximas podem superar os 26¬∞C.

 J√° na segunda-feira (2), as chuvas isoladas v√£o se alternar com per√≠odos de nebulosidade no decorrer do dia. Os term√¥metros variam entre m√≠nimas de 14¬∫C e m√°ximas que n√£o devem superar os 23¬∫C.

 Os chuviscos devem melhorar a qualidade do ar e elevar os √≠ndices de umidade na Grande S√£o Paulo.

 O [clima gangorra ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/07/com-frio-calor-e-chuva-sp-vai-enfrentar-clima-gangorra-com-minima-de-ate-5-oc.shtml)√© comum em agosto. A grande amplitude t√©rmica se d√° em fun√ß√£o de bloqueios atmosf√©ricos que resultam na falta de chuva e consequente eleva√ß√£o das temperaturas ao longo dos dias.

 At√© ent√£o, a maior m√°xima do inverno este ano havia ocorrido no dia 12 de agosto, quando a m√©dia na cidade ficou em 30,3¬∞C. A [tarde mais fria do ano tamb√©m foi neste m√™s](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/08/tarde-deste-sabado-foi-a-mais-fria-do-ano-em-sao-paulo.shtml), no dia 4, quando os term√¥metros marcaram s√≥ 11,7¬∫C.

 A esta√ß√£o, que come√ßou no dia 21 de junho e termina em 23 de setembro, √© comumente um per√≠odo seco em S√£o Paulo. 

 Este ano, no entanto, a quantidade de chuva ficou 91% abaixo da m√©dia climatol√≥gica mensal. 

 A m√©dia de precipita√ß√£o para agosto √© de 36 mm na capital. O m√™s se encerra neste s√°bado com volume total acumulado de 3,3 mm, de acordo com dados do Mirante de Santana do Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia). 

 Isso ocorreu porque as massas de ar frio que chegaram √† cidade, provocando quedas de temperatura, n√£o formaram √°reas de instabilidade suficientes para provocar aumento das chuvas, devido √† baixa umidade.",1567296272

It's actually even ""more"" fine now that Linux is the primary target of the ZFS community project (that's right, ZoL is now the 'norm' before BSD since earlier this year iirc).

It's an awesome filesystem with incredible resilience. Unless you really go out of your way to mess it up, your data cannot be safer.

It is an important skill to learn when it‚Äôs time to stop talking, stop talking back, and stop thinking you‚Äôre entitled to special rules.

When you start the fight, if you‚Äôre on the middle part of the stairs, the Vyr won‚Äôt be able to aim at you, makes wrapping them up a breeze, and the Undying King (UK) doesn‚Äôt do anything for a minute (usually once all four Vyr are killed or after you kill the third one depending how quickly you do it). Once he summons the two little dudes, I back up and just slowly strafe side to side after each volley they shoot. Their shots are super easy to read because of how slow the rate of fire is, and just aiming and shooting while moving side to side is enough to dodge them. You have to adjust this once he summons the other two, but dodging them is still easy if you just stay calm, learn the pattern, and move side to side while shooting. Once he starts to summon the other four Vyr from the pods, immediately stop shooting UK and kill the Vyr as quickly as you can, you‚Äôll be able to damage him plenty after the next phase. Once you‚Äôve damaged him enough, he‚Äôll walk away and summon the little adds, just kill all of them and then DPS UK down to start the second phase.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3.5% of the item price (actually 2.9% plus $0.30), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam.  Additionally, with new Terms of Service, Paypal may begin freezing accounts they suspect of abusing the F&amp;F feature to avoid the service fees.

Genetics play a role in metabolism, which influences your weight. I then proceeded to talk about many other factors that ALSO influence weight, including nutrition. I can only assume you just... decided not to read the rest of my post? 

You then imply that we are genetically perfect which, while a somewhat irrelevant point for me to dispute in my own argument, just isn‚Äôt true... There are plenty of genetically determined features which are not beneficial for our survival. Consider the many, many genetic disorders that exist. And maybe ‚Äúno one weak survived‚Äù in our primitive days, but this hasn‚Äôt been the case for some time now - ‚Äúweak people‚Äù have been supported to live lives they wouldn‚Äôt have previously been able to, for many years. But again, this isn‚Äôt really relevant, because weight is not a genetic disorder. And actually, it would be beneficial in a strange, survival sense, to have a little extra weight, as it serves as a future reserve for tougher times.

**But all this argument about what makes a person overweight and whether or not it is their fault is besides the point of my main argument. Once again, it is unnecessary to make nasty comments about someone‚Äôs weight, specifically in this context. If you don‚Äôt want to date someone you find unattractive, don‚Äôt date them. Don‚Äôt broadcast to others about how unattractive you find certain features.**

"skyrim","t5_2s837","*from one thing, know ten thousand.*

[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory\_consolidation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation)

Ok, the basics: Having played skyrim (though the quote above is actually overwatch, just in case you didn't know), and heard the statement so often the voice is engrained within memory. The catch here is the brain is lazy AF and since it can simply create a relationship between that voice, and that line making it easier to recall if it ever comes up, reading it will inevitably provoke your brains memory of the voice.

Of course, the real trick is - it is your MEMORY of the voice which likely means it is an imperfect recolection but, should you hear the voice again close enough to be recognized as the same.

This is basically the same reason for mistaken identity - your memory of someones face is an imperfect snap shot that is ""good enough for most cases"". Especially as the brain will map voice and other characteristics beyond just the face.

TL;DR - the brain and how memory is handled by it is a super fascinating subject.

In addition, you can actually abuse this quirk in order to purposefully generate associations (see [method of loci - wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) to get into it). Pretty damn awesome stuff.",1567296285

My comments about why he denies the existence of facts does reflect an honest effort to understand why he does that. But understanding isn't the same thing as valuing.

There's a whole thing we could get into about the nature of objectivity, and whether it really exists at all. But I think it's enough to say that there's a commonly accepted view of reality and factual phenomena, and departing from that commonality is something that's both remarkable and dangerous. The danger affects both individuals and entire societies. 

When my interlocutor just flatly said that the declaration didn't happen, with no interest in an alternate interpretation of the event, that was a red flag for me. It's one thing to have an alternate interpretation of an event, and completely another to contest the existence of an event well attested to both at the time - it was worldwide news from many sources and in many perspectives, but not disagreeing about facts - and well attested to in the historical record.

I could be wrong about why his version of reality is not just differently interpreted but differently defined. 

The thing is, some perspectives *are* more valid in some contexts. The truth is preferred when the truth is claimed, and more complete versions of the truth are preferable to less complete versions. But truth is an awfully complex topic, and we don't get more of it by invalidating someone's perspective, no matter which truth or how much or little of it they can see.

Yep he hit a 96 and then did absolutely nothing the rest of the series, averaging 22 which is almost an average perfromance from him. 

If you can count the good performances of a top 6 batsman after 53 innings on 1 hand then he's trash. We don't need more bowling, our bowling has been strong for the most part.

Tbh I'd consider it racism if you only hate brown people for being Muslim, but the word for discriminating against a religion as a whole is sectarianism. Which is still a form of bigotry. So I don't understand when I see people online basically saying ""it's fine, I only hate them because of their religion"". That's not any better. It's being a sectarian shithead.

Considering that this fantasy was basically a rape fantasy anyway, it's hard to say what would've indicated to him that it was actually unwanted unless they had a safe word ahead of time. 

Truly a disgusting human being, but I don't think this story was/should qualify as marital rape based on what I remember reading. Unfortunately, the post has been removed so I can't really be sure of myself here except that I don't remember her saying anything about resisting, insisting he stop, etc. I just remember her saying that it was painful and she didn't have to act like she didn't like it because she actually didn't like it.

What really made him a better fight in MHFU in my opinion was that he left way more consistent openings for the head, he had low head stagger values, one head stagger means he's going down, and when he's going down the wind aura dissipates. And he was not a pain in the ass to fight when he was flying, he left openings for that too (legs and tail, a lot of openings), and with a stagger you could even get him down most of the time. I coincidentially played MHFU in the last few days, and his timings were much more consistent and less erratic, and it was much easier to predict what he was going to do based on your positioning.

As for going into a 2nd year, it's only fans' speculation so far. Largely because there seem to be a lot set up for it. So many of the top players we have been introduced to at Nationals are 2nd years, Miyagi-wise we have Datekou being shown very proactively working on their new lineup and improving their overall skill (like Aone attempted a jump serve, it was out but he's obviously been working on it), likely they'll be Karasuno's strongest opponents at prefectural level, we *have* been introduced to possible next year players (for Shiratorizawa), there's Atsumu Miya saying he wants to set for Hinata, surely we'd get see that at some point. Hinata has grown a LOT compared to the start of the series but he still has a ways to go.

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Normally I only lurk here, but I am going through a massive wardrobe change right now; I'm 41 and a teacher, so I need to look professional but I'm also preparing for the inevitable hot flashes, which have started here and there over the past few months.  All the polyester in my life has got to go, so I'm phasing it out and paring down my clothes; sticking to things like silk and cotton shirts, wicking camis from Uniqlo, and preparing for more layering.  I've also ditched most of my higher-heeled shoes in favor of cute and comfy flats, loafers and boots and booties.  I'm going for less quantity and more quality over all.  Even the underwear has changed from cute little thongs and cheeky things to fuller coverage and higher waists (nothing more annoying to me than wearing low-waisted underwear with high rise pants!).  I'm happy with the direction I'm heading, and hopefully I will have some pieces that last me through the next decade or so of change.",1567296291

We'll be playing Alliance. Not really interested in Warrior or Paladin.  

Mostly leaning towards Hunter or Warlock.  

Warlock pros for me are the variety of builds you can run (1 shot, drainer, tanky), and the self healing.  Areas of concern are pretty much just generally being squishy, tremor totem+wotf because ally, and the lack of mobility.  

Hunter seems like it has a complex and interesting kit overall that seems like it would be fun to play around.  Hunters my biggest concerns are their poor scaling and some of the bugs.

Does either of these combo particularly well with a priest healer?  Playing with a healer the fights have the potential to be more drawn out - will either have issues in this area?

Will I have any issue getting into good BG premades as either?

In 1v1s or 1vX does either class have matchups that are particularly bad?  Does either have a shot at killing a warrior/healer combo?",1567296292

- Whether people have much to hide or not
- How present to the moment they are
- What their intentions are with other people, this one is hard to explain but I can see and feel greed and nefarious energy radiating from the ""wrong"" people
- other high-sensitive people are easy to notice and they notice me too (I've never encountered an HSP with nefarious intent)
- whether they believe and/or mean what comes out of their mouth

Starts off so afraid to stand up for himself and terrified of his own father, filled with so much fear of failure.

I've had a ton of that fear of failure. I impose a fair bit of perfectionism on myself and it's really hard to deal with. It's that destructive societal expectation placed on you - that ludicrous standard that everyone wants you to meet, that the people around you have no trouble meeting. 

And then you learn he was never meant to meet it in the first place. That the only reason his father told him to capture the Avatar was because he thought it was impossible.

And then eventually, Zuko begins to understand all of it is bullshit. That he was raised in an abusive environment. So he tells that abuser to piss off and leaves.

&gt; What's especially disconcerting is how many Americans are one paycheck away from poverty (somewhere between 40% and 60% from what I found). 

I'm assuming you're referring to the paycheck-to-paycheck statistics? This is originally from Charles Schwab, and the purpose of it was not to show that Americans are struggling because they're poor but that Americans struggle [because they overspend on non-essentials and don't devote their money to savings](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/Charles-Schwab-2019-Modern-Wealth-Survey-findings-0519-9JBP.pdf). The problem with the answer you're proposing is that it's based on the idea that Americans are one paycheck away while living frugally. It's not. It's one paycheck away while spending on average \~$500 on ""non-essential stuff, like eating out, entertainment, luxury items, or vacations"" per the study.

And, this goes without saying, but don‚Äôt cheat! When I took 3B with Pete, some people would get the quiz answers from the morning lecture students.

Except this lizard brain instinct is too simple to differentiate actual power like being able to bring a group of people together to raise a barn, or being able to disrupt an enemies plans with no retaliation possible, from valueless power like provoking a reaction from internet strangers.

It's no surprise that trolls are typically shut ins with little forms of actual power to speak of. Trolling is the low hanging fruit for them to feel some vague semblance of power. Actually putting work into having the power to affect people in meaningful ways takes way more effort.",1567296302

So the stem of my debate comes from that.

I will say, I hadn‚Äôt considered Japan. I have read similar accounts of prejudice in Japan; Africa, too. And I have found that many of the people who say you cannot be racist to white people are Americans, and that alone is another nuanced topic of discussion.

This is the opposite of the truth. The police started the violence without a good reason.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","This was a major concern for me in early pregnancy.  I couldn't even picture myself holding a baby, let alone how I was going to raise it or what kind of mother I would be.

A psychologist in our OBGYN department took a liking to me for some reason (probably as a result of my alcoholism and depression/anxiety issues) and I was fortunate enough to have monthly phone check-ins with her.  

When I brought up concerns about this ""new identity"" I felt I needed to form very quickly, she brought up the term matrescence, which she believes is more relevant now than ever, but unfortunately there is still not a lot of research done on it or information available.  She explained since a lot of women and families are waiting until later in life to get pregnant/have children, they often have strong identities already established and suddenly working this foreign motherhood identity into that can be scary.

My approach so far has been to:

* Remind myself that no one knows what the fuck they are doing, so give myself a gentle mental and emotional space to figure out what being a mother/family means to me.
* Not hold myself up to the ideals and expectations of anyone else.
* Hold my already established identity up as a reminder that I have overcome a lot and made it this far in life, so I can handle whatever this new chapter throws my way.
* Remember there is still another party in this I have not even met yet, and her little (or big) personality is going to largely shape the type of mother I am.

For what it's worth, I feel like things are slowly revealing themselves to me as I progress through pregnancy and my anxiety surrounding having a baby has been dissipating.  I still have moments of ""Holy shit in two months there is going to be a fucking baby in this house,"" but I am more excited than terrified.

If you are interested, [here is a short article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/well/family/the-birth-of-a-mother.html) (re-)introducing matrescence.  It doesn't go into a lot of detail, but the author is probably trying to slang her book.  It has mixed reviews, so I am on the fence about buying it.",1567296305

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","&gt; You say that goodness is commensurate with God's essence. Therefore God is goodness. But this is circular. You are defining God as being good by his very essence, and then using that to say that God is good. It is just a tautology. Perhaps God is good, but with all respect, you have not proven it here. Remember that you may have read and accept Aquinas and other Catholic philosophers' arguments, but I do not (not that I necessarily disagree on everything either).

It's not a tautology, it's simply a definition. You are using the assumption that God and Good are two separate things. I'm saying that God and Goodness are the same thing. It is an axiom. You may believe it or not, but we're discussing the limit of rational argument. 

Aquinas' position, by the way, mirrors this. He never explicitly discusses Euthyphro as far as I know, but in his argument, good is not arbitrary because God cannot change his own nature, which is goodness. God, for example, cannot alter the Ten Commandments. Again, you are relying on a linguistic trick to refute me. You're essentially making the ""can God make a rock so big He can't life it"" argument. The answer is that it's a meaningless sentence that only represents linguistic, not actual, conflict. 

&gt; If God must agree with the Natural Law, it seems to make God's power limited

This thread makes the same error. God's power *is* limited in the sense that He cannot alter his nature. In our terms, He cannot change what's Good, which is Himself. This is why there's no need to discuss Divine Command Theory - goodness isn't arbitrary.

&gt; It's just that time spend praying the Rosary, intending to serve God, could be spent helping our neighbors, and with the latter I do not have to take a leap of faith because I am 100% (or 99.999%, which is close enough) certain that goodness exists in the world and that helping others is this goodness in action.

This misunderstands the purpose of the Church, which is to continue the work of Christ. Helping our neighbors is only one purpose of the Church. The Church also exists as a structure for us to grow in virtue and holiness and to offer to God the praise and gratitude we owe Him.

Helping people is great, but it's not a complete replacement for participation in the sacramental life of the Church. 

&gt; I don't want to hand over my conscience to an external authority when I am far, far, from 100% certain that this external authority is moral. At the risk of being prideful, I trust my own conscience before I trust the Church. I believe that modern liberalism, or modernism, is a very good thing with a few notable exceptions, and the Church seems to think the opposite. The United States banned slavery before the Catholic Church did. And so did France and Britain and pretty much every Western country. I trust whatever this spirit is ahead of the Church for now (I call it modernism or liberalism, but perhaps this is the wrong label, but whatever it is to be called I trust it more). By the way, there were other Christian denominations which did indeed ban slavery far ahead of the Civil War in the US, like the Quakers.

Not sure you have your facts straight here. 1) your comparison is sort of inapposite, since the U.S. is a state with legal sovereignty over that issue and the Catholic church isn't; 2) The Church's doctrinal positions on slavery are complex, but the simplest response is that the Church has always been concerned with the treatment of people in servitude (medieval religious order like the Mercedarians existed to ransom people out of slavery) and the Church began banning slavery in the 1500s thanks to Bartolome de las Casas and others.

The greater point here is that you're right. You're indulging your own pride and measuring what's moral against yourself as the baseline. You are making yourself the standard for morality, which, in my experience, just doesn't really go anywhere in the long run.

&gt; Of course I could reply with similar type of arguments to the contrary, and I will say that the Catholic Church's history is far darker than most Catholics think, because they have been reading biased history.

Catholics are generally very aware of the Church's failings. It's a constant discussion within the Church. ""A hospital for sinners"" as they say.

&gt; I will bring up one argument in Lutheranism's defense. Lutheranism is far more forgiving on the subject of Hell, because of course Luther had major scruples about Hell. And I think this goes far better with the Natural Law. One missed Mass, or one mortal sin in anything, and this could lead to Hell is my single biggest stumbling block (though I have plenty more). So if Mother Theresa missed Mass once, with full knowledge and deliberate consent, and didn't repent, she is in Hell? It honestly makes me so angry at God. (And to prebut the argument that really good people don't commit grave sins, look at Winston Churchill or MLK Jr., or all sorts of people who saved lives during the Holocaust. I mean humans are so complex. Most great moral heroes committed affairs or missed Mass or looked at pornography even after their heroic deeds. It is the rare moral hero who didn't.)

I think the best way to respond to this is to first clarify what I mean by Natural Law. Natural Law is a sub-set of the Divine Law, in the sense that Natural Law is the structural representation of the Divine Law by which we are obligated to structure our life. There are also directly revealed elements of Divine Law which are not part of the Natural Law. I don't think Luther's position on hell is best considered under the Natural Law, but rather the revealed Divine Law. 

Nevertheless, in my opinion, you're still making the error of starting with what *you* think the rule should be and thinking the Church is wrong because it teaches otherwise. But from even a *neutral* position, there's no inherent reason why missing Mass, masturbating, or anything else shouldn't lead to hell. To me, it sounds like saying ""I don't agree with my doctor, it seems like BS that if i just don't breathe for 3 minutes I'll be dead?"" 

But finally, the Church doesn't *ever* state that *anyone* is definitely in hell. We pray for the souls of the deceased, because God acts mysteriously. The Church explicitly teaches that acts of perfect contrition can engender justification. So if Mother Theresa just said ""screw it"" and then died an hour later, we are perfectly right to hope and pray that she repented before she went. That's between her and God.",1567296306

Whereas there's a general belief that homosexuality is inborn among researchers, gender is culturally constructed and any phenomena arising from that , such as [transgenderism](https://cl34nslate.tumblr.com/post/185240716556/is-julia-serano-right-that-transwomen-are-female#notes)can therefore be categorized as a response to culture. As someone else has said,

&gt;The cis/trans linguistic binary implies there‚Äôs only 1 way to reject gender stereotypes associated w sex: you either accept them or you reject them by transitioning. It doesn‚Äôt allow a third way:eg rejecting stereotypes by changing society, not the individual body (aka feminism)

This survey from a pro-trans organization found that more attempted suicide AFTER transition:

&gt;Those who have medically transitioned (45%) and surgically transitioned (43%) have higher rates of attempted suicide than those who have not (34% and 39% respectively).

&gt;As recently as last year, a [17-clinic qualitative study ](https://4thwavenow.com/2015/11/04/skeptical-gender-therapist-a-medical-doctor-is-not-a-candy-seller/)reported on doubts some clinicans have about aspects of¬†‚Äúaffirmative‚Äù treatments for children:

&gt;***As long as debate remains ‚Ä¶ and only limited long-term data are available, there will be no consensus on treatment.*** *Therefore, more systematic interdisciplinary and (worldwide) multicenter research is required.*  
&gt;  
&gt;One would hope that the state and medical establishment had taken great care with something that may permanently affect children and families. But this radical change is not based on recent medical breakthroughs. [There is no amazing new science suggesting that state-run medical plans serving the most needy and vulnerable people should now put children as young as 10 years old on puberty-blocking hormones if they are ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù as ‚Äútransgender.‚Äù](https://sexnotgender.com/2013/03/20/activism-to-normalize-gender-transitioning-now-comes-at-childrens-expense/)

You could rent a 1-room flat for 300 GEL per month in the outskirts of Tbilisi. Utilities would cost you about 30 GEL if you don't overuse the electricity. 5 GEL should be enough to cover your call needs on a phone and you can get internet at your home for 30 GEL per month at an okay speed of 20mbps. 85 GEL should be enough to cover your transport expenses (assuming you don't have a car). There we are on 450 GEL. 

400 GEL is enough to feed you well, even if you like to eat chocolate, drink some good coffee/tea, cakes, etc once in a while. That's around 850 GEL total. If you don't want to drink tap water, 5l bottle can be bought for 2 GEL. 75 liters of drinking water should be enough per month, so you can buy that for 30 GEL total. We sit on 880 GEL now. Around 60 GEL per month should cover you for surgical masks and other hygiene items like soaps, toothpastes, shampoos, razors, toothbrushes, toilet cleaning products, etc. Another 60 GEL should be enough for going to a decent gym and being geared up. Now we sit on 1000 GEL of expenses.

There we are with extra 618 GEL per month. You can use that to save up, buy clothes, spend on fun, it's plenty. Lets say ""extra"" expenses cost you around 118 GEL and round it down to 500, and save up. You'd get 6000 GEL of savings per year (1850‚Ç¨).

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","I agree with him that that sheer amount of versatility, regardless of if the player uses it very effectively or not, should only be on Sorcerer. This takes quite a few of the really good things about Sorcerer and plops it on Wizard. The whole point of a Sorcerer is that you don‚Äôt get Wizard‚Äôs insane spell list, instead focus more on either a specific kind of spell or sheer versatility in your ability to cast them. This undermines that concept entirely. If you wanted a subclass capable of Metamagic, that‚Äôs one thing, but to take both metamagic and spell points is a bit rediculous. 

Also, regardless of that, changing a spell‚Äôs damage type is good enough to be its own feature and not part of a different one. Also, it‚Äôs already a thing, on Unearthed Arcana‚Äôs Lore Wizard. You‚Äôre taking too much from other things all at once.

I do agree with another commenter, however- I think this would work well as a 10-20 prestige class that requires levels in both. It would continue a subclass if your choice, either Wizard or Sorcerer, and then offer a different set of perks like the complete Spell Points system. It would also make the most sense, as you‚Äôve already got a name for it- Archmage. Taking the best attributes of both traditional casters, and making a mage superior to them in several ways.

"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","Wondering if anyone had some data on a notion I see floating around a lot of right-wing/libertarian places.

There's an idea that \[Gen Z / iGen / whatever the name is for people born after 1995\] are significantly more conservative than the generation before them (millenials). Something like that wouldn't be completely unprecedented (e.g. in Family Ties, Michael J. Fox's character represents a young generation turned on to Reagan-style conservatism clashing with their hippie boomer parents) but anecdotally I can't say I've seen much evidence to support that trend. 

While there definitely exist conservative groups among people my age (for reference: born 1997) the modal view among them seems to be moderately to significantly left of center.  Moreover, most media targeted at young people (looking at you, Teen Vogue) is significantly more fueled by identity politics than corresponding media with older readership. I'm left wondering whether my own anecdotal experience is wildly skewed from social sorting or whether the supposed studies showing an increase in conservatism among my generation aren't up to snuff (youth voting patterns seem to support the latter). When you get into disentangling age effects vs. cohort effects, the picture becomes even more unclear.

What do you all believe are the most reliable statistics and trends about the politics of the young, and what do you think those predict about the future of politics in the US and worldwide?",1567296310

Obesity comes from your excessive diet and lack of exercise, assuming you don't have very rare health condition.

Look at obesity rates historically :  in the 1950's in America the Obesity rates were around 10%, today they are around 40%. If obesity were caused by genetics, this would mean that the genes prevalence in our society quadrupled in only a couple generations, which is an unheard of level of mutation in a such a large population.",1567296311

Center-pivot irrigation (sometimes called central pivot irrigation), also called water-wheel and circle irrigation, is a method of crop irrigation in which equipment rotates around a pivot and crops are watered with sprinklers. A circular area centered on the pivot is irrigated, often creating a circular pattern in crops when viewed from above (sometimes referred to as crop circles). Most center pivots were initially water-powered, however today most are propelled by electric motors.

If the circumstances and failures of my life are my fault because of who I am, then it means they're also under my control. I can change who I am. The first step is to change the belief that I can't change. The second step is to believe that I'm a person who is productive and creative and whatever I need to be to tackle my lack. The third step is to take small steps in living out my ""new identity"" and taking responsibility for my actions. The people who change their own circumstances (and the world) are the people who believe they can do it because self-identity is simply a mental construct and the story we tell ourselves to justify being a certain way. We act in ways that are congruent with what we have convinced ourselves that we are.

The moment ww blame external circumstances for the circumstances in our life is the moment we become a victim of our own choosing beyond the actual unfortunate circumstances that we literally could not control. The one thing we can always control is our attitude and reaction to the cards we are dealt.

The T18 tips on the FX888D are definitely better (less temperature deviation and better thermal conductivity), but that's not going to be the difference between a successful and non-successful repair. It only helps people improperly use the wrong tips (small tip to heat a large copper region without the tip getting stuck).

Spend the $50-$60 on the cheap combo station, and learn proper technique (e.g. properly tin the tip, and operate at 330C).

I have a nice Metcal that I picked up from a liquidation sale, but rarely use, because the $50 &lt;generic Chinese brand&gt; 862D+ 2-in-1 does just fine. I end up building about a board a month (100-300 placements), and have never thought to myself that the cheap station was performing poorly enough that switching on the Metcal beside it would make my life better.

If I were in a production environment, the Metcal's temperature response could help with takt time, but it won't do any better than a properly tinned tip when you're only hitting a couple hundred points in an hour. For repair, this matters even less.",1567296318

The main character has a problem where he can't learn anything through the brain upload. He struggles for a while until a secret government agency finds him and tells him that he is special because of his problem. They need people like him to try things a different way and discover new things that the normal people cannot because of how they are all educated in the exact same way. I can't remember who wrote the story or what anthology I read it in.

The point is that I think society benefits from people like Jaimie who are willing to go their own way. It's not realistic to say that everyone should be like him, but I don't think he should be criticized for rethinking the basics. You can't deny that he is good at inventing things.

His strengths are his weaknesses at the same time. He is stubborn and independent, which helps him succeed at what he does and also makes him think some pretty stupid stuff.",1567296319

For TV programming, location work and SFX was pre-filmed on 16mm, while all interiors were recorded on tape. The 16mm inserts were TKed to tape in real time during the studio sessions. It was from this final as-live tape that playout master was dubbed. Film prints were only struck for export. The exception was the content shot by Lew Grade's ITC which was primarily produced for export to the US market (The Prisoner, Thunderbirds, The Avengers, The Muppet Show etc.) as this was shot on 35mm with standards conversion in mind.",1567296319

Ivanhoe () is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1819 (all first editions carry the date of 1820, but it was released at the end of December 1819) in three volumes and subtitled A Romance. At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England. It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels.

Ivanhoe is set in 12th-century England with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You need to talk about what you saw. Otherwise it will just boil up and ultimately ruin the relationship.  Do not talk with her about what you saw until the three weeks are up.  Right now you need to be the best partner you can be and be by her side even if she doesn‚Äôt seem like she wants you around (unless she lashes out and says to leave her alone).  If you guys normally check in with each other- do so.  Say goodnight and say good morning (if you guys do that regularly).  Do not be defensive.  Do not get angry at her for something you read that should have been private.  In this situation you are at fault and need to make it up to her.  

If she loves you enough, she will forgive you and you guys will move past this.  What you need to do is have a serious conversation with her about what you saw and your concerns.  Do not get angry with her.  After this conversation- never discuss the things you saw and give her your full trust.  Do not go through her things ever again.  

Only do this if you can manage giving her your full trust.  Are you able to get over the things you saw?

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Yup, I agree if you're accepting that there is no objective suffering. Hence, to you, the only satisfying solution God had available is to have never made humans at all. Right? That seems to follow necessarily.

&gt; The logical consequence of ""there is no instance of suffering that is gratuitous"" *is* to never seek to prevent any suffering.

That's not actually true, but I don't know if it matters to you enough for me to comment on. Basically, one can believe there is no gratuitous suffering, as I believe, and yet still have the moral imperative to stop suffering, as I do, because moral directives are a separate thing from the ontological nature of suffering.

&gt;If there's a single instance of suffering that you think should be stopped, that is enough for a problem of evil. Because if it should be stopped, why isn't God stopping it? An answer may be ""God knows better and knows that it in fact shouldn't be stopped"", but if you know this, you wouldn't hold that the instance should be stopped. It's just not logically consistent.

This seems wrong to me. What if I think that the existence of God should be stopped, or what if I think the existence of only logically-possible things should be stopped, ushering in the need for logically impossible things to occur? Seems to run into absurd scenarios.

And, anyway, there is nothing inconsistent about thinking there is no unnecessary suffering, yet trying to stop forms of suffering that you can stop. For example, I think suffering is a fundamental and unavoidable part of human existence, and I think that the potential for suffering must pretty much be infinite for any willful creatures. It's a necessary fact of reality that could never have been another way. And yet, I have a moral imperative to stop whatever sufferings I can.",1567296323

Once the rules were in play, then it follows what happens, but does not interfere because to do so would corrupt the integrity of the experience. I think anything resembling judgement would be more akin to feeling that aspect of the game wasn't working well and that player should be abolished from future versions.",1567296324

People with lactose intolerance don't go around saying they're allergic to dairy, even though their bodies straight up cannot handle it. An allergic reaction is a pretty defined set of symptoms in response to an allergen. With lactose intolerance and diabetes, there's no immune reaction to the foods, ergo not an allergy. Also, my dude, read a bio textbook or something please. Just because you're not eating carbs doesnt mean your body doesnt have to use insulin to process glucose. The keto diet is called that because, when not eating carbs, the body converts other foods into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis - byproduct of this process: ketones. You need insulin to then use this converted glucose. No one can survive without insulin for long (be it exogenous or endogenous).",1567296324

Legacy going full steam ahead with EVs will be amazing for expanding the segment. EV understanding/acceptance is still very low, and has gotten where it has almost purely thanks to Tesla. I believe there is a silver lining to the slow adaption however:

It gives Tesla time to boost its production capabilities. I'd love to have competition come in and boost EV awareness, and in turn demand, but I would REALLY love if it happened once GF4 is up and Tesla can produce the 1m+ yearly cars to feed that demand. For now, I'm happy with the pretty much solo game Tesla's playing.  


EDIT: To answer your question: ""People"" are still buying ICE because most people are slow to change. Advertising works because people like being told what's good and taking solace in the hive mind. This will all change when legacy goes full EV with their billions in advertising budgets.",1567296324

The steel pipe is ~13 - 20mm thick radially.

The ceramic lined pipe is inside a borehole so there is no way to access the outside of it, therefore it has to be done on the ID. The steel pipe is up on hangers and while it can be done on the OD it would be better to be done on the ID to not have to constantly be moving the EWP and other accompanying equipment. I would consider external equipment specifically for the bends as I imagine most of the probes won't cope to well with a 90¬∞ or 180¬∞ pipe bend. If there is ID mounted equipment that can be easily and quickly removed it be useful but it would mean that we might miss scanning the pipe when we get to a section where it is on the hangers.",1567296325

That's the part I disagree with the most. You can disable most of the Google services you don't want to use, disable diagnostic reports and opt in or out for information gathering.

As for updates Samsung isn't the biggest offender in that regard. I use a S9 and while I'm not getting updates every two weeks I still get them. Also, quality of updates &gt; quantity of updates. And 'shitty quality apps' is such a false blanket term that I'm not even going to try to disprove that. Not only have my experiences from apps downloaded from the Play Store have been quite positive, there are also more apps from the Play Store than Apple's App Store, and not all of them are 'crappy'.

"cyprus","t5_2qyof","&gt;we have to consider that there are gonna be two far right parties whose believes are gonna be opposed in many areas. 

Only far right party is ELAM, with a dozen of real supporters. There won't be two far right parties or whatsoever to be fair.. 

Some political parties already have their connections, while some don't. But they'll be getting together if they happen to share common goals, if we got to reunify the island. At the end, they have to in order to function. 

&gt;So when we see countries with similar races get split,

There are no 'radical' differences between two communities. We are closest to each other, and pretty much the same when it comes to genetics. Our differences is about the ethnic self-identification and our religous backgrounds.

We also don't have 'countries' on the island. There hasn't been a North Cyprus or South Cyprus, etc. through the history. Both communities were spread all around the island, and villages were rather mixed, or divided into two, or just close by to some other village from the other community. Separation happened with the war, and before that the heterogeneity was disturbed with Turkish Cypriots being driven out and/or fled into more homogenous pockets.

We don't have any other country to go, and don't have any other way than living together. We won't be repeating the 63-74 process for sure, and unless someone tries to annex the island there won't be any other 74 either. We just need to agree on some common ground, then start to live together and get normalised - and during that process, hopefully see any military presence and whatnot of foreign countries out of the island.",1567296326

The Taurus specifically is a low cost, low value, low quality item.  It is still in production, and has no specific association that would lend value. The 454 round is a novelty, and neither cheap nor fun to fire.

All of this combines to indicate that you would get, at best, 3/4 of the 'normal street price' of the gun for resale - normal street price is not MSRP. Taurus can say 'this gun is valued at 10,000$, but we're selling it for 5, look at the discount!'.

That means the gun is street priced at 5$, regardless of the documentation.  And a cursory search shows the Raging bull is 400-500.

So you would be looking at resale of 250-350 in a reasonable world. If that means 'break even' OK. If it doesn't, then don't buy the gun.",1567296329

Why do you think that's likely in say the next 50 years? The housing situation got so horrible, legislators are finally having to act to change policies that caused it. More housing and better policies mean an end to spikes. Of course it depends on how casually you want to define a spike.

When there's recessions, rents are unlikely to fall more than 50%. With landlords allowed to raise rent inflation+5%/yr, as rents recover post-recession within 10 years landlords will have brought rents back up 50%. Smoothing the pace of rent increases by several years is something plenty of landlords will put up with if they have a good tenant. Remember that 10 year recovery time only applies if rents actually fall 50% but it's unlikely to be that much.",1567296329

Me and my best friend at the time (lets call him Sam) got into a small argument over some random thing (i dont remember). Things escalated quickly as he starts to try and get violent with me. We were both 10 at the time, so we were getting to the age where we thought fighting was cool. However, I didn't want to fight, so i try and calmly back away. He tells me that i need to give him $40 by the next day or he'd say some sh\*t about stuff that isn't true to the school authorities (probs about me cheating on tests and threatening people). I gave him the $40 because I was fearing for what he would do. After this, I stopped talking to him and ended up telling the school, which ended up with the kid getting in trouble with the police.

You were the one I've always believed to be the next guy to make it into F1, on your pace and dedication alone.

It's been a tough call to make the step over to Arden, after ART preferred to take over de Vries and Mazepin. But you've proven us all wrong, made the Ardens look like they are some competitive cars, brought us joy when you won in Monaco and even won on home soil.

You'll be missed, by family, friends and fans all over the world. Keep on racing, mate, wherever you are now.

For casual stuff, Ivy is great for a range of body types.  The same breathing room that makes skinny young dudes look rumpled makes bigger guys look relaxed.",1567296333

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","&gt;Data leak can only be protected if the machine is secure. Don't get me wrong. Linux is secure but do you think the OP is a Linux sys admin?

Forced encryption of the VM in Parallels is all it takes, it's just a check box, they even have pre-made VM images. To use Linux you don't need to be a SysAdmin. My personal Windows and Linux VMs technically have two levels of encryption, the OS X hdd itself is encrypted by default (I work for a major multimedia streaming company) so all my company related shit is protected, then my personal VM disk images are encrypted with a different password and fingerprint auth, so they couldn't get in even if they tried if they reclaimed the laptop, most they can do is delete it.

Even if he wanted to install Linux on it natively he could just use LUKS to encrypt the disk, its not difficult and requires a boot up password. The great thing about Linux is its secure *by default*. You have to do tons of things to reduce the security of the OS, unlike Windows which gives you admin access by default. OS X takes the completely opposite approach and locks everything down like Fort Knox, essentially neutering the root account, which would piss off any Linux user. Wanna install 3rd party apps not from the app store? Be prepared to jump through hoops! Even with that approach, it's still inherently less secure than Linux.

If you really are interested in the security of the 3 look up the Pwn2Own hacking competition. Its a weekend security conference where 3 laptops are connected to the network for the weekend (1 windows, 1 linux with SELinux or AppArmor enabled I believe and 1 OS X) and teams attempt to ""own"" the laptops via exploits.

I believe that round two would either end in a draw or a loss on your side, since Big Z would lead and motivate Dora and Boots to work their hardest AND Dora and Boots would have the advantage of knowing how to work together due to past experience of playing. It'll be a hard fight, but if you play defensively, you can survive them all, especially if Big Z or Dora holds off to direct or wait for a kill.  


The bonus round is easy: YOU GUYS STOMP any neighborhood, including mine. I could see a problem with Boots, since he is the weak link, but if you protect him then you guys can take down the human prey like insects. PLEASE DON'T ATTACK!",1567296336

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I'm _cautiously_ optimistic that this new map will be better, though. The walls are only the first line of defense; they're visible at the very bottom of this image. The rest of the map is restricted high-ground, perfect for Handgunners or artillery pieces, with enough wide-open space for cavalry to execute charges if needed.

Basically, the new map provides more opportunity for open-field battles with favourable terrain, and focuses less on the terrible wall mechanics of TW:WH2. Maybe that'll be enough to make it good. If it works, then maybe this logic will be applied to the siege battles in TW:WH3, which would be the absolute best change possible for the third and final part of the trilogy!",1567296338

I‚Äôve been all over the world and in 3 different continents. I have felt less freaked out by the smell of weed on street corners than stumbling rowdy drunk people to be honest. Your less likely to start shit when stoned than drunk. 

Your not going to give me ‚Äúeliminates crime‚Äù? Id disagree completely. If you dropped the drinking age, you‚Äôd still get underage drinkers. If you legalise cannabis you won‚Äôt get illegal cannabis smokers. It completely eliminates the illegal import of cannabis and eliminates the need to purchase the most popular UK drug from dealers.  This means the money is redirected into the economy and not to drug dealers. Not to mention the reduction in crime because stoners are too stoned to move lol. But seriously, it‚Äôs one thing to sell weed it‚Äôs another to push heroin or coke. The numbers of dealers will drop and police won‚Äôt waste time picking up weed smokers, while it is mostly a blind eye offence there are still investigations and crap that‚Äôs a waste of time. 

The money argument is the main thing that will make it legal. New jobs, new UK industry and TAXES. It‚Äôs coming soon now a matter of ‚Äúif‚Äù but when. 


Well.. prostitution is technically but I know it‚Äôs officially legal in Australia.. and there is 2 billion made from taxes, human trafficking has been completely stopped, the women are safe/tested/well paid and protected. Not to mention divorce rates have dropped 11%. Happy days.",1567296339

Mao orchestrated a mass extermination of sparrows in order to try and boost food productivity and killed 10's of millions with the locust induced famine that followed soon after. Are you suggesting that this never happened and the government killed tens of millions of Chinese on purpose and then starved a bunch of people to create fake evidence about what happened? Or did Mao secretly have a degree and scientific understanding of ecology and biology, and have the sparrows killed because he *secretly* knew the locusts would fill the void and eat the crops instead, and kill a bunch of people indiscriminately including loyal communists, which is it?

"vintagemotorcycles","t5_2skny","Im actually in the process of taking the previous owner to small claims court over the condition of the engine as he advertised it as a perfect running engine which it obviously wasn‚Äôt.

The cam bushing was shattered and turning in the crankcase, the idler gear in the timing case broke the stay bolt and wore the crankcase hole so oval it was a few thou away from wedging against the crankcase which would‚Äôve grenaded the whole assembly, one of the cam rollers went kaput which spread metal throughout the engine destroying the oil pump, right bearing journal/rollers/crank journal etc etc.
The right rollers were in the worst condition I have ever seen in my life, they worse the bearing race so far that the roller cage started hitting it which if it went any further would‚Äôve again locked up the whole engine. They looked like sandpaper and also completely destroyed the crank journal.
The left side bearing race spun in the crank half for so long I doubt a oversized race would‚Äôve fixed it.
The rod assembly was fairly fucked aswell and would‚Äôve needed replacing most likely as t would‚Äôve been cheaper than rebuilding them.

The biggest thing that bothered me was that the previous owner recently replaced the cam cover (for one not centerbored ofcoarse) which would‚Äôve made the idler gear fall into their lap and the crank end play had a ridiculous amount of play to it which they could easily notice, and it came from a ‚Äúreputable bike builder‚Äù

Looking at the card he linked in the thread, it doesnt look like it would fit perfectly in the adapter I was suggested. I was curious if there is a difference. 


My motherboard is a gigabyte z370n wifi and I was going off of [this guide](https://hackintosher.com/forums/thread/success-guide-mojave-10-14-6-vanilla-hackintosh-deluxe-gigabyte-z370n-wifi-i5-8400-970-evo.704/).

However, we have had problems with the ice maker where it makes so much ice that it can't dispense any more. When that happens, we just chisel off the giant block of ice that it makes and put it in the sink so it can melt. After that, it works fine.

There is a good amount of sediment build up on and under that little black plate below the nozzle. The nozzle itself has a lot. I've been needing to replace the water filter but I haven't had the money to do it. I'll post a link below to a pic of the sediment. I live in a place where the water has a lot of sediment, but I also haven't cleaned this part of the fridge in a while.

Can you give me some links to the parts I need and possibly a YouTube video tutorial if you can? That would be a great help!

Don't necessarily shy away from the GUI, but learn how to control and create using shell sessions. You will learn a lot more about Linux from a terminal. Here's an example:

     $ inxi -Fix

This simple command will tell you a huge amount about your system, in a way that no GUI app can provide. This one command by itself is enough to justify keeping a terminal session open at all times.",1567296346

"sewing","t5_2sczp","They are both very much (popular) beginner machines and you should just keep that in mind. Thick seams of jeans will be a struggle and fur and vinyls are a struggle in their own. I have heard good things about the Singer's ability to handle that sort of stuff above its pay grade, but I feel it's worth mentioning the ""Heavy Duty"" moniker is because it has a metal chassis but still plastic gears. All I'm saying is don't expect these to last you a decade or anything, but certainly great options for your situation

Anyway the main difference I see between these two is that the Singer is mechanical and the Brother computerised. Computerised machines give some nice QoL things like a needle up/down button, but they're harder to troubleshoot or service.

As for brand name stuff, I heard lower priced brothers are made completely separately to their higher end flagship stuff. Like they're basically two different brands. Modern singer has a bad rep but that's because it's competing against their vintage quality. They're on par for modern domestic like Brother imo

Personally I'd choose the Singer, but I am a little biased towards mechanical machines as a vintage machine enthusiast and also I just think the brother is super ugly. I've used neither but I did have a mechanical Brother GS3700 and it did me well as a beginner (I did vinyl but no jeans or fur)",1567296346

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Well, some new sellers may be intimated by a negative review, and panic, so some may issue refund right away without getting the product back first, or send additional free replacement, and etc., hoping to make it all go away, when the sellers themselves have done nothing wrong.  They ended up bending backward, wasted time, resources, money, and still left with a negative review.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This method is for people who are brand new to writing essays or have a lot of difficulty writing or structuring essays:

Step 1: 

you're going to decide on your essay topic. Get yourself an outline to start working on. This will be your master document. Your outline should be structured something like this at first: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WRopZY7
Essays should always have a thesis,  3 major arguments ('body' paragraphs), and a conclusion. Each of the 3 body paragraphs should have a minimum of 2 or 3 supporting pieces of evidence within them. 

Step 2: 

now that you've picked a general topic, you need to sit down and do some studying. Do some reading and figure out what your argument or specific research topic is going to be. Write it at the top of your outline. Keep your outline nearby while you're studying so you don't lose focus. 

Step 3: 

When you find some information in your book or online that you think would be really useful for your essay topic, write it down on an index card (paraphrase it if it's long or general information,  or write the quote directly if it's a reasonable length or important to quote exactly). On the back of the card, write down the source information so you can cite it in your essay. 

As you study, general themes and topics should be standing out to you. This is the time when you want to figure out what your 3 main arguments (or research areas) are going to be. You can pencil them in to your outline and narrow/ reword them if necessary. This is to narrow down and refine your studying. Study those areas specifically, and keep tracking the things you think will support your arguments on your index cards. 

Step 4:

You have all your research. Go through your cards and assign them to one of your 3 main arguments. You can color code them with the symbol that represents one of your 3 main topics. 

Step 5: 

Move the cards around in front of you so you can see the order changing. Look at each body paragraph/ main topic alone, and name sure the pieces of evidence are in an order that makes sense. Look at all 3 groups together and see if you like the order of the paragraphs. You want your weakest/ most boring argument in the middle. 

Step 6: fill in your outline.

Step 7: use your outline to put the 'bones' of your paper together. All you need to do is write 'joining up' sentences. Fill it in and you're done!",1567296347

I know people saw the diamonds as Nazis but from what I saw it was just a broken family with no communication whatsoever.
