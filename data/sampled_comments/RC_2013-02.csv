For instance, showing the entire end game in a trailer leaves someone with no reason to actually play your game. You've robbed them of that experience, of beating the skeleton.

There are other non-stimulants you can use by the way--""Delivered from Distraction"" lists a bunch, I can get that for you when I'm home.  **Wellbutrin is an option though--it's usually for depression but because it is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, it can be used off-label for ADHD.**  I was prescribed it for awhile in conjunction with Concerta (on Adderall now).

As for handling laziness and procrastination, what have you tried?  Do you make lists of tasks?  Do you have a [calendar](http://i.imgur.com/SGf2j.jpg) of some sort to help you plan things? See [comments on photo from r/ADHD here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/169jry/my_wardrobe_closet_doubles_as_a_mirror_now_i/)  Do you drink caffeine at all?  What about exercise?

As I approached it, I noticed three men standing at the entrance to it and I instantly knew I'd be in trouble if they saw me. I tried calling my dad to pick me up, but my phone kept buzzing and flashing '1% Battery' and wouldn't go through, and as I was trying to remain silent and unseen, they started slowly walking towards me. Suddenly, I let out terrified screams of 'Please God! Save me!' And after shouting that a few times as they were getting closer, I suddenly darted awake and had a massive tingling sensation going from my head down to my feet. I've had loads of crazy dreams, but I think that this one had to have been the scariest!","1359676809"

If you're trying to separate out a CJDNS tunnel from regular network traffic it's another deal.

To regular programs CJDNS appears as a layer 2 item (a tun ethernet device), but what it does when traffic is passed to it is to send it out over the back haul (utilizing layer 4). I'm probably not being very clear (I'm still not exactly certain what you're asking). Maybe look up diagrams that explain how a VPN works over the internet.

The new dome that Blank will build will also need renovations as well over time. The Mercedes-Benz Superdome is over 40 years old. Still home to many Super Bowls, and very profitable for the city of New Orleans because its paid for. 

&gt;The fact is, Blank wants and is getting a new stadium.

I'd love to have a billion dollars so I could buy a government like this guy. Its quite lovely how the construction supplies, which would generate a lot of money in taxes, are tax exempt and most of the jobs created will be from out of state or country. Its also rather lovely how Blank is not paying property taxes for this either. Its lovely how Blank gets control over what big events come to the city. Its lovely that Blank keeps all revenue generated from parking, product sales, and events in the dome.

1. Sit in Black or dimly lit room
2. Find a spot on your wall about 5m of farther from you
3 pick something against the wall, like a black dot, or nail 
4. Thousand yard stare that motherfucker for a good 20 seconds or so just keep your eyes trained on it and never look away.'
5. Now focus your eyes on that dot, glare at that bitch
6. Focus all your mental energy on the thought ""green spiky ball of energy I summon thee"" COMMAND IT! just keep focusing on conjuring it up again
7. Keeping focused on the target keep blasting it with thoughts of ""grow grow grow!!!"" and in probally 5-10 seconds this thing will start ""blooming"" 

I tell you whhat... I have gotten to the point where if I haven't slepd in 4 days. I can do those steps in bout 4 Seconds all together.. I've gotten that green ball to envious the facade of the whole tripler hospital .

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I'm in a very similar situation. I don't have an issue with the thought of rejection, it's the *actual* rejection that hurts the most. It's not a new phenomena either. It's like everything I deeply care about suddenly gets wretched out of my life. Like, one week things will great with love and plans for the future then the next.. well, you're head is spinning and trying to figure out what happened. And you ask yourself, ""How can I do better next time? What can I change to make sure this never happens again?"" 

And for a while, you think you've got it. But sure enough.. it happens again. And again. And again. Each time, you try to learn from your mistakes, and you try to do better, be better. But when will it ever be good enough? When will you actually have those people that you see others constantly surrounded by? When will you have friends and a lover that care about you as much as you care about them?

It's terribly isolating. It's like, you just don't fit in anywhere. You're a tourist. Never actually home. Always abroad. Wether you're in a hotel room or your actual home you just feel disconnected from everything. You try to be ""buy in"" to this whole life thing people keep going on about.. and you keep getting burned by it. You keep getting rejected by everyone. No one's really there for you in life. That cold, hard realization begins to settle in and you suddenly start to wonder what it'd be like to just step off the train platform as the muni comes in for a stop. 

You're not even curious about what people will think at your funeral. There's no delusion. They'll mourn, sure. But within a few days everything will be back to normal for them. You feel like you're a specter that's already happened.

I don't know how to say it will get better because I don't know myself. But I have past experience to go on.. and I'm stubborn like that I guess. I just know it will get better. If my lot in life is to be a traveling specter, then I guess it is. But with each iteration inbetween rejection I know that I have more going for me. More happening personally. 

Does this lead to happiness? I don't think it ultimately does. Honestly part of me despises it. But it's something I guess. In the meantime I try to keep in mind that I'm ultimately blind to those around me. I know logically, or at least suspect, that I matter a lot more then I realize even if I don't feel like it emotionally. 

All I can say is, don't kill yourself, and earnestly hope you don't. If you want a drinking buddy or even just a friend to talk it over with, I'll PM you my details. It's not charity since I could use someone to talk to myself. Hope this helps and god bless. ","1359676826"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Hi, thanks for the message!  I thought about that but I wasn't sure how much interest would be retained.  You know how fast things move on the Internet and with a one week deadline (or longer) a lot of people might lose interest and move on.  

In addition, while I think it would be great to see some of the exceptional work that could arise in that timeframe, there are just more cons than pros.  First, I don't want this contest to consume hours upon hours of anyone's life.  It would make me feel sad to know someone spent umpteen hours on a project not to even place.  Second, those that would put such a long effort into this would pretty much blow out the average joe from having a shot at the prize.  

My goal is that this allows everyone to have a chance to participate.  Things like a screenshot with sentimental value, an action scene, or a simple sketch are all just fine.  No matter how busy someone's life is, I don't think it should be too hard for anyone to have a chance to contribute and enjoy the contest this way.

**Edit:** I will remain open to the idea of extending the deadline.  If a lot of people feel this is the better option, please reply here with your reasoning.  

**Edit 2:** Okay, the new deadline is February 4 - 12:00 AM PST, 3:00 AM EST, 8:00 AM GMT!  This will be the final date, good luck everyone that enters the contest!","1359676826"

"gadgets","t5_2qgzt","- 1080p on a 11"" display is no longer impressive.

- The i5 in Surface Pro doesn't live up to its namesake, it's closer to their Celeron or Atom chips in performance than desktop or even laptop Ivy Bridge chips.

- The Wacom digitizer **is** a nice idea.

- The internal SSD starts off 30 GB smaller than advertised due to OS bloat; a 32 GB smartphone has about the same usable capacity as a 64 GB Surface Pro.  Also, the fact alone that it's an SSD doesn't say much about its performance.

- Magnesium alloy **is** a great material.

- Windows 8 is not a selling point right now; this is doubly the case when you consider that Microsoft doesn't pay a license fee to use it.

When you have a product that has no brand power and a very immature (touch-based) software ecosystem, you don't get to charge the same as another product that has both - unless your product is overwhelmingly superior.  Surface Pro is not: it is measurably inferior to existing laptops which cost less money and have better features, and it is measurably inferior to existing tablets which have a mature library of touch-based applications.

Apple can get away with charging a premium because they have a great reputation and a long history of high-quality and innovative products.  They also have the best library of touch-based software.  Also, a cult.

Google understands this.  Their ""Nexus"" devices lack enthusiast features but they are priced so cheaply that they establish a baseline for each generation.  With the Nexus and Chromebook devices you can buy directly from them, they've effectively destroyed the market for shitty low-end devices that ruin their reputation as a whole.

Microsoft should be doing the same thing: produce a baseline but high-quality product and leave the high-end and enthusiast markets to their partners.  Showcase their OS and make it desirable, not try to produce something that screws over their partners.

  In theory, x86 Windows on a tablet is great because it means there's a huge back-catalog of great software, but in reality so little of the software is optimized for touch that it's not much of a feature.  **In time** this will improve, but **today** is when they're selling it at a premium price point against rivals that have better touch-based functionality for half the price or less.","1359676833"

And take into account that the OPs original gripe was hat he is lacking power.  Straight up laddering on a campus board will net you roughly zero gains in terms of power.  Contact strength yes. Power no.  Training ""power"" means skipping rungs, making longer moves, and being able to latch a rung with 2, 3, 4 rungs inbetween your starting rung and target.  Or double clutching (I probably shouldnt even mention that here...).  A V3 climber will not have developed the fast twitch muscle to safely (or at all) be able to do this, but will get hurt in the process of attempting it.  To say nothing of the fact that even the least gifted of climbers should be able to climb V3 in fairly short order.  I never related onsight ability to connective tissue integrity, however for the novice climber that has yet to develop the tendon strength for as intensive an activity as campus boarding is, what do you think the weakest link in the chain is?  I'll give you a hint:  connective tissue integrity.  And what would better serve the climber in question, attempting to campus, sustaining an injury and being out for weeks to months (losing all gains in the interim), or focusing that energy on actually learning to climb?

He fits into a Pete Carroll team perfectly. Look back at his USC teams. You will see that they were all big, long, tall and fast. Not all of them were stars, just a couple each year.

Yes, two of them, at the very end of the summer transfer window.  They were never replaced, and we're in 6th place as a result.

&gt;Anyone who has been an Arsenal supporter for more than 6 months will know that nothing much was ever going to happen in January.

Actually there was an enormous amount of chatter that we finally had enough of a bank balance to make the signings that would improve the squad, and Arsene has signed in January before (Reyes, Arshavin)

&gt;If we can consistently receive performances like second half Arsenal v Chelsea or Liverpool, we are capable of top 4.

Ha.  What possible reason do we have to believe we'll play this way consistently?

&gt;Even if we don't make the top 4 this season, our players are tied down to long term deals, and with new commercial deals the need to sell is not nearly as strong (even accounting for loss of Champions League money. None of the team except maybe Arteta are going to regress due to age, with most likely to improve over the next 12 months. Arsene will buy in the summer, he always does.

Being in the Europa League disbars you from a certain class of player, as Arsene knows every well.  Great players want CL football.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","There are ALWAYS more ways you can spend more money. You can have the more expensive wine. Or upgrade to first class. Or get that extra option on the car. That's the way the world is setup.

And yes, I think there is a balance between ""spending ALL the money now"" and ""save ALL the money for later."" However, I also think that western culture is not setup properly to allow its people to make properly educated decisions regarding this.

I mean, yes, the question is: What will make you happy?

What makes me happy is knowing that if I get into a horrible accident right this minute, I'll be able to live ok. I know that if I have children in the future, I will be able to fund their education AND not depend on them for retirement.

Yes, eating well and living well also makes me happy. But to me, eating at a $30/person restaurant pretty much brings me max enjoyment. I don't enjoy the $100/person restaurant any more than the $30/person restaurant. And I love homemade food. I also know that having a reliable car makes me happy, but will that $100k Porsche make me happy? No, it wouldn't. I want to live in a nice home. But I actually don't want more than 800 sq ft (which I found out after living in 1000 sq ft). And I don't want to live in a house (which I found out after purchasing a house). And I have traveled internationally, both in $700/night hotels (paid for by a relative) and sleeping on a friend's hard concrete floor with a camping pad. I actually didn't enjoy the holiday with the expensive hotel room more.

Another thing I want to point out is that I enjoy my job. I enjoy going to work (and it pays me fairly well too). I enjoy haggling and buying second hand items as a scavenger hunt/challenge for myself. I also enjoy making things, from furniture to electronics to clothing (to food, somewhat). I enjoy maximizing my dollar, for the most part. So a large part of me day-to-day enjoyment is things I do at work, and things I make at home. I don't need to spend nearly all that much money to make myself happy.

Things I do splurge on (and it's a lot): Skiing (I buy new last-season's skis on clearance, and season's pass). Housekeeping (I hire a housekeeper to come clean regularly.) Clothing and shoes (I spend ~1% of my gross income on clothing and shoes.) Artisan cheese, and good food in general. We host parties regularly, where we provide all the food and alcohol, and it is delicious too. I think we have a really nice place to live, but it's under 13% of my gross, if my boyfriend decides to stop working tomorrow and I have to pay for the whole thing. Oh, and I bought a new car 2 years ago, and spent $450 on a camera recently to try out photography. And theater; I'm a season subscriber to 3 play/musical theaters.

Things I do not splurge on: Eating out. Drinking (though I have a stocked bar, it's only for parties). We don't have cable or phone bills. We pay the basic for internet and computers. My boyfriend and I have only one car between us. We don't travel much, and when we do, it's usually combined with our work travel plans.

This year, I plan to increase my net worth by 40% of my gross income.

(I have also lived beyond my means. I have spent $3k in one month on eating out. And lived in a one-bedroom apartment with a view. I traveled multiple times a year to places that weren't even that interesting to me. It did not make me happy.)","1359676846"

I recently found out my mom smokes too. I went back home, I live in a different town for college, a week or so before thanksgiving break and I decided to quit around this time because smoking gave me bad anxiety/depression, whatevs. 

Around comes Thanksgiving break and I'm home again, and one day, I decide to chill at a friend's house. I was feeling pretty tired, so I decided to head back home. I stop at a stop sign to text my friend to see if he wanted to hang out the following day. As I take a left, I approach a stoplight. I admittedly roll through it, and all of a sudden I see the infamous blue and red lights along with that dreaded sound no ent wants to hear. ""Whoooooop"" or something.

Long story short, he pulled me over for running both the stop sign and the stop light, which was bullshit. He smelled ""cannabis"" in my car, when it wasn't, it was just cigarette smoke. And he found a roach. I was fucking scared shitless. Note, I want to be an English teach, so this isn't good for me. He said, he was going to just write me a ""ticket"" because it was so little. 

Apparently, it was my mom's and her boyfriend's. She must've left it there from months ago, she said. She smokes for menstrual cramps. We had a very real mother-son moment there in the living room. She said, ""I didn't want to tell you until you found it on your own, I know you weren't going to be an idiot about it and this is my fault."" And she cried and I cried and we hugged for what seemed like forever. 

Apparently, she smoked for all her life. My grandma, her mom, knew, my dad knew, my aunt, etc etc. I also found out my mom, who divorced my dad, tried smoking with my dad a couple of times but he got too paranoid. So, I guess I know where I get THAT from now.

TL;DR: Caught with roach by cops, mom admits it was hers. We bonded.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Art's a tricky subject, because unlike most other forms of creative expression (books, films, music, for example) the original piece itself is what commands the price, and that really messes with the economics. With a book, it's pretty simple. People buy the book because they want to read it, and their owning the book doesn't prevent anyone else from owning it. You can copy the book, and each one has the same value. The same is true of films: you can keep screening it and each person will pay the same to view it.

The difference between these and art is that while books and films are funded by a large number of people paying a small amount (allowing commercial success to be reasonably equated with popularity), sales of art focus on selling a single original for a large sum of money. It's a very different business model, and the fact that only one person ever owns what's considered to be 'the' piece of art (whilst thousands can own the book) means that the commercial aspects of art are necessarily separated from ordinary consumers. I think it would be premature to conclude from this that a piece of art is not 'worth' £10,000 - if an artist creates a work, and an author writes a book, with the later selling 1000 copies at £10 each, who's to say they're not equally valuable items? - but I think the total isolation of the viewing public from the actual valuation of artwork is something that's definitely worth considering. I think it's actually very reasonable for people to feel uncomfortable about the excess of one person paying millions for a painting which they could buy an arbitrarily precise copy of for just tens of pounds. There's a definite element of pride involved - the painting being 'yours', and yours alone - which doesn't impact other forms of creative endeavour. Nobody can selfishly hoard music, but one can selfishly hoard art.","1359676857"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I agree that there are technologies that are now in their infancy that in the future could allow for a symbiosis and a balance of human life on the landbase.

That being said, it's still the question of whether or not those technologies would be centralized, like all other utilities, or be decentralized. My guess is that as soon as Oil and gas are no longer profitable/feasible as an energy source, we will have ""solar and wind barons"" take their place. They will build centrallized solar farms, and transmit the power over the lines similar to what we have now.  But does that not protect the current power structures?  Won't the people that are rich now be the ones that still hold onto the ""means of production"", since they will be the ones with investment capital to dominate these new forms of energy and utility?

I think the problems we face need to be faced on a local level.  Derrick Jensen, while dire in his forecast of human progress, addresses some key issues that I believe you are dismissing too easily.  

Going back to simpler processes, and decentralized production of necessities not only re-builds community structures, it also makes humans appreciate their landbase again.  And I'm sure you will agree that without a habitable landbase, we have zero chance of survival as a species.

Just because factory farming exists, does that make it the most ""efficient"" way of farming?  Is it the most sustainable long-term?  Does the distance between how our food is produced make us respect our environment more or less?

I would clearly argue that people that don't see land as a means for personal sustenance, will see it as a resource to be exploited.  And people who don't farm their own land, and require monies to purchase food will be more willing to destroy their landbase inorder to acquire the monies. (People who allow fracking on their properties for example).  Technology is not always a good thing.  The best quote from his book, Endgame, is something to the effect of (paraphrase, sorry at work) ""Our great grandchildren won't be impressed by our iphones, or our cars, or our internet.  They will be angry when they go to catch a fish, and there are none.  They will be angrier when they go to drink the water, and it is tainted.""  

Our basic needs have not evolved with technology.  If anything, technology has alienated us from our most basic of skills and needs. It's not about ""returning to the 1800s""  Its about realizing that we are not all that different from people back then.  The main difference is that most of us are no longer able to survive without the processes in place that are killing off the planet.","1359676868"

I don't think that the scale is flexible, or really valuable. While I agree it takes time and focus to get good at something, that doesn't say what ""good"" means in the objective sense, it also says nothing about natural tendencies. There are lots of things I am very good or even great at, that I have not put in 10 years or 10,000 hours. Things that aren't trivial (being good at halo is trivial, for example). 

If you want a 'rule.' Work hard at something, you'll get better at it, nothing good comes easy, etc etc. Not sure there is any value in 10k hours, 10 years measuring stick.

To answer your question, I do believe it is wrong to wish death upon others. I think everyone deserves the right to live, and no one should have that right taken away. I don't want to see lives taken, I'd never wish for another's death, and I surely do not want to take a life; however if it is necessary I'm willing to do so. To me, if an armed man has intentions to kill my family or myself, it is completely justified to fight back in order to defend my family or myself. In short, I guess you could say that I object to wishing death upon others, however I believe that if its necessary, the taking of a life is justified.

The theory is that with a low hourly salary, a restaurant can hire more server which in turns will provide better service. Better customer service means happier customers which means returning customers. Also, since your wage is based on the tips you make, you are more likely to give better customer service to someone than if you were just making an hourly wage. Again, this is just a theory

I simply do not need this kind of insurance, nor do the vast majority of gun owners.  While I am in favor of taking steps to reduce gun violence, this isn't something I can get behind.  Insurance, or lack of insurance, does nothing to change the risk level associated with owning a firearm.  My behavior in storage, usage, and safety of my firearms will not change because of an insurance policy.

I was released from a level 4 institution in 2008 (I was shackled all the way to the gate in my dress outs-bastards!), and my mom and sister were there to pick me up. I quickly hugged them and jumped in the backseat. My mom was in the passenger seat, she was crying; they were both extremely emotional. I told my sister to fucking drive before they changed their mind. They had to drive me all the way to Fresno (where I was convicted). We stopped at a gas station and I just remember standing in front of all the drinks, but there was so many selections I had no idea what to get- shit was mind-boggling. I went to the bathroom and couldn't piss because I was so nervous.  We got to Fresno, I was car sick as hell, checked into a hotel, ate at Chili's. I wouldn't eat that shit now, but at the time it was pretty goddamn delicious. I finished eating way before my mom and sister, and I didn't want to get back in the car because it was turning my stomach.  I told them I'd just walk back to the room, the hotel was on the other side of a long winding busy road with no crosswalk or light. I stood across from the hotel trying to cross, but cars kept coming in the distance. I'd try to get across, but then another car would come. It then dawned on me that I couldn't judge how far away, or how fast the cars were coming because I hadn't seen anything move that fast in over six years! I've been off parole for a year and a half. I earn my associates after this semester, and will be transfering to UNLV. I still get car sick though.","1359676878"

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","I was emulating FF7-9 on my old 1.6Ghz Centrino Proccessor (single core) laptop with integrated intel graphics. So I'd wager that unless your PC is 9+ years old it will do just fine.

That said it really depends on your preferences.

If you like save states go for emulation, if you don't care for that (and don't want the temptation of abusing it) go for the PC version.

People usually blow up a storm about how the music is supposedly far worse in the PC version than it was on the PSX and they are partly right. The PC version uses midi files and they sound slightly worse, but I honestly never picked up on it until someone told me about it. besides it's not like an emulator is great at it either, from what I remember it was a tad glitchy.

If you go for emulation just make sure to configure the game before you head to the airport, and make sure everything works alright, you don't want to be sitting at 30000 feet with weird graphical glitches that make the game unplayable. Also you might want to boot up the game and leave your laptop on for a couple of hours in the game to make sure it runs alright even after the PC gets hot.

But whichever one you land on, there's really not much of a difference.

FAKE EDIT(can't be bothered to re-write the post &gt;&lt;): the new PC version of FFVII might have always on DRM because of the way it handles save games. Test it in an offline environment if you want to make sure it works. But after remembering this I'd probably say emulating it is your best bet.

Ps. I'd recommend just using the keyboard to control it with, a controller really doesn't add anything for a title like this and it only increases your odds of forgetting something on the plane if you have that many gadgets.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","The state exists for the aristocracy; reinforcing wealth and privilege.  Without the state, you do not need to seek permission to cast-off oppression.  How you go about it is entirely up to you.  Chances are you'll never be in a position to reform haute bourgeoisie (e.g. heads of state, bank presidents, chief executive officers, etc).  Even if you were, the state is in their best interest.  You may be able to convince a few petites, a few shop owners, subject to lenders, but they often think themselves much more wealthy / powerful than they actually are (despite being every bit as susceptible to foreclosures, evictions, asset seizures, etc).  Your best chance is with the working-class who lack class consciousness.  Earning six figures a year doesn't make you not a wage-slave.  It simply means your owners are really fucking good at exploiting labor; typically through you.","1359676882"

Unfortunately, probing is a big part of what you have to do in w-space, and leeching of other people's probing work is generally considered bad form. The skills aren't had to pick up, it's just a little monotonous at times, and you generally want decent tools (like Siggy or one of the others) to help make probing significantly easier to track.

As for w-space being a watering hole? I'm not sure I agree 100%. there's a lot of isk available to be had, but you need to risk a lot of isk in order to get it, and the fights will typically have you flying ships at around the 900-1.2 bill range for subcaps (mostly tech 3), or in the 4-5b range for decent capital support.

Please understand that there is a clear difference between a ""new dynamic"" and a fucking overpowered weapon.  You're basically saying that if they made, for example, the DMR a 1 shot kill weapon and kept the sniper the same(1 shot to the head and 2 shots to the body), that's a completely legitimate ""new dynamic"" that people have to get used to. But looking at it, it's completely OP. You *start* out with an all-purpose gun that is *better* at long range than a god damned long range gun.

 This is exactly the problem with the boltshot. It's **better** than the shotgun and scattershot.  It's **BETTER** than the shotgun and scattershot. Does your little brain not conceive this fact as unfair or overpowered? Are you really that blindly hooked on the franchise that everything they do with it is perfect in your eyes?

Your movie section will be pretty forgiving if you don't do it perfectly. However, television shows are not as easy. So if you find yourself cursing at your computer because you know your file is in the proper destination but it's not showing up in Plex it's most likely your fault.

I find that since the change in S3, he lost too much of this damage, especially withe game shifting towards the ""League of Warmogs"" build.  Gragas has great damage, but can't do too much against tanky people.  His E forces him to get close in order to deal the damage and has pretty mediocre damage unless you hit a lone target.  His W is great for keeping up sustained poke and giving him some extra tankiness to make up for him being melee, but there are just better champions for his role right now (unless you want the ult for an engage/disengage in something like a poke comp).  He can still farm like a beast since his Q has great damage and his passive + W makes last hitting easy (since it gives him tankiness, AD and decent health regen).  He's a tricky champion, but can be really strong if played right and his ultimate can make or break team fights (even if your team is down, if you can set it up so you can push 2 enemies toward you and the rest away, you should be able to quickly win the 5v2 and get out).","1359676890"

there is only one super strong aoe stun ala amumus ultimate. And that has to be channeled in almost melee range.

If you start playing the game it feels like everything is op. But after a few games you realize theres nothing super broken.

We (another medical student and I) do our history and physical exam, and turn around to leave. As I turn around, the patient grabs my hand and says, ""Can I tell you something?""

After I agree, he says ""I never liked colored folk before."" He went on to explain that he finally understood, and that skin color made no difference, and he was so sorry and appreciative of the care he received. He started crying while he apologized to me. 

I told him I understood, and I ""accepted"" his apology (he seemed to be asking me for forgiveness.) I just tried to be as kind and understanding as possible. It seemed to me that he realized he was near his end, and was doing his best to make amends. Honestly, the whole situation made me very sad.

&gt;your statement that killing somehow makes storytelling easier

I never said that. I said more gameplay elements suit violent settings than non-violent ones.

I'm not saying it's impossible to make a ""fun"" non-violent game in a 3 dimensional world. I'm saying it's FAR easier to make a violent one as there are many more different options for it. 

The games you listed *are* inherently violent, just because you can play though the whole game without killing anyone doesn't mean the world you're in doesn't have gunshots and murder around every corner. In a stealth game what happens if you get spotted? Do you get hugged and then have to restart the level? No, you get shot because it's the most believable outcome.

Imagine Half-Life (or some other shooter) if you just stun-gunned every combine soldier. You'd need an explanation for that. ""Why are we using stun guns?"", ""These are bad guys why don't we just kill them?"", ""Bullets are cheaper and more abundant!"" etc.","1359676901"

Best thing to do is what you aready did contact Riot support give them ALL THE INFO YOU CAN on your account. Tell them lots of little details.

I respect the hell out of him, but he's always had a penchant for selling a call.  Yes, that serves a purpose, in the same way diving serves a purpose and can benefit the team.  Accentuating a call is sometimes called, but even when it isn't it violates the spirit of the game, in my opinion.

I think most fans hold superstars like Brodeur to a higher standard, like Crosby, Giroux, Kane.  So when they do things less-skilled players do, like a dive or whine (early Sid), a cheap shot (Giroux in the playoffs last year against Zubrus), or binge-drink in the offseason (Kane), fans get annoyed because they're supposed to be above that sort of stuff.  So yes, Brodeur is an incredible goalie, and I respect him.  But I think his level of skill throughout his career has only made it worse when he dives to get the ref's attention (and he's done it a lot in his career).","1359676906"

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt;Sounds to me like your own problem. I have no trouble finding interesting content and discussion here.

Have you considered that visiting the frontpage of a subreddit isn't the only way people experience a subreddit? I will list 2 not uncommon ways to use a subreddit that do make findingfcontent and discussion difficult.

1. **Personal homepage**: Your personal homepage lists the hot content of the subreddits you are subscribed to. The content of each subreddit is weighed depending on the subreddit's subscriber numbers, so that low subscriber subreddits, where content recieves less votes, can get a showcase vs high subscriber subreddits.

Images like this post recieve 1k+ votes, compared to a 100+ that may recieve a good discussion. In your frontpage, the image might be in the top 10 posts, while the good discussion will probably appear a couple of pages later on the 50th spot. There is trouble in finding a good post if you have to read through a couple of pages before finding it.

2.  **/r/books/top/**: The list of top posts (based on votes) for the week/month/year. A quick way to catch up on a week, or to get a feeling of the state of the subreddit. Ideal for people who are looking for new subreddits to subscribe to. A good option if you couldn't check reddit in a period of time and want to catch up quickly.

Check this subreddit's top year/moth/week/all time. Pretty much all posts are images. If you want to find good content or discussion there, you would have to delve into the comment section, which isn't promising for image posts.

Those 2 are valid ways to use reddit. 1) is common for mobile users who use the i.reddit.com version of the page, where it takes a number of interactions to get to a particular subreddit. 2) should be common for anyone on a time budget.

(At least) For those 2 group of users, finding interesting content and discussion is difficult, so don't go around assuming that content is easy to find just because it is on the frontpage of the subreddit in a small timeframe.

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","My apologies, aMalfunction helped me make some clarifications for my sword but I forgot to send them in: 

* There is no limit to how many scars can be active at a time.
* The shikai length is 18in and bankai is 22in long.
* He also suggested there be a limit of 4-6. While obviously I'd rather not have a limit on them, I can settle for a max of 5.

**Shikai**: 

My main goal is to leave scars spread out around CpnKangaroo's sword, rather than CpnKangaroo himself, though I will strike him if I see a good opening. The entire time, I will play along with him and try to match his blows rather than go for a critical hit, leaving scars as I go. Hopefully this will keep the sword happy and not start taking the fight into its own hands. 

At some point after these exchanges, the scars will accumulate to the point where if I tap CpnKangaroo's sword, the force of all the scars will knock it around wildly since each scar strikes with the same force and direction as the original strike. So it would be as if every one of my strikes are actually 5/6/10/15/however many scars are there.

**Bankai**:

CpnKangaroo's description is ""the simple glaive from before grows and splits itself up into many glaives,"" so the scars will remain on the 5 glaives, although spread out. From this point, I will cut myself two times on my arms to make 2 shadows, purposely keep my distance, and play defensive. With 2 shadows, I have a total of 6 blades to block his 5 glaives, which I will actively be trying to track. My goal here is to keep piling on scars while he attacks, which considering CpnKangaroo's sword's personality, I don't believe will be a problem. 

I will wait until the scars reach the point again where a tap will disorient the glaives, after which I will try to bait his final attack, and hope my scars and shadows will be enough to send them off track, at which point if any shadows were killed, I'll destroy their scars on my arms, strike myself again to create up to three shadows, and rush in. My 2-speed advantage should let me get to him before the glaives can reorient themselves, and after a few scar procs, I will reach a critical mass of shadows (or if the limit of 5 max is imposed, I'll use my 5 shadows to keep the glaives at bay while I go after the unarmed CpnKangaroo)

**Plan-B**:

If my strategy to pile on early scars does not work for some reason, because the CpnKangaroo's blade does not think we're evenly matched or what have you, at that point, I'll stop and switch over to the bankai strategy. The only difference being that it will take longer to get a critical mass of scars and that the glaives will maybe try harder?

If he uses his final maneuver early(which I doubt considering the sword wants to have fun, I'm interpreting it as prolonging the fight), I'll strike myself lightly multiple times and make up to 10 shadows(or 5 max) to use as a wall. Continue with the original plan from there on.

**Edit**: My original description states that I can make shadows from hitting a Zanpakuto. If I can make unlimited shadows, I'd like to remove that as I can see that becoming overpowered. However, if the max of 5 is imposed, I see it as strong but not overly unbeatable compared to other bankais. I'll leave the decision of whether to impose the limit or not to you guys.","1359676916"

This is not a semantic argument about the issue of now versus the past; one instant to the next. This was a substantial amount of time ago; years, and it occurred under a different administration and the new administration has taken public action to correct and change previous actions. This is of course assuming the US ever did in fact torture, who knows.

Regardless, you cannot provide any current evidence that indicates we likely still do the things we did at Abu Ghraib and were accused of doing in Guantanamo.

&gt;And my last comment about blindly following the government is about your ability to believe things the government saying that certain tactics are simply enhanced interrogations (like waterboarding or the cold room tactic from the example I gave above).

I'm not believing the government's assertion at all. I'm assessing the technique and deciding I don't consider it to be torture; sometimes I may analyze their arguments and agree with them, but I'm certainly not taking any assertion on faith.

&gt;If you truly believe those methods are justified and aren't torturous then you're a lost cause.

A lost cause? I simply disagree with you. Why do people have to share your opinion? If you could make a rational argument as to why either of those should be considered torture, I'd be open to listening, but everything I've read and seen indicates otherwise.","1359676917"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; But it indicates a greater probability that a resultant sex act is consensual

No it doesn't. It has no effect on consent. It indicates a greater probability that the person wants some kind of sexual encounter (maybe far less than sex), and indicates that it might be reasonable to ask. But it doesn't indicate anything about how likely they are to consent themselves! There are way too many other variables, and the woman's own VOLITION, that play a role.

&gt; But it, again indicates a greater probability that the sex act in question wasn't rape.

No. After the fact, the only way a sex act can not be rape is if the woman verbally consented. It has no bearing on whether or not this is true. Maybe there's a correlation between ""how a woman dresses"" and ""how likely she consents to sex,"" but why is this relevant? How a woman dresses can ABSOLUTELY NOT be used as a sign of consent, or likeliness of consent.

Do you really think it's okay to say in a court case ""Well, we have the victim saying she didn't consent, and the accused saying she did...the victim was wearing very scanty clothing, therefore the accused is more likely to be telling the truth?"" And if you don't think this supposed probabilistic relationship should ever be used, what's the point of bringing it up at all?","1359676925"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","shareholders are not necessarily guaranteed a cut of corporate profits, only ownership. if i dividend is declared and disbursed, then shareholders receive a portion of the profits. 

stocks arent issued for short term capital gain, but to expand the size of the company. say you own abc corp. you want to expand, so youll make a $1mil stock offering, 200000 shares, $5 each. you keep half of the shares, and sell the other half to the public. people go wild and love abc and its stock, shares now trade at $10 a share, you just doubled your companies valuation. 

many companies do borrow from banks, but more commonly they will issue debt (bonds). bonds are preferred to bank loans because the firm can establish its own borrowing terms (not to say that both arent used, and frequently). there is a thing called ""cost of capital."" capital comes from many sources, company assets, profits, money borrowed, equity, retained earnings, and others. the main three used in fundraising efforts are retained earnings, debt issues (bond offering), equity issues (stock offering). retained earnings is a company's ""rainy day fund."" when you want the cool new assembly line, you tap into retained earnings first, you earned the money already, and it costs you near nothing to use it (for our purposes right now, its free to use). after retained earnings, maybe a slightly bigger project comes around that will take a few years, the firm will offer bonds. bonds are more expensive capital because they have to be paid back. finally when the firm *really* wants to go big, it offers stocks. this is the most expensive sort of capital raising because you are giving away a part of the company. there are many factors to consider before taking a company public, and thats why not all companies do trade publicly. 

as for the last part about dividing profits, again, shareholders arent guaranteed a right to profits (dividends), and even in the case where a dividend is declared, the board of directors sets the dividend at will, it can be low, it can be high, but it certainly will not be enough to hurt company profits in any meaningful way","1359676926"

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","If so, this equation is not very hard if you the rules that make solving equations faster than doing the problems long-hand.
First thing to know:
for s(t)=1t^2 +3t+20, each term is derived separately.so you find the derivative of 1t^2 and the derivative of 3t and the derivative of 20 all separately.
the rule is:
if s(t)=ct^n, then s'(t)=n•ct^n-1 . (c and n are constants)(s'(t) is simply the derivative of s(t)
so if s(t)=1t^2, then s'(t)=2•1t^2-1 or s'(t)=2t^1 or s'(t)=2t
then s(t)=3t which is really s(t)=3t^1 so s'(t)=1•3t^1-1 or s'(t)=3
then since s(t)=20 is a costant that will equal zero
in conclusion, s(t)=1t^2+3t+20 so s'(t)=2t+3+0 or s'(t)=2t+3.

1t^2 becomes 2t because you multipy the coefficient by the exponent and subtract the exponent by 1.  The variables to explain it can get tricky but in truth it is really basic","1359676928"

That's not a very good argument for your moral rule.  Presumably he restricts his dickdom to people who he considers ""clearly a fucking idiot"", so he won't have those as friends.  He might also lose some people like yourself who are judgmental about his reaction to said idiots.  But realistically, this is unlikely to heavily cut into his friend count.

So presumably, the real reason for your moral rule is not how many friends it garners you - so why bring that up?  You're just trying to coerce someone into following your moral rules with an empty threat of social consequences.  This is quite similar to theist tactics.

"NewsOfTheWeird","t5_2vmjd","My family comes from a small midwestern town. 99% German Catholics. Well, once upon a time in the 1990s, an Indian family moved there (the father got a job in the pharmacy) and there was a segment of the population who was not particularly *keen* on their presence. One older woman in particular, who would demand that her medication be handled by the owner of the pharmacy (a white man) so as to keep her drugs from being (quote) *dirtied*.

On one occasion, the Indian man was the only person working and he had no choice but to handle this woman's medication. When he handed it to her, she refused to pay, claiming that he had somehow ruined her order, and she drove off with her drugs. He reported this, and the woman was approached by the authorities (small town, so not too big of a deal) Trouble is, she was approached while she had some guests over and got to be very embarrassed about the whole ordeal.

So she stormed up to the pharmacy and demanded that the Indian man be penalized for his actions, just because she hadn't paid for an order he'd clearly messed up, and that he ought to be fired so that other members of the community (small town, only one pharmacy) wouldn't be forced to deal with this man.

Now, this woman was a pretty big deal in the community. One of those grain-silo millionaires with a lot of sway, so you know what happened?

The owner of the pharmacy banned her for life, and now she gets to drive forty-five minutes each way to the next town to pick up her medication from (surprise) another Indian pharmacist.

Get key evidence thrown out, an identification nullified, a statement suppressed and the state's case goes away.  Knowing the facts are always important.  You have to know the facts to argue the procedural issues.  How do you know if a cop had probable cause?  How so you know if a statement is reliable and voluntary?  Based on the facts. Procedural hearings in criminal cases are largely based on the facts of a case so I don't get the point of this article at all.  The truth is the only a small aspect of procedural issues have no basis in the facts of the case and those are rarely time consuming.

Copilot ($20) - tricky at first but it does all your flight calculations for you. It's reliable but make sure you learn to use it correctly. Don't necessarily rely on it either. 

Foreflight (subscribtions for about $30/3 months) - reliable and legal charts in the US. It also works as a GPS if you need extra reference. Again learn traditional navigation before relying on this. 

Aeroweather pro ($2) - Weather on the go. It offers METAR's, TAF's, NOTAMS, radar, airport cams and crosswind/headwind data for airports of your choice.

Here's the solution -- find a VoIP provider that also provides internet service and can QoS it from end to end. You may find one locally or nationally - the national ones peer with the local ISP and MPLS/VLAN it. **Get the QoS in SLA and identify how to test it (may have to tag the packets yourself).**

Nothing else will work reliably for your size. SIP should have a connection with &lt;30ms latency and &lt;10ms jitter and ZERO packet loss. (some codec specs allow for more but you WILL hear it). Do a 24 hour ping to sip.8x8.com and see if you're even close.

"Naruto","t5_2quts","Dude...you've missed a lot.  Obvious spoilers coming up:
- the akatsuki was demolished one at a time.  Shikamaru, Kakashi, and naruto beat two immortal members, naruto having done so with a new jutsu called wind style: rasenshuriken.
- Sasuke killed deidara and continued on to kill itachi.  However, the masked fool Toni revealed himself to be Uchiha madara, and told Sasuke that itachi killed the clan as a mission for the village.  He also left Sasuke alive because he loved him.
- pain, akatsuki's leader, killed jiraiya after being discovered. Naruto learned jiraiya's sage jutsu and while he was off training, pain showed up and rotfl stomped Konoha.  Naruto returned, late, and in one of the best moments of the series, fought pain.  During the fight, the kyuubi reached the eighth tail and almost consumed naruto, but the fourth hokage's chakra stopped It.
- now working for akatsuki, Sasuke attacked the 8 tails, and was fooled into taking with him a substitution.  The 8 tails chose that moment to flee captivity from his village, causing his brother the raikage to convene a summit with the five Kage to determine the course of action against akatsuki.
- meanwhile, tsunami slipped into a coma after using souzou saizei, and danzo took over as hokage.
- at the five Kage summit, danzo used some sketchy ass shit to be named world leader, but was discovered right as Sasuke broke into the summit, intending to kill him.  Danzo fled in the chaos, but madara appeared to detail his plan of world domination and to declare war on the five Kage.
- naruto and the 8 tails were hidden away where naruto learned to control the kyuubi's chakra.  His mother's chakra, stored inside of him as his fathers was, aided him and told him the story of the nine tails attack the night of his birth.  More importantly, that madara was the one behind it.
- meanwhile, the war began.  Skirmishes and battles of mostly inconsequential substance were fought, but naruto got wind of the fighting, fleeing captivity in the companionship of the 8 tails.

I won't spoil any more, since that is where the anime is.  I greatly suggest watching the anime up to this point; they did a phenomenal job with the akatsuki fights, pain's invasion, and a few other key moments since.  Rest assured, I haven't even come close to telling you everything.","1359676955"

But, instead, you put it in a really bitchy tone ""just a tip"" because you wanted it known that *you* were offended as *part* of said minority group.

I disagree with any victim blaming where no victimizing was even intended. I find it perplexing when someone goes out of their way to be a victim. If anything else suggested I had an issue with anything or things gender related, trans or otherwise, I could see it, but I am seriously just side blinded by unsolicited animosity. 

Tolerance works both ways. It's not *what* you say but *how* you say it. Maybe say ""hey that word is derogatory"" without all the added snide tone? I could see it if I was being in any way intentionally untoward, but I'm pretty sure being open with a BF who was into such a world is about as un-fucking-bigoted as a bi, gg female is going to get, so please take your ""us against the world"" attitude and look at the lady in the mirror. 

Not everyone is out to wrong you. Pick on someone who actually is. It's not a blanket pass, I mentioned where I was coming from and that I had no fucking clue it was a slur, *i plan to stop using it, so for fuck sake cut me some slack*.

I don't know anything about this guy, but if you know how reality shows are cut at all, what he said is obviously true. If you're not expecting producers to do that shit constantly, you should check out how dangerous Survivor is. ""Oh man, there was an alligator *right there*...."" Yeah, four months earlier when a different crew shot their stock footage. Or the non-stop drama of Big Brother, where people are actually on their ass doing nothing 23 hours of the day and half the conversations are obviously spliced together from different times.

There's two shitty ways to do a reality show these days: either script it then let certain people react naturally (Kitchen Nightmares, Pawn Stars) or film a ton of shit and cut it together to make a story by changing the sequence of events. TUF takes the second approach, and if you're paying attention, you can see where they messed around with it.

I 100% think the guy is a douche anyway, but if you talk to anyone after a reality show, literally everything you're seeing is the result of narrative-producing techniques (out of context interview questions, cutting, suggesting ideas of what to do on camera, etc.).","1359676962"

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad","If it's a fantasy story, do you *need* to choose a time period? Why not just run with it? If the houses and dress don't match, then come up with some justification for it, even if you don't explicitly mention it.

Maybe the village was built a couple of hundred years ago, and they haven't wanted or needed or been able to bring the architecture up to the current standard.

Maybe the dresses are different and more modern because for some reason, there's been an influx of people from another area such as a city or other affluent area, bringing new fashions and fabrics with them.

If it has to be in a particular time frame, does it need to be on ""earth""?

If it has to be on ""earth"" and in a particular time frame, does it have to be 100% historically accurate?

Personally, I would just write and see what comes of it. Getting caught up in the details is a great excuse for not getting started.

As long as the story is internally consistent, links to real world events don't need to be solid and tangible. I have found that writing period pieces is quite difficult and takes a great deal of research. Even one misplaced object or word can ruin the entire mood of the section, if not the entire story.

Any more info on how/where these lists are gathered would be helpful to determine if any rule-breaking occured. 



**However** I think your more pressing problem here, is that you have a product which I do not see a demand for.  If you are a recruiter worth anything, you already know how to get these lists from the school directly, or other recruiting list providers).   

Then theres the fact that these are just a list of email adresses.  Unfortunately thats only step 1 of being able to sell a marketable list.  You need to *add* information to it.  Layers and layers, ie Majors, club associations, change of majors, student career length, sports associations.  

I mean realistically, what do you see a recruiter doing with this list? 
""Oh wow, I now how a list of 384 graduates from harvard....lets start with.....Alice Allison......nope, next Benjamin Bafflebar....nope, next....go down and down the list?""


Recruiters are skilled (well some of them are) professionals who specifically target for positions based on Skills.   I would be shocked about recruiters who litterally just go down the list of graduates.  

My suggestion:  Go through those 200+ sub-lists from the accounts and categorize what they specify, (I'm thinking there may be something like ""Deans List"" or something there.  I would say that small list is where there might be some value.  ","1359676969"

The high was nothing compared to what would have happened if I'd smoked it, but I was still definitely high.

So, not only have I performed an experiment, I am also speaking from personal experience.

To clarify some things: I never said that weed that hadn't been heated would be super potent. I only said that the majority of the THC would be destroyed before it had a chance to be absorbed, hence it lacking the majority of it's potency.

Really, though, if you're going to be trying to make it as an artist, you probably need to be putting out at least 1 song a week, and it's probably better to start off with your own low-end studio and upgrade it as funds allow.

The thing about this is that a given song may not net you very much, but it keeps doing it long after you're done working on the song. Furthermore, she's not doing so hot because she's in a pretty niche area, with a small market. It's to be expected that she's not doing well -- that's pretty much the bleeding edge where people fail hard most of the time and sometimes make it really big. Not everyone can be Trent Reznor, and music is really a market where you have to appeal to enough people to get by.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Mostly. All that I'm really saying is that life in Iran isn't some hellish existence defined by the terror of being dragged away by the secret police. You seek to make a living, try to start a family, make connections with the people around you and hopefully make some inquiry and effort towards finding a personal meaning in your life. All the trappings and complications aside, that's what life is almost anywhere.

That said, my personal opinion is that women's rights are at the top of the list of things that need to change in Iran. Women in Iran have a similar place in society as they did in the US a few decades ago. 

I'm going to qualify what I'm about to cite by noting that I am, if anything, an agnostic but for all intents and purposes an atheist. Back in 2003, Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel prize for her efforts towards women's rights in Iran. Needless to say, she recieved a lot of blowback from the regime. She's currently in exile in the UK. Here's her take on the issue:

&gt;In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work.""","1359676980"

Aika, being the body, can symbolize the glue thats holding mahiro and yoshino together (honestly, what does their friendship really have other than the event with the biker). When the truth really does get revealed, Mahiro and yoshino will probably turn against each other (in a sense).

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I'm a guy, so take this how you will, but I think the core reasoning is same across genders.

The clothes you wear are a physical expression of your identity. They externalize how you see yourself in the world. This expression can only happen however if there are people to observe it. When no one is around, there is no one to make this expression to, hence the willingness to wear random comfortable items of clothing. 

This is distinct from choosing clothes expressly with the idea of comparison. 

To make the distinction more clear, here's a personal example.  
Let's say I'm picking a tie as I get dressed morning. If I reach for my tie patterned with the seal of the my school because I recently revisited some particularly fond memories of my time spent there I'm dressing for myself. 

If I pick that very same tie, to impress my coworkers with the prestige of my alma mater, I'm dressing for them.

School is prep for the adult world, and in the adult world people are shitty, and you have to listen to strangers you don't like because that's life. 

You may have had acceptable group activities a few times a week, but did you ever sneak behind the school to smoke? Did your parents ever get a phone call to come pick you up from some strangers house because you're drunk? Did you ever have a relationship with someone they didn't like?  

And generalizations are useful when you understand that individual cases aren't reflective of the whole. ","1359677005"

Say you went in with the above gameplan and end up getting foot swept - now you're on your back, now what?  You panic.  

Some would argue back that you _obviously_ need a branching gameplan that takes into account multiple possibilities - getting or not getting the takedown, in this case.  But at what point does that end?  How many branches does your gameplan have before it's overly complicated and impossible to remember or implement effectively?  

Instead of a gameplan, go in with a game.  Your game.  Have two, maybe three 'money moves' from each position.  Drill them all until you're sick of them, and then drill them some more.  Drill transitioning from one to the other.  Drill with an upper belt getting all of your moves stuffed.

James Bond is ordering vodka martinis in upscale establishments in the 1950's/1960's, so they're likely to be made with real potato vodka. Potato vodka is slightly oily, and so, if the drink isn't vigorously mixed, there will be a layer of oil that sits on top of the drink, and is rather unpleasant.

Im trying not to offend anyone but in my experience (and I was a bad server at a vietnamese restaurant.) European tourists who came to toronto and black people never tipped. Ever. Students tipped even though I was crappy and sometimes I wonder if its cause I always got by on my looks and older people would just be like ""thar sucked"" but then wasps would tip me all the time.
Id take it personally if you didnt tip me. Before I quit I would remember who you were and I would make sure your soup came with bodily fluids and the chicken you got or milk based food had an element of salmanella for you to enjoy later.
I can assure you this was when I was a teenage and since im cursed with a photographic memory I cant forget things and hold grudges for ever. But ive gotten better. Instead of being a server im involved in a practice that helps people. Rather than imdulging them with a tiny luxury like dining out and having pho.
Another thkng id like to note is all the restaurants I was moonlighting at are closed. I also had a vendetta against the managers. Except for this kne place in the west end. It was owned by one of the finest restauranteurs in toronto and I never messed with their food. The clients would always thank us and it goes to show that if you treat the people who cook your food, change your diapers, deliver your mail and protect you while you sleep with a little dignity and respect that youre getting clean food while that mother fucker next to you is having a flavourful farted on creme brule.

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","I second (third? fourth?) Adventure Time, but only if they're above ~10 years old. I think it's got enough older themes that younger kids won't understand it.
I also enjoyed shows like [X-Men: Evolution](http://www.youtube.com/channel/SWDmJMgpU45BE) and other superhero shows (some of which have been suggested already) and...yeah, maybe mlp. Decent superhero shows are a good choice because (for example) the X-men deal quite heavily with the themes of being different/an outsider, prejudice, and inequality. MLP is about friendship, so I don't think there's anyone who can't support that, but it might not be for everyone. I also know several teenage girls who enjoy Phineas and Ferb, though I don't know if that fulfills your request quite as well.
For a slightly unrelated suggestion...someone mentioned Star Wars. You could always try Star Trek, too (not the original series, though, that one tends to be creepier) and if they're teenagers, maybe introduce them to anime? It's not always as family-friendly, but they tend to be pretty good.

Does it really matter which one I choose to begin with? Common sense tells me that I could pick either one to do a take in mono.

Lately, I've been doing what I think you were trying to explain with the vocal and guitars on two separate tracks. Only, I've been arming two tracks panned hard left and right to record just guitar, and messing around with the track delay to get the haas effect to achieve a stereo image.

However, consciously or not, there is an aversion to gay men under the surface. When ""OP sucks cocks"" is the *de facto* insult, it's hard not to infer that ""men who suck cocks"" is an undesirable subset of society. Those who like to claim that ""faggot"" has been divorced from its homophobic meaning (like how ""idiot"" no longer has any real connection with the mentally disabled) have to grapple with the common variations on ""faggot"" that clearly refer to gay men.","1359677025"

if cis people are specifically allowed to be targeted for 'deviant' gender identities, it makes it easier for trans* people to be targeted for *their* gender identities.

i would sort of prefer to live in a world where people can't, or at least never choose to try to decide to themselves whether i'm a trans* woman, or a gay man, or an effeminate straight man simply because of how I present my body to the world around me.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","So I completely stole your mythology idea, but I changed up some of the details, and I added a couple characters, so I thought I'd share with you.

In the ancient days, there was a great king of mortals, a human named Hastur.  Hastur was a powerful warrior mage and a great hero, and he was loved by all he met.  He was also a devoted acolyte of Bahamut, and his efforts to destroy the works of Tiamat were so successful that the Dragon God made Hastur his right hand in the mortal world.  But Tiamat was jealous of Bahamut's champion, so she devised a plan to steal him from her brother.  She disguised herself as a beautiful woman named Shal and came before the king, saying she wished to marry him.  Hastur fell in love with Shal, and they were married for several years while Tiamat tried to turn Hastur to her side.  His willpower was too strong, but his love for Shal made him blind to what was happening.  Finally, Tiamat broke Hastur's mind and took her brother's servant for her own.  Harnessing Hastur's power alongside her own, the goddess blotted out the sun with fell clouds and spread chaos over the land.  The other gods were no match for her power, except for Bahamut, who battled his sister in Hastur's body.  He finally struck off three of Hastur's fingers, and the pain was enough for the king to gain control of his body for long enough to realize what Tiamat had done.  In an effort to save his kingdom from eternal darkness, he plunged his remaining fingers into the earth and raised 7 massive pillars through the clouds.  Now miles above the chaos she had created, Tiamat re-entered Hastur's mind and fought back against her brother, driving him to the edge.  But before she could strike the killing blow, the little bit of compassion she had left for her brother caused her to hesitate for a second- and Bahamut pulled her from the edge of the plateau, where they fell into the darkness together.

It's been thousands of years since the Fall of the Dragons, and neither Bahamut nor Tiamat has emerged from the dark of the Wilds.  Most believe the twin gods to be truly dead, but a few speak of a darker truth- that Tiamat still walks the Wilds, trapped in the body of Hastur, twisted with grief and hatred and insanity.","1359677028"

Alone? Probably not comfortably. If you have a partner who makes around average salary as well, then there's a better chance of not pinching pennies around the end of the month.

As to contraceptives, they're readily available for anyone. Oral contraceptive pills are cheap and it's easy to get a prescription (for minors as well, through the ""youth cabinets"" (?) system that offer free counseling and medical care, if you don't wish to go through your GP). Same with morning after pills, available at every pharmacy without prescription, no questions asked. There have been complaints that condoms are too expensive so young people might skip them altoghether. A Durex 3-pack is around 3€, a 12-pack around 10€ last I checked.

*Everyone* all around the world loves whining about their healthcare system. Looking at it objectively, I'm happy enough. I can get an appointment with my GP on the same day, usually. Specialised care can have several months of waiting time, as mentioned earlier. But any urgent problems will yield urgent help as well. Personal experience: had a sudden onset of intensive pain in the ear, the GP's reception had ended for the day, he referred me to an ear / throat clinic, went there, got a check-up and a prescription within an hour. The infrastructure is good, and the technology is top notch - at least in Tallinn and Tartu. To-be mothers are coming here to give birth from Latvia and Russia, so there's an indication of relative quality. And if the media is to be believed, Scandinavians and Finns are travelling here for dental care, as the quality is basically the same, but the prices are cheaper.","1359677029"

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","It's only fundamental in a philosophical sense, really.  Technically, we can't PROVE that the solar system won't act pathologically and fling Earth off into the galaxy in a few years.  We can estimate things, and get very close in the specific case of the three-body problem, but of course in reality we're dealing with numbers of bodies so large that even estimating them would be no mean feat.  Whether there is some emergent property that comes out of a simple system like a bunch of bodies interacting via gravity that creates an effect that mimics dark energy, for example, is something we just have to shrug our shoulders about.  If we tried to estimate it, the error would eat any conclusion long before we got very far.  But clearly, the universe clumps up and acts in really predictable ways.  Ways predictable without having to address all the interactions of the particles even though it is exclusively produced from those interactions.  Why that is, and how we could 'see it coming' from looking at the things we know about the particles, would be such monumental discoveries that they would likely dwarf all findings of science in the past millenia in terms of benefits to humanity.  Being able to construct simple systems with huge numbers of parts that would be predictable and robust or anti-fragile would be a fundamentally different paradigm from our current system of eliminating as many variables as possible in order to setup very sensitive systems formed from relatively small numbers of parts, and always working on a scale quite close to their problem domain.

edit: Let me elaborate. The main goal here is to get close to the enemy team as quickly as possible, and once you do that, remain hidden, hence the silencer and the perks. The range on the M1216 is atrocious already, so the silencer really doesn't make that much of a difference. And remember this: you want to fire off all four rounds in the chamber for each enemy, even if they're dead after two. This is because you don't wanna run into the next enemy, fire off two, and then have to rechamber. The extended mags is nice because you now have 5 chambers with 4 rounds each.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","That's a very broad question, but here's a start, from a USA perspective.

1.  Location matters.  Think carefully about the area where you want to live.  Who lives nearby?  What stores, clubs, restaurants, etc are close?  Is is close to work?  Public transportation? Pedestrian and bike friendly?  What about if/when you have kids?  Do you like the neighborhood? Crime rate?  Local schools?
2.  Selecting possible houses.  Look on Realtor.com for a searchable list of homes in your area, in your price range.  Then find a real estate agent you like.  The real estate agent will take you around to see houses and eventually help you with the negotiation process.  They also have a good sense of the proper pricing for homes in your area.  Agents get paid by the seller, so they're free to you.
3.  Inspection.  Get a qualified home inspector (your agent can recommend someone) to inspect the house and tell you if there are any problems.  There is a ""disclosure sheet"" that requires the owner to tell you about any problems they are aware of, but a good building inspector may find other things too.  it's a couple of hundred bucks, but you definitely want to know.
4.  Making an offer.  The price the owner puts on the house is the ""asking price.""  They expect you to offer less than that.  Maybe 10% off, maybe 5%.  Look for some guidance from your agent here, but remember that the agent wants you to bid as high as possible so that the deal will be more likely to go through.  (Agents get paid a commission on completed sales.)  Setting the price is a back-and-forth process, so be prepared for a couple of rounds of negotiating.
5.  Mortgage.  You'll probably need to borrow money from the bank to afford your house.  Interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) are very low right now, and you can look around for the best deal.  But, you'll need to have a good credit history score to get the best rates.  Check the online comparison sites.
6.  Down payment.  The bank won't loan you the full cost of the house; you'll need to put some of your own money towards the purchase price.  Save up until you have 20% of the purchase price in cash.  That way you'll be more likely to qualify for a loan, and you'll have some equity (ownership) of the house right from the start.  Over time, as you pay off your mortgage, you'll own a larger and larger percentage of the house.

Buying your first house can be a stressful process, but it's an exiting step in your life -- and a big step for you and your girlfriend in your lives together.

I'm eyeing the Everlane Silk ones for personal wear, but I need machine washable fabrics for work. Is [this Express Portofino blouse](http://www.express.com/the-portofino-shirt-52047-721/control/show/3/index.pro) ([Image](http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/expressfashion/97_979_9357_947?rgn=0,0,1720,2000&amp;scl=4.9002849002849&amp;id=tyorh0)) a good example of something polyester that would still look good?

But on that note, what made Deckard the best Blade Runner? Was it a superior empathetic ability that allowed him to spot replicants, thus making him a worthy arbiter of fate? It certainly didn't appear to be a physical superiority. 

I prefer the noir of Bogart: a detective caught in a conspiracy bigger than the details (eg Maltese Falcon) where it's up to his intellectual ability and criminal mind to stay one step ahead. Deckard seemed to stumble through the case and the only impressive pieces of work were recognizing the scale as a clue and the photo enhancement scene that puts CSI to shame.

Annie Hall
Casablanca
Dogma

Godfather II
Heat

Pale Rider

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","It is interesting how magic is becoming increasingly important, but I hope it doesn't continue just to exponentially expand to the point where it is just a matter of whose/which magic is stronger. I have always liked the feel in ASOIAF that it matters what the ""little people"" do too. In regards to your breakdown, I especially hope that the ""stormsinging"" trap doesn't come to pass. 

This is an overly simplistic view of the world as a whole, but so far magic goes, it was falling into three categries. Fire: dragons, horns, magic swords, bringing people back to life. Ice: wights, wargs (and ice dragons?). Prophetic: Greenseeing, Warlocks, visions of the future etc... (obviously not a full list, but I only have a couple of minutes before work, downvotes away for incompleteness).

Throwing another arm of elemental sorcery into the fold just seems confusing. As an aside, a friend tried to get me to read Codex Alera recently and everyone in control of something just becomes blah, but I digress. 

So, I hope it is just crazy Euron boasting/rambling/bravado and not a case a huge naval force being overcome by a conjuror's tempest. Sure, it is fun to play with readers and have a shadow babies  turn the tables of what would've been an easy victory (in terms of military might) for Renly to Hammis, but I don't want to see such tropes rehashed.

I, for one, would rather see the naval battle we were robbed of because of the use of wildfire, than have one more kind of magic to speculate about. ","1359677045"

To me, Fallout New Vegas lacked the soul of Fallout 3. While NV made some technical improvements, it lost some of the flavor that made FO3 great (ie. Characters, Storyline and Finale). 

So, if you loved FNV, you will probably really love FO3.

I will caution you that navigation can be much more painful in FO3 than in FNV. Being from DC, I found myself wondering, ""How can a videogame make navigating DC's metro lines MORE of a pain in the ass than they are in real life--aside from there being no running trains. lol)","1359677046"

Other than that, never rub your emulsion. You can easily screw up the stencil edge or worse. (Source: my own sad mistake)

Use more water pressure but don't get anywhere near power washer pressure. Some emulsions take a bit of time to spray out. Be patient. You can get most stencils out with normal house water pressure through a sprayer. 

I always put black fabric on the ink side if the screen when exposing but mainly for better edge definition. 

You should also perform a step exposure test with your set up. [start here](http://www.silkscreeningsupplies.com/page/910538)

2. Pre-08, none. I have heated grips to keep my hands from going numb on cold mornings, but there's not much you can do to increase performance significantly without spending tons of money, and at that point you could buy a used super sport. 08+, I've heard a Leo Vince full exhaust system can add 4 horsepower or so, but it will cost around $600.

The fact remains though that Riot sold these 'Limited Edition' skins under the conditions that they would NOT be released again in the store at any point.

They would have to offer a refund (if not even something else in compensation) to every player who had once bought these skins if they were to do resell them in anyway. I'm not even just talking about an RP refund here, there is a good chance that the players wouldn't have even purchased RP to begin with if they weren't Limited Edition.

Gaming communities and communities in general that gather a large fanbase and put the label 'Limited Edition' on ANYTHING, it sells better than it normally would and people who have it purchase it knowing that they're 'special' that they have it.

I own numerous limited edition skins, not legacy, and I would be furious if I made the purchases in the past under that sort of agreement only for them to do something like this. I'm sorry, but the fans that this type of idea would infuriate are the ones that own them already. It's better to have legacy skins heading towards the future because it keeps the most amount of people happy because at least they know they will go on sale again. They shouldn't and I don't think they will go back on their word with limited edition skins. (Goth Annie isn't and was never limited edition, it was just a collector's edition add-in)","1359677049"

It's like you are part of a market that is catered to stupid people that click on whatever flashy rubbish grabs their attention.

Something else that annoys me is the removal by some YouTubers of comment ratings. These are so essential to having a sense of community. Obviously, YouTube comments on popular videos don't generate discussion, but seeing top comments highlights what the common consensus among the viewers is. Without it, I feel like the video-creator doesn't care about the viewers' opinions, and it makes me feel insignificant as a viewer.

If you happen to be reading this Etho, then I think you should keep going pretty much as you are. Thumbnails would be a nice touch, but more out of their usefulness to me than to popularity gaining for you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a story like yours. I delivered to an apartment once where the people were upstairs having fairly loud sex. I didn't hear them at first so I rang the doorbell, no answer. Knocked on the door next, no answer. Started hearing what might have been sex sounds upstairs, walked out to my car to get my cell phone, called the number on the order. No answer. Walked back to the door. Knocked again, only heard louder sex sounds. A couple walking a dog walked by, saw me, heard what was happening upstairs, gave me a sympathetic look as they passed. I called them again, held my phone up to hopefully record some of what they were doing on the answering machine.

So, after about 5-10 minutes of first knocking on the door, I hear things die down, and I pound as loud as I could on the door. From the window I hear a woman say ""Oh shit"", and then louder, ""I'm coming!""

I'm not 100% sure if I spelled what she meant to say correctly, but shortly after she got dressed and ran down the stairs in panties and a button up shirt and the rest was a normal delivery.","1359677054"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I think the next step for zombie survival, as overplayed as it is, is to create an actual living world that simulates a zombie outbreak. Perhaps the next-next generation consoles and PCs will be powerful enough to simulate a huge in-game world with tens of thousands of NPCs with their own schedules all being run at the same time. When you begin the game, a seed is set in one or maybe a few people that turns them into zombies, and they become hostile to everything else and spread the infection in real time. It wouldn't be a single linear storyline but would sort of be a roguelike-style game that you play many times. 

You start somewhere on a huge continent, and somewhere else (possibly very far away), someone starts out infected. You don't know where the infection starts, but you need to investigate as quickly as you can so you have the advantage in stopping it. As homes and cities get wiped out, you can find media coverage hinting at where the danger is. Civilians and wild animals are vulnerable, but you'll have police and armies on your side if things get rough. There are also no respawns - the world begins with a set number of people and it ends when all of the zombies have been wiped out or if you die. 

As you manage to win rounds of the game, you unlock more options, modifications, and difficulties. Greater population densities, greater land size, mods like ""Outbreak is guaranteed to start in an area with high population density"" or ""All zombies know where you are and immediately move on your location""","1359677068"

The pair of logs you then have are your P(t) here, you shouldn't be subbing in P(t)=e^kt here. If you wanted P(t) explicitly you'd combine the logs and then raise them to a power to undo the logs etc. See (this link)[http://www.math.usu.edu/powell/ysa-html/node8.html] for an example.

This means you should be subbing in the P(0)=1400 condition as:

`[; \frac{\log(1400)-\log(30000-1400)}{k} +c = 0 ;]`

and similarly for P(1)=2800. This gives you 2 equations in k and c to solve for these constants.

So their ability to attack would basically serve as a time limit: Construct enough houses for your small group of Testificates within this number of days or die! On hard mode the villagers would have no form of attack at all, but they would have increased AI, allowing them to sneak past mobs.

"HiTMAN","t5_2rn0x","I have two ideas that I think would really make Contracts even better:

1.  Allow more than 3 targets.  Hitman missions have featured multiple targets before (upwards of 5 and 6).  Allowing a player to make this many targets would create even more replay value and allow for limitless missions from the community. 

2.  Get rid of the ""Don't Miss any Shots"" thing.  Instead, set a limit for the number of bullets that can be fired.  This would reward players for conserving ammunition.  So, for example, let's say there are four targets.  Instead of the whole don't miss any shots thing, the player would be rewarded for finding a way to take out all four targets using only two bullets, say, with a sniper rifle.  This would create for some challenging shots that players need to find and execute and really make Contracts mode more challenging.  Instead of don't miss any shots, it would be ""Kill all the targets using no more than 2 bullets"" or something, and the player would have to find the perfect shot to kill two people with one shot (or even more, possibly), setting up some awesome trick shots.

If you can't shoot video legally, also considered getting one of those [Livescribe](http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/) pens for audio note-taking that gets cross-referenced with marks in your notebook. Teachers are likely to give you or one of your classmates permission to use a pen like that -- having a friend use it is even better, if the teacher is suspicious of you as a potential trouble-maker. That way you can accurately transcribe what's said if you need to report it, and also can burn a back-up disc of proof (not to use unless or until the teacher denies having said what you transcribed. Only bring out the proof *after* the teacher has lied to the principal about never having said those things.)

If a class in your public school (or really any part of your government) is promoting a specific religion, or promoting a specific church even, then that's a serious violation. I hope you are all over documenting this, and get help from any friends in class who can help you without calling attention to it.

Edit: There are organizations that can help you if a talk with school administrators doesn't fix this problem.

Sorry, just because I'm a big guy I'm not going to go risk myself and $7,000 worth of equipment just to save this guys old brick.","1359677082"

Although I did say sometimes it is philosophy, like you said, it helps people understand the world around them, especially in Buddhism. Why I like Buddhism even more is it's more self guided, it is what you make of it, your mind drives it. Buddhists even argue that it isn't a religion, but more so philosophy. It isn't what we normally think of as religion. Your idea of philosophy is very interesting, why don't you think it's about truths?

Also... I'm not extremely experienced in Buddhism, so I won't be able to debate with someone for long if someone calls me out on that. Nor will I be confident in some areas.","1359677082"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","They have this reaction, because they believe that the new testament (NT) changes the laws of god from the old testament (OT). Also, the NT is what separates christians from jews, and they believe that the OT is there for just context (at least that's what I understand from christian friends and acquaintances that I debated). 

There are several things to argue against in the NT. It's just that the OT is riddled with the more ""obvious arguments"" (stuff like slavery etc) so debaters and prevalent atheists tend to point those out, and as a result, these are the arguments we know best to use as atheists.

Some things you could point out (sorry for long list):

* Perhaps the most important thing you could argue is that Jesus does say that he is NOT CHANGING the laws set out in the OT (Matthew 5:17-19; Luke 16:17; John 7:19). The only thing he was sent to change was to sacrifice himself in order to absolve humanity of the original sin and allow through redemption for other humans to enter heaven.

* also you can argue on the way Jesus offers salvation. Salvation is not offered freely to everyone, but rather you have to humble yourself and offer your servitude to god. Otherwise you go to hell. This of course, consitutes a threat and not an offer, but is cleverly disguised under the guile of free will. There's a clever analogy for this point: It's like a robber saying ""your money or your life, your choice"", or a mobster asking for protection money, otherwise bad things might happen to you, either way it's your choice. This is emotional blackmail and creates a moral system based on fear. If you commit finite crimes, you are punished for an infinite period of time, UNLESS you offer yourself to be an obedient servant of god.

* the liar, lunatic or lord argument, which through a process of elimination tries to prove that Jesus was god (the counterarguments against this notion can be found [here](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Liar,_Lunatic_or_Lord)). In other words, this is the most effective way to disprove the divinity of jesus if you use the counterarguments against this argument.

* the sermon of the mount: you can argue that it requires of people to be happy in life no matter their situation because those who suffer end up in heaven and their tormenters in hell. However, this notion also encourages people to be obedient slaves to their tyrants, to never fight for their rights and freedom, to not try and improve their situation. In other words it is a lesson of obedience to all high authority.

* Although the moral teachings of Jesus could be considered indeed wise, most of them are borrowed from greek and roman philosophers and other religions, including budhism which appeared in India about 600-800 years before the alleged birth of Jesus. That is not to say exclusively that Jesus ""stole"" those teachings, but it serves as proof that christianity can not be considered the correct religion merely because Jesus was the only one who taught morality.

* You could argue against the historicity of Jesus. Although historians generally accept that such a person might have existed, his divinity is questioned. The main argument in this case is, that if someone walked around in even a remote corner of the roman empire, raising the dead and healing the blind, then logically at least one of the 20 prominent historians of that era would record at least a line about him.

* You could argue on the writing of the NT. The NT consists of 4 gospels, however there are tens more (also called Apocryphas) which say the same story of Jesus but never made it in the bible. In fact the 4 ""official"" gospels were also written at least 30-60 years after the death of christ, and mainly contain second-hand witness testimonies. They contradict themselves greatly, to the extend where 2 of the 4 don't mention that Mary was a virgin. The NT as is known today was compiled by Constantine the Great, who was seeking to reestablish the Roman Empire, by moving the capital to the Byzantine peninsula, the city of Constantinople (Instabul today) and adapting Christianity as the official religion of the state. The compilation of the NT was made at the Synod of Nicaea at 336 AD (not sure on date, but somewhere around there), where the 4 gospels were chosen out of approximately 150 others. The gospels were translated to ancient greek from hebrew and constituted the holy book of the official christian religion. It's worth mentioning, that Constantine the Great, although revered as a saint by the orthodox church, he only became a christian at his deathbed.

* The NT also includes the letters Paul sent to various christian societies he and the other apostles formed, in the segment known as Epistles, in which you can find plenty of things to argue against. The one I'm most familiar with is the first epistle (epistle = from greek επιστολη meaning mailed letter) to the Corinthians, in which he encourages the ""true believers"" to actively punish the sinner christians, enforce sexual purity laws and try to recruit more people from the city to the christian ranks in order to fight against the immorality spreading through the city.

"spikes","t5_2utkz","I went on an indefinite hiatus from Magic back in '04, and around '06-'07 I decided that I probably would never return to the game, and sold my entire collection. 

Yet, here I am. I've recently decided to break back into the competitive scene, formerly I was a consistent Top 4 finishers at my LGS, as well as a handful of Top 10 Finishes at surrounding PTQs, and more less impressive Top 25s. 

I hope to return to my former level of competitive play, and then increase beyond that, and maybe attend some Pro-Tours. I'll be moving to Seattle in a couple of weeks, where this is a much big scene, and with that, I've decided to start studying the Meta, and rebuilding my collection. With some confidence in what I've learned, I've decided to work on creating my own versions of popular decks in the Meta, and was hoping to get some feedback from fellow players, who are actively participating in the competitive scene. I feel that the best way to get better, is to be able to look at what's out there winning, and then find a way to make it your own, just copying some deck from the Pro-Tour and taking it to FNM doesn't do much in the way of learning. 

So, without further rambling, here is my version of Bant deck, influenced by Simic. 

End-Game Guilds Decklist: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/end-game-guilds/

The main focus of the deck is to use Restoration Angel and Cloudshift to blink creatures like Thragtusk, Prime Speaker, and Armada Wurm to get the ball rolling, while using acceleration from Avacyn's Pilgrim, Farseek, &amp; Ranger's Path to speed things up before it's too late. 

I decided to use Bioshift to bring my own flavor to the deck, although I'm sure I'm not the first to think of it. It works wonderfully with Zegana, initially I ran more creatures with Evolve, so Zegana wasn't the only Bioshiftable target, but after some playtesting found that they weren't serving any purpose besides slowing the deck down. This is my second revision of the deck, and I feel confident enough with the deck's ability to succeed in the competitive scene now to put it up for discussion without fear of getting blasted by the community. 

I go into a more in-depth discussion about the deck, and the reasons I made the choices I've made, as well as, some ideas/revisions that are in my head for the deck, but I haven't been able to pull the trigger on in my blog. If you like what you see here, and would like to see what inspires my decisions to either use them for yourself, or find a better way to show me what I'm doing wrong, I'd love to gain some more feedback/followers.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That a wizard or in your words ""magician"" fulled with evil and hatred, went to kill the Potters, but his plan went south when his incantation backfired when he tried to kill a young boy, and he went around to the Albanian Forests to hide and hope to be revived. 
It took him about ten years until a man full of fear found him, and tried to help him return to his old body, but the young boy he had previously tried to kill won, and He Who Must Not Be Named went back into hiding. 
Then, in the form of an old diary, Tom Riddle from the past came back and tried to kill the young boy he had tried to kill in the past-future, but alas he failed and his form was killed with the diary. 
It was another two years, before a coward known as Peter Pettigrew went searching for Lord Voldemort, found him and with some help managed to revive him back to his full body. 
Once again, Harry Potter escaped and the half wizard half vampire died (rumoured to be along with his acting talents).
Lord Voldemort stayed hidden, as the ministry of magic refused to believe he was alive, and he was just killing a few people but not many, to remain unknown.
Once again, he met up with Harry Potter, and tried to kill him, but he just failed. He cannot even kill someone who is 50 years younger than him, though he is trying his best.
The entire wizarding world is alerted that he is alive.
Lord Voldemort stays out of the drama for a whole year, until finally he is trying to track down Harry Potter, the ginger weasel and the mudblood. He is a control freak, controlling the ministry of magic, hogwarts and thousands of other things, making everyone lose hope.
The only hope left was Harry Potter, but then Harry Potter and Voldemort finally make out only for voldemort to explode into a final little pieces.

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","Then people wouldn't want to build up a bank. Remember, this is Runescape. Players want to avoid spending unnecessary money where they can. Having a taxation floor just makes people want to avoid building wealth, and as an extension building up a respectable bank of gear and supplies. A player with a few 99s banked shouldn't have to pay the same taxes as a dice host just because they have the same net worth. The dice host is the one concentrating wealth and driving up inflation of high valued goods, not the person buying stats.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;Because people tend judge policies based on their intentions and not their results. 

What can we use as a basis for comparison?  I can't think of a 1st world country willing to not subsidize the poor - and poor children.

&gt;If you look at the portions of people in poverty, they only climb/remain stagnant when you expand welfare. Reductions in actual poverty come from economic growth, and taking money away from the economy is antithetical to that.

Subsidies add money to the economy by giving it to poor people who go out and (hopefully) spend it on food/shelter/basic necessities.  

&gt;No I mean your objection is based on the assumption that the poor can't take care of their children, but welfare is based on the same assumption.

Are you asserting that poor people *can* take care of their children without state subsidies or that they *should*?

&gt;I think you misunderstand what capitalism entails, and prison recidivism is highest among those with shorter sentences.

I don't misunderstand capitalism entails.. I just don't see how making more prisons and rewarding incarceration helps our society.

Of course people with shorter sentences reoffend more often.  The ones with longer sentences are still in prison (possibly offending in there).

&gt;Well maybe if it didn't take so long and didn't cost so much due to government policy more people would be willing and able to do it.

I've no doubt it would encourage people to adopt/foster.  However, I just don't see a large enough percentage of the population stepping up.  Orphanages would be the most likely result.

&gt;I'm okay with a rough transition period if it's better for everyone in the long run.

Fair enough.  I hope that if it happens - it waits till I'm gone.

&gt;The problem with these kinds of policies is confusing intention and result, which makes it politically unpalatable for anyone to ever regress in wages from that, despite the fact most people don't stay in the same income bracket for very long. Even among the rich and the poorest quintiles 40% are no longer in the upper/lower quintile, respectively, a decade later; people for the most part are very transient to begin wit, but politicians convince well meaning voters with snapshots of data and intentions over results. 

I don't know how this relates unless you're suggesting the people below the poverty line keep bouncing in and out of that percentile.


&gt;Unfortunately the only way to enforce responsibility to have them face the actual threat of those casualties and removing barriers such as the minimum wage and lack of school choice. You can't reasonably expect people to be consistently responsible if they don't bear the costs of their decisions.

I disagree with you.  Dissolving safety nets for people in need just breaks down the society by forcing more people into criminal behavior (society harmful).  Not paying a living wage forces more people into criminal (societally harmful) behavior.  Schools have limited resources - I taught at a State university for 6 years (ending in 2011) and it was hard to find rooms big enough for some of the classes - not to mention when 1 Instructor has 120 students grading and individual attention suffers.

You can't expect children to be reasonably responsible adults but they still need to be fed.  As for the parents, all to often, they're still children.  Taking them away and putting the children someplace else (ie. the arms of an adopting person(s) or an orphanage) doesn't seem to do anything to promote responsibility since all the parents need to do is grow another baby until the state stops taking them away.

I know of people that turned away from homosexuality and have gone on to live perfectly normal married lives. Sin can be overcome if the person wants to overcome it. However most of the gay community doesn't want this. They want us to rewrite God's word so they don't feel offended. They don't want to change. They want their lifestyle to be accepted. They want us to conform which means we would have to turn away from God. No sir. I don't care how much I offend someone. I will not bend on this issue.

I have extreme anxiety towards unknown people when I am walking alone, and to cure that I am now listening to music everytime I can. The reason for this is because I am hyper-aware of my environment (I suffer from depersonalization) and I am constantly watching around me, listening to all noises and everything that happens in my close proximity, because I am so frightened of other unknown persons that I have to keep track of what they do all the time.

Condoms are thought of primarily to prevent pregnency. Gay men cannot make babies, so they do not always use condoms. During the rise of the HIV epidemic, I'm fairly certain gay men never used condoms. So, when the first man got it, there was no way to stop it. Now, there is a movement to get homosexual couples to practice safe sex as well, and if I'm not mistaken, the rate of HIV contraction has dropped. I do not have a source for that. So, use condoms.","1359677091"

"Archaeology","t5_2qmyp","&gt; I have no doubt that this is why known looters visited my project this summer, eager to show us archaeologists their cases of framed artifacts looted from the local area's sites (including artifacts clearly from burial context). To be able to say that an archaeologist inspected / identified an artifact and gave it his / her seal of approval would, I'm sure, boost its value in many people's eyes. 

And then you get those folks going back to the sites they're mining to get more. Because if you have one, two is worth twice as much, right? And how many burials do you have to rip out to find one more really good one. One? Two? Ten?


I've noticed a behavior pattern with similar elements between serial ""artifact inquirers"", and people who almost use the knowledge or acknowledgement by the archaeologist to elevate themselves--a sort of ""Show-and-Tell"" contact high. They not only really, really like knowing, they like to tell EVERYONE that they're ""working with a real archaeologist"" until the point where I've overheard them say that they were. 

They start with something fairly ubiquitous and after identification they have a story they can tell others about it. Whereas this would be where a normal person would stop, these serial inquirers return again... and again with even more stuff and with more of an attitude about the artifacts. I've been asked ""could you please tell me about this thing"" and Ive been told ""Tell me about this artifact; it's your job to tell me so you can't say no.""  by the same person to which I stopped.

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","&gt;since it reeks of ""chivalry"" and gender double-standards. That said, I'm approaching it from a Western perspective

those notions of macho chivalry were imported directly from English society during colonial times which tended to praise a certain sir gallahad school of manliness. 

The British did not consider South Asian men fit to rule themselves because of their soft-spoken and feminine demeanor, as opposed to the kind of brash alpha-toughness they expect from ""real men."" 

Ironically, that sparked a small women's suffrage movement among colonial women in I think, the 1860s.. as if to say, ""hey what do you mean too feminine to rule?!""

Steven Moffat's era tends to have a lot of them because he likes messing around with time but doesn't always think them through, so there are often plot holes galore. Like why River Song asked the 10th doctor about the Crash of the Byzantium when he's very obviously the wrong regeneration or everything about the Wedding of River Song. 

RTD era has less plots holes but they creep up when writers aren't careful. 10's regeneration didn't make sense to me because it seemed to me to be unnecessary. Like why didn't he just run to the TARDIS, kidnap Captain Jack and throw him into the machine to save Wilf? or the episode of Dalek where no one knows what a Dalek is despite the Daleks invading Earth twice already?

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","I'll say it again.  Wenger is a long-term guy.  The method he has been using for the past 10 years has always been successful up to the point of our top players leaving.  The discussion of Arsenal success has always been ""We were so close, if only Cole/Adebayor/Clichy/Hleb/Flamini/Nasri/Cesc/van Persie/Toure hadn't left, we'd be right up there"".

Arsene has seen that what he does works, the point of failure being the departure of players once they reach a certain level.  Now with increased funds and the British core he has addressed that.  When Jack/Aaron/Kieran/Theo develop to their full potential, not only will they love the club, we will finally have the money to give them to sate their greed.  Of course this will infuriate fans because it means we are still 3-4 years from realistically challenging for the major trophies (Premier League, Champions League), but what our manager has done is take a successful formula with one weakness, and fix the weakness.

Or we could pull a Liverpool and die a horrible horrible death.

It's hard to say where the idea began, but there are a few key themes:

1) Radiation. Everyone talks about how cell phones operate on radio waves and reports of it causing cancer sometimes call it ""radiation"". This is...sort of correct. They *are* electromagnetic radiation, but so are many other things, including radios, satellite signals, and so on. It also ignores the fact that cell phone and wifi waves are too ""large"" to fit between skin cells. 

2) Circumstantial evidence and popular ""stories"". These sound like they link cancer to cell phone use, but they are not actual hard evidence and can have many alternate explanations. For example, my mom is a neurologist and had a patient who used to work for CCIS (Canada's secret service). They got a brain tumour exactly around beside device installed in their ear that received radio signals (for covert communication). However, my mother, instead of jumping to the conclusion that it was the signals that caused it, said that it could be anything from mere coincidence since the patient had a family history of brain tumours, to the metals and materials used in the device (this was decades ago, after all). Another example are the many stories of people who ""use their cell phone all the time"" and then get tumours near their ear. Well...yeah. Everyone uses cellphones all the time and, by random chance, a few of them will develop tumours near where they put their cell phone. They confuse circumstantial evidence for actual evidence. *Everyone* does this all the time, usually without even realizing it. I find it takes either university, dedication in high school, or learning from experience to beat it out of them. 

3) They don't know what causes cancer. Cancer is caused by cell mutation. However, cell phone signals have not been conclusively proven to cause cell mutation. This is because the strength and frequency of cell phone radiation aren't enough to break down chemical and genetic structures. People who believe they cause cancer either deny or are simply unaware of this fact. 

4) There are also a bunch of stuff about how people can be afraid of technology and therefore blame society's ills on technology, which has some merit but probably isn't a root cause. 

5) They started believing it and are now in the habit of believing it. My use of ""habit"" is key here. Once someone believes something, it takes a lot of effort and experience for them to believe something else. It is very hard for most people to change their belief in the short term and, the longer they go without questioning something, the less likely it is for them to be convinced otherwise. Many people who started believing cell phones cause cancer back when they were new, mysterious, and relatively unknown things aren't willing to change their opinion.

[Here](http://www.dropeik.com/risk_excerpt.html) is a good article outlining the issue. 

ELI5: People sometimes believe things because they don't know everything about the topic, which is hardly their fault, or because they refuse to believe facts because they are convinced they are right. They also don't know what is good or bad evidence which, again, is not always their fault. ","1359677124"

I mean, shit, why would they drive a few hours when all they have to do is just go a local LEGAL gun store and have someone else make the purchase... 

So my point is that if we can't enforce the laws we have, what makes you think we can enforce an all out ban?

&gt; Gee, I wonder if gun ownership is the ONLY factor in the murder rate? Not like. you know, a complete and total collapse of government? I wonder what Russia's murder rate would have been if guns were legal?

Russian government enacted an all out gun ban. They have a very oppressive government still. The point is that they couldn't do it. I'm sorry, but when you discard data. You need to quantify it.

You are saying we need to revoke the second amendment. You're going to need a lot more proof than you have to convince people otherwise. The second amendment is as much about guns as the first amendment is about pens.

There is mention of a comparison of kids who have different levels of exposure to NATURALLY OCCURRING fluoride. Not the quite same as the fluoride you are drinking. Also, what kids? From where? What other factors exist in this study? How did they isolate the effects of natural fluoride on dental health amongst all the noise? How does natural fluoride differ from the fluoride in your water (a waste product of the aluminum industry)?

So, I still haven't heard any decent argument for adding fluoride to my water.

 I was with you until that part. I understand that the OS is easier for less techy (older-ish) people (which I am assuming your parents are, although they may not be) to deal with and are less buggy, and that with what they would actually use a laptop for (again, assuming here) it's cheaper and easier to get a tablet. Basically, I understand all the arguments both for the existence of tablets and for people wanting to buy them. But I still can't help but think of tablets with mobile OSes as remarkably stupid. I don't know why. Those Win8 convertibles sure are fucking snazzy though. ","1359677132"

Sort the result by number of ratings is a pretty good way to go. You can also sort by geek rank or average rating (which doesn't work well with low numbers of ratings).

You can also (somehow, don't remember right now) add columns to the result, like the number of people who own a game. That can be useful too.

I also like the threads/geeklists called something like ""What did you make or plan to make in January 2013?"". You can get some great ideas in there.","1359677132"

Generally, it's thought that Trahearne's Wyld Hunt to purify Orr sideswipes their own personal story. It kinda does and doesn't - the two paths have the same procession until it comes time to kill Zhaitan. Trahearne isn't there for that, instead it's Destiny's Edge being responsible for getting that moving. 

The hate I would expect to see more of is for the five members of Destiny's Edge. After all, they do a lot more to get in the way of things and drag you along than Trahearne does. 

And yet, all of these six characters we're discussing here have good points and bad points. Most of the problem is in the presentation, and how a section of the players react to it. Again, these are mostly the same people who feel Kormir ""stole their spotlight"" before.

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","Go check out your local junk yards or metal recyclers for an older style out door HVAC unit. The guards on the unit covert very nicely into a disc golf basket, and chain holder.

[Youtube ~ Build a disc golf basket from HVAC parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jie8kV-QGLI)

After you have the parts for the basket structure, get a 100 ft box of trapping chain. It is the most in expensive heavy duty chain you can buy, however is not galvanized or rust proof. 

[100 FT of trapping chain on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/100-feet-of-2-Straight-Link-chain-traps-trapping-/290666337606?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item43ad105546)

[Different trapping chains](http://www.schmittent.com/chain)

You will also need a [fence pole](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202024128/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=fence+pole&amp;storeId=10051#.UQsDsL9lEn0).

After you have your parts, weld them (or have them welded) together.  Keep a light layer of oil on your basket to keep it rust proof, or have it powered coated. 

The real tricky thing is to avoid approaching the $130 ~ $140 mark, because at that point it may be more inexpensive and hassle free to purchase a DGA [M-14](http://www.amazon.com/DGA-M-14-Disc-Golf-Basket/dp/B0009T6AF6) or [Mach Lite](http://www.amazon.com/Mach-Lite-Disc-Golf-Target/dp/B0015O6QSA/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359677004&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mach+lite). 

There is also the second hand market to consider. I managed to score a almost new DGA Mach V in blue powder coat with wheel stand for $160 on Craigslist. 

This basket is currently for sale in my local area, [Disc Craft Chainstar - $200](http://tampa.craigslist.org/hil/spo/3544176765.html). Don't be afraid to haggle people down either, the list price is always negotiable on Craigslist.  

My advise is to be patient, keep checking your local junk yards as well as your state's Craigslist. You will eventually stumble across a great deal on a used basket or will gathered up all the needed HVAC parts to build one for peanuts. ","1359677137"

THE EVIDENCE, THE DENIAL, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
PRIMARY PREVENTION AND TREATMENT*](http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V70%20version%20N3.pdf)  
  
&gt;...Despite these writings, **the prevailing conceptualization of PV remains that it is primarily a male crime** and that the few women who do perpetrate PV do so almost exclusively in self-defense or in retaliation for a long history of victimization. Because of this conceptualization, **it is necessary to present the evidence on symmetry in perpetration rate**, motivation and risk factors for partner violence before moving on to explanations for the misperception and the implications of the misperception for designing more effective modes of prevention and treatment of PV. ....Several studies, including large and nationally representative samples, have found that that **the most prevalent pattern is mutual violence, and that female-only violence is as prevalent as, or more prevalent than, maleonly violence.** This is true **even for severe partner violence such kicking, attacks with objects, choking**...","1359677140"

Walking out of that tunnel to see that beautiful overly saturated world and then realising how big it was is something I've experienced in only one other game, WoW. Skyrim gets 3rd place because of how much they improved the combat and for making what could have been an epic game.

"volleyball","t5_2rcxy","It really is a lot about safety to others and ref's discretion. In a lot of cases it is easiest to just say 'absolutely no jewelry', which is why a lot of regional associations have such policies, but a high-level ref should have the common sense to be able to make decisions on an individual basis.

General rules to follow are: no rings or bracelets (get caught on nets/other players and can cause a lot of injury); no chains (won't break easily if caught on something); necklaces that will break easily if caught should still be tucked underneath uniforms; and careful of earrings (more below).

As a girls coach, I make a point of always reminding players to take out any kind of earrings that can catch on things (hoops etc), as well as any earrings with pin backs (the kind with a pin that extends out behind the ear). The latter can cause incredibly painful injuries if a player is hit in the side of their head and the pin punctures the skin/bone right behind the earlobe.

As for the gum: http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/fitness-coach/Will-Chewing-Gum-Improve-My-Performance.html

Speaking of curry, what about bypassing utensils and eating in a more Asian style? In a lot of Indian regions it's common to use flatbread (e.g. paratha, chapatti) to pick up food with the hands - depending on his dexterity it might be helpful to be able to do that rather than rely on a hand-utensil-mouth arrangement.

I think the narrative relied too much on mood though. The short could've used more substance (which doesn't have to mean more length), in that you could've made the duo have more powerful scenes between them. I really didn't see anything happen that would make the straight girl go ""I've only known you for three hours and I'm already damaged."" . The line was good but it felt unwarranted.

I guess I think the script could've used one more pass or a second set of eyes before heading into production in order to make it really good. Right now your short film shines, but I think it could sing. But that's my opinion. I think you've done a great job at directing and I hope you have more fiction lined up.

Rabadons. It's good against champions that you're not going to kill easily (Cho'gath, Swain, bruiser mids, etc) or if you're losing lane. This is a standard first item.

Rylais if you're against an AD caster that can beat you like Talon.

Prior to 2006, most spacecraft had significant energy leakage issues which were primarily due to solar radiation, but other factors such as space-dust also contribute to the problem (tiny particles moving thousands of miles an hour). The leakages occur on certain areas of spacecraft are purposefully exposed to allow for high-frequency transmissions from the craft.

To solve this problem, the thermodynamic foil is installed as a mobile part which contains Kevochlak-Yaal gel (Russian invented, not sure where the name originated). The part will automatically engage as transmissions are being prepared to be sent, to allow a temporary exposure of that area on the craft. When there are no transmissions, the foil skeleton will reset to stop space-dust and the solar radiation is absorbed and diffused by the gel.

Speaking as a person who makes dollars, I'm assuming, like you, to bargain is just to get rid of the little change. Say, the price of a kilo of meat being PhP 150 and they cut you a 1.10 kilo-portion, ask them to give it to you for PhP 150 anyway.

There are wet markets where they post the prices of EVERYTHING on a big board along with the 'Timbangan ng Bayan' or the public weighing scale to make sure no one's over-pricing. But if you're shopping in a grocery store like Shopwise or Save More, don't sweat it, expect it to be a bit more pricey than the stuff from the wet market.

So really, PhP 5 to maybe PhP 20 is acceptable, depending on you're choice of purchase. (Hah! That's a $0.50 savings at the most!)

If it's a taxi ride or renting a van, or island hopping, and they won't use a meter, don't hesitate to ask for them to chop the price by 30%, maybe sometimes even half. You'll have to ask around to find a good deal and will take time and patience. And if it comes down to it, say something along the lines of '...but I only have this much 'cause my friend told me this is the standard fare.' It'll give them the idea that you're an honorary Filipino and will stop giving you weird treatment. You know?

Or getting a maid, for $70/month and have them do the grocery shopping for you? Man, I loved that! Cause they know better -- quality, freshness, which piece of avocado to pick, what time of the day to go to the market, how to chop that coconut. Then they cook for you, and do your laundry and clean your house, plant that calamansi and labuyo trees so you have an endless supply in your backyard. I love all the nannies I had growing up!

Those are pretty much the two spots to park at and drop off and pick up points if you want to shuttle.  You can hike up even more from the top point (A) to add vertical to your run.  This is the backcountry so be sure to check if avalanche conditions exist, take required gear, and be sure to be safe.  On full moon nights it can be like a party at some places where people will build a bonfire near the (B) point.

Hiking would take a good amount of time, skinning probably wouldn't take that long, and shuttling would be the quickest.  

Sorry I can't really provide too specific info, I went once something like 6 years ago when I was living in Keystone.  Here are some other sites I found just googling loveland pass moonlight skiing.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","My opinion:

The thing about mid is, it's the only lane that has such a big influence on the rest of the map in the way that laning isn't the be-all of a mid champ. Because of this, there is no real consensus on what makes a 'good' mid. As the start of Season 3 has shown us, AD champs can do just as well as AP champs in mid lane, and so we know that so many different champions can prove so versatile in this lane.

And that's the problem.

If we were to talk about bot lane we'd discuss say AD/support synergy or providing lane presence. If we were to talk about top lane we'd talk about maybe optimal trades and power spikes. With jungle, counterjungling; ganking routes etc. You get the idea. But with mid lane what can we discuss? Apart from just straight out comparing matchups there's just so much variety in playstyle between champions and the lane is so gorram short that it would be pointless to talk about anything other than the champions themselves, and that's the point; instead of talking about the lane, we talk about the champions.","1359677158"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't think there should be any restrictions on the type of guns someone should be able to own, be it a vintage Browning M2 or a .22 cal. target pistol. However, I do believe in having extensive background checks, waiting periods, and mandatory training certifications. Every prospective gun owner should have to go through training courses in the safe and effective operation of the type of gun they are buying and then have to pass an exam to get their license (like with driving). Too many people are killed or hurt by not knowing how to operate their own gun. This would also prevent some spontaneous gun purchases for crimes. I also think ammunition types should be regulated, armor piercing and explosive rounds should not be legal. ","1359677166"

This is an interesting point. The restrictions they are referring to are restrictions that for any other law are par for the course.

The Tea Partiers made sure to obey the laws in their protests.  They broke no laws and made sure to get the appropriate permits.

OWS protesters occupied private property, or public property without bothering to get permits.  A crime.  This exhibits the attitude problem of the group because they had no regard for private property of others.  They were pepper sprayed because they resisted arrest or refused to leave when the authorities asked them to.  A thing that never happened with the Tea Party.

You're right in stating that it's unfair to compare the two.  One group showed regard and adherence to the law of the land and the property rights of others.  The other group was a self centered group of criminals who showed no regard for the law or property rights of others.","1359677178"

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","On the most basic level, the thing is a cell phone with a GPS.  If you knew the inner workings of these systems, you could probably make a smart phone mimic one of these devices.  (These inner workings (including addresses/URLs, APIs, certificates, passwords, etc.) are probably well hidden details, mind you.)

However, it's not clear how useful that would be.  OK, so you have a device you can put somewhere.  A signal appears on the tracker center downtown, the police are alerted that their device was deployed.  They weren't notified by the officers using it, so they call up the police car that the should have the device with the serial number that you're using, ask if they deployed.  ""Nope"".  They go out to check the device, no, that number device is still there.

They call Starchase customer support, they don't know what's going on.  The police aren't actively chasing anybody, so they meander over to the location reported when they get a chance, see if they can find your device.  

Of course, you could have more fun by making it report a location that is not correct, but even so, unless the police are chasing somebody, they aren't going to all drop everything to chase it.  The only cops who are going to be actively tracking it are the ones who deployed it (and those they ask for help) and if nobody deployed it -- it's a curiosity at best.

Now, if you're actually in a high speed chase, and the device is deployed and attached to your car, you won't have time to do anything with it.  Given time and the right skills, you could probably hack the device into a decoy or something, but the police are still following you.  Odds are, you won't even have time to find the device and look at it.

More practical would be to find the ""web portal"" the police use to access it and hack that somehow.  If you could get in and put in a backdoor, but leave it secret -- THAT would be useful.  Then you add the ability to disable tracking in a specific city and advertise your services to local criminals.  If they're in a high speed chase (or expect to be), they call you, offer lots of money and you disable the system for them for a while, or perhaps create a fake trail for the police to follow -- but not until the target car is out of their visual range.  None of that would be done while you're being tracked, however.

That said, such an enterprise would be very difficult to make work.  More likely is that somebody would hack their portal, figure out what it is (or maybe not), and put a PWNED YOU! message on it.  And then it gets fixed.

It could be jammed, however -- jam the GPS and/or cell phone frequencies, that would stop it from working.  Of course, that would require a lot of planning (and normally the primary plan is to not get chased by the police) and would increase the penalties if caught considerably.","1359677180"

Inland Australia could be the breadbasket of the world but for want of water.  If the Maya and Romans could manage to feed millions through their brilliant water management , why can’t modern day engineers do likewise?
Just think of the job creation such a project would generate, Australia did it before  in the Snowy Mountains in 1950s.

"amateur_boxing","t5_2ss7o","First off, great job! Clearly, you have a great grasp on the fundamentals and if you just keep on practicing and do what your coach tells you, you will keep improving rapidly. 

One thing I saw you could've done at round 2, 1:10 into video, was throw a BIG hook to the body after you slipped his punch. Also you should throw more hooks to the body given your come forward pressure style. 

Combinations I think you'd benefit from are 1-2, then feint a quick body slip to the right and come in HARD with another cross or overhand. Also you should throw more overhands, I could see you landing a lot of those in that fight. Also since you're on the shorter side, try throwing a 1-2 while moving forward, stepping in with your lead foot, and when you throw the cross bring your right foot forward so that you end up squared up. This will greatly close the distance and allow you to fight on the inside, where you excel. Great job and also keep improving your jump roping skills and footwork skills in the ring. ","1359677185"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; I'm not trying to confuse anything.

The speaker says ""demand"" and you say ""consumption"".  That's confusing.  

The speaker talks about jobs and hiring, and you obsess over production-based ""growth"".  That's confusing.


&gt; I'm saying that jobs don't produce jobs.

Whatever you say, dude.  I assume we're into full-blown troll territory at this point.

&gt; the speaker is obviously implying that jobs improve the economy.

No, he's not.  He's saying consumer demand is necessary for jobs and business.

&gt; His logic is flawed and ill conceived.

Your brain is flawed and ill conceived.

&gt; You can't earn money without a job, and the whole point of the talk is that consumers need to have money before businesses will hire you.

Which is why the government needs to intervene by bailing out consumers instead bailing out bankers and billionaires.

&gt; Well first, consumers always have resources in some supply.

They don't have enough.  The global economy is stagnating because working-class consumers can't afford to buy enough things to keep each other  employed.

&gt; Businesses first need investment in order to hire.

And they first need indications of consumer demand from their market-research departments before they'll invest.

&gt; That could come from other people or the owners savings. 

We don't need to worry about the fucking investment.  The world is drowning in investment money.

&gt; So widget maker Mr. Smith ...

And so you continue with your stupid parable, as though that somehow proves that you're smart and sophisticated, even though it has nothing to do with either the talk or the problems of today's economy.

&gt; Of course Mr. Smith expects consumers to eventually spend money on his products. 

No, he doesn't.  His market researchers have told him we're in an ""hourglass"" economy.  That means there's a trickle of demand for 99-cent goods from poor people and another trickle of demand for luxury goods from the rich, but the rest of the economy is dead or dying along with the middle class.

&gt; But now you contend ... ""consumers need money ~~from jobs~~

See?  That's more bullshit (a straw man).  Neither I nor the speaker said anything about the money coming exclusively from jobs.

&gt; they could have savings set aside

Really?  Then where would their employer's profits come from?

&gt; Say Mr. Wilson ...

Uh-oh, more parables!

&gt; So at some point the end consumer has something to give or trade.

But he doesn't.  His job has been technosourced (*BUZZWORD ALERT!* :), and now he's ""unemployable"".  

&gt; Rational? I present logical arguments and you present rhetoric and emotional diarrhea.

Sure, bud.  Whatever you say.

The downside is you do less dps than a dps spec (I never tried ret) so I had to use 'work arounds' for some bosses. For Festergut I had to bubble at 9 stacks and barely made it with around 5 secs to spare. For Blood Queen I had to bubble up to avoid the bite then save all defensive cooldowns to nuke her down during her enrage. She hits extremely hard during enrage, my vengeance was shooting past 100k.

Tips (for prot): 

- Keep sacred shield up, get an addon to track it if you can

- Use seal of insight, the dps seals aren't worth it for prot (about 5% dps increase)

- Check wowhead comments, you can find useful stuff there

- [This](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1167234-MoP-Protection-Paladin-Guide) is a good prot guide","1359677188"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; why are we not allowed to so much as suggest that she made some really poor choices?

The point is the social atmosphere created by it all. If all we do is focus on telling women not to get raped, are we really addressing the issue that men rape lots of women at a societal level? No, we're reinforcing their behavior by teaching women to make its effects less visible. People who want to rape will still exist, and they'll only find trickier ways of raping people.

&gt; Is the fact that the rapist had no right to do so some kind of comforting fact to the woman AFTER she's been raped?

The thought that ""it was my fault, I could have prevented it"" is incredibly damaging. It's not that the fact that the rapist didn't have the right to do it is comforting...it's that the opposite thought, the thought that it was your fault, is emotionally damaging and FALSE. And a lot of women do have this thought, and it's very sad. I have seen it many times in person and it is depressing that you have to reassure and convince women that it wasn't their fault that they got raped, and does indicate to me that society is sick.

This is like treating the symptoms, not the illness itself.","1359677190"

I am quite certain that it is about Isaac being abused by his mother, and he tries to justify her actions through his exposure to religion, which is that his mother is doing God's will, just as Abraham had done with his son. He becomes less human as he progresses and becomes a bit demonlike, so he might see himself as the reason for his treatment. During the scenes between levels, we see him dream of the abuses that he has gone through, which sometimes include him dying, which, accompanied by the horrible things he sees that are probably part of his imagination, suggest that he has mental disorders. This is all up to interpretation, but it is quite unlikely that the religious elements actually have much significance in the story past the names and references.","1359677192"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Battle-Girl, an obscure shareware Mac/PC game circa 1997, that was a top-down old-school vector graphics arcade game with a really fun techno soundtrack. The original developer was Ultra|United. 

http://i.imgur.com/SSxyM9w.jpg

In it you are a small ship that travels on levels and you shoot enemies, especially the computer viruses/bugs to stop them from taking over the program. You clear a level then move to the next. If you didn't save your program, you would lose and the boss Terminus would come out and charge at you and kill you. Simple gameplay, right? Well, after 50-60 levels, no, it was frantic arcade action at its best. Pure action, pure twitch.

The low levels of Battle-Girl are pretty boring. You had to start at the highest level like in the old arcade game Tempest, and go from there. Nonstop action. The hardest part was firing in different directions from where you were going, abruptly changing direction, etc.

Also add an inn- I don't see one. The rest has been more or less said before. Although I see you have a sewer system there- if so, the town would need to be a little richer and bigger, or have a summer residence somewhere.

And if I am in fact the only one, can someone help explain to me why I'm so confused?

As I read it, they were set up from the beginning as being basically a bunch of backwater fuckups, the weakest of the major players and never able to assert any kind of authority or dominance over anything they couldn't float a boat to in a few weeks. They have almost no resources they don't steal, and they haven't been doing much reaving during the time leading up to the events in AGOT, so I wouldn't think they'd be flush with anything - food, supplies, boats, etc.

And as the series progressed it seemed to continue in that vein. To the extent they were influencing anyone it was as a pawn for bigger players.

Then all of a sudden in AFFC and ADWD I feel like GRRM's just assuming I'm supposed to take these people seriously, especially Euron, without giving me much reason as to why. There've been no revelations (in fact, if anything, with Balon no longer in charge and the Kingsmoot and all I'd think them *weaker* now, just as a result of of strife and conflict), the other major players are every bit as major as ever, and while the war maybe presented some opportunity to expand their influence a little with everyone distracted - and they did take advantage of that, a little - it's clear there aren't much in the way of easy pickings for them.

But your post here asks questions that I think are totally reasonable so long as you just take as *fait accompli* that the Iron Islanders are able to muster any kind of a serious offensive against the other players - despite never having done so, and the only recent developments being overall negative for them. The whole idea of Euron helping himself to some hot hot dragon action makes even less sense than Quentyn, and he's extra crispy.

I feel like it's some bunch of nuts in a religious compound in rural Idaho making plans for the takeover of North America. Sure they exist, but nobody takes them seriously. I kind of thought that was the plan for Pike, but now I'm just confused.","1359677200"

In today's world? It's easier to be a man today than it was a few years ago. Maybe not by much, but it is. 

If I was ten years older I'd have either gone to work in a coal mine or in a wool mill when I left school. I'd have left school at 15 (which I did), and with no qualifications (which I did), and with nobody at any point suggesting that ""you're a bright lad, have you thought about going to college?"" (which nobody ever did). For the generation before me the mill or the pit was the default option, and they would have done it for the rest of their lives just like their fathers and their grandfathers did. Don't like it? Tough shit. You have a family of your own to feed now. 

School and family tradition and the limits of imagination was all still set up to turn me into a factory worker, but by the time I got there those jobs were long gone. What I ended up becoming, via a circuitous route, is one of the senior tech' guys in central IT at a university. 

There's much more satisfying work available to a broader range of people now in provincial Britain than there was for the generations that came before me. There's some soul crushing work too, but many more options exist in ways they didn't from the beginning of the industrial revolution up until thirty years ago.","1359677202"

Clothing generally I've thought of what I want to wear the night before so I just find all the bits and put them on. usually about 1-2 min. If I'm going out somewhere fun I might take 5 minutes to get dressed since I haven't usually mentally prepared an outfit I'd have to match things then.

Well, I just gave it a watch and here are my impressions.    
It's a *hugely overlong* video that offers very little insight. It's a stream-of-thought video featuring amateur offclass play on a pub server.  
The video is full of completely unnecessary footage. (A full minute of you taunting and high-fiving during setup? Begging for likes, Twitter follows, and joins for your Steam group? You talking about your Doritos and your strawberry milkshake? You *stopping playing to talk about putting the lid on your strawberry milkshake?!*)  
More unfortunately, it's full of completely unnecessary repetition. You'll say something, and then you'll reword it and repeat it a few times. (An example: From 3:07-3:40, you say that the flaregun requires you to lead your enemy. That's all you say during those agonizing 33 seconds, though then you repeat it in three or four different ways.)   
You often get flustered and have trouble speaking during firefights, which is a tremendous problem if you're making these kinds of videos.  
And your answer to the flaregun/shotgun debate? The nugget of wisdom it took you over 11 minutes to forge?  
&gt; ""Use what you want to use. You shouldn't use weapons because somebody says so.""   

What did you hope to teach people who took the time to watch your video? What did you hope to illustrate for them? Do you feel there is anything of value in it?

Absolutely not, it's bad marketing. When you advertise, you shouldn't reinforce your competitor's message.  That's what this does. Worse, it legitimizes a message that is more useful for atheists to use against the religious.

It is a play on an increasingly common Christian comment that Christianity is not a religion, but a personal relationship with Jesus. This is such an awful argument, so unconvincing to anyone but the already converted, that it should be allowed to proceed largely unmolested.

It's a clever retort, and may be funny to use in person, but it shouldn't be used as the basis of an ad campaign.","1359677211"

"Ingenu","t5_2w74y","Also ""per se"" ist auf jedenfall schonmal dein Lieblingswort :)

In dieser Debatte bewegen wir uns auf 2 verschiedenen Ebenen des Sexismus: einerseits haben wir den sexismus im Umgang mit den Frauen im einzelnen wie bei Herrn Brüderle und andereseits den allgemeinen Sexismus in der Gesellschaft mit Quote und co. Darauf weise ich hin, da ich verwundert bin, welche Ausmaße diese Äußerungen eines alkoholisierten, älteren Herrens annehmen.
Die Überschrift lautet inzwischen Sexismus, wo all das diskutierte selbstverständlich mit hinein zählt, doch am Anfang steht lediglich eine (leicht) sexistische, anstößige aber vermutlich nett gemeinte Äusserung eines Politikers. Was kommt als nächstes? Wenn Herr Brüderle die nächste Journalistin fragt ob sie lesbisch sei, gibt es dann einen Aufschrei zur noch zu wenig anerkannten Homosexualität? Es wäre nur gerecht. Aber ich gebe zu, dass das Beispiel nicht das Beste ist.
Ich denke wir sind uns einig, dass dieser Aufschrei übetrieben ist, doch irgendwie ist es ja Trend geworden, dass immer eine bestimmte Sache ganz groß diskutiert, nachgeahmt, verfolgt, praktiziert, ""gehatet"" oder sonst was wird. Ob es nun Banken, Atomkraftwerke, Stoffbeutel, falsche Doktoren oder der Gagnam Style sind.

Btw, ich bin dafür, dass der Ingénu die Sendung ""Roche und Böhmermann"" auf ZDF.Kultur weiterführt, die inzwischen leider abgesetzt wurde. Selbstverständlich mit etwas ernsteren Themen, welche dann auch zur Kulisse passen. Humor sollte dennoch mit dabei sein. Dafür würde ich mich bereiterklären mit lockeren Sprüchen dafür zu sorgen, dass das Niveau nicht zu hoch steigt. Es sollte eine Unterhaltungssendung bleiben. Und Roche ist bestimmt zu einer Sexismus Debatte bereit.","1359677211"

Do you always wear a shirt that says on it, ""I'm an ENTP and a Gemini?"" Reorganize your info.

You know what’s going to happen. There will be proper indoctrination into a certain kind of worldview, shall we say.

They're just way too unreliable and take way too long to fully cash in.

The *only* reason why I even have a chequebook is because my apartment complex asks we pay with them instead of cash. They now also accept pre-authorized payment, but I haven't bothered to sign up for it because I'm in the process of searching for a new home.

I'm also quick to gain weight and am scared of getting fat. I have just a few more questions since you piqued my curiosity:


- So you gained about 30 pounds back from contest weight? Do you think that weight is fat/water/etc? You still look lean. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just honestly surprised you look as good as you do. 


- You're 6 foot (if I remember correctly), how much above maintenance is that 2800 Cal's/day?


- I'm guessing you're eating close to a Paleo diet? I think you mentioned that you were while prepping for contest, just wondering if you're eating that way still.

Dedicated criminals likely would find things only slightly more difficult than they do now. Those who have connections to smuggling aren't going to have any problem at all.

Street level crime would eventually see a decline in firearms as the easy supply dwindled though it would take quite a while with how many guns are out there in the US. I doubt the crime rate would decrease much - it would just switch to knives, blunt objects, etc. which, I suppose, are at least safer for innocent bystanders.

Spur of the moment people who snap would have a much harder time than they do now which, I think, is the appeal such bans have to a lot of people.","1359677216"

"admincraft","t5_2tcp9","It really depends on what SSD and what standard drives you're using for RAID, as well as what controllers. A cheap SSD can be had these days for sub $100, but if you put in 4x SAS drives, you'll probably get very similar performance to the SSD, and have more space available for everything else. Also, while RAID is not an alternative to backup, it does give you an added piece of mind for data security.  This is because in 4 drive RAID 10 array, any 1 drive can go bad (or 2 drives if you're lucky) at any time, and you wouldn't suffer data loss; where as if you have one single SSD, if it goes bad, your data's gone.

Running server in ramdisk is cheap man's alternative to a SSD. It is a bit hacky, but it works, and gives similar performance at expense of RAM. If you don't have SSD, but have the extra RAM, and feel that it will help performance, then you can consider going for it. However, keep in mind that RAM is volatile memory, if you lose power, the content on there are gone forever. So you will want to make sure you have backup power supply on a different power grid for the server, and make sure you take regular ""backup"" from the ramdrive back to a physical drive.","1359677217"

Just remind yourself that the reason people are doing so, is because it's too uncomfortable for them to deal with the idea that someone could be creating an unsafe environment for you. And make no mistake, that's exactly what the guy did by telling the rape joke in your presence. You have every right to be upset and you have every right to make the choice of who you want to interact with and not. Don't be peer pressured into silence. I've heard stories of ""friends"" doing the same thing when a girl was ACTUALLY raped, so it's definitely not a positive path to go down.","1359677224"

One book that I highly recommend is *NOT ""Just Friends"":
Rebuilding Trust and Recovering Your Sanity After Infidelity* by Shirley Glass.  

You can hit Google and search for ""emotional affair"", check for affair recovery books at your library, talk to friends of your marriage about it, or talk to a therapist about it.  Do it ASAP before things get much worse.","1359677225"

I know that astral projection experiences are a lot easier to remember and interface with than lucid dreaming experiences. But I suspect that both are taking place within the landscape of the mind and not on some other plan of existence.

However, I did have an experience once that casts some doubt on that belief. I dont want to get into it but I ended up in a physical place with smells and sounds etc and I met a being there who I suspect was another human traveller. Just a much more experienced one than I was.

The ""outsider"" beings that you run into in dreams and voyaging experiences or whatever may be real or may be figments of the imaginations. It is said that spirits, demons or angels or whatever can manifest in that place even though it is only inside our minds.

But as I alluded too, I did once meet a being that was as solid as I was. As real as I was in that place. It still haunts me to this day because I can't shake the belief that somewhere out there is that person. I even feel sort of pulled towards what I believe to be their physical location. Anyway if this is a real experience and not some figment of my degrading sanity then that would suggest that an ""astral plane"" is a real place outside of the mind.","1359677227"

It won't be any problem.  My iphone/ipad wireless data speeds are about 12x faster than my parents DSL at their house.  I also tether my laptop to my devices when I'm on the train.  It works perfectly well.  It will be a missing feature on the surface, but MS must have had a reason.","1359677233"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; Yeah, for real. I don't know what kind of argument this one person's anecdotal experience was supposed to contribute to the gun banning debate other than to paint him as a complete idiot.

The purpose is quite obvious, to discourage those who would own firearms. If they nail it, if they get just the right tone, it resonates with some of the other inconveniences that firearms owners experience themselves, and maybe it turns a few off. Even if that's only a dozen, those people will be just a little less likely to vote against gun control.

Now, 12 people won't make or break anything. But the next article will do another half dozen (or maybe 50 if it's inspired). And they all add up. Remember this isn't about changing the outcome of a presidential election, but congressional elections... and sometimes those hinge on 10,000 or 5000 votes. Or even fewer. A dozen minds changed at a time can add up. And that's just short term, those few people will raise children that feel the same way, go on to put pressure on friends and family...

"beer","t5_2qhg1","Several things in this article aren't entirely true. For example, lots of people keep their kegs at room temperature and serve from a jockey box which rapidly cools the beer in the line before it flows out of the faucet. You need to let the beer warm a bit since it will come out ice-cold, but it certainly doesn't ruin the beer to have it sitting at room temp.

The beer won't just suddenly foam inside the keg unless you agitate it. Even then, kegs draw beer off the bottom of the keg (where there's no foam). Most foaming issues are caused by having the dispensing pressure set too high, not knowing how to properly use a faucet, or not knowing how to properly pour into a glass.","1359677241"

So we get rid of the line and we notice hes not at the phones anymore (located right next to the front counter on the wall) so me, nit being limited to vehind the counter, volunteer to check if hes still in the store. So I make my way around the store and spot him in the back hunched in an isle up to something. So I swing around the next isle and approach him from behind to get a sneak peak at what he was up to. To my surprise he had the phone ( which was locked onto the peg thing) and as I saw, he noticed me. We looked each other in the eyes like this 0.0 Then I notice hes got a large knife in his hand that he used to cut the phone off the hook.

That guitar played well out of the box (to the best of my memory), and still plays better than comparable entry-level guitars I've played (looking at you Squire). The guitar I replaced it with, after about two years, was an 8 year old MiM Stratocaster HSS which is still my main guitar, of course with different pickups. Were I to suggest a starter guitar, I'd go right for a used MiM Fender. Used for two reasons: firstly, their value is already diminished from new, and they tend to hold a static used value for much longer; secondly, the shitty used MiM Fenders usually don't make it back to stores (IN MY EXPERIENCE), so the guitars you'll see will have been the real players of the lot.","1359677243"

I actually just made that mistake last night on a set of fresh batteries. I noticed it this morning when I left the house. The battery monitor has four bars. When I stopped it it still had three. So my guess is it would probably go for about 3.5-4 days nonstop if it didn't fill up the memory card first. And I've got an 8 gig card in it so I don't see that happening.

But yeah, because I keep making that mistake I'm thinking about buying some NiCD rechargeables for it. It'd probably be a bigger PITA because most rechargeables don't hold a charge for more than a week or so, but it'd be a lot cheaper in the long run if I can't get into the habit of turning it off when I get home.

Something else about the modern age is that we have the resources to not have to let human beings die from originally minor things, we're actually capable to help our fellow human beings thanks to progress. We've surpassed this kind of ""natural selection"" as a species.

With this system, of course there are freeloading scumbags, but they're such a small part of society it's worth a few rotten apples, even out of my already humble paycheck.

I speak a diction and grammar-corrected (to utter the words ""ain't"" or ""ya'll"" was verboten in my family) SAE. Many Oklahomans and Texans do speak this older accent. It has a drawl decay but clipped attacks to compensate for the speed loss imposed by the drawl. I was told by my great-grandmother that her accent, which simply demanded deference, was that of landed or educated Oklahomans/Texans... reflective of status and authority but without implied condescension. It's kind of a faster, more poised Matthew McConaughey pattern.

I will say that the appeal of the SAE really isn't the pleasantness of the sound, it's the anecdotal way in which people from that region speak. SAE is a just a delivery mechanism for storytelling and self-deprecating jokes.","1359677250"

"swordartonline","t5_2uikt","Finally was able to get in. Here's some more infos/opinions.

* You have to get a soulname, it'll will be your character's last name and your account name.

* Then it is the character creation. You're given a random ammount of bonus stats to put in from 3 to 10.

* Graphically, it' looks old, almost WoW old. This ain't the strenght of the game so far. Also floating shields and swords. ( nitpickingin' )

* Also, not being able to change setting before getting past the cinematics and other is pretty annoying.
* It was all on low so far and you can't change AA and resolution unless you reboot the game.

* There's a logout button. 10 seconds before leaving, so you can't run by D/Cing.

* 2nd boot : 13 minutes to log in. hurray for overcharged servers.

* Alright, Graphics aren't that bad anymore with decent resolution and AA. Still an old feel to the game though.

* Combat: 3 main stats : HP, MP and OD ( aka stamina ). There's also GP for Guard Points, it is used when blocking. 0 GP = no blocking

* Leftclick attack, shift to block, Middle mouse Draw/holster. Skills are hotkeys.

* Tab and rightclick can be used to lock on enemies.

* Chest can be trapped, you can use some skills that will use OD to check what is the trap and to augment your chances to disarm it.

* Cutscene text is slow and cannot be sped up unless you skip the whole cutscene.

* Crimes work kind of like in SAO. Attacking others gets you yellow status. More or harder crimes will give you red status. NPC guards in town will attack Reds and throw them in prison if they are defeated.

So far, game looks alright. Lag issues are understandable therefore fighting right now is dangerous. But If I can make some kind of Spear/TowerShield Defensive Knight, I'll surely play some more.

If you had enough insulation, or you and the box were only in the lava for a short period of time (depending on the wall thickness), then you could survive, but the walls of the box are going to heat up until they get very close to the lava temperature.  The box could stay intact while it's contents caught fire from the extreme heat.

Little information about North Korea escapes their borders, but everyone should read a fantastic book, *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* by Martin. (Disclaimer: I am not an expert on the DPRK, but I found that book incredibly informative).

Anyway, little information filters *into* North Korea, either. The North Korean people are supposed to believe that their ruling family has divine origins, that their juche ideology represents the pinnacle of philosophy and political science, and that, despite their ongoing misery, they're much better off than the rest of the world. They are educated by the state, pictures of Kim Il Sung overlook every dining table, there is no knowing which of your neighbors are eavesdropping at the windowsill. Dissent is not tolerated and efforts to mold the populace are ceaseless. Two generations have grown up in a society that treats the state as a religion. South Koreans long, according to North Korean propaganda, to be freed of their capitalist masters and reunited with their comrades to the North. In short, different types of government and opinion are corrupt because no threat to the almighty state, be it physical or ideological, is tolerable. If people are allowed to hold their own opinions about their system of government, things are likely to get ugly for the Kims et al. As it stands, their entire society is based on the rickety premise that people are stupid.

Of course, South Koreans long for reunification under different conditions. That's an extraordinarily complex issue in and of itself.","1359677253"

They could be in prepared slit-trenches or hasty fighting positions, and you lose momentum trying to root them out or make it to face to face without getting your dick shot off.  A sudden flurry of grenades into a trench means whoever was in it is now diving his ass out again, or else risk meeting his dear and fluffy lord sooner rather than later.  Evens the odds.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;No, Linking articles about scientists who hold these beliefs does not make it ""not a matter of mere rationality"".

I'll make it very simple for you. You say: ""TIS EXTREORDINARYUH MAGICC!!!!11""

I say: ""Scientists don't see it that way, and here's the data that demonstrates that. And since I've already explained this to you before and you refused to acknowledge it and go on about it anyway, can't you see that you have your materialistic goggles on that make you unable to think neutrally on the subject?""

You say: ""Saying what you just did does not prove that biases play a role here.""

But how not? You've *clearly* ignored the data that I've provided before that refuted something you've said, *and yet you happily go on about it again!* That's the very definition of being blind to the objective data and the dispassionate arguments concerning the matter.

I'm sorry.

&gt;I'm in a scientific field at uni and I have never run into anyone who holds these beliefs.

And why do you think people hold those beliefs to themselves and aren't telling you about it, seeing as how curious, open-minded and non-judgmental you are? ;)

&gt;This point seems like it should be moot for you anyway, as looking through your comment history, I see several people arguing with you on this thread, as well as several other threads, as well as a post you made in r/atheism where a great number of mostly eloquent people got to tell you why you're wrong and you got a net total of 0 upvotes.

Yes, atheists down-voting me is a real brainer I can't quite wrap my head around. Why would they do that!??

&gt;I even texted the smartest person i know - Aerospace engineer student, 36 on his ACT, mensa, etc. etc. etc. I asked him, ""What would you say to someone trying to prove psychic powers and the afterlife?"" he just said ""don't bother"". 

Nawwh :)

&gt;wat. You are obligated. Unless you don't want to convince me, in which case...what the fuck are you doing?

Are you trolling me? I'm really getting tired of you not following our discussion. You made a request - ""prove all your shit with one accessible study/article."" I responded by saying that that is impossible *for the very same reason that it's impossible to do with evolution!*

It's a matter of principle. A single article can't prove something like that. It takes a lot of pages to summarize the entire argument if you want to cover everything.

So you see friend, I asked of you to do it for evolution to *highlight* how impossible such a task is *in principle*, even in a field where we both agree that there's an abundance of evidence.

&gt;No no, I mean anecdote, as in ""a short narrative"". As in, a story. Comparing NDEs to medical science is silly, as they are entirely different situations.

And how? Claiming something isn't an argument, you have to argue your case. *How* are they different situations? Medical science relies on surveys *all the time.* Those surveys are individuals responding to questions. Just like NDE reports. There's literally no difference.

&gt;Wha...wah...wat? I said there's no evidence for the afterlife that goes beyond anecdotes and you linked me a study where 18% of people resuscitated from cardiac arrest experienced NDE. That was literally a study ABOUT anecdotes.

:D

Do you have any evidence to back that up? For example, the front page at the moment has no facebook-god posts, and there are maybe 5 out of 25 that depict a theist losing an argument (the word ""pwned"" doesn't appear in any titles). Most are either about cases where religion was a force for bad in the world (e.g. the pastor justifying not leaving a tip with comparison to tithes), or general, non-personal criticisms of religious logic (""religion is like meatloaf, everyone things theirs is the best"").

Unless you have thought up the next Portal you have no reason to be paranoid. No one on this forum cares. They probably won't even download your game were it to be finished and published for iOS for free. The effort to *click* would be too high for something they haven't heard anything good about. It will fail to make itself heard amongst all the other fart APPs.

Second paragraph. What you fail to realise is that the idea is of very little importance compared to its execution. So what if Portal had been ripped-off by someone? Would they have done as good a job of it as Valve? Why is that the case? Coming up with the equivalent of 'the portal gun' may seem to you to be the hard part, but that game would be nothing without the puzzles it was put to, the gradual ramping up of difficulty, the humour making light of your frustrating terminal failures, the personification of its ludic sadism in the character of GLaDOS, towards the final confrontation. Yet, a bad idea which has no thought given to the execution of gameplay mechanics, but waffles on at length about Heroes and Heroines and some stupid backstory the player is supposed to care about would have proven that you didn't have anything worth making, even if you had the money. I' guess we will never know, because you missed the opportunity to take advantage of my freely offered expertise.","1359677264"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Before I tell my story, there are two important facts to consider.

1: Alaska has small insects and spiders. There are no creepy crawlies here larger than a spruce bark beetle other than a dragonfly or butterfly.

2: I am not afraid of typical crawlies. What happens in this story was extremely unexpected and out of the ordinary which is why I was so scared. (Or maybe I am afraid of... special crawlies...)

So I'm about 16 at the time and my Mom is outside painting the side of the house. We live on a lake in Alaska and it is pretty sunny outside. She's doing fine for the most part but then she comes in all irritated after a few hours. She begins telling me all about how there is a small piece of siding missing and its full of bees that stung her.

So I head outside and plug in my Dad's powered pressure washer. I spray a powerful stream of water straight in to the hole where a swarm of bees can be seen crawling over each other. As the water blasts into the hole, bees are flying all over the place trying to escape and being blasted around by the high pressure water.

I continue this for maybe 30 seconds to a minute, stopping only once I was satisfied that the bees were gone. Then, something terrifying happened. As I watched in horror, a large brown critter crab-walked out of the hole in my house. It must have been 3 or four inches wide. I was probably 40 yards away so I couldn't quite make out the details, but it was clearly a massive spider or tarantula. It continued to skitter sideways for only a second and then it paused on the siding of the house. I was just starting to calm down as about two seconds went by. Then, this massive spider... this giant tarantula... this fat creepy crawlie... JUMPED OFF OF THE HOUSE AND FLEW STRAIGHT AT ME before turning and flying out into the woods.

Tl;dr: I got rid of some bees that were attacking my mom from long range with a pressure house. This woke up a bat in the middle of the day which I mistook for a tarantula or something similar. It then dive-bombed me, scaring me nearly half to death.","1359677268"

The starting point skill level gap is so broad that you never know what type of players you will get.

My niece Mary was just talking about it the other day, you know Mary, my brother Joe's daughter? Anyway, she was telling me all about her new friend that she met at her school, St. Rose's, the same school her mother went to. I'm not sure if you've met Lynn, but she is a peach of a woman. Her and Joe met right after he got back from the war, and got married pretty soon after that. A real whirlwind romance, but that seems to be all the rage these days, doesn't it?

But regardless, I feel as if people should avoid that game, so what do I do? I bash on. Hopefully Nintendo will learn from their mistakes through this, wether it's through Reddit comments or private mails. (*That are probably never read, but you gotta have hope, you know.*)

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Still, the idea that we're voting for the person they want to be PM undermines politics. People aren't voting for issues or ideology. Politics in this country, in the last few years, has boiled down to 'I don't like him, so I'm going to vote for someone else'.

The difference between a PM and a President is that the President  can effectively have a lot more control over legislation. A PM must not only fight the opposition but also his own party and thus when he presents a policy it is more than likely to be extremely compromised. If people feel that the PM is the be all and end all of government than they are undoubtedly going to be disappointed. Every news story is filled with how *the PM* has failed.

If you elect a man because of his policies then there is no way he can succeed. If you elect a party then politics gets a lot more interesting.

When I upgraded to a better laptop (my new company bought me a great one) I transferred that to a thumbdrive (also Truecrypted) and put it somewhere very safe.

I looked at it before I stored it away and was amazed at how twisted I sounded. Lots of venom about my ex-gf. LOTS of detail about planning the ""vacation"" and about my feelings afterward. Very little after I got the new job and nothing since the move here.

You're right, though--the guy I was back then sounded A LOT like a sociopath or even a psychopath. I guess the experience put me on a more even keel somehow. Maybe it was just something I needed to get out of my system.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Im sure its the same thing I read about in discover magazine some time ago.  Its for real.  No one i tell believes me either. It came about from someone replacing a missing tendon or some other sort of normally irreplaceable part  in a dogs leg with a part from a pig. When they noticed the dogs limp unexpectedly disappeared entirely they opened the leg back up and found no trace of pig part and new dog parts. They eventually found the exact method of how the extra cellular matrix, if thats what it is, works. They have used it on war vets to help regrow muscle past what they were able to do with extreme physical therapy. I wouldnt be surprised if were able to regrow limbs soon, probably just in time to all die from drug resistant diseases and bacteria.

"news","t5_2qh3l","On behalf of people employed by the service industry I say thank you, and I mean that. I'm glad that you adhere to the New Testament's ideas on generosity. I'm even more glad that the pastors and your Christian friends tip more than 10%. I would definitely recommend you recommending to your minister or pastor to bring up the notion of tipping in his sermons from time to time. 

Sadly Christians are not held in high esteem in the service industry from hotel workers to servers in restaurants. To be fair it really has nothing to do with their religion per se. Only that they have garnered the reputation of tipping 10% through the notion of tithing, and use this as their basis for not tipping well. I'm sure you and those Christians you know tip well, but the fact of the matter is I've served in the North East, the South, and the Midwest--and while things may be more enlightened on the West Coast--in all the places the religious have a reputation for their poor tipping. It just comes with the territory. To rectify this the only thing I can think of is Christians telling other Christians that Jesus's message of generosity doesn't stop once you pass through the church doors.


I'm not trying to bemoan my station in life. I like the service industry and have garnered many accolades and 5 Star reviews for the restaurant where I work. I'm a good server, but when I see a table bow their heads to pray in a restaurant... I cannot help but be disappointed. For a long time I still gave such tables my all and the best service possible, but after being stiffed time and time again I just don't try anymore. Now when I see a bowed head... Let's just say I offer the bare minimum and focus on the tables that are actually going to tip fair. 

**On a Side Note:**
20% is the industry standard for gratuity and is what I and my friends and family tip. It is the baseline. Great service garners a 25% or higher tip from me. Also the service has to be very, very bad before I will go down to 15%. 

Spread the word! Maybe together we can help bring this terrible--but very very true--generalization to an end!

"funny","t5_2qh33","Are you suggesting that it's in Fahrenheit? Because that's an interesting stove that heats to 1, 3, 5, 11 degress Fahrenheit.

EDIT: So I tried to figure the actual temperature of a stove that went up to 2,000. The average stove, according to [this shitty source](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Temperature_of_hot_stove_top), sets level 10 to 500 degrees. Level 2000 would be 200 times that, or 100,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That's about 55,810 degrees Kelvin. The surface of the sun is 5,800 K.

The sun's temperature rises very very quickly as you move towards the center. The next layer after the photosphere (the ""surface"", 5,800 K) is the radiative zone, which is 2,100,000 K. So, the stove heats up to a temperature equivalent to somewhere within the first few miles into the sun's surface.

It might be worth noting that a stove that got this hot would destroy everything nearby, and then some.","1359677289"

Maybe it's just me, but they seem a bit more greasy than regular burgers and more flavorful.  Perfect for keto (I sometime struggle to get fat calories).

"sfwtrees","t5_2tbsv","you have a very good point about the not so reputable companies and improper cabling techniques. It is VERY EASY to screw up a cabling system. and a cabling system SHOULD ALWAYS go hand in hand with some sort of pruning. that is a best management practice. the pruning will usually involve lightening or thinning the limb and then adding to the risk reduction by installing the cables (if done properly). 

So where i completely agree with you about other companies screwing it up and being safe.. I personally will climb a cabled tree..even if I dont know who cabled it. I will definetley choose a tie-in point that is not directly affected by the cabling system. 


In regards to ""A"" the amount of damage done to the limb is quite negligible. and ""B""..When I cable a limb it really is only as an added or additional level of security. Never because it is the only thing keeping it stable. here I COMPLETELY AGREE with what you said.

Also, talking about worth. What is it worth, then? As of right now, it is worth the 3900RP as that is the only way to get it. If Riot wants to lower the value of it while increasing the quality they would have to actively refund everyone who bought the bundle.","1359677290"

But it would be stupid for every studio to wait and release in fall.  You'd have 30 video games competing for the top spot.  So they naturally choose another time...well spring is the next logical bet: it's winter in most places, and the people have gotten sick of/beaten the fall games.

So more companies are releasing in spring to find their niche.  Example: Crysis 3, dead space 3, and most importantly **bioshock: infinite**.  It would be retarded for TTWO to release two of their bestsellers at the exact same time!  They would cannibalize each other.","1359677290"

Some of these cards are supporting existing themes (tokens in bant, flickering, lifegain in B&amp;W), and some are just filling roles to balance out the colors and the curve of each color, so I've **bolded the one's I'd recommend for every cube**. It's worth noting that I'm playing all the guildgates, but no keyrunes or signets (I have very little colorless ramp that fixes your colors).

**all the guildmages except Duskmantle** (I have a policy of no milling the opponent)

**all five charms**

Orzhov: Kingpin's Pet, **One Thousand Lashes**, Vitzkopa Confessor, **Gift of Orzhova**, Thrull Parasite, Syndicate Enforcer, Basilica Screecher, **Syndic of Tithes**, Knight of Obligation and Basilica Guards (I'm putting in every Extort card I can becuase I love the mechanic, and I already have Beckon Apparition)

Dimir: Bane Alley Broker, **Dinrova Horror**, Midnight Recovery, Voidwalk, Last Thoughts and **Hands of Binding**

Gruul: Ghor Clan Rampager, Zhur-Taa Swine, Slaughterhorn, Viashino Shanktail and **Scorchwalker**

Boros: Truefire Paladin, **Wojek Halberdiers**, Firefist Striker and Daring Dkyjek (I already have Skyknight Legionnaire)

Simic: **Shambleshark**, **Urban Evolution**, Drakewing Krasis, **Adaptive Snapjaw**, Simic Fluxmage

Others: Court Street Denezins, **Guardian of the Gateless**, Knight Watch, Urbis Protector, **Aetherize**, Smog Elemental, Hellraiser Goblin, Homing Lightning, Skullcrack, Verdant Haven

I also already have Prophetic Prism.

Edit: It might also be worth mentioning that my cube is all modern bordered, though not nessecarily modern legal, so I have mostly modern cards, but a few old things like FoF, Psychatog and Deep Analysis that have promo versions with modern borders.","1359677293"

(Less than once a year.) And the occasions that I have are viewed with disdain. About half of one group has had sex, and are single. They are viewed as loose and it's talked about behind their back. I've had one friend get ""engaged"" (openly planning wedding and such.) Minus the ring and when they broke up claim that they were never engaged. (Not blaming them, they were wise to avoid extra stigma. And they only knew three weeks before becoming engaged.) The marry and have kids no sex till then cultural stance has caused a lot of strife among a lot of them. Some of them are in terrible relationships because of it. (Argue all the time and are noticeably less happy.)

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I understand your point...  mods help a lot.  I don't have as much time for video games as I used to, so I avoid repetition by only dungeon diving for quests, etc.  Then I play maybe an hour, turn it off for a few days.  There does come a point when you get around fifty hours in most Bethesda games that you feel like you've seen everything over and over again.

But then the game draws you back, you avoid quests you've done already, and the game experience is completely different.  Seriously last time I played Skyrim I managed to get to every single Draugr cave in existence.  Draugr, draugr, draugr, occasional spider.  So boring.  Now despite my best intentions I keep bumping into Falmer and Dwemer bots and also a strangely large amount of vampires.

Bethesda games aren't for perfectionists who want to conquer every dungeon, they're for people who want a different gameplay experience every time.  The story does suck in most cases (FO3- hurr durr, making clean water; Oblivion- here random prisoner, take my most valuable possession and take it to the son I never acknowledged; Skyrim- kill dragons and eat their souls.)  They can't do a third-person view of the character without looking like trash.  But they're fun to just relax and get lost in, and the stories are interesting.  Pls, dopamine hit for random loot.  There's nothing quite like roaming the Wastelands or the arctic tundra and just looking in the distance at everything that's there.  Not to mention the background lore.

The true essence of what TES is:  a vast fantasy world based on D&amp;D from way back.  Each new generation adds a bit of a twist and lets you explore the other realms of the land.  You can make a character and give him an entirely different play style and then explore what it takes to be on the good or the bad side of a conflict.  You get branching paths on either side of a situation.  No two game sequences should be the same, or else it will get repetitive.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Riot should please both sides by:
Keeping the Goth Annie for people who bought the bundle (old model) and name it Goth Annie v1
and release the new one for 975RP calling it Goth Annie v2.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Hippalus, normally I would tell you to ""keep up the awesome!"" but in this case I feel you have caved to pressure too soon.

I believe that you can come out of this ahead, though. There appears to be a legitimate source stating that the skin is exclusive to the bundle, but there are also a lot of players who own the rest of the content in the bundle who are unwilling to pay the full bundle price for a single (now massively improved) skin.

*SOLUTION: SCALE THE PRICE OF THE BUNDLE BASED ON THE OWNED CONTENT WITHIN*

I was always confused by the bundle packs remaining the same price if you owned parts of them. I wouldn't suggest scaling it down one-to-one or anything, but just maintaining some sort of average sale ratio would go a long way at improving not just this bundle, but _ALL_ of them.

I believe this would allow you to achieve your original goal of helping players obtain the skin without a massively inflated pricetag, as well as maintaining its exclusivity to the bundle. Additionally, it could allow you to make MORE bundles without them having the intrinsic negative value obtained by paying full price for the contents elsewhere.

Blacks (and Whites) without education are already displaced in construction, plumbing, electrical, and especially handyman honest jobs.

There is nothing wrong with an honest, decently paid job such as a plumber, car mechanic, handyman, painter, etc.

There IS something wrong with our elite still talking about ""jobs Americans won't do"" and pushing legalization of tens of millions while we have record (much bigger than official figures) unemployment.

Black leaders of today are just race hustlers, trying to get paid personally (rainbow push, etc) by playing the race card, that is all - and they dance the tunes on immigration and gun control the way they are told to.

Zionism (Hebrew: ציונות, Tsiyonut) is a form of nationalism of Jews and Jewish culture that supports a Jewish nation state in the territory defined as the Land of Israel.[1]


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel

The definition of the limits of this territory varies between biblical passages, specifically Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Elsewhere in the Bible, this land is often referred as ""from Dan to Beersheba"". The Land of Canaan is another biblical name for this region. A reference to the land of Israel is also made in the New Testament at Matthew 2:19–21.","1359677300"

It's OK, it just means they haven't played nearly as much as I have. It doesn't make any sense to harass a level 10 player because he doesn't know the meta. Of course he doesn't know the meta, he's level 10. I don't smurf to get good competitive games, I smurf to play with other low level or low Elo friends. Playing with some people who are not as good at the game as I am is part of the experience.

I try to never be a jerk when I smurf, although sometimes people interpret me as being a harasser because I say things like ""LeBlanc, try out ignite instead of clarity in your next game. The extra burst damage will really help you out."" There's this weird perception in the community that if you offer any kind of advice, then you are harassing; to some people, constructive criticism doesn't exist, only malicious criticism.

The best part of smurfing, though, is when I encounter another smurf who acts as OP describes. I once had another smurf try to explain to me that I sucked and was a noob (even though I was performing better than he was). His evidence against me was that he had a level 30 account, so I should listen to him. He linked me his main account on LoLking. Normally, I don't throw around my Elo weight when I smurf because I think it's ultimately a pissing contest (and I'm only a gold player), but when I saw that his Elo was about 1300 in solo queue, I couldn't help linking him to my own LoLking profile which was around 1700 in solo queue at the time.

There are some huge differences, but thematically its completely spot on and by far the best TV/movie version of The Count of Monte Cristo. But there are some notable things I should disclose:

- The series takes place in the future rather than 19th Century France.
- Albert is the main character rather than the Count himself. It sounds crazy, but it works very well and gives the Count an aura of mystery.
- The show starts off with Albert and Franz on the moon (Rome in the book), which IIRC is well over 100 pages into the book.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The issue with the really big, scary guns is power, capacity, rate of fire, ease of use and accuracy

The only thing an 'assault weapon' has over a semi-auto, magazine fed hunting rifle is the magazine capacity. In fact, the 'assault weapon' uses a less powerful cartridge than what is considered humane to use in a hunting rifle.

It's best to think of these weapons as a mix between semi-automatic handguns and hunting rifles. They are designed to be effective at medium range and so they make some sacrifices to accuracy and stopping power for portability and control. Along the way they pick up the ergonomics (pistol grip, magazine fed) of a hand gun.

The banning of 'assault weapons' is ridiculous for more reasons than nobody knows what it means. It's ridiculous because an 'assault weapon' is used in less that 3% of gun related homicides. Hand guns are responsible for the large majority of gun related homicides.

I'm not anti-gun control but when the conversation starts on something that is so obviously going to be ineffective, it makes the proponents look like they are just using a tragedy to ban the guns they've wanted to ban all along.

Rokitzan, den 14. 8. 44.

Meine allerliebste kleine Babett!
Will Dir auch heute wieder ein Brieflein schreiben, und Dir mitteilen, daß ich Deinen lieben Brief vom 9. 8. gestern mit großer Freude erhalten habe, recht herzlichen Dank dafür. Liebe Babett wie Du schreibst, hast Du schon [unleserlich] Tage keine Post mehr erhalten, da sind sicher wieder Briefe liegen geblieben, ich schreibe Dir doch so oft es mir die Zeit erlaubt und wenn es manchmal einige Tage länger dauert, so darfst Du meine Liebste keineswegs denken, ich hab Dich vergessen. Meine Gedanken sind sehr viel bei Dir und noch nie im Leben hab ich einen Menschen mehr geliebt als Dich, ich weiß ja, daß Du jetzt sehr viel Arbeit hast und ich mache dir da [?] auch keine Vorwürfe, wenn Du mir jetzt nicht so oft schreiben kannst. Mir wäre es ja am liebsten wenn

--- Seite 2 ---
ich bei dir sein könnte und die [unleserlich] Arbeit übernehmen könnte. Liebe Babett heute hab ich mit der Schreibstube wegen dem Gesuch nachgefragt und habe erfahren, daß es aus dienstlichen Gründen nicht genehmigt werden kann, es sind ja auch mehrere Gesuche hier, sind alle gestrichen worden; es ist ja auch zu verstehen, so viele Rekruten und die wenigen Ausbilder; in zwölf Wochen sollen die Rekruten ausgebildet sein und sollen an die Front kommen. Ich werde ja nochmal mit dem Chef reden, vielleicht bringe ich da [?] noch einige Tage zur [unleserlich]ernte heraus. Liebste Babett ich sollte dieses Monat auf nach Lemberg zu einem Reit und Fahr Lehrgang [unleserlich], auch das hat der Chef bei der Abteilung abgelehnt, weil die Ausbilder fehlen, es besteht vorerst [unleserlich] gar keine Aussicht, daß Ausbilder von hier an die Front kommen und so lange es geht werde ich auch hier bleiben, denn ich weiß, daß Du dann eine Sorge weniger hast, ich wäre ja am liebsten wieder draußen bei meinen Kameraden, aber man muß
--- Seite 3 ---
seine Pflicht tun wo man hingestellt wird; und es wird nicht danach gefragt ob einem gefällt oder nicht. Ich wäre ja sehr gerne auf Lemberg, da wäre ich wenigstens in einer deutschen Stadt und es wäre da die Möglichkeit eher gewesen, mal nach Hause zu kommen. Nun meine Liebste wie weit bist Du mit der Ernte? Hoffentlich ist das Wetter jetzt etwas besser, wir haben hier schon 14 Tage das schönste Erntewetter und die Leute hier sind meistens schon fertig. Wie geht es denn mit der Mutter Ihrer Hand, hoffentlich ist sie wieder gut geworden. Also meine gute Babett mach Dir keine unmäßigen Sorgen, einmal wird auch [unleserlich] für uns beiden die Zeit kommen, da wir immer beisammen sein können und dann wollen wir recht glücklich sein und alles schwere bald vergessen haben. Liebe Babett ich hätte nur eine kleine Bitte und zwar wenn es dir möglich ist so kannst mir ein paar Filzpantoffel schicken, ich hätte ja

--- Seite 4 ---

[unleserlich] geschrieben, aber dann ärgert es dich bestimmt wieder, kannst mir auch ein Stückchen Seife und eine kleine Schachtel Schuhkrem beilegen. Sonst hätte ich für heute nichts weiter und ich schließe und verbleibe mit tausend Grüßen und Küssen Dein Dich nie vergessender treuer Sig. [?]
Viele Grüße an Vater u. Mutter Fam. Lebringer - Heiner u. Hans und an Fam. Kalber.
Auf Wiedersehen mein kleiner Liebling schlaf wohl und denk im Traum an mich

My dearest little Babett!
Today, too, I would like to write a short letter to you and I want to tell you that I received your letter from August 9, thank you for that. Dear Babett, you wrote that you haven't received any mail in [illegible] days, some of the letters must have been delayed, I'm writing to you as often as my spare time permits me to, and if it should sometimes take some additional days, you my Dear should not think that I had forgotten you. My thoughts are with you very much und never in my life have I loved a person more that I love you, I know that you are quite busy right now and I won't hold it against you if you can't manage to write to me frequently. I would prefer if

--- page 2 ---

I could be with you and do this [illegible] work for you. Dear Babett today I went to the office to inquire about my request and I learned that it cannot be approved for official reasons, and there are indeed a lot of requests here, all of which have been rejected; it is quite understandable, so many recruits and so few instructors; within twelve weeks time, the recruits should be trained and sent to the front. I will talk to the boss again, perhaps I can manage to get some days for the harvest of the [illegible]. My dearest Babett ich was supposed to go to Lemberg this month for a riding and driving training, and this was also rejected by the boss because there's a shortage of instructors, so for the near future there's no chance that instructors will be sent to the front and as long as possible I will stay here as I know you then will have one less thing to worry about, I would prefer to be out with my comrades but you have to

--- page 3 ---

fulfil your duties wherever they put you; and nobody asks whether you like it or not. I would have liked to go to Lemberg, at least I would be in a German city there and it would have been easier to get a furlough. Now my love, how about the harvest? Hopefully, the weather is better now, here we have had the most beautiful weather for harvesting and most folks around are already done with the harvest. What about Mother's hand, hopefully she has gotten well by now. So, my dear Babett, don't worry too much, once the time will come for us where we can be together and then we will happy and forget the bad times. Dear Babett I would like to ask you for a small favour, so if possible, please send me a pair of felt slippers, I would have written

--- page 4 ---

about [illegible], but this would only make you upset, you may send a small bar of soap and a box of shoepolish as well. Apart from that, there's nothing more to write about, so I send you a thousand greetings and kisses, your faithful Sig.

"4chan","t5_2qh4w","Correct.  You pass out and never wake up.  There's no sense of suffocation or struggling or panic in your brain, as helium is an inert gas (along with nitrogen, often used for suicide).  Carbon monoxide works the same way, but is deadly to first responders, where helium and nitrogen are generally not (unless in excessively large amounts). 

The human body is designed to freak out when there's an overabundance of carbon dioxide, which is that ""struggling to breathe"" feeling you get when you hold your breath for a long time.  The excess CO2 is setting off panic buttons deep within your brain in order to get you to breathe.  This is old animalistic shit that prevents you from not-breathing and dying.  Kind of like how Windows won't let you delete Windows.  There's inherent programming in your brain that prevents you from killing yourself.

Mostly.  There's no programming for some other gasses.  They'll replace oxygen on the hemoglobin, sometimes to a degree of 1000 or more (meaning, if the hemo had a choice, it'd chose the nitrogen 1000x more often than the oxygen, or something to that effect). 

With a steady supply of helium, nitrogen, or carbon monoxide, you'll pass out in about ten or twenty seconds of heavy breathing.  Brain death follows within ten minutes.","1359677307"

It does not make it right nor does it make it wrong. If you are trading for *profit*, wouldn't you be smart enough to know the risk associated with it? If you operate a mom-n-pop shop, you know that anyday Walmart is going to move in and you're going to close down. Is that right? Yet the majority of Americans enjoy Walmart. 

&gt;I dont that justifies the fact that someone is doing damage to the market for their own personal gain.

Government officials themselves do insider trading. I don't think that that is ethical but there is nothing you can do about it. Everyone is out there for personal gain. Show me someone out there for personal lost. I'm not justifying price manipulation as much as I'm just pointing out some facts about trading in general.

&gt;And just because you couldnt afford an item you like when it came out doesnt mean you cant afford it later.

If we put the perspective into goods of limited quantity; e.g. I've always wanted property in Manhattan, 10 years later I still can't afford it.

Evangelion has *by far* the laziest writing I've seen in anime.  That's not to say that there aren't other lazy stories but rather that there aren't any that present themselves as being similarly ""deep"" and ""complex"" when in fact the writer has just appropriated a bunch of random religious-sounding words and made characters say them while having serious looks on their faces.

Who knows, maybe I'm the problem.  It's possible I just missed all the deep, meaningful, important stuff while I was laughing at how outrageously bad the story was.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","Jag tycker iofs inte att man ska se på företag som nånting som kan ta beslut, moraliska eller omoraliska. Ett företag kan inte vara ont eller gott, för det är inte ett levande ting. Man skulle kanske kunna säga att människorna som arbetar i ledningen i ett företag är onda eller goda dock.

Men den sorgliga sanningen är den att om ett företag prioriterar moral över vinst så kommer det företaget långsamt att förlora kapital och tillslut bli ersatt av ett annat företag som inte prioriterar likadant. Så därför försvinner alla företag som prioriterar moral långsamt bort, och det är därför vi inte ser så många sådanna företag idag.

Därför är det enda sättet att få företag att bruka god moral i affärsvärlden genom lagar och politiker. 
Politiker blir valda och populära på att främja bra moral och tjänar därför på att tvinga företag att hålla sig till en bra moral.

Så därför tycker jag att man ska sluta snacka om onda eller goda företag. Det enda som är relevant är om politikerna har reglerat branchen klokt eller ej.","1359677317"

Anecdotally, I've been smoking daily for roughly 14 years, and have yet to notice any memory effects while sober. I'm even pretty good for that while I'm high, due in part to tolerance, and in part due to training myself to act normal when high.

Yes, it would be nice if people skirted a few certain luxuries to help others, but the fact is people spend money on things that directly enrich their lives whether it be a new computer or their cat's surgery. Even the people who made the donations might not have necessarily put their money into another charity. I'm not arguing that what they did was right or wrong, just that the money going to the cat wouldn't have necessarily gone to the less fortunate otherwise, so bringing up other charities it could have gone to is fairly moot.

I enjoyed very little of my life, and hardly ever had the feeling of ""being comfortable in my own skin."" Social interaction was tiresome and frustrating. This led to a lot of self-imposed isolation. I have always been functional, able to get through college (barely) and have worked steadily since, but was always limited in my capacity to enjoy my life.

As far as number 3 goes then, I'd make sure that you have your own lawyer to help you through the proceedings. Not just his, although he may have one present as well.

Bronson is really Kubrick-esque. Tom Hardy is brilliant in it.

James Gunn's *Super* is also worth a watch. Rainn Wilson beats people up. Beware though, it is really gut wrenching and at times hard to watch. It's a critique on glorification of violence in Superhero films and Superhero cliches. 

Rian Johnson's Looper, and Brick are both outstanding films I've seen recently. I'm certain you'll love them both. Looper has fantastic shot framing and really smooth colour tones.

The Coconut deo is made with coconut and vetivert, which is kind of earthy and smoky. So the overall smell is sweet and earthy, which is a lot like vanilla! Also there's a bit of benzoin, which is reminiscent of vanilla ice cream, and is a big addition to the smell of American Cream so there's the connection. 

The one thing you'll notice about Lush is that it's all about cocktails - things that don't match exactly, but go together. Complement each other. It's actually a big part of the fun! You can make all sorts of bath or lotion ""cocktails"" depending on your mood or what you want from it. I personally love Charity Pot (cocoa butter, chocolatey smell) with the Coconut deo as a dusting powder over top - mm chocolate coconut!

"politics","t5_2cneq","It may not be equivalent in terms of utility of the policy, but it is not a false equivalency if viewed this way: Would a law requiring free speech insurance in case someone incites a riot be unconstitutional? Because if it would, then surely a law requiring gun owner's insurance would be.

I think both would be unconstitutional. Also...can everyone please cool it would calling out false equivalencies before exploring an anology from multiple angles? This seems to be the new, ""they're not the same!"" or ""it's different!"". 

So many people calling out false equivalencies (mostly anti-gun people) fail to understand that the fallacy only works if you claim, ""A and B share one similarity, so they are the same in every respect (or more respects than A and B""). He did not say that they are the same in all respects. Really, pro-gun people just desire some clarity. What is the threshold? Clearly many things are okay with gun-control advocates that cause harm to society--alcohol use, marijuana use, tobacco use, unhealthy foods, use of vehicles, etc. 

Yes, they are not the same as guns, but nobody has really explained why. All the things listed cause more death than guns except marijuana. Guns DO have uses outside of killing people. Alcohol is a poison, but if used in small quantities it can be enjoyed recreationally. Guns, likewise, can be used for recreational purposes. 

What it really boils down to is that gun-control advocates hold their position based on personal biases. ","1359677333"

I'm trying to apply for grad school up north so I can get out for a bit.  As far as my own neurosis is concerned...well...it's complicated. I'm anxious, somewhat depressive, and an extreme introvert so attempting to socialize is really difficult for me. I have health issues so I constantly feel drained and unable to relate to my peers.  I tend to isolate myself quite a bit...but it gets lonely. I'm actually pretty functional considering what I've been through (a whole other story for another time I'm sure) but I struggle to find balance in my life. What's your story?

"writing","t5_2qh2n","You change tenses back and forth from past to present.  You should fix things like this before submitting them.  Tense changes can be more annoying than spelling mistakes.

Also, there is quite a bit of dialogue, but very little else.  I don't get a sense of where these characters are or what anyone looks like.  In addition there appears to be a lot of telling in this story and almost no showing.  And you're telegraphing everything (telling the reader too much up front).

For example: 

&gt; ""I am a manifestation of the human soul, fueled by celestial energy. I can become corporeal at will; however, becoming corporeal as well as staying on Earth consumes celestial energy, and if I run out, I can no longer return to Paradise. At most, I would estimate that I have about a year before this happens.""

This is too much info.  You need to save some of these things to be discovered during the course of the story.

Bottom line, it's a cute idea, but this reads like an outline to the author.  Something that you'd write for yourself to give yourself an idea on how the story is going to go.  Find a way to work these things into the story more naturally.  Give us scenes, not recollections.  There's no tension and emotion behind having someone blandly recall how they were shot and killed.  Show us the scene where this happens and take us on the ride where your MC meets his friend as a ghost and they continue their friendship.","1359677335"

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","This works for various reasons. It shows that you are assuming attraction. It shows that you are confident. You are telling her what to do (any time you want to close a woman, it is better to *tell* her than to ask her, and if she doesnt want it she'll say no.) Telling means that you are leading her, and that you are dominant.  It also shows that you have value. A guy who is getting lots of girls numbers isnt going to want to put all those numbers in himself, so he makes the girls do it. Finally it also makes her do some work. Whenever a girl puts in work you are increasing her investment in you, which makes it easier to close her.

You should ***never*** say ""can I have your number?"" At the very least you should always be saying, ""Here, give me your number.""
But handing her the phone and making her do the work is great as well, do it whenever, or all the time. Just avoid doing it in situations where situationally you cant do it.","1359677338"

So if you think you might at some point (maybe not this year) upgrade, I would just buy the biggest one that you can afford &amp; can fit in your space. I realized that the money I would save by buying a paintball canister I would spend buying a specialty regulator. Also, I don't know if you are close to a Co2 refill place, but a bigger canister means you can go longer without refills. I would try 2.5 or a 5 gallon tank.

Generally you can compare funds so long as they are in the same ""class,"" meaning that they are both Canadian equity funds or both global neutral balanced funds, or w/e.

You could do what I did and spend a year in Cusco teaching English and covering the Sacred Valley like a rug.(-; Machu Pichu IS amazing, especially if you approach it in the dawn mists, which you can only do by hiking there (the first train arrives around 9:30 am, IIRC). But there's a shit ton of Inca ruins surrounding Cusco and going to some of the village markets higher up is pretty cool, too.

The best part of going to Peru is getting to know Peruvians and that's not easy to do in a one week tour. It's a beautiful country and they're beautiful people. Slow down and get to know them. And do it while you're young--you'll have plenty of time to be an ""adult"" later.","1359677341"

So do the aforementioned libraries supply you with convenient methods to receive, parse and send said data?

I don't know how it started but suddenly, I started talking to some people I got along with about things that scared me. About puberty and feels and whatever I thought about frequently. And I discovered that people were pretty much all the same. They all had the exact same problems. And I talked and talked. I didn't hide anything, just told them what was on my mind. Told everything to everybody who wanted to hear it. People trusted me and told my their secrets and fears because I had no secrets myself. 

This was the giant boost in self-esteem I needed. 

First, I took the bullies' weapons away by hiding nothing and genuinely not caring about them picking on me. I slowly became confident and didn't let people tell me shit anymore. The bullies became aware of my new confidence and just stopped.

Enjoy yourself and keep in mind that people who try to give you a shitty time are just really poor human beings who won't be able to harm you that much if you step up and act confident.","1359677344"

Dark Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls.

This is a game that is *terrifying* through and through, but not because it's a horror game. Because it's a *realistic* game with horrible creatures.

Put simply to Rocket, you need to make zombies more of a threat, but not necessarily in a ""Oops, I see a zombie, better go the other way,"" kinda' way. That would be ideal- fearing zombies. But also in a way where zombies just go above and beyond. How you might do this diverges into a few methods based on what kind of zombies we're dealing with and how you want to approach the game.

L4D-style, have multiple kinds of zombies. But I understand the hesitation to go with the absurd, so when I say ""multiple kinds,"" I mean normal zombies that do one of the following each:

1. Sprint.
2. Hide in trees.
3. Hide around corners.
4. Make terrifying sounds that alert other zombies. (Banshee wail?)
5. Wander through the woods.
6. Crawl on the ground.
7. Unique animation where if it grabs you, it can one-shot you (bites through your throat?)

Or, of course, if you didn't want to go this route, you could do with traveling hordes as has been suggested time and time again.

As it stands though, we can logically predict everything about zombies. They need to be able to surprise us both by passing our expectations and by being tough enough to kill us easily if we let our guard down.


With that said, Dark Souls is unnerving in the practical world. The actions and sounds and visuals concern us.

Amnesia is terrifying in an aesthetic realm. You see a hanging body down a hallway, but you're playing a horror game, so you expect that. But, when you turn around, it's not there anymore. 
The mood, the lighting, the lack of supplies- it's makes you feel pressed and pressured into taking one bad thing or another.
Amnesia, however, is largely scripted, so it's hard to do with in the SA without perhaps scripted zombie events, which would be hard to do and might become too bland if they're easy enough to spot.
Be that as it may, Amnesia still represents the scarcity and unnerving choices present in DayZ. You should absolutely have to make those choices. Choices you don't want to make- that make you uncomfortable in every way.

Combine those two formulas, and you have a truly horrible game.","1359677348"

In Islam Muslim men are allowed to marry up to 4 wives. There are a lot of restrictions and conditions that must be taken into account if you want to do this but in Islam it's allowed.

The difference between Muslims in the past compared to Muslims today is that the majority of Muslims today would feel uncomfortable having more than 1 wife, especially Muslims in the west. So basically whilst most Muslims AGREE that it's allowed (it's clearly stated in the Quran and Hadith) most Muslims wouldn't do it.

Ok now for the age part. In Islam there is no concept of teenage years. Once you undergo puberty you are considered to be an adult and so can marry, work, etc. I assume this is because people had much shorter life spans then and so needed to marry earlier but I don't really know for sure. Similar to the first point, whilst technically in Islam this is permitted (again most Muslims will admit this as its clearly stated in the texts although some may be reluctant to discuss it) most Muslims wouldn't want to marry a young teenager in today's age for obvious reasons.

I hope this answered your question. Decided to post since the other replies appear to be giving false information. Typed from my phone so sorry for any errors.

People seem to want to get angry. It's very easy if the person you are getting angry to is ""some bad man somewhere I don't personally know"". Then the whole conversation turns into aimless steam blowing and there might not even exist anyone who fit's the bill of that ""bad man"".

If there is a ""rape culture"" I think it has to be a very silent one in the western world. If you can point some big mouthed prophet of slut raping I'd be glad to admit I'm wrong.

EDIT: It might be easy to find one from India. But if you want to convince me it has to be someone who says something like ""its OK for **us** to rape women who dress like sluts"" not someone who says ""women should stay inside because there are some other men who will rape them"".

"startups","t5_2qh26","Hey great comment! These aren't actually student emails but the listservs and their admins to get onto the listserv newsletter. I know recruiters can collect this information themselves but the value proposition is a more exhaustive, easier to access, uniform interface to many schools rather than digging around 10 different CS undergrad home pages looking for the admin.  I'm on mobile at the moment but I'll respond more ASAP!  
  
Also super interesting is that my value proposition was misunderstood - no student emails are sold, just the newsletters and their admins. I'll work on rephrasing the pitch!  
  
Edit: listservs are found via the google search API, I stay under the rate limit but could potentially pay to increase API usage.  
  
Edit 2: the use case is someone looking to contact CS students can find CS listservs and their admins, or business listservs and their admins to get relevant messages approved. There has been interest from a few recruiters so far, I just don't know if they will pay for it yet.  
  
Edit 3: I'm looking to do a la carte CS, engineering, and business listservs as well as group packages of those departments in the future. Also right now the listservs are alphabetical but I could highlight the important ones at the top for sure. Thanks for the awesome feedback!","1359677353"

Top 8 from the WoL tournament will compete in a campaign speedrun on Brutal difficulty. The 4 slowest players are banished to BW, indefinitely. The top 4 receive a seed in the HoTS tournament. The open bracket finalists compete against the 4 seeds, and the winner of THAT is awarded the honor of competing in the IPL Deathmatch Arena (IPLDMA).

The IPLDMA will pit the HoTS champ, LoL champ team captain, and Street Fighter II champ into an open arena where they will fight to the death. 

The winner of the IPLDMA will then advance to the Ultimate eSports Battle of Terrible Terrible Damage and Glory (UEBTTDG). The challenger will be stripped naked (save for Razer's new Deathcobra loincloth) and dropped into a pit with only a keyboard for protection. They will be hooked up to an intravenous drip of Hotsix energy drink and absorb 3 gallons into their bloodstream. At this point, Dustin Browder will be lowered into the pit by a flock of doves, riding a harley that's equipped with a 2,000lb slingshot designed to hurl giant boulders.

If you survive, you will be awarded a nod of approval from Flash, one trillion dollars, and a free weight-lifting session with iNcontroL.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A) Citation needed. B) Driving tired is also stupid, the fact that it is equally (or more!) dangerous is irrelevant, and does not excuse drunk driving. 

The problem with drinking is that it impairs your judgement, meaning that you are unable to properly assess how safe it is for you to drive home. While having a small amount of alcohol in your blood system is not dangerous, the danger is that as you drink you may not be able to judge how intoxicated you in fact are. This is especially important as Alcohol does not affect you consistently. How intoxicated you get, can vary on many factors ranging from weight sex, or genetics, to other more daily factors such as how much you've eaten, what meds you may have been taking, or how heavily you have been drinking over previous weeks. To be honest, I find that on some evenings one beer'll make me feel plenty tipsy, and on others, it'll take four. 
My personal rule is that if there is any chance of drinking, I'd rather bus/train/walk than risk the chance of my alcohol addled self tricking me. It's just not worth it.

edit: I say citation needed more out of interest rather than obnoxious scepticism. ","1359677359"

Doesn't matter. End result has the same emotional impact.

I find the idea that I might like a piece of bad art because I find the artist likable or attractive, to be horrible and disgusting. And I feel the same about disliking good art because I hate the artist. This applies to all mediums.","1359677359"

How the world will be better off without them, please tell my daughter I did it because she doesn't deserve a horrible mother like me, things like that.  I don't mean to belittle people who commit parasuicide or attempt suicide, I really don't.  They're just (understandably) very emotional by the time I get to them.  I do my best to show that I understand and support them, so I hope that I have managed to bring relief to some of them.

"MorbidReality","t5_2tz1e","* ""I was appalled at what they were doing. I was appalled at what I was doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do."" - Kevin Carter*

What I take from these quotes is that he did care about the things he witnessed and photographed, he was horrified by both the subject matter and the fact that to depict these things for a wider audience and draw attention to them, he was required to be a bystander.  We think of all bystanders to horror as apathetic, weak, or cowardly (and undoubtedly many of them are) but if Kevin Carter was truly apathetic, if he truly felt nothing for the things he witnessed, he would not have been driven to photograph it at all.

So in my mind at least, this is a man who had to swallow his horror and fight his own conscience in order to compose a photograph that would properly convey the terrible gravity of what he saw.  In his choice of composition and subject, he quietly shows us his own revulsion in such a way that we feel it as well.  That's really what photography like this is about - invoking emotion and reaction in the viewer, forcing them to stare upon things that they would otherwise try to forget, to ignore, to pretend does not exist.

As a young writer, I was taught that *'writing is the lie that tells the truth'*, and in retrospect it applies to photography as well.  The vulture is a powerful element in this photo, and while in the situation itself the carrion bird was twenty or so feet away from the fallen child and required him to wait and choose his angles, its proper inclusion and placement was part of what made this image so horrifying.  In a world where we see so many atrocious things and become so jaded against the natural reaction of disgust, it seems like a massive challenge on part of photographers everywhere to get beneath our skins and provoke us.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","Reading through the original thread.... you're doing a very sloppy/haphazard/incomplete job of troubleshooting this problem. 

1.) (as the /r/techsupport/ sidebar recommends)... you should give the Readers as full/complete/detailed as possible description of the environment you're working in. (what kind of computers, what type of connection (wired or Wifi), who is your ISP, what kind of Router do you have?.. etc.etc) Be as detailed as possible. If all you say is ""I have Win7... "".. then you're not giving us enough info to do help you. 

A good example of a complete description would be something like:... ""I live on the outskirts of Chicago and have Comcast as my ISP. We've got a Surfboard 3200 Modem, a Linksys EA6500 Router and an Acer Win8 Laptop, DELL Optiplex Win7 Desktop, a few iPhones and a Nexus 7 tablet. The problem loading Reddit only seems to happen on the Win8 Laptop and only in Firefox (works fine in Chrome). "" 

2.) Isolate the problem. Is it happening in only 1 Browser ?... is it happening on only 1 computer ? ... (test different Browsers or different devices and see if you notice any patterns/new behaviors). If you can, test on different connections (Wired, WiFi, Cellular-hotspot,etc). 

From the screenshots you posted my 1st reaction is:... it's not a problem on your end.. it's a problem on Reddit's end.

2nd guess would be you've got a speed/latency problem of some kind (where the web-page isn't responding as quickly as it should).. but without knowing all the other particular information about your connection,. I can't really help you fix it.

I'd like to think that, for example, this subreddit is populated by people who are trying to flee the wave of memes and vague game references and that we will have to continuously keep adding true to our name in order to keep the actual community alive. 
Is there a solution? I don't know. It would be nice to have a private community of actuall ""gamers"" that could not be inundated with useless idiotic posts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRKP3VbI41M 
This is may be the future of any ""trueblahblah"" subreddit.

"ABDL","t5_2r8xk","Well, I've recently just gotten more comfortable identifying myself as AB (but still would rather like being called a little...), so I might not know a lot. But I'll try to answer it from my perspective.

First of all, I will say, I know I am not crazy. I'm a rational person, I think, besides the fact that I can get stressed sometimes and overwhelmed, but that's just like any person. Although I do like regressing, it's mostly a turn-on for me-meaning that I only regress when I feel horny. I know not everybody regresses for this reason, but this is just from my perspective (which might come off as even weirder, but oh well).

When I first figured out my fetish, I thought that I might be crazy, too. It was weird and, in fact, I still find it weird! But it's what I like. Now, I've grown more comfortable with it, and I can say, in my case, that it is something that I control. It's not some psychological break down. I would never describe it like that-I choose when I want to act this way. Rather it's out of a need to feel safe or secure, or to just feel cute, *I* decide if I want to act this way, and if I want to stop. I think if it's something you are doing that you have complete control of, you can't really describe it as ""crazy town"" ....which,btw, I appreciate bluntness as much as the next person,but there is another way to word your thoughts than comparing people to gollum from Lord of the Rings. Just saying, if you want people to have a respectful discussion with you, show that same respect back and then you wouldn't have to worry at all about downvotes or hurting people's feelings. :p Although I do like your questions, it gets people to think!

Also,another point I wanted to make is, I wouldn't really say I leave myself, at least, not in my case. My new partner described it like this when I asked him how much I change when I am in little mode-he said I'm still the same person, but with more simpler emotions, less complex. I don't know if that makes sense, but I guess I'm just saying some people want to feel like things can be more simpler in their lives, and maybe this is just how some people take a break from all the complexities of life. Hope that makes sense!

Refering to OP-I don't think you're crazy, not at all. Things can get overwhelming sometimes, and believe me, I've seen people react to stress in a worst matter before. But if you have trouble controlling your urges, I think that's when you need to figure out how to control it, and maybe a therapist can help you with that. Like I said,though, I wouldn't know! But in my opinion, if I had no control over my little urges, I would try to find a way to get a grip so I could go through life without retreating from obstacles.

Btw,sorry for all the rambling and the grammar problems. On the phone,you know how it is. Hope I helped somehow!

Do you want me to cite some more radical feminists who write about rape/abuse and don't say that?  Okay, here you go.  Patricia Hill Collins, Liz Kelly, Jill Radford, Judith Herman, Michael Kimmel, Evan Stark, Jalna Hanmer, Henriette Jansen, James Ptacek, Linda Saltzman... there are 10 other key feminist thinkers, many involved high up in political and legislation, who have absolutely, never said 'victims are always right and those prosecuted are always guilty'.

"running","t5_2qlit","In response to your girlfriend's negativity, I would add:

a) Depending on your current fitness level, risk of heart disease, etc, training to run a marathon can be an excellent way to build healthy habits.  The actual act of racing a marathon is a tiny part of the preparation you will need to do, and the vast majority of it will be running &lt;1 hour at a time at a slow-ish pace.  Which is great for your health.

b) Running a marathon means setting a difficult goal, making a plan, prioritizing your time, and investing effort to achieve your goal.  The psychological benefit of following through on a year long plan (or 4 months, or 2 years, or whatever) of self-improvement is huge.  Training for a marathon is an experience of taking control of your life and realizing a difficult goal.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Poison Mist (3), Toxic Mist (1), Acid Mist (2), Poison Darts, Poison Resin (though generally I have them poisoned before I need to use this).  Basically Acid Mist breaks weapons/shields maybe armor too, but I'm still debating as to how well it does this (had people stand in it the whole time and their weapons still hurt more than a broken weapon).... So I use this first at them, best place being Depths bonfire, but anywhere claustophobic works.  The point of Acid Mist is not to break their stuff but to obscure their vision.  Then walk into the mist to get closer and Poison Mist... Then you have 2 poisons 1 acid and your toxic mist left. I generally just want to get them with the toxic since I have darts for poisoning and without toxic it takes too long to kill them, even toxic alone can be tough.  Once I toxic them I lloyd's, then throw darts at their shield as the poison effect will go through, usually takes like 3 or 4 hits relatively quickly, but since it goes through shields this isn't tough if you keep your distance.  Then once they are poisoned and toxiced I just turtle up and lloyd's them every now and again to make sure they can't heal.  Basically if you hear their poison sounds instead of lloyd's sounds then they can heal. I will literally not swing at them once if possible, just poison block and lloyd's. (I don't count the darts as attacking since I actually try to hit their shield so they get more comfortable)

Also it is hilarious when people have never been lloyd's talismaned before and they keep trying to use their estus.  I skyward look as they stand 2 feet away helplessly looking at the bottom of the estus flask and shaking it out.","1359677382"

Kenny Rogers is still 74 years old, and no amount of surgery is going to reverse his age. At least, not with existing techniques / technology. How the two are different, I can't say exactly. But they do seem different to me. I'm not saying that big tits and a tone body determines whether someone is a woman or not, but it sure seems like it can't hurt. I mean, it makes perfect sense to me to refer to [Yasmine Petty](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6d89jhU4n1ruqwuzo1_500.jpg) as 'her' rather than 'him' or 'she' rather than 'he'.

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","Northern Ireland is a fairly unique place in that you can live in the middle of nowhere and still be fairly close (by American standards) to urban centres.

The two 'big' cities are Belfast and Derry, and they have the biggest hospitals. They also happen to be very nice cities (don't be put off by any news reports about sectarian violence and protests, our country is remarkably safe). They're really not much nicer than anywhere in the South though. 

If you definitely are moving to some part of the island, then there's a few things to consider about the differences between the two states. The first is that by and large Northern Ireland has a lower cost of living. This might make it a little more attractive. But it also has its downsides. Wages may be lower too. I'm not sure there's really much difference in actual quality of life on either side of the border. 

Really all I can say is do a lot of research on other factors before you move. Healthcare wise either part of Ireland is going to be better than America for you. There are important differences between different parts of Ireland regarding how likely you are to get a job, what your cost of living will be, whether this will translate into a better quality of life... etc.

I live in Derry, it's pretty good. If you'd like to know anything about it I can help you with that too.

Google terms like London knife crime etc for some background, it's viewed here in the same way as gun crime is view in the states.

As for the knife in question, all locking knives are considered to be fixed length blades under UK law unfortunately and there are no provisions for having one in a public place without good cause. Even if it was a 1"" blade it's still viewed as illegal while [this](http://www.boker.de/images/zoom/01bo591.jpg) is perfectly legal because it is a slip joint (which is why I carry one).

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I did a bunch of work, and got something that looks like an answer. I made some assumptions (outlined below) and found the minimum height-to-height ratio *r* you need (as in, how much taller each domino is than the previous) for a given height-to-width ratio *s* (is our domino a square or more rectangular?):

    2(r^4)(√(s^2-1) - s) + s*r + √(4-r) = 2√(s^2-1)

I couldn't solve that equation, but I can plug in various values of *s* and see what the graph looks like. Funny thing is, some values don't even have positive solutions, which indicate I did something wrong. For *s*=1 (a square) I got *r*=1.087, which makes sense at least.

Unless someone *really* wants me too, I won't post the work. But here are some of my assumptions:

* the dominoes are made of the same material
* the height ratio from domino to domino is the same
* same goes for width and length (this implies mass increases by the ratio cubed)
* we aim the dominoes so they hit the next one directly at the center
* after momentary collision, we ignore the effects of the inciting domino
* we're in a perfectly spherical vacuum, and we have no friction unless we want to (static friction, mostly)

That's all I can think of at the moment.","1359677392"

"BUGhunt","t5_2w75j","Those are all I got for now. Some suggestions for arguments in the future.

&gt;Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-white because it justifies the ""forced flooding"" of white countries by non-white people

&gt;If white people ""forcibly flooded"" non-white countries, it would be considered genocide

I find these often come with comparisons of colonialism. Of course, there are fairly clear differences between colonial occupation and multiculturalism, multiculturalism being voluntary and often due to their already being a multiethnic fabric (see Anglo-North-American states, in which the introduction of multiculturalism is actually a way to keep all cultures alive, including the variety of cultures they would consider ""white"" and others), as well as a need for more workers in the face of population declines, which will stabilize as further developments in more impoverished nations occurs. It is also worth noting that this is happening in other ""non-white"" countries that have ""developed"", such as increased expats to Asia in the wake of globalization. This signals that these international movements are not about extinguishing other cultures, but a product of our world becoming more global. And frankly, the issue with globalization isn't in the fact of cultures interacting and meshing with each other, but moreso issues of capitalist exploitation. That might be a bit too high-level for these discussions tho. :/

&gt;Non-white people procreating with white people is genocide, because it is getting rid of the ""white race""

Genetically impossible for one. The genes for ""whiteness"" won't magically disappear. ""White people"" number at least a billion, possibly 2, which is quite a significant number. As there is no evolutionary pressure against ""whiteness"", then I expect it to stay around that number. Of course, a white genocide believer will argue that there is a pressure, but they would need to provide evidence beyond immigration in order to back that up, as it simply won't happen without a significant amount of violence. At worst ""white people"" will a plurality in these multicultural nations, which is still the majority group.

&gt;Africa is for the Africans, Asia is for the Asians, white countries are for everyone -- this is discrimination against white countries

Expats to Asia are common. Africa more so as it becomes more viable in the global market. Xenophobia in Asian countries is often a subject of critique. So no, this is bullshit.

Don't get me wrong: my experiences should *not* be used a measuring stick for other people's relationships.

For a lot of heroes, Tranquil Boots replaced Vanguard, so you might consider that too.

Generally, Mek will be better for team play and Supports that have the mana pool to use it well.

Many heroes can also consider getting a naked Vitality Booster and turning it into a Heart later on.

Vanguard can be good if you get is early on, but it tapers off into late game because:

* Large gold investment
* Many of the pieces used to build it can be more useful elsewhere (e.g. Battlefury/Linkin's and Heart)
* Flat amount of blocked damage vs. adding into your Armor
* The regen is good early game, but mediocre mid-late

That being said, I would look at a few things:

* Do you have the mana to support Mek?
* Is the game more than 10-15 minutes in? (go Mek)
* Do you absolutely need the raw HP? (Note: there are other options like Rod of Atos, in that event)
* Are you planning to play very aggressively and win early on? (really, you could get either for this, but Vanguard is more geared towards early game)
* Do you risk being locked down and killed before being able to trigger Mek?","1359677406"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Absolutely true.  In fact, some of the worst known environmental disasters occurred in Japan in the 20th century.  Chief among those was riparian and seawater dumping of heavy metals like mercury by Japanese chemical manufacturing companies like Shin Nihon Chisso, in collusion with the Japanese government itself.

The [Minamata story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamata_disease) is absolutely horrifying.  In 1951, Chisso began releasing organic mercury as part of their wastewater at the Minamata factory in Kyushu.  The mercury poisoned the entire ecosystem, getting into the fish and then into the fishermen and their families.  Soon symptoms of extreme mercury poising began appearing in fishing villages surrounding the factory, the mysterious ""Minamata disease"".  The company began investigating, and soon realized they were causing the disease by their dumping.  However, rather than stop it, or let people know, they played dumb and ordered the company doctors to stay quite while the poisoning continued.  

Even though Chisso wouldn't allow outside researchers access to their wastewater (which would have cleared up the issue immediately), by 1956, researchers at a local university had correctly identified what the mysterious Minamata disease actually was.  However, as soon as they began making their findings public, Chisso and the Japanese government stepped in to discredit their research, and paid hack scientists to propose countertheories to confuse the issue.  Chisso had an obvious financial interest at stake, and MITI was concerned that inevitable environmental regulations would impede the ""Japanese miracle"" that was then transforming their country.  

Thus they pimped all sorts of false theories: fertilizer runoff, leaking military ordinance, bacterial blooms, and - most atrociously - filthy hygiene in rural fishing communities.  The Kyushu researchers who had identified the factory as the cause were called country bumpkins, and big-name researchers from Tokyo came out to say it couldn't possibly be the factory.  The press, a willing participant in the ""economic miracle"" narrative, ate this up.  Listen to this interview between a reporter and one of the Kumamoto University researchers who had correctly identified Chisso's mercury as the problem (perhaps compare to the contemporary debate about climate change:)

&gt; Q: Selenium, manganese, thallium...the average layman just doesn't trust you any more.  Why have you changed your minds three or four times?

&gt; A: The main thing for us is discovering the cause of the disease; we're not trying to oppose the factory.  It can't be helped if the result is harmful to the factory.  As for our coming up with three different theories, when you do research that's what happens; there's no need for me to defend this...

&gt; Q: Won't you just change your minds a fourth time and come out with another theory...

&gt; A: That won't happen...

&gt; Q: Maybe not, but why does Kumamoto University confuse laymen by putting out all these haphazard theories?

&gt; A: They're not haphazard.  That's just the way the research happened to turn out...

&gt; Q: When you can't give a satisfactory explanation to a layman like me, I can't help thinking yours is really a country university.  Scholars from the center [meaning Tokyo] are much better...

So, the poisoning continued.  Because nearly half the people in Minamata either worked at Chisso factory or a connected business, those who spoke out were seen as enemies of the community.  By far the absolute worst aspect of this tragedy: those fishermen and their families who contracted the disease were ostracized and ignored, for fear that local fish would be unsellable.  In fact, we simply don't know how many people were poisoned because they hid their symptoms out of fear.  

In 1959, eight years after poisoning of the bay began, Chisso corporation installed a Cyclator to purify their wastewater and claimed that - even though there was no definitive proof they were the cause of Minamata disease - their Cyclator ensured that the alleged problem was corrected.  

However, it was all a lie - the company consciously knew that the Cyclator would do nothing to scrub the mercury out of the water, and installed it simply to deflect the growing rumors.  Thanks to this lie, the poisoning continued for another *ten years*.  

Horrifying evidence of the effect of mercury on developing fetuses came out of these decades.  Doctors in Kumamoto noticed an immense spike in birth defects in those communities affected by Minamata disease. [Photographic documentation](http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/tomoko-uemura-in-her-bath/) of those born with congenital mercury poising by W. Eugene Smith and his wife led to widespread international outrage but no action in Minamata itself.  

It wasn't until 1969, after nearly two decades of continuous poisoning, that the truth about the company's multiple coverups became fully known.  Chisso had dumped so much organic mercury into the water that Minamata Bay's seafloor qualified as a mercury mine.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","When I was 13 I went shooting with a friend of mine and up until then the only thing I'd ever shot were a couple Daisy BB guns and my dads pump 12 gauge. 

We went to somebodys private outdoor rage just outside town and we were the only people there. Just my friend, his dad, and I. His dad brought about 6 guns. I don't remember them all but I remember my favorite was a S&amp;W Nickel plated .357 Mag with about a 6""-7"" barrel. But the moment of infamy was when I was handed a Winchester 30-30. I fired once, lowered the weapon to look at my target and cycled the lever at the same time. Being totally inexperienced though, I didn't realize that this also reset the hammer and gave the trigger a nearly feather light pull. As I was standing, holding the rifle loose and turning to talk **BLAM!!!** I had fired at about 90 degrees through a 180 turn back towards my friend and his dad. They both went absolutly apeshit. 

This is the one and only time I've ever been involved with an accidental discharge and it's also the moment I had found a lifelong hobby. It frightened the life out of me, and I'm much better for it.

If you know Japanese, I would recommend checking out gaijin pot or one of the English newspapers (Yomiuri Shimbun or Japan Times) to see if there's anything available that offers visa sponsorship. 

Most people come here teaching English because its unarguably the best way to get a work visa. A lot of people use it as an opportunity to learn Japanese before going off into another industry after completing their contracts. 

If you're looking to go to school, keep in mind that you'll be significantly limited with what you can do for work, so you might would want to save up a little bit first. There's a ton of places to see outside of Tokyo (which aside from the lights and sounds, doesn't really have a whole lot to do), so you'll need some money to check it all out. I hope this helps. If you need any specifics, just send me a pm. I'll help to the best of my ability.","1359677411"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","This sounds like it could be stalking behavior. It's definitely abnormal judging by the message she sent your friend's mom. I'd leave the situation alone for now, but keep a record of every time your ex contacts any of your family or friends, comes into your work, or runs into you in public. Delete her from your Facebook/other social media and set everything to private. Tell the management at your store that they should never give out your schedule to anyone who asks. 

If she continues coming into your store, explain the situation to your HR manager, tell them that her obsessive behavior makes you very uncomfortable and that she shouldn't be allowed in the store. 

It's inappropriate for her to keep in touch with your siblings, unless they are friends who actually see each other on a regular basis. I would encourage them to minimize their interactions with her. 

In the event that she does something that could be construed as harassment, you need to send an email to all of your family, friends, and co-workers, stating that they should never give any information about you, your family, or your whereabouts to her because of her stalking behavior. Include a photo of her. Then file a police report and have a consultation with a lawyer (usually free) to see if you can file a restraining order. 

I work with 3 people who have stalkers, all of them exes, and this is how the cops told them to handle it. It probably won't come to this, but you need to protect yourself, your family, and your co-workers. ","1359677412"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","He had white hair at the end because this is still a Devil May Cry game. Dante has white hair. That's just part of it. It's the same reason that he has an overcoat and Rebellion and Ebony and Ivory. It's just part of his character design. The reason he started out with dark hair was because this was his origin story. He didn't really *become* Dante until towards he end. It was just a visual metaphor showcasing his transformation into something more akin to the Dante we were more familiar with. 

The reason they are charging for the original Dante look is because Capcom is entirely dildos. Back in my day, you'd unlock alternate costumes by doing stuff in the game. For one Spider-man game, I got to play as the Green Goblin by beating the game, and it was awesome. Now that'd be $20. The black and red costume would be $5. This kind of DLC sucks. The point is, they know a lot of fanboys are upset about the change in character design and they decided to capitalize on the situation. 

Devil Trigger changes Dante's hair color and coat color for a variety of reasons. First, to do something different. Having him not turn into a demon would just be another thing to set it apart from it's predecessor, and during reboots, this is desired. Second, foreshadowing. This goes neatly with the character development I mentioned earlier. It communicates that Dante has the potential to become like Old Dante; something that is paid off towards the end of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if New Dante has a red coat in the next game. 

As for the character change, I don't think it has anything to do with negative backlash from the fans. Games tend to change dramatically from their inception to their final product. New Dante is no longer a smoker because it just wasn't necessary. What exactly does having him smoking on screen add?  And, in my opinion, the launch trailer Dante was just as much as a obnoxious douche as the Dante in the final product. He was still anti-social, a bit ruthless, and hedonistic. This wasn't a very big change. 

Gameplay could have been improved, I'll give you that. The lack of a lock on button was very noticeable. But they also innovated fairly well. I no longer had to go through pause menus to change styles and weapons. All of that was easily handled through the triggers and d-pad. It flowed really well, which is important in this kind of game. 

Also, when I first started out, I sucked at this game, but I still could manage SSS ratings sometimes. Once I started getting better, I'd consistently get SSS for both time and style, which was a bit weird. I'm playing it on Son of Sparda now and I think he lowest grade I've ever gotten was an A.  The scoring meter could stand to be a bit more rigorous. 

Finally, i think a lot of this type of criticism is based off of a fear that fans will never get to see Old Dante again. They fell in love with the character and now they feel like he's gone forever. To that I say hooplah! May I direct you to this [graph.](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Recons_4798.jpg) Don't worry DMC fans. Old Dante will be back. New Dante will either become him, or they'll eventually just drop this reboot thing in an effort to ""get back to their roots"" and Dante will be all the richer for it. ","1359677418"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","edit: so, I guess this whole thing is weird on purpose, and maybe my advice is poking at stuff that's the way it is intentionally... So, if my advice isn't useful, just take it to mean that I find this whole thing weird, and so I don't really like it because of that.

&gt;”Well, what’s it to you?” Under the bridge you could really smell the sea. One wouldn’t really expect that, but you really could. You might think that you smelled the sea, if one hadn’t before, but Jim really did smell the sea. Jim had been out there, actually crossing the waves, like a real sailor. Maybe it sounds silly, but that’s what he told me. One might not expect a guy like Jim to have, though. Cross the waves like that, I mean. But he really didn’t miss it, no, that part was over for now.

This part is almost good, but it's... weird instead.

A few things. First, why are you leading with this dialogue and then immediately ignoring it? Try something like...

""Well, what's it to you?"" Bob said, his grizzled, old face hidden in the shadow beneath the bridge. Down here, you could really smell the sea. -- Yeah, not the best example, but if you want to lead with that dialogue, you really shouldn't just leave it completely hanging here.

Next, you've got a really weird mix of using ""you"" and ""one."" Not sure exactly, but I think you/one generally wants to only use you or one, and not both. And, usually, you don't want to use ""one"" because it sounds weird and pompous in English. But why use either? Why not make it Jim smelling the sea?

""The smell of the sea was strong beneath the bridge. Jim wouldn't have expected that, but there it was, and there was no mistaking it.""

Third, you're really overusing really. Really, you want to avoid words like ""really"" in your prose unless you *really* need it. ""It was really tall"" is never really as good as ""It was so tall, Jim could hardly see the top."" Same with actually, truthfully, etc.

&gt;One might not expect a guy like Jim to have, though. Cross the waves like that, I mean. But he really didn’t miss it, no, that part was over for now.

I feel like this part is meant to be written like some random guy narrating the story in a sort of conversational tone. Well, you can do that, but it's *really* hard to do well, and you just end up with flowery (see; weird) prose a lot of the time. I personally don't like how you've gone about it, but at the same time, I'm not sure how to fix it. I'd suggest sticking to a more standard approach to prose.

&gt;“I have rights, you know.”

Another seemingly random, hanging piece of dialogue. I don't understand why you're doing this or what it's meant to accomplish.

&gt;Anyhow, the sea wasn’t all you could smell down there. You might think that the sea wouldn’t smell that much compared to what else was there. Well, you’re on the right path – for sure. But don’t tell Jim, he’ll get sore about it.

Hm. If you want to write it like dialogue, why don't you just make it actual dialogue? As prose goes, this is kind of tedious. As the reader, I'm getting impatient. You need to get to the point already!

I think I'll stop there. Hopefully I've made my point with just picking at those first few paragraphs. I find the whole thing sort of enjoyable in a way, but also very weird, and definitely taking too long to go anywhere.

I really wish they had gone the way of Pokemon and just made the DS games pseudo 3D with the gameplay of the 2D Zelda's because let's be honest, the hardware just wasn't there at the time. They should have waited for the 3DS before they made the 3D handheld Zelda's. Also, they would have been the last 2D Zelda's EVER which honestly I miss. I'm not saying that 2D Zelda is better, but if they had made a Zelda game on the DS that looked more like Pokemon B/W or D/P (3D enviroments, 2D movement and sprites) it would have blown every other DS game outta the motherfucking water, instead of the sad, insignificant little plop made by Spirit Tracks and Phantom Hourglass.","1359677423"

WillowGarage's ROS software platform is designed to support multi-process component architectures on-board a robot, based on a publish-subscribe model. Today, it is one of the more popular architectures in the industry. ROS has its faults. ROS isn't especially scalable or bandwidth efficient. There is no synchrony hypothesis or deterministic FRP semantics. It is easy for ROS systems to have race conditions, glitches, and other oddities.  But it is widely used. (Yay, industry.)

roshask provides effective integration of ROS with the haskell process, and also some nice properties when multiple ROS nodes are defined within one haskell process.  I'm enjoying that roshask is enabling me to use Haskell in my current dayjob tasks.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","&gt; Maybe this Umbridge's problem is that she thinks human sexuality is a soul-destroying ""writhing abyss,"" and that someone should get to the age of 14 without knowing what sex is and what a penis looks like?

When my kids reach puberty they'll know the appearance and function of their own genitals and those of the opposite sex, but come on, there is a big difference between seeing a drawing or even a picture of another person's genitals in various stages of arousal, of knowing the purpose of said genitals, or knowing the parts and placement, and the accessibility of very hard core porn.

I grew up in the 80s and 90s. We had porn back then, sure. A friend's dad had a subscription to Penthouse and he'd raid his dad's closet for back issues and lend them out to his mates. I found a dirty book in my parents bedroom. And I was even privy to seeing a simulated porn on the Spice channel once when I was 14 or so.

But today the accessibility is totally different. I never saw shemales, orgies, violent anal sex, etc.

* Even if the Gateway opens, there's no way to know what's going to be on the other side since everything's been re-arranged, so you could very easily expose yourself to danger simply by *opening* one.  Consider in [AMoL when](/s ""Androl opens the Gateway to the magma chamber under Dragonmount.  If you don't close that Gateway fast enough, you could get yourself killed - especially if you're in an area with a lot of dead grass or other flammable materials."")  Or worse, what if you have the awful luck of opening one that leads straight to one of the mad male channelers?
* Given that the geography is in constant flux, and they don't exactly have Google Maps, the usefulness of Traveling is going to be sharply decreased.  Even if the Gateway actually opens, how are you going to know where you want to go?
* Even if you did have a general idea of the geography, there aren't exactly going to be a lot of desirable destinations at the moment.

Norwegian doesn't have this problem, because it has the reflexive pronoun: «Louise kommenterte sitt bilde» and «Louise kommenterte hennes bilde» are grammatically distinct. Hence «sitt eget» seeming somewhat tautological.

That method is heating pressed kief and you end up with a solid hash disc rather then a pressed kief disc. To my understanding the only difference is the pressed kief can be easily broken back down into powder, and the hash-kief disc-thing cannot.

That being said the MFLB somewhat does this w/o trying to and hence yoou can somewhat make hash from kief with the MFLB. However, you cannot do this with your Q because you are pulling hot air over the load instead of actually heating the screen the load is held in.","1359677437"

"homestuck","t5_2rzgi","&gt;Wow, and you wonder why I wanted to clarify the terminology. That just doesn't make any sense.

It doesn't make sense to you that the characters were drawn a-racial to make them a-racial... Ok... I'm really not sure how else to explain it, but what the hell, I'll give it a go. 

Hussie wanted to make characters that were highly abstracted/templatized. He wanted to do this so that the readers could fill in certain characteristics based on their own personal preferences. One of these characteristics was race. This meant not supplying a race in the comics, because if he did the reader would not be able to supply their own. So he drew the characters in such a way that they did not have a race. If someone does not have a race they are a-racial. Canonically, the characters have no race. Any race you imagine them with will be non-canonical, it will be a head canon, just like any voice you imagine them with. This does not mean you aren't supposed to or allowed to imagine them without a race or a voice, it means it is up to you to supply one, there is no canonical one. None exists in the canon. They are canonically a-racial. Are you following this? I can explain it again.

&gt;Then they can't also be evidence against filling them in however I like.

Yes! You can fill them in however you'd like! Whatever you fill them in as is exactly as correct as anything else!

&gt;Well, that's the definition I have been using the whole time, since it's consistent with other terms of the kind, as I explained earlier. It isn't my fault you were using a different one, without explaining yourself. Frankly, it seems like your definition of the word is constantly shifting, since to have a constant one would make it impossible to support your argument.

First of all, the definition you started using is in no way shape or form the ""default"" or ""correct"" definition. Second, I explained over and over and over again what I meant. I repeated it in nearly every single comment. How many times must you have read my explanation that the characters were ""blank"", ""non-affiliated"", ""their race is NA""? How many times have I said that the whole purpose was to allow the reader to fill in any race they'd like? You're lying through your teeth trying to back track about purposefully using a different definition of a-racial to attack straw men. I have been perfectly consistent in my argument and my use of the word a-racial. It is not my fault that you are absolutely abysmal at gathering contextual information.

&gt;Clarify for me then - have you decided to discard your faulty position that the drawings of the characters are evidence against them having a race?

That is **not** my position. You are attacking a position that is not mine. That is why it is a straw man fallacy. The position you are currently attacking is that the characters can't have any race at all, and that the drawings support this, which is **not** a position I have ever held.

My position is and always has been that the drawings of the characters are evidence against them having a **canonical** race. If they had a **canonical** race then a reader would not be able to fill in their own choice of race. I never once said that the characters can not have a race. I have, in fact, said exactly the opposite of that. I have said that the characters can have **any** race. There is **no** race the characters can't have. I have said this over and over and over again. In order to achieve this there can not be a single ""correct"" race, canonically their race must be NA they must be non-affiliated, blank, like a coloring book. 

&gt;Or do you hold that we can fill them in however we like, which is contradictory to that?

Yes. As I have said about a million times now, you can fill them in however you'd like. In order to be able to fill them in however you'd like, no race is supplied by the comic. The characters are a-racial in the comic, i.e. they **do not** have a race in the comic, so that one can be supplied by the reader.

&gt;To me, you still seem to be saying that the pictures allow us to fill them in as we like.. because they are evidence that we can't fill them in however we like.

Not even a little bit. I can't make this simpler, it just isn't that difficult. The comic gives them no race because that's the reader's job. Canonically there is no race so that the readers can choose any for their head canon. The pictures allow us to fill them in as we like because they are evidence that the comic doesn't do it for us. 

To quote Hussie again ""So much of HS and Sburb is designed with EXTREME flexibility in mind. It’s designed to have your imagination fill in gaps, and expand the universe far beyond the boundaries of what happens in the story."" Inside the boundaries of the story the characters have no race. Their race is left blank, non-affiliated, NA, so that your imagination can fill in the gaps. ","1359677439"

"airsoft","t5_2qi2x","&gt;Why not? Fuck cost, it's the best piston made.

Because I can get two Lonex Red pistons for the price of that one, with a similar design, from a brand that I trust and that is still producing parts. Or, six ZCl 14t pistons, which I have also had great experiences with.

&gt;You sure on the TPA of a JG Red? a JG Blue is rated at 18k RPM, and the JG red at 23K RPM, only a 27% speed increase. I was under the impression that JG blues had a TPA of 28. (Chaoli armatures that people make franken torques out of have 32 TPA, right?) Changing the TPA to 16 should result in a WAY bigger speed increase than 27%. 

I haven't checked myself, but my friend has and that is what he told me. A quick google confirms it. The JG Blue is 22TPA IIRC. Chaolis are 32, like you said.

I don't trust manufacturer RPM ratings, even if they are correct they have very little bearing on real world use. 

&gt;SS'ing normally also causes problems for anyone who doesn't know what they are doing, and it can reduce the structural integrity of the piston overall, just like AOE correction can.

SSing is super easy and safe if you have a full metal tooth piston, I don't see why someone wouldn't anyway these days. AoE correction between the piston and PH is old-school and not recommended. Sorbo, my man!

&gt;MOSFET's aren't necessary unless I want a fancy feature, like precocking, burst, or something else built it. Just 1 more part to fail. As long as you run no bottle necks in your electrical chain, you should have no issue other than dirty contacts and brushes, which happens on ANY setup.

While I agree that MOSFETs aren't necessary, they are one of the most cost-effective and generally effective upgrades you can add to your system. The trigger switch, no matter how clean it is, will act as a bottleneck. It's only $15 bucks, why not?

&gt;TL;DR, I flew in the face of every conventional piece of tech wisdom spewed on the internet, and my AEG works perfectly fine with a compression that is near unexplainable. You mad?

Also, culture is difficult to define, and I think trying to do so misses the point. What I'm trying to communicate I guess can best be summed up as racial 'privilege' (eek I know that isn't Reddit-friendly), i.e. the concept that whites growing up in a white-dominant society are generally entitled to certain socio-economic and especially psychological privileges that non-whites don't. The concept of privilege is the reasoning behind programs like affirmative action and race-adjusted college admissions (I won't say whether I'm in favor or opposed to these programs for now though, since that's a whole other issue). It is also the reason why whites should be extra-sensitive when making ethnic jokes where non-whites don't need to worry so much.

I know if you're not acquainted with the concept of privilege, especially as a white person, it can be very hard to see the extent to which our culture holds whites in higher esteem than anyone else, but know that it is a very complicated issue. There is lots of additional reasoning and nuance behind seemingly overbearing statements like ""whites shouldn't make ethnic jokes,"" so I encourage you if you're interested to look into the concept further and not dismiss little apothegms like that as overzealous or radical.","1359677446"

The problem is that sometimes a customer is wrong and it's worth while to the business to lose them as a customer rather than trying to appease them.  That's the case here.  Applebees tried to appease a customer who not only violated the trust of the restaurant (you pay for services rendered.  Unless the service is bad, you pay the expected tip, if service is excellent you pay more) but was snotty and disrespectful about it.  In siding with the Pastor (who was obviously in the wrong) over their own employee, Applebees has painted themselves as a place that accepts and encourages customers to cheat their employees, and drove away a great many more paying customers.  

It was the ultimate penny wise, pound foolish thing to do.  Because most people connect more with the employee, who is working hard and getting nothing for it, than with a bunch of corporate types who only care about profits.

How's that?  Why would it be implausible for God to only violate free will in special cases?

&gt; And by the definition of omniscience and omnipotence, that literally defines God as knowing everything (including peoples' choices) and then making them knowing that that was what he was doing.

Depends a lot on how you define omnscience and omnipotence themselves.  For instance, one could say omniscience is ""only knowledge of knowable propositions"" and as such God might not know with certainty what a free agent will do (since such a thing may be impossible), but can still make a reasonable prediction about it.

For instance, God might not know for certain what Pontius Pilate will choose, but God may know that in his situation Pontius Pilate will almost undoubtedly choose to crucify Jesus less he provokes the angry crowd in the same way that I may not know if you choose to drink ammonia on a daily basis, but given the consequences of choosing to do so, I'd be safe in betting that you don't.","1359677448"

The mower hits the nest, and the nest was on top of an ant-hill or something. But somehow the baby rabbits are covered in PISSED ants.

We just kept picking them off and gettin bit and stung, cause they were literally covered. Every time we handled the rabbits the ants would crawl on us, and sting and bite. So we would have to set them down to tend to our wounds. We didnt do that much.


We tried to drown the ants in warm water keeping the head above water. But it didnt work so well. Someone had the idea of using the vaccum cleaner to suck the ants off. One got sucked in on accident. 

We freaked out.

It ended up having a broken leg and who knows what kind of internal issues(bleeding bruising if any) it had. It eventually died. The other 2 or 3, after picking all the ants off, lasted about 4 or 5 days of trying to nurse them.","1359677449"

I've got some gear in my studio that's the polar opposite.  Just getting it near the signal chain fucks shit up, haha.

The day will eventually come when a plugin, or series of plugins are made to ""replace"" a big 2"", real tube gear, and consoles with beautiful preamps, eq, and dynamics.

I remember using a plugin something like 10 years ago (I think it was called Mic Modeler) where you selected the mic you were recording with, and then a mic to model  57-&gt;87, shit like that.  

Combine that with some 192k fancypants A/D, an emulated channel strip (Waves SSL 9k series channel strips for instance, I actually rather like using those), and then the holy grail of VST plugs, something that really honestly sounds like an 1176, or distressor or something.

Ignoring the obvious work flow differences or try to replace the experience with a huge control surface or something.

I get this horrible burning in my stomach and utter emotional discomfort, and I can't help it, because I can't view what's happening superficially, like ""Oh, cool, rape scene."" What made this even harder to deal with was that it seemed like EVERY OTHER MOVIE I watched had a rape/assault scene, and it seriously made me go WTF. 

Empathy...it's important. These days it seems like the attitude is ""What's the big deal? It's just a joke."" or ""You're overreacting."" But what is the alternative? To sit on in silence, to take everything as a total joke, not to be critical thinker or consider the power of words? ","1359677449"

On the day of his death he went into work and left a handwritten will leaving the clinic to the workers, drove out to his wife's grave to put some flowers on it, went back home, took a combination of pills he had and died listening to an old record which was still playing when his body was found.  My husband was the one that discovered him after him not reporting to work for over a week.  

The note on his desk pretty much described the horror of what he saw in being one of the hundreds of doctors immediately after WWII who had to document all the atrocities for the war crime proceedings going on.  He worked in China, so he was one of the people that got to deal with the Imperial armies last brutal campaign as they were retreating.

&gt; Yes, two of them, at the very end of the summer transfer window. They were never replaced, and we're in 6th place as a result.

I thought we were discussing *this* window.

&gt;Actually there was an enormous amount of chatter that we finally had enough of a bank balance to make the signings that would improve the squad, and Arsene has signed in January before (Reyes, Arshavin)

Yes, talk, but by media outlets trying to get readers.  What did Arsene say that was any different from any other transfer window.  And yes we have signed big players in the past, but also nothings.  Last January we bought Eisfeld, this January, a 26 year old Spanish international.

&gt;Being in the Europa League disbars you from a certain class of player, as Arsene knows every well. Great players want CL football.

This is the one real caveat to all this.  But again, we have a youthful squad, who are almost all capable of improving with age and more Premier League experience.

&gt;Ha. What possible reason do we have to believe we'll play this way consistently?

Ok, I got you here. It's not a crime to be socially awkward but talking in this way and spending time on a one player game or reddit isn't going to help. You want to get laid? You don't have to be a jock or popular or charismatic by any means. What you have to do is get away from the screens. Start by associating with awkward chicks. They exist and they want to get laid just as much as you. They are socially awkward as well so you won't find them at the party your don't want to be at for the same reasons you don't want to be there. But, and here is the silver lining, they do want to party in small groups off dedicated friends. Your job is to get into those groups. 

Second, stop worrying about getting laid and you will get laid. I promise. Sex is like air, it only matters if you don't get enough. So stop worrying about it. Go outside, and hang out with your buddies. Get buddies that do something, anything publicly. Even sitting around playing multiplayer games will help you be better socialized. But sitting playing single player games will not. Not in the slightest. 

Third, party a little. Say kegers  aren't your thing. Ok, no problem, a quiet party with a couple friends works just fine. In fact this can be a lot less distracting. Start soliciting non threatening females. Have a friend whom you never see because he is tied up with his girlfriend? Invite him and her over to a small get together, tell her to bring friends, stir up some Jell-O shots, profit. Now you are hosting the small get togethers you need to break into. Arrange a weekly get together. A buddy of mine would do this once a week for South Park episodes. Rerun this week? No problem, more talking and drinking. 

The answer is you need to get socialized. Being socialized with other guys is a first step. Being socialized with any chicks, even ones whom you are not attracted to helps better. 

I'm sorry this isn't in proper format and you can downvote me for it, but seriously it's not that hard. Source, I've been getting laid since I was 15 and I'm a pretty big dork. Always have been. ","1359677459"

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","The approximate cost in material for an large format colour print would be around 10$, to get it printed at a print shop it will likely cost you around 30$ - 60$, depending on the print shop etc.

If you do it as a digital print (4 tabloid sheets of paper, or 6 letter size sheets) you are looking at a total material cost of ~1$. And it will cost you about 5-10$ to get it printed at a print shop (again depending on the exact location).

If you have the printer at home and it just sits there - you might as well print out a few of these / month, just to keep the ink heads in use.

If you have a decent digital printer - you can split it into letter sized sheets, throw them into page protectors, and use a dry erase marker to make on the fly notes (the players break down a door, or they find a trap), without perminantly marking up the page (so that if they revisit the location in 6-8 months (in game time), you can make slight alterations depending on the inhabitants).

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Kormir's biggest problem, IMO, is that most of her positive traits are informed.  We see other characters with high respect for her, and we can find out that she has a history of being well-regarded, but this doesn't enter enough into the storyline itself because once the player character enters the picture, the story has them taking on most of the leadership.  I always thought the fact that she was the one who helped touch off Nightfall to be kind of cool, because it was a very human thing for her to do; she seems in a lot of ways to be characterized as sort of a scholarly type and her biggest mistake was letting her curiosity get the better of her.  Overall I thought she was very compelling because she starts out as the ""mentor"" archetype and later becomes a character who loses everything and has to question everything.  I really like the Six, but the moment that cemented my affection for Kormir was when she was told the gods had given all the help they were going to.  Not knowing what she'd been ""gifted,"" and faced with the possibility that the entities she'd worshiped all her life had just given her a brush-off in the face of arguably the worst threat humanity had faced to that point, she basically said, ""Fuck them, then, let's go kill this asshole god anyway.""

I also like Trahearne and Logan.  But it takes a lot to make me dislike a character.  They typically have to be really vile and/or super gratingly obnoxious.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","I like the idea of scheduling regular ""let's talk"" times and getting into the habit of them. Eventually, maybe your communications are so good that you don't need them anymore, but I've never gotten there - and my communications with my main partner and most of my other partners is excellent. So, better to have it on the calendar and not have much to talk about than to not have it on the calendar. 

What you're talking about in terms of the fears holding you all back from communicating are very common. Pretty much *everybody* fears that. ""If I bring this out into the open and we talk about it, something bad will happen"" - the end of the relationship, or a partner will get mad, or something will occur that somehow changes the relationship as you currently experience it. Except that you're already experiencing fears and doubts and frustrations, right? Even if these things turn out to be huge, deal-breaker relationship-ending things - isn't it better, if you think about it, to *know* those things are out there and be able to act on them? It's not as though those deal-breaking things aren't already there; you're not going to create them by talking about them. You're just going to bring them out into the open where you can all examine them together and decide how important they are, and how to fix them.

As to your mom - the important part for you, I think, based on what you've said, is not that the decision to not tell her anything is necessarily the wrong choice. It's simply that you weren't allowed to *make* the choice. ","1359677464"

Didn't add a hard drive as you didn't in your initial post, if you need one I'd recommend the WD 1tb Blue as very reliable and efficient. Don't buy a cheap sound card, it will make no difference compared to the on-board one. 2 modules of memory will run faster than just one. The power supply you chose is quite dodgy, go with a Corsair one, or alternatively a Seasonic made one (but those are more expensive). I upgraded the gpu as the 6870 is one generation behind and this way you'll see much better performance gains in games. Lastly, I chose a G860 as that's firepower enough to carry a 7870 XT as well as do well in games. There's still room left in your budget and whether or not you want to upgrade to an i3 or i5 is up to you, though I wouldn't suggest the i5 unless you actually need the extra cores, else you can pocket the money.

Mentioning what you want to do with the computer (as in, what games you'll play, what programs you run, how many tabs you have open at one time etc.) would help, as well as what your monitor resolution is. That and also your expectations (how long do you want to keep the computer, what upgrades would you be open to over time, what performance in games would you like-or, not mind- etc).","1359677465"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","My definition would be; sexual contact without prior consent - including times when consent is unable to be given (black out drunk, drugged, or under age of consent). I consider rape an umbrella term, underneath would fall sexual assault, sexual exploitation and molestation. Again - it bothers me when people argue over word definitions when (a lot - but not all - of the time) victims of sexual crimes all experience similar pain, feelings and pervasive symptoms. Obviously some crimes are 'worse' than others - and this is why I believe that all cases of rape should be treated on a case-by-case nature. However, I have no intention of hurting a victim further and de-valuing his/her pain or situation by arguing that his/her assault doesn't classify as 'rape' (generally deemed - assault with penetration.)

As for my sources, you'd have to find your own online (so sorry, but I am strapped for time). All the information I have was given to me during sensitivity training for a volunteer program I took part in that I am not entirely at liberty to speak about (it's very private). The part I can talk about involved going into the local school systems and talking about sexual exploitation, we handed out information  about how to stay safe and how to obtain consent. The front of most of the programs fliers had the 1/3 statistic on it, with a disclaimer that the majority of rapes go un-reported, especially when the victim is male or a minor. My presumption is that a non-profit organization specializing in  sexual education and abuse prevention services would have correct facts, and therefor I feel comfortable using them. Almost all of what I know and believe, was learned through personal experience, and my various non-profit work. 

Edit: MY apologies for using the female pronoun when talking about rape victims. I hate met and worked with various male victims and in no way want to devalue their experiences either.","1359677467"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It's not about ""working hard,"" it's about limited resources.  Because of the difficult logistics of serving them all at the same time (instead of staggered as with several smaller tables) A server attending to a table of 20 *cannot* handle as many other tables at the same time--that work will need to be reassigned to other workers.  And it's not just the server--the cooks, busboys, and other staff also have a harder time servicing a table of 20 than several smaller ones.  It effectively increases the amount of manpower required to operate to serve large parties as opposed to small ones, basically increasing costs.  Putting that extra strain on the restaurant apparently makes things about 18% more difficult to handle, so they charge you for that.  If you're not up for it, you're free to walk out.

The extra charge for that service is mandatory and listed in advance.  If you don't want to pay it, don't eat out at restaurants that include it.  You don't have a ""right"" to take the service you want and then simply refuse to pay the listed cost--you have only the right to take your custom elsewhere.","1359677470"

If your savvy with your pentatonic scale, you will always have that trick in your arsenal. Now the second lick is also simple, as the chord I'm playing it over is a moveable shape, and where ever you drag it you will be able to enjoy the same result. The third lick... It's an A chord shape shifted up to the 9th fret, any major bar chord rooted from the A string can be accompanied with a phrase like the one demonstrated.

You almost have no other option to be honest. If Obama lets these guys do that without a huge push back he doesn't just look weak and take dems with him, he sets a precedent for what rouge nations can get away with. NK better hope the missile doesn't get anywhere near the US. 

While it's a nice thought that NK thinks this will strength their people moral, they also must know that their people's moral won't be so high with US air raids going on night and day and our navy parked outside their country. Certainly China is going to side with the US as well and it's not as if China has some massive military anyway. 

We already let them get away with this once. If they detonate a real nuke in our direction I think a war will be coming, maybe not immediately since they are not a real threat at this point, but that action is quite likely to seal their nations fake.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; My view is that it describes a worldview in which Christ is divine. So you at least know where I stand on that point. I'd also like to point out that throughout history, an overwhelming majority of people who describe themselves as ""Christian"" also believe in the divinity of Christ. 

Yes, the majority of people calling themselves Christians have believed in the divinity of Christ. But if we take it in that sense, it becomes meaningful to say that Christ was not a Christian. Instead of having a dispute over what true Christianity is, we now have a dispute over whether Christianity is true and over whether Jesus ever believed it. Instead of going away, the dispute just takes on a different form.


&gt;&gt; As a non-Christian, I am rather inclined to believe that there is no true Christianity, and there are no true Christians.

&gt; Funny. As a Christian I would say exactly the same about atheism and atheists.

But you couldn't say it on the same grounds. I am saying that the existence of true Christianity and true Christians depend upon the existence of a real person identified as Christ. Atheism does not depend upon the existence of any particular person in the same way. An atheist is just someone who disagrees with theism.

Numbers on the stopwatch don't lie. The pictures of me beating them in the hurdles and races leaves everyone confused. Just by a little bit I was always ahead of the black runners and captains. I dealt with a lot of racism from those bitches in the locker room, not exactly fun. I would get shoved, and sometimes the runners from the other team would be behind me at the starting line and say ""Uh, excuse me. whites go behind us, in the BACK."" It goes in order from the fastest people first to the slowest last, even though my times were faster than them so I should be ahead.

Apparently college scouts don't care though. If you look fast then clearly you are fast, even though those fraction of a seconds I was faster is the difference between first and second place. Now I'm struggling through college, in a college that doesn't even have a track team.

Please provide a source for your assertion (as it is a big one and I am genuinely interested in checking this fact), if you don't have a source, i expect my driveway to be shoveled tomorrow morning :P

2) Having the time is not a relevant argument. You have the time to write back on forth on reddit (so do i for that matter), does that obgligate us to run afterschool programs?

I think your example makes a point about tactics and whether or not they are ""good form"". If someone is a coach they have made a commitment, but they are allowed to stop being coaches if they choose, and their stopping to be a coach does not prevent someone else from taking up that mantle. its not well regarded generally, but it is acceptable. 

The fact that you have volunteered in the past does not obligate future volunteering. I think it is worth pointing out that your example ignores that the ""volunteers"" in the teacher case are initially coerced into their volunteer positions which is very much a mitigating factor.

3) I agree if it is part of their contracts (need a source for that one). 

I would say the province does a shit job as a whole of setting children as a top priority. If it isnt part of their contract I think placing that blame squarely on teachers (placing the mantle of responsibility as well) is a cop out. If as a province we think afterschool programs are important (and there are many positive effects of them), we should be willing to pay for them and that might mean paying higher taxes or diverting funds from another social program. I know people hate to hear higher taxes, but asking teachers to extended their responsibilities without appropriately compensating them is irresponsible and increasing debts is going to hurt those very kids you are trying to help out.

As for access to guns for the poor, a properly designed program would take the money collected and use it to subsidize the reduction of the lower income tax brackets, increase the earned income tax credit, or something of that nature that would benefit the less well-to-do. 

&gt; But I shouldn't be forced to pay a tax that pays for the damage criminals cause. 
Homeowners insurance rates can go up if you have an aggressive species of dog as a pet. Even if you train them and raise them correctly, the insurance company will still charge you for that risk. Is it because you're a bad guy, or because there's an inherent risk with those breeds? I guess if we as a nation start having tens of thousands of deaths each year caused by dogs we should consider that as well. 

All that being said, I'm still making up my mind on the subject. I don't like the idea of a corporation profiting from the exercise of our second amendment rights.","1359677483"

There was also, however, a significant industrial change. The quality of Japanese equipment deteriorated significantly throughout the war. Compare the machine work on a pre-war Arisaka rifle to a ""last-ditch"" one made during the closing months of the war (I wish I had my rifle with me to take some pictures). The buttplate is made of wood and is nailed on, the machining is rough and crude, it lacks complex rear sights, a cleaning rod, and a monopod (all of which were standard pre-war), and the bolt would probably fail any tolerance test. The same principle applied to other pieces of equipment such as bayonets. [Pre/Early War example](http://i.imgur.com/nJeyBzw.jpg) vs. [Last-Ditch example](http://i.imgur.com/grn9RCa.jpg).

Further, and again against my better judgement, I will add that in the last sequence of *Metroid: Zero Mission*, Samus is stripped of her powersuit and subsequently forced into a stealth-type segment of the game in order to retrieve it. Finally, I will at last listen to the nagging voice in my ear and refrain from mentioning [*Metroid: Other M*](/spoiler), which I never played but, I'll intuit, inspired your post in the first place.

Another thing: If you smoke weed, you do not automatically become a lazy, unmotivated piece of shit.  I am very much a professional, working my way up much quicker than those I graduated with.  I smoke when I get home every night with my fiance.  I have a lot of anxiety and while I could live without it, it's much nicer to actually be able to unwind at 8pm instead of 1am when my body becomes too tired.  He has opened my mind about the functionality that can be accessed while smoking.

We are going to become dads soon-ish (probably within the next 3-5 years) and we have a discussion about it all the time.  I'm still not sure where I stand on the situation, probably will not smoke while my child is an infant (due to them being incredibly tiny and that's scary) but it definitely lets you be okay with expressing your inner child.","1359677495"

"programmingforever","t5_2w5fo"," Yes, it makes sense now. Could become a pretty big deal someday. If you want to be really convincing about the benefits of this project someday, you should explain why it's important compilers be easy to write.

 Here's an explanation of the reasoning that I leads me to believe this advice is important:

 If people want to do great things, they're usually going to have get other people to do something, like buy a product, help out on a project, etc. And if you're getting other people to do something, you need to sell people on the idea. People don't care about stuff just because; they need a reason to care about it, and that isn't always obvious.

 For instance, people don't care about that ukelele they never use, or that book sitting about the house they have, or that feature in their text editor they don't use. Sure, they could use it, and they may even say that they like it, but it's not making their life better in any way. So, you make it clear to them the reason to care about it, or that reason to use it, in a manner where that reason is compelling enough to get people to buy the vision of the maker, and invest a bit of energy into making that vision work.

I only mentioned this because I'm already inclined to help out because of my own vision, the one that caused me to create this subreddit. This subreddit's not a huge deal even for me, which is why I haven't taken that advice to heart with this subreddit, but this project seems to be such a big deal for you. Wish you luck.

I can't think of a good reason why WvW kills are in the monthly.  I assume they want to get people into WvW with it, but really you just get a bunch of PvP noobs like myself running around for hours only caring about tagging enemies in hopes of getting a kill credit.  This doesn't exactly help a server win...

Personally, I'd like to see nothing in the monthly that requires dungeons and WvW until we have a system where there are 6 monthlies but I only need to complete 4. Then I can, for example, decide to run one of WvW, fractals, or dungeons to finish off the meta-achievement.","1359677498"

I am glad your child has a good support and that you are contributing financially. If you were looking for reinforcement that you did the right thing, I think you did. Children deserve to be with a family that wants and loves them and if you think you couldn't provide that kind of environment for your child, then its better for everyone involved that you not be an active parent. You are definitely not broken and I think there are many people out there who are pressured into parenthood or don't realize they have other options.

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

Yes that pastor brought shame on himself and his congregation by being such an ingrate as to go out to a meal with a large party and be waited on cheerfully by a young woman making minimum wage or possibly even less (depending on the state) and leave no gratuity whatsoever, not even 5%, but the shame of taking away someone's livelihood is a hundred times greater.  You should be embarassed and ashamed when you are served my another person and you give them absolutely nothing and if you are made to feel a little bit more ashamed, that is only fair and just.  I was recently fired for an attempt to get around the 'no solicitation of tips' rule at my work when a coworker failed to include salad dressing with a woman's order.  She called the store irate because she hadn't been given a couple ounces of salad dressing (nor had she taken a couple of seconds to confirm that it was there before she left the premises and drove 3 miles to her home). My manager requested that I take her a ration of salad dressing and I agreed because she was upset and we try to make our customers happy, not because I felt it was my responsibility and I was asked not ordered to perform this service.  I drove to her home, outside our normal delivery area, using time that I could have delivered two orders to tipping customers out of the goodness of my heart, trying my best to keep a customer happy, and as she was closing the door in my face I stood on her step and smiled, which caused her to fly into an even greater rage than before, saying that she wasn't going to tip me because she hadn't done anything wrong and the mistake was mine when I had not even been in the store at the time her order was made.  I blurted out that I had driven outside our usual delivery area to bring her some salad dressing before I could think since I'm not used to being yelled at when performing a service for someone else, and as she continued to scream at me I walked away.  She called the store several times over the next few days and eventually succeeded in getting me fired for delivering a salad dressing cup to her doorstep (highly unusual practice only for favored/unreasonably upset customers) outside our delivery area (almost unheard of) and then standing on her step for a couple of seconds longer than she was comfortable with, possibly making her feel a little bit small and mean for making such ridiculous demands of minimum wage workers when she could easily have looked in the bag before leaving the store.  It should be enough simply to not tip someone, if you feel the need to get someone fired because you did not want to follow societal norms and provide a gratuity for a service, you are beyond a bad person, you are a menace to the livelihood of thousands of professional waitstaff who go far out of their way every year to service your petty desires and to anyone who has ever gone so far as to try to get someone fired over something like you being made to feel a tiny bit of shame for not tipping, you make me sick and I hope that you lose your job and home and maybe have to take a service industry job and then I hope no one ever tips you.","1359677507"

In an effort to provide free public access to JSTOR, he broke into computer networks at M.I.T. by means that included gaining entry to a utility closet on campus and leaving a laptop that signed into the university network under a false account, federal officials said.

At that very moment, a somersaulting Harbaugh comes flying through the air and impales himself on Ray's antlers. A rush of sadness ebbs through the crowd as the dying Jim froths his last froth, and a single tear flows down Stag Lewis' cheek. While  the stunned crowd is gathering itself, Chris Kluwe trots up on a chariot and hitches its reigns onto Stag Lewis. He gathers Jim into his arms and returns to his chariot as Stag Lewis takes off into the night with the chariot in tow, never to be seen again.

It just takes on a mask closer to a superiority complex becoming more and more generic ""men are better than women."" Reddit agrees sexism is a bad thing. 

""Man up"" on the other hand is something that is not said exclusive in an ironic or satirical way. When people say, ""man up"" to someone it is there weakest attempt at tough love.

This way Goth Annie would be available to everyone who owns the collectors pack champs already for a lower price and it would be half the price for people who own half of the champions in the pack.

---
Edit:

You could say Goth Annie is worth 975 RP, so the rest of the package is worth 2925 RP. If we see the runes as a Gift, you pay 2925 RP for the 20 champs = 195 RP for one Champ.
When you own 12 of the champs, you get the pack for 8 * 195 RP + 975 RP = 2535 RP

You get 1380 RP in the pack. For every already owned champ you'll get 1380 RP/20 less RP. So with 12 champs owned you get 8 * 69 RP =  552 RP.

This way you could get only Annie for 975 RP but if you don't have all the champs, you have to pay for them but will receive RP for it. The runes are still in the pack, so you get a little bonus for only buying the skin.","1359677527"

1 in 4 women have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner while 1 in 7 men experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner.""

You also mention the greater likelihood of women to abuse/neglect children without acknowledging the incredible proportion of single mothers (approximately 50% of children born last year were born to single mothers) which plays an enormous role in such statistics. That's a lot of dads neglecting their kids too.

This is not to say that men facing domestic abuse, children facing abuse from women, or men being wrongly accused for crimes are not important issues, but you guys need to stop with hyperbole if you want to be taken seriously.

The advantages that most men get to enjoy are far greater than those that most women enjoy. YES, there are important cases where men have been wronged by women in privileged positions but let's not use those as smokescreens to obscure the very large numbers of women being wronged by men.

It just received a buff to farming infantry too, now as HEAT does 25% extra damage v tanks with 0 reduction to infantry farming ability.

I want to see the VS max as useful at the NC max, etc.  I feel that Mags will be pretty much outclassed in terms of MBT v MBT and flexibility, and you'll see less people pulling them.

&gt;I personally would have liked to see the front armor of Magriders nerfed a bit considering VS have significantly less risk to their side and rear armor compared to TR/NC but I will certainly accept the maneuverability nerf and see how that plays out.

The Sun is hot. Feel free to get into the science of it, the reasons, the whys, the hows, compare it to other stars, etc., but you can't require that I produce anything beyond my simple production of ""The Sun is hot"".

If your betta is aggressive he could be stressed out by those bright colored decorations. Does he 'flare' at them, opening up his fins and swimming around it? If so, it should be removed.

If those plants are plastic(They look like silk to me), they can, in some cases, tear the fins of your fish. Silk is preferable, but its not like your fish will immediately be hurt by plastic plants. Just, gradually replace them if you feel like it, if they are plastic. I cant tell, but in this picture they look silk.

Marbles aren't the best substrate but its not that bad.

OP, I would highly suggest you also pick up a [blade sampler pack](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&amp;field-keywords=blade+sampler+pack) for your boyfriend.  Different brands of blades can make a huge difference in shave quality and different people will favor different brands.  I myself prefer Gillette Super Platinums but other people will love Astra, Derby, Feathers, etc.  Your boyfriend should try one blade of each brand until he finds one that feels sharp and doesn't irritate his skin (this will also depend on his developing skill in wielding a DE safety razor) and then stick with that brand until he feels completely comfortable wetshaving and then he can try other blade brands or experiment with a new soap or brush or whatever.

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","A GSR 190 was actually my first bass, and I did in fact modify it quite like how you're thinking of doing it. After I bought a few more basses I found my first bass collecting dust in my closet so I figured I'll changed it up a bit. I only used the Jazz style pickups so I took out the P-bass and swapped out the Jazz pickup for a Quarter-Pounder. I also de-fretted it, stained the fingerboard and swapped out the bridge with a badass. 

One thing I don't recommend doing is fixing up the body. The body's paint is almost like a plastic coating and not very paint like, it's obnoxious to take off to begin with. Then to seal it (I guess) there's also a strange red stain all over the entire bass, which is even more annoying to take off and the body (mine at least) was three pieces, so staining it wouldn't look too great and rather plain due to the wood's lack of figure.

Once you've used an apple product you can just tell the difference between something that has all the little final touches in place, and something that is targeted at the 'but specs!' crowd. 

I didn't really get into android enough to identify specific things missing, because the first couple things had already failed so I stopped digging. For specifics, my first android experience was my daughter's htc wildfire. 

First the texting built into it was crap and would fail if too many messages were stored - looked into it and it was a known issue and there were a bunch of replacement apps for texting available. This just seemed weird to me since texting is texting - I need one app that works, not a choice of dozens where I don't know wtf the difference is and have to trust random reviews and hope one works. The solution was to delete enough texts that it would work again, which of course locked up her phone completely for hours if she forgot to delete a conversation before it got too large. Just usability problem after usability problem.

Then it decided to tell her the camera was not available, the pictures already on the phone was not available, and her music was not available. All because it was 'full'. It had an 8GB microsd card I put in it, with not even half a gig used. Turns out android had crap memory management and if the phone's built-in memory was getting full, it couldn't even see that the SD card exists. Ridiculous. More troubleshooting and now I'm moving where programs are stored, changing settings etc... just to get it working for a couple weeks at a time until it flakes out again. We finally figured out the surest way to get it running was to clear the facebook app's memory. Small downside (sign in again) but it cleared all the other crap that kept building up as part of that app. 

After that I really had no interest in exploring android further, because even if it grew hands and jerked me off it wouldn't be enough to redeem itself. The moving wallpapers were cool though.","1359677553"

The majority of people in the USA *are* overweight - in fact, a LARGE majority - it's not even close. Even in Canada and the UK, which are generally considered ""not as bad"" as the US, the majority of people are still overweight though there is still a significant difference between them.

Your statistic for ""overweight"" is probably more accurate for the current amount of people in the US who are OBESE. According to the World Health Organization, 74.1% of all Americans in 2007 were overweight (and obesity problems have only increased since then). It would not be a stretch to say that 3/4 Americans, at least, are overweight. I believe the obesity rate is estimated somewhere around 36%. This means that in the USA, you have approximately 225 million fatties, of which 108 million are ultra-fatties.

In comparison, in the UK around 60% of people are overweight - so there are a lot of fatties everywhere, not just in the US, but it is clearly worst in the US. Canada is comparable to the UK with around 58% of people being overweight.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Any time I use another forum, I'm reminded how much they suck and how good Reddit's threading and rating system is.  I think it's the key to Reddit's success and should be copied like crazy in all other forums.

The good/relevant information goes to the top, which is great, yeah.  But the real key is that tangential discussions get their own mini-thread.  It lets those discussions happen without interfering with each other.  For an analogy, imagine each main post as a room.  If everybody in that room is trying to talk over each other, it just leads to confusion, which is what you see on Battle.net and every other traditional forum structure.  But, by threading, you effectively let everybody create and rank their own mini-rooms.  Any time you reply, you create a new room where you and anybody else can talk without having to yell over everybody else.

In retrospect, it's so obviously-superior that I'm surprised other forums haven't taken the hint yet.  This format is the best way yet to facilitate large online discussions.  This format is the future.","1359677555"

I started a trial account yesterday, and I decided to chill in highsec and do the tutorial missions for a few days, learn the game, get some skills, and I plan to go into lowsec this weekend and play for real. So far, I've noticed two things

1. Holy FUCK the tutorial missions are boring, even for an MMO. There's a mission that's literally 'deliver this thing to somewhere else far away' which translates to ""set destination, turn on auto-pilot, alt-tab to porn for 20 minutes""

2. There have been no indications about what kind of game this is. If I didn't know about EVE going in, the first time a player killed me would've been a surprise. 

So you probably end up not only with whiners, but people who never get attacked leaving early because they think the game is lame and the only reason people like it is the community and I already have a guild in WoW and etc.

If there are going to be safe zones, there need to be big flashing orange neon lights going ""Abandon hope all ye who enter"" at the end of them. ","1359677559"

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","You have no idea how tired I am of having this conversation with Americans who believe these words have very narrow specific meanings.

You are not referring to democracy, which is quite a broad term, you are probably alluding to athenian-style 'true democracy' or 'absolute democracy'. You are a 'representative democracy', in that you have representatives, and you vote for them. Democracy merely refers to the fact that you vote for something. It does not imply that you vote for everything. We have a Queen, yet we're a democracy, because we have a parliament and we vote for our representatives.

You're probably also referring to the existance of the electoral college, which indeed muddies things, but doesn't change what I said abobe. You might also be referring to the fact that you have a presidential bi-cameral democratic republic, as opposed to the parliamentary democracy we have (which you might be believing is what one should term a 'democracy').

'Republic' and 'Democracy' are not mutually exclusive terms, indeed by their nature a Republic pretty much has to be a democracy, but not the other way around.

Your view on this is coloured by political bullshit in the USA. People, especially people who rant on TV and radio, like to redefine these terms to ""prove"" what the founding fathers intended the USA to be. Indeed, one of the issues arises from the fact that when they wrote the supporting documentation for the constitution, they often used the term ""democracy"" to mean a specific form of democracy, but that is not what the term actually means.","1359677560"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;You have to understand that what you're saying is that distributors are entitled to what they project

If they're losing money because they were overly optimistic on their projections, that's their fault. If they're losing it because half the people using the product decided not to pay for it, it's not. Are they supposed to just ""live with piracy"" and invest less in their product? Do you not see how that is fundamentally bound to reduce quality?

&gt;Hammer sharing is allowed, car sharing is allowed, book sharing is allowed, mass experience of media is allowed (even if not everyone pays), etc. You have the burden of proof to defend the proposal that we as a society ought to codify a monopoly on copying works. As I said elsewhere, the (US) founding fathers nearly all considered monopolies evil, especially unnatural ones, but the debate is over whether or not they are a necessary or useful evil. I find it curious that you seem to be unwilling to recognize the true debate.

You don't copy a hammer, a car or a book. You *share* them. File sharing is not ""sharing"" because every party still has a personal copy of the property. There is a fundamental difference between allowing someone to preview a product, and copying the product for millions of people to obtain without any compensation for the producer.

What monopoly are you referring to, and by whom is it held? I have yet to see one corporation in control of all media on any format. The founding fathers were not around in the era of file sharing, so we have no idea what they would say on this matter. I also fail to see how the founding fathers being for or against anything is supposed to help your argument.

&gt;copying you does not deprive you of anything

&gt;You must know that. Copyright infringement has literally been likened to murder, child porn, and child abduction

I'm aware that there are an army of nutjobs who will resort to anything to get their point across. It doesn't make their actual stance any less valid.

Look, this is getting long so I'm going to wrap it up, but I'm not against file sharing in principle. It's a great idea that will hopefully develop into a way for producers (excluding industry moguls and other middlemen) to get their product to people more efficiently, less expensively, and with a greater profit to the creators themselves. That said, it needs work, and at this point in time, it seems to hurt not only the greedy execs but the artists themselves. The whole system needs an overhaul before file sharing will benefit those who deserve it.","1359677563"

I also tested my pills back then. I think you are confused. Amphetamine is methylphenethylamine, the cheapest and most simple of the amphetamines. MDMA is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine.

My approach is this: Since the lack of belief in any gods isn't a good topic to talk about (since there isn't much to add), the subreddit turned away from atheism to antitheism. So the posting behavior would be more justified under that name. Of course, intelligent antitheism has nothing to do with the things described in the video.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","ECM + Below Radar means even a skilled chopper duo doesn't stand a chance against a skilled jet pilot, assuming the jet pilot is also accurate with the main cannon. The pilot won't be able to fire a single heat seeker on the jet (barring any external factors, such as another jet with heat seekers or stinger trying to take out the same target), and the chopper gunner can't do enough damage to the jet in the 1-2 second window when the jet is in reasonable firing range. Whenever I'm flying a chopper, I find it much more effective to fly relatively low and/or around and between obstacles in an effort to make the jet crash, as attempting to take out a skilled jet pilot in the chopper in a straight up fight is suicide, no matter how good you are.

Of course, this is just generally speaking (and I'm also on console, so I'm sure our experiences in this respect differ quite a bit, to be fair). I'm sure a chopper gunner who is a natural with the TV missile will probably make jets *much* less frustrating, but that is exceedingly rare.","1359677574"

It's not the best game I've played, but it's the best game I've played that every single person I know has NEVER even heard of.

Since you could have more than one animal following you, having certain ones in combination gave you different bonuses (Flaming thrown sword, triple movement speed, etc) that you would use to solve puzzles in interesting ways or to help you beat hard monsters/bosses.  That was the main quirk, but it had all the elements of a successful Action-RPG there.

I picked Java simply because it's my best language, but using Swing components in the interface has some pretty significant drawbacks, not to mention that applets seem to be going obsolete pretty quickly. I'm hoping to redo the front end in HTML5 eventually. Java seems fine for the logic though.

There's two ways for arguments to persist. One is to use the desktop application to save your map as a .db8 file. The other is a kind of hack-ish way that codes the whole thing into the URL, which makes it super long. You can always use a url-shortener for that though, like this:

[http://tinyurl.com/bxtadwc](http://tinyurl.com/bxtadwc)

That link should load a simple argument map I just made. Haven't tested all browsers, I hear IE doesn't like massive URL's. If that works fine, you should be able to make changes, and then click ""save"" to be forwarded to the new URL, which you can link back to someone. A debate using this system in it's current form would have to take the form of a message board like reddit where people paste URL's back and forth to each other.

"Bioshock","t5_2shl2","A good trailer, in my opinion, tells a story.  It introduces the universe, builds up tension, and has a brief release.  Games tend to show off [escalating levels of gameplay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERe3wZdIAtc), while (good) movies show off [escalating levels of a story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GokKUqLcvD8).  The trailer definitively fits more into the latter, while retaining a healthy demonstration of gameplay.

On top of that, it uses a very movie like structure and presentation: opening logo presentation; ""must come down"" titles; doesn't really emphasize player being Booker; uses a lot of movie camera angles; song is clearly trailer music; production values, specifically voice acting, is very much on-par with well producted movies.

Compare with [Mass Effect 2's launch trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlk3w13JHM4), [Battlefield 3's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7GVSx7yMaA), and a [L4D TV spot](http://store.steampowered.com/video/500/5139).  All four are game trailers.  City in the Sky and ME2 clearly emphasise story over everything else.  BF3 shows off some story, it clearly emphasizes the game part.  L4D and BL2 skip the story almost entirely for gameplay.

""Batman faces the biggest threat he's seen, and it may finally push to far"" vs ""this is a story of two fishes out of water in a mysterious city in the clouds tearing itself a part"" vs ""this is a story about a space marine building a team and saving the galaxy"" vs ""this is a Marine fighting against a terrorist threat, but you totally get to play as Marine and blow lots of shit up and did I mention you get to blow shit up?"" vs ""you get to kill lots of stuff, and can do so with three friends!"" vs ""previous, but with zombies!""

(Also for the record, it's not that I any of the trailers I linked to, or any of the games for that matter.  BF3 does get points off for pretending to be something it's not - I swear half the single player campaigns are made these days just to create content for the trailers.)","1359677581"

Why is it socially unacceptable for one to rank other people into categories like ""superior/inferior/equal"" in an objective way with no prejudice. 

For instance, Asimov said ""I'm the second most intelligent person I know"" and if this were to be his objective, personal opinion on the ranking of people by intelligence (according to his definition of intelligence), why is that a faux-pas, degraded by the notion of arrogance?

I'm not talking about being conceited, that's another thing. I'm talking about how seeing things in a hierarchic structure usually tends to be categorized and dismissed as arrogance.

Stephen Hawking could say ""I'm one of the most intelligent men in the planet"" and that would sound horrible but half the world says it and not only is it ok, it's accounted as utterly truthful.","1359677584"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","About what's bad about ""artificial"", I feel a comparison of something like apple juice to actual apples is pretty enlightening about why people get fat without feeling they eat too much. A glass of apple juice has the sugar of about two or three apples, if I remember right. You can probably drink several glasses throughout the day without feeling that this is strange. If you would drink glasses of pure water instead of the juice, and ate actual apples, you would have to eat a lot of apples in that day for the same amount of sugar.

Something like eating a dozen apples sounds ridiculous, but that same amount of sugar is perfectly possible to consume through eating cake, chocolate, drinking juice, soda, etc. Additionally, I personally feel, I get addicted to a sweet taste in all food, if I eat too much sweetened food. For example when cooking, the tomato soup tastes like it needs a spoonful of sugar, and the curry can't be sweet enough. It takes a few weeks to get away from that after stopping with the sweets.","1359677590"

No, I think this is incorrect. It does not mirror my own observations. 

&gt;Does the hacking player's level compared to the portal's level matter? For example, a L7 hacking a L5 portal gets L6-7 gear, but a L4 player hacking that same L5 portal gets L4-5 gear.

Yes, the level matters a bit. But only in so far, as the player level is below the portal level.

"postprocessing","t5_2smai","Lightroom provides you with all the options Camera RAW would, and more.  It also provides you with an image library so you can easily mess around with a photograph, say nah fuck it, this sucks, and hit the next arrow to go to the next image in your library in an instant.

**Other cool shit:**

You can compare photos side by side at the click of a button, which comes in handy when you are wanting to see if picture A is more in focus than picture B.  You can also do this to show you before and after of an edit.

In Camera Raw, you have to go back and re-open it from Bridge or the folder or whatever.

Creating ""actions"" is significantly more efficient in Lightroom than it is in Photoshop.  You'll notice to create an action, you have to go through the action first.  If you screw up along the way, sometimes it won't work, or sometimes you will get error messages saying something about how ""Layer 1 is not present"" mumbojumbo.  With Lightroom, you can save anything you do to any image just by clicking a button,  You can also use the check boxes say, for instance, if you want to save the action but NOT the temperature adjusting part.  Hopefully that makes sense.

It's also just way fucking quicker than Photoshop, which I find to be excruciatingly slow depending.

Don't get me wrong - Photoshop still can do some outrageous things Lightroom cannot, but when it comes to general edits in RAW, I stick to Lightroom completely for speed, efficiency, etc.","1359677591"

Are your 5 days a week ""typical bodybuilder"" type workouts with 1 body part or 2 body parts per day? If so, I would change that to different body parts or pairs of body parts on the same day.

If not, I would use more weight and less reps on most of your exercises. You can combine a heavy set of 6 reps followed by a lighter set of 12 reps, and even another lighter of 14 reps. (strip set)

If that doesn't work; try supersetting (assuming you don't already).

The Congress simply seems decent to supposedly liberals because they pander specifically to minorities such as the Muslim and Christian communities who the liberals see as being oppressed by the Hindu majority.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Anecdote:  I got to be pretty close with my German teacher in high school.  He was born and raised in Germany, and has lived in the US since he was about 30 (he's probably in his 60s now, never told us anything reasonably believable about how old he was).  Once I asked him if he had ever used his foreignness as a way to wiggle out of a sticky situation and he said he only had once.

At the time, he had been living in the US for probably about 10 years, and had become fluent in English years before he moved out of Germany.  He claimed to be going way over the speed limit on I-95, and got pulled over.  When the officer came up to his window, he didn't speak a word of English.  He just rambled on in German and eventually started repeating ""fünfundneunzig"" (""ninety-five"") and pointing to the I-95 sign.

The cop bought it, and thought it was hilarious.  He pointed to the real speed limit sign, and drove away.  No ticket or anything.

TL;DR if you're on a highway whose number is higher than the speed limit, point at the sign and say the number repeatedly in another language.","1359677596"

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

"RandomActsOfPolish","t5_2ukje","First off, I want to say I am very, very sorry for all your losses. How devastating. However, I hardly doubt your friends would want you living this way, they'd want you to be happy and healthy. And you're trying, I know you are. But look at what you wrote, instead of the memories bringing you happy thoughts, they're still crippling you. We all go through stages of grief, but it seems like you had a lot in a short amount of time and you're still dealing with that, as best as you can. But, maybe it's time to look into a counselor. 

I, too, find it extremely difficult to have a ""bad"" day or to talk to anyone. I'm a fixer, I'm not a downer. But, I went through a period of my life where I was so deep in a hole I couldn't even see the light. I would wake up in the morning and my despair was a cement blanket. I had no feelings, I was numb. A shell. That's not how life is supposed to be, I knew I needed help. 

My first few counseling sessions I just went and pretended I was normal, everything was ok. It wasn't, I knew it wasn't, and she knew it wasn't. The next few times I spent the entire hour crying. Literally, heaving sobs where I had snot dripping down my face. I had a lot build up. The next few times touched on areas that felt like a live wire to my heart. It was uncomfortable, and a situation I hadn't even been in before.

You know what? The next few times after that, I started to feel better. The cement blanket was getting lighter and lighter everyday. I started to actually laugh, instead of pretend. I showed emotions. I felt 'real'. There are free or pay as much as you can counselors all over. Some of them are religious orientated, some are not. Point is, you're NOT fixing this on your own, and you know that. It's time to get help, and there is nothing wrong with that.

You are an amazing, kind, wonderful person. I'm here to share your burden, in whatever form I can. You don't have to be alone anymore.","1359677602"

"JusticePorn","t5_2sokh","**Tl:dr: My company will bend over to please someone in the wrong, punish you for a stranger's ^^^(strangers?) mistakes, attempt to fire you for theirs, and then forget to pay you for the pleasure.**

My biggest gripe with my company is the shady payroll ethics. They're always, *accidentally*, forgetting an hour or two here or there. I have yet to meet a guard who has not lost some hours. I'm currently missing 11 1/2 hours, which they assured me they would correct. Last week. And the week before. And the week before that. I've already been to the Labour Board, I have no issues going again. 

Beyond that, my Scheduling Manager absolutely *hates* me because he's such a moronic fuck-up. This man can call you personally everyday of the week, send you a dozen e-mails detailing your 40 hour workweek, and then forget to pay you for it. Did I mention he's also the guy who forgot my 11 1/2 hours?

The man yells at clients, berated me (because I asked where the boss was when he wasn't present for a meeting he cancelled one of my shifts for). He hates me because I made him look like an idiot one time infront of the DM. Called a bullshit meeting to gloat/punish me. Ended up with him getting chewed out, and me getting 8 hours for a 1hr meeting.

And just to specify, I'm nothing like the guy in these videos. I'm a defuser, I lower the tension in situations. I never back down, but I don't have to shout to get my point through. At the meetings I sat quietly, let them make their cases (they always paused expecting me to interject, I'd tell them to continue), and then concisely make my point, generally with legal documents.

Edit: Extra blurb, sorry for the length :/

I trained a girl two weeks ago. She was let go from her post at [COMPANY] because someone made a complaint against her, after 2 years at that site. How bullshit was the complaint? The person who complained was a [COMPANY] Supervisor for [B] Division, but kept telling her to call [C] Division, saying her matter relating to [B] wasn't the supervisors problem. The girl called [C], repeated what the Supervisor said and was told, basically 'that lady is wrong, call her back'. She did, the Super still refused to take responsibility, and then complained to our company because the matter 'stressed' her out. ","1359677604"

1a) Possibly true but irrelevant to this discussion.

2 &amp; 3) I looked up ""harassment"" at Wikipedia and the topic seems very complicated; without doing a ton of research on the topic, I can tell you that it appears that most harassment law concerns things like harassment of employees by employers &amp; coworkers, harassment of students by teachers and fellow students; harassment of citizens by police, etc., in other words, situations where the victim is a sort of captive audience and can't escape the harassment. In other words, it's not harassment if you can simply walk away from it with no consequences. Since, as far as I know, no one is bothering the ""pastor"" at her home or workplace, I don't think this fits the definition of ""harassment.""

Furthermore, if this IS harassment, then practically everyone whose name gets printed in the paper for having done something dishonorable is a victim of harassment.","1359677603"

We are charged whether she goes or not, whether there's a holiday, whether they are closed for meetings, which is at least one Friday every two or three months. There are up to twenty kids in her class. At the moment, I think it's around fifteen. 

Our preschool charges on an income-based sliding scale; there are parents there who pay upwards of $400 per week, maybe more.

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's a fine political argument that you could have meaningful discussion about. But saying that the Tea Party is ""racist in nature"" is just wrong. It is based purely on misinformation and/or misunderstanding.

People use the States Rights argument to claim that supporters of States Rights want slavery or racist laws or whatever but that's also silly. States Rights are why slavery was abolished in the North! If States Rights didn't exist then slavery could have been a national institution instead of a state or regional one. It's also why there are things like states where medical marijuana is legal, or even regulated prostitution. I have never heard anyone say that they want States Rights because they want to enact racist laws. In fact, more often, the entire point is that they want to be subject to less laws.

It's completely unrealistic to imagine blatantly racist laws coming to pass in the modern US. The backlash would be unprecedented. Whites are a majority but only a small minority of whites are racists, let alone racist enough to support racist laws. Furthermore, the states most associated with racism (the south, however unfairly this is) also have the highest populations of blacks.

The problem with the Civil Rights Act is that it infringes on our right to property. You have a right to refuse anyone entry into your home. Why? Because it's a fundamental right of your property ownership. It's part of what it means to be sovereign, and individual sovereignty is the goal of the liberty movement. The same should also apply to privately owned businesses. Yes racist business owners will refuse entry to minorities. But whites who are against racism would never frequent such a place. That business would get utterly destroyed. Competing businesses would use these racist practices against them. And even if the racist business *did* succeed, the only people that would go there would be racists themselves. And isn't there something positive to be said for having all of the racists away from everyone else?

The reason why people want the government broken up and distributed is because smaller governments have less power to rule over your life, and if you don't like the way they do things, it's easier to escape their control. It's much easier to leave Kentucky than it is to leave the United States. It's easier still to leave your town.

Much of Paul's criticisms have more to do with the fact that the existence of certain government agencies is unconstitutional, not simply that he doesn't like them. If the US government made a constitutional amendment to authorize the creation of the FAA (like the constitution authorizes the creation of the army and navy) then there's nothing Paul could say about it. But currently the FAA (among other agencies) operate outside the scope of government authorized by the constitution.

Hopefully you can see that the things you've decided you're against are much more nuanced than you seem to think they are. The arguments take more time and effort to understand than /r/politics or much of the media is willing to give them. It's far easier to just say the Tea Party is racist than to actually address their arguments. Don't you think it's mysteriously convenient such a horrible ""scarlet letter"" type of indefensible accusation is made instead of reasoned counterargument? If people think something or someone is racist then they won't even listen to them.","1359677609"

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","A little further analysis.  Your mana regen works according to this equation:

    Mana Regeneration =  1.05 * (Base Mana) * ( 1 + Mp ) * ( 1 + Rp + Ir ) / 60

Where base mana is a function of level, intelligence, and additional mana from items, Mp is additional mana percentage from passives, Rp is additional mana regeneration percentage from passives and Ir is additional mana regeneration percentage from items.

We're going to hold base mana constant for the moment to analyze how max mana passives and mana regen passives interact.

If you think of choosing between additonal maximum mana percentage and additional mana regeneration percentage in your passive tree as a production-possibility frontier, you can conclude that the optimal solution will likely be where

    ( 1 + Mp ) ~= ( 1 + Rp + Ir )

Or, in English, where your bonus max mana percentage from passives is (approximately) equal to your bonus mana regen percentage ***plus*** your bonus mana regen percentage from items.

The shape of the production-possibility frontier will vary from class to class and build to build based on what mana and mana regen nodes are available, but the general idea is that by selecting additional max mana you can take less additional mana regen, and vice versa.

tl;dr If you have a ton of bonus max mana already, take the mana regen nodes for a little more optimization.  If you have a ton of mana regen nodes already, take more max mana nodes.  It's important to note that you can itemize *only for mana regen in this tradeoff*, so if you have good items you can neglect taking additional mana regen and instead just take as much max mana as possible.

I understand why this is offensive to women, but as a guy, it's equally bad to feel like your gender identity is at question when you don't perpetually act like the portrait of a stoic, self-reliant, confident, male.  

Never having had a girlfriend, having had sex once, living at home at 21, and feeling like crying when I'm depressed shouldn't make me feel like less of a person, but they do. They make me feel like the worst kind of person.

My only working car door froze shut the other day, and the first thought in my head wasn't 

""You need to open this to drive your car,"" 

it was; 

""If you don't open this you're a bitch. If you ask for help, you're a failure as a man.""

The AOE Amumu was quite popular during mid Season 2 due to Azingy's AP Amumu in the jungle and could see how it would work middle, but feel that it would be too easy to zone him out due to not having any way to farm when being zoned (Fiddle has his E atleast).  Twitch would be interesting to play, but feel that he a bit too squishy and some champions will be able to 100-0 him as soon as they hit 6 since stealth takes up to 3 seconds to kick in if you are taking damage.

So what I've done in my formula is look for instances of ""St."", ""Ave."",""Street"", or ""Avenue"".  If it counts more than one instance of these it will return a True and could help to identify problem rows. Then I would add a quick filter.  Very short term solution, but it might help you out.  

    =OR((SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,""St."","""")))&gt;LEN(""St."")),(SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,""Ave."","""")))&gt;LEN(""Ave."")),(SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,""Street"","""")))&gt;LEN(""Street"")),(SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,""Avenue"","""")))&gt;LEN(""Avenue"")))

I am assuming the address is in cell A1.  If this does work and you want to add another string, simply add another comma before the last right parenthetic and add a new string within a sumproduct formula:

    (SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,""New String"","""")))&gt;LEN(""New String""))

It's not every year.  It's more like every 3 years, with the exception of the last two games because they were developed and released together, but on different consoles.  Also, they've only released one NSMB game per console.

Madden, on the other hand, has released 6 games on the PS3, 8 on the 360, 7 on the Wii, 5 on the DS, 7 on the PSP, 6 on the GBA, 6 on the GB/C, 8 on the Xbox, and 12 on the PS2.  And they've already got one on the Wii U, 3DS, and Vita.  I can appreciate exaggeration, but your comparison is completely unfair.

New Super Mario Bros is becoming a staple of Nintendo consoles, much like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros, and possibly even Mario &amp; Sonic Olympic Games.

I also drew stick figures, lots of stick figures that were doing something, such as whipping other stick figures to demonstrate a form of power. Or laying on a couch, talking to another stick figure about ""expertise"" power. 

At this point, I mainly use mind-mapping to further ideas, not to capture them as much because as a grad student it's not about memorizing a bunch of facts.

For one thing, reducing the range would almost certainly be a very simple fix for Valve, and they've certainly heard the complaints about the Mini-Sentry by now. 

Secondly, notice that you get 28 metal from a Mini-Sentry's metal gibs. That's about half what you get from a normal Sentry's, but why *exactly* 28 rather than 30? Suppose that the Mini-Sentry cost 130 to build, like a normal Sentry. Then if an Engie started on full metal, dropped a mini, then picked up the metal gibs when it was destroyed, he would have 128 metal - not quite enough to build a second mini (unless he got more metal from elsewhere of course). It's as if Valve was planning a weaker mini, with a reduced range and a 130 metal cost, then changed their minds at the last minute, re-buffing the Mini-Sentry without fixing things like the visible 3D sphere.

I love making love, and I could make love to the woman I end up loving for the rest of my life. I don't get what's so bad about monogamy and not cheating.

I'd be happy entering a relationship at 19 and ending it with a smile when my time comes. I know i'm sappy, but I wonder if there isn't a girl out there who feels the same way from a young age. So far I have my doubts... I haven't met anyone who feels the same way.

"intj","t5_2qowo","I smoke entirely too much weed to try and remember a big list of small tasks, so I write them down straight away either on my phone or (if I'm at work) a small whiteboard. TBH I think that's a good idea regardless

I accomplish the task by having a clear idea of what I need to do before I start. At the very least I'll know what I need to check to get a better idea of what to do.  

For tedious tasks, I'll think on it for a while to see if there's any better or alternate route which would achieve the same goal.   
If there is I'll switch to that and do it happily, knowing I would have otherwise been tied up longer for the same result. Dunno, that makes me happy for some reason.  
If it's not possible, then I'll try to get myself in a headspace where I can just block out everything else except the repetitive actions I need to finish the job. It's funny how fast time goes then

I don't know if that IS the best way to get things done, but it's the best way I've discovered as of yet. I never liked to-be-completed-by-*x*-time methodologies, simply because the completion times are arbitrarily chosen. Actual deadlines with valid reason for establishing said deadline I can follow/meet, but not for no reason whatsoever.

"editors","t5_2qpkc","200gb sounds like not too much, especially for a docu (they tend to have the 'keep it rolling!' attitude). I've done a few docus, my approach (FCP, Avid) was usually to divide the material into bins by date and persons\location. Then I'd watch the whole thing, FFing on visuals and making subclips on interviews that sound important.

Next, subclips go into sub-bin of whoever was talking, just to keep things neat. Next step (I'm working sort of old school) is to get the important talk typed and printed, and make a paper cut of the narrative. This becomes sort of a script. Each piece of paper has subclip name and TC I\O on it. These papers move around until the director feel it is sort of right. Now I have a script, glue the pieces on a sheet of paper. Make a rough cut (everything is labeled so it's easy to find). Watch, recut, repeat. When the structure is ready, cover it up with visuals. Done. (hehe, easier said than done)

I wouldn't change to FCPX just for the collections and surely not in the beginning of a new project. What you can do, if you really feel the need for some more organizing, you can get a 30 day trial of CatDV, an excellent video catalog application.","1359677631"

I personally think that Riot would at least try this and run the numbers.

What they want to do is be able to sell at least some of the exclusive skins but only in limited quantities to preserve their exclusivity. This accomplishes that pretty well IMO.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Firstly I think I need to clarify something.  In my opinion there are 2 categories of self-published.  The 1st group is those authors that just aren't good enough to be properly (this is the wrong word but I'm not sure what the right word is) published so they self-publish.  The 2nd group is those authors (like you*) that have been properly published but have now chosen to self publish some/all books.  

To me the whole self-published category has been dominated by the 1st group and, while I admire their effort and enthusiasm, they're the ones I was complaining about in my 1st post.  The 2nd group is growing though and I think that's good for everyone (except the publishers!) and generally I have no problem with this group as long as the same level of effort is put in.  I'm sure unscrupulous authors could self-publish to trade on their name without putting the effort in but that would be a very short-sighted move.  

Unfortunately I'm not sure the signal to noise ratio is really raised by the Top Rated Lists for me.  Probably mostly because my opinions don't seem to match 95% of Amazon reviewers.  Then there's the peculiarity of the fantasy genre that means there are very few stand alone books, everything has to be a trilogy or even longer and, unlike with films, in general reviews for the sequels are higher because the people that didn't like the 1st book have already been culled and all that's left are apparently rabid fans.  This possibly explains Brent Weeks being number 3 on that list you linked (unless it's a monumental improvement from the 1st book and his Night Angel stuff).  And then there is friends and family writing amazing reviews for obviously rubbish books (j/k).

As an aside, that list you linked to was for ""historical fantasy"".  Now historical fantasy seems a bit of a silly name to me but even going along with it, I'm struggling to work out how The Blinding Knife could possibly fit into it.

*I'm afraid I've not read any of your books, I have considered the Riyria books on occasion but for some reason not taken the plunge yet.  However I've just seen your awesome moustache on your Amazon page which means I probably need to buy it.  Then if you're lucky you'll get a 3 star review that sounds like a 1 star review which means I loved it.

Her name is Ellie and she has got to be the most supportive, encouraging, and understanding person who I've ever come across in my years of education. She took time put of her busy schedule to help me, she'd check up on me, give me extensions on deadlines when I was feeling so overwhelmed, she really was the most wonderful person I could've ever asked for to teach me. She told me that one of the reasons she wouldn't give up on me was because she could see my passion for what I was studying, and that she thought I was such a lovely person and deserved to get my diploma. This really helped a lot - she didn't feel like just a teacher, but a really encouraging friend. I made sure that she knew how much she affected me and thanked her for everything before I left college after achieving my National Diploma, but unfortunately all I had was her college email address and she now teaches at a different college so I don't know how to contact her, but I really hope she remembers what a huge impact she had on me and I hope she can help many other people how she helped me. :)","1359677640"

"science","t5_mouw","When you were doing your research, did you also happen across the records of orphanages?  Many births were fairly undocumented and I believe I read just a couple years ago that researchers had come into ownership of a large number of records of childrens homes and charities that helped unwed mothers and they were shocked at how many children were abandoned and such shortly after WWII.  I know that recently it has come to light, also, that the Catholic church had been taking in hundreds of thousands of children in Spain and very, very few of them ever survived.  

Many people confuse the repressive culture that people espoused in public with what happened in private.  As far as I have learned from my reading, no cultures in history anywhere have ever been as sexually inactive as western and westernized cultures have become since the 1990s.  Whereas various cultures in the past talked a good game, and kept sex out of the public eye, cultural development since the Industrial Revolution up until the present has been a progressive destruction of sex and removal of sex from peoples lives.  Prior to the Industrial Revolution, practically everyone (except the very small upper class) didn't even have private bedrooms.  Families slept, and screwed, in common rooms.  When someone got pregnant, people got married, and a new family was started.  The Industrial Revolution and societies acceptance of factory owners desire to pay adolescents so little that they could not raise a family on it provided the motivation to the lower classes to start on a long quest to destroy at least adolescent sexuality.  The measures they took were drastic and we still live with many of them today even though we now have effective birth control that makes most all of their concerns irrelevant.","1359677641"

“A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.

*The review suggests possible benefits of an upright birthing position, with the possibility of an increased risk of blood loss greater than 500 ml. The authors conclude that this finding should be regarded as tentative until better data become available. In the meantime women should be encouraged to adopt birthing positions they find most comfortable.*

Your last links says much the same thing. Also

All of what I have read about fat cells up until this point is in agreeance with the idea that fat cells remain in number, except in the case of liposuction (which carries a high risk of mortality).

In short, cravings are based on a multitude of things: blood sugar level and insulin resistance; the amount of dietary fibre you are receiving in your meals; to a larger extent than you might think, habitual eating.

Habit forming and subsequent positive self-talk is one of your strongest tools in the fight against cravings. It is also free and requires the least physical effort! Each time you make a healthy nutritional choice, give yourself a mental pat on the back. If you don't feel like any less of a person, maybe put a tally up on the front of your fridge of how many days since you last fell off the wagon.

Blood sugar level and dietary fibre follow along with healthy nutritional choices, insulin resistance can be brought under control with resistance training (at home workout with no equipment required, here: http://www.workoutbox.com/workouts/home-workouts/rookie/bodyweight-circuit-or-warm-up-routine/)

Consider that they each have a reputation for not only daring acts of bravery and precision, but they are performing at their own peak abilities. For Spartans, that peak is much higher -- for the ODSTs, it's the natural edge of human capability.

Should I berate ODSTs for not being Spartans? Should I berate the Spartans for having power-assisted armor? I don't think so in either case.

To address the ODST personality, that's probably the normal human reaction to being faced with the threat of death so constantly; you do your best to brush it aside. The Spartans (IIs and IIIs, at least) are the odd ones out: only several of them deal with that herculean stress in a healthy manner, the rest either bottle it up or never even approach the thought. Like John, most see themselves as tools (a means to an end), and that selflessness is badass in itself. That contrasts with the IVs, who view themselves as individual humans first (as they grew up and were socialized), and Spartan volunteers second, which comes across as professional bravado mixed with egotistical pride.

**Analogy time**

To me it's like saying a PFC in the Army is less badass than a ParaRescue from the Air Force. Assuming both see combat and behave according to their training, their personal experiences of courage at the limit of their abilities should each be respected.

I would do the following, see if there's an equivalent option on the market (i'm assuming that since they're restriced options they don't trade openly in the market) and from there you will be able to determing an aproximate value for your ""award"".

You can do some customizing along the lines of cake topper, small favors, centerpieces, etc., as well as customizing the ceremony from some of the options they give you, or you can do things like write in your own vows and what not. 

It fit my husband and I's personalities perfectly of just wanting to focus on ourselves and our day, and not all the extra things going into ""traditional"" weddings like table linens, themes, etc. We just wanted something nice and simple and it was great! And of course we took our honeymoon cruise that day! Also, she could bring her family/friends on the cruise with her if she wanted and it would be like a 7 day wedding party.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Death ends the self.

Then wouldn't an action which causes your self to end be, by definition, a selfless act? You are performing an action even though you know it will result in your death. You have placed *something* (a person, object, idea, or otherwise) above yourself in terms of importance.

I believe *that's* the idea. You don't, personally, get a benefit from picking up some litter on the ground. Sure, you might feel a little better, but why does that detract from the action? You could also feel better by looking at the trash, shrugging, and thinking, ""Well, at least **I** don't litter like some other filthy people.""

When you say there are no selfless actions, you are making an objective statement. But you judge each action according to the individual's desires (subjectively). It doesn't make sense. If somebody truly acted in a way that's selfless, you would simply respond, ""Sorry, you did it because you wanted something else. It wasn't selfless."" You've made a decision and you'll simply mold all of the information to fit that view.

Personally, I don't really know if a person can act selflessly. I'd like to think so, but I try to be a realist. But if the information isn't verifiable or falsifiable in some way (or, in other words, objective/scientific), then it seems silly to take a hard stance on these issues. I feel similarly about atheism/religion, free will/determinism, and morality. Even if one answer *is* correct, we can't really know (which is kinda what makes it so fun to discuss, no?).

&gt;Even the philosophical buddhist who tries to overcome his idea of the ""self"" is doing so to avoid suffering.

What if the end of suffering is merely a consequence? I say the Buddhist is trying to understand the true nature of reality. You say he's trying to escape from suffering. How can we determine who is correct?","1359677666"

"gunpolitics","t5_2sumr","Right. In this case, they simply did not want to admit that most people can get a firearm from another person easily. They were thinking, if people didn't buy from gun stores, the only other alternative is gun shows, completely ignoring the person to person sale. (Which the bill will do little to stop in the case of criminal activity) I mean, as a registered owner, (bought from a gun store) if I ever wanted to commit a crime (Which I never would) I would NOT commit the crime with my registered and paid for through a gun store weapon. I would buy another gun from somebody I met through friends or acquaintances. This simple fact blows their argument on regulation at the point of sale useless. Another argument they were trying to use, was that the person that shot that Senator killed a kid on the 13th or 14th shot, they claimed that if magazines were limited to 10, the kid would still be alive! You can't use data that way, it just doesn't work. You can't take a sample size of ONE and claim that your experiment represents the population. I was reading the other day that a farmer fell off his tractor and died, apparently (based on my sample size of one) all tractors kill farmers, we should ban tractors. I would need to see a statistical analysis of every crime committed, and at which round in the magazine each person was struck, then we could perform analysis on this data, then I'd need to put that into a visual graph to understand overall, how many times someone was injured or killed within rounds 11 through 100. Maybe then we could talk. I know most people would fall into rounds 1 to 10 though, it just makes sense. (Round #1 typically being the lethal round in most cases) You can't say because one person was killed with round 12, that we need to limit all to 10 rounds. They talk about interrupting the shooter. That doesn't do anything. I can change a magazine in under three seconds. The Columbine case should be proof enough that magazine capacity has no correlation to the amount of death some crazy off balance person can deal out if they really want to.(Especially if the most lethal round is #1) The professor that was sitting on the Senate hearing knows what's up. They would ask him a question, and he would always try to take it into academics, ""Well, Senator, you can't really measure outcomes in a system that way, it doesn't make sense, you have to measure data through. . "". ""Professor, please just answer the question!"", the Senator would remark knowing that the short answer was 'Yes' but how one arrived at the answer changed the entire context of the question. It was laughable how many times he got interrupted when all he was trying to do was spread a little intelligence on the hearings. ""Professor, do tractors kill people, because I have a case in front of me where that happened?"" ""Well, Senator, you can't really say because it happened that one time, that it. .

I got to the club, and the bouncer notices the fake right away. Usually, no big deal, it's happened before, and he's likely used to it by now. But it seemed like he was a special kind of pissed off that night, because he ended up calling the cops, who came and charged me with forgery. I live in Denmark, so this meant a $750 USD (approximately when converting) fine, and 30 days in prison.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I find your intellectual arrogance pathetic.

Rather than debate my theory on its merits, you attack my education, and make a bunch of sweeping statements about what I supposedly know and don't know. Furthermore, you claim my argument is based on emotion rather than reason, without showing in any way how my logic is flawed, while I did my best to explain rationally, my position, extending to you, on good faith, the respect of a fellow rational debater. 

&gt; If you are going to ignore the more in depth science and use sentences like ""Furthermore, neuroplasticity firmly proves that the brain does have the capability to lay down new neuronal pathways throughout life, just that it may get harder as you get older, but not impossible. "" There is just no room for discussion. You are set in your ways and no amount of debate is going to move you.

[From a relatively well-sourced Wikipedia article on the subject:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)

&gt; Neuroplasticity (from neural - pertaining to the nerves and/or brain and plastic - moldable or changeable in structure), also known as brain plasticity, refers to changes in neural pathways and synapses which are due to changes in behavior, environment and neural processes, as well as changes resulting from bodily injury.[1] Neuroplasticity has replaced the formerly-held position that the brain is a physiologically static organ, and explores how - and in which ways - the brain changes throughout life.

So explain to me how what I said was a misstatement?

&gt; Again, maybe once you are less emotionally attached to this idea or have taken more than Econ 101 and and an Intro to Cognitive Psychology course things can get more interesting, but until then, if you are only going to use vague arguments picked up in an article you read somewhere and then filtered via confirmation bias, we are done here.

Yay more intellectual elitism and *ad hominem*. You know what *ad homimem* means right? It's a way of circumventing logical argument by attacking the source of an idea (me) rather than the idea itself. And yet you claim my ideas are emotionally based and unjustified by logic and reason. 

You fucking hypocrite. This poor excuse of a response you presented has far more invective and emotional ranting in it than anything I've said, and yet you claim the right to sneer at me and give a blanket dismissal of my ideas.

Anytime Jack and Liz have interaction, it's brilliant. Jenna and Tracy are definitely the weakest links, with Tracy's humor being the most predictable, forced and uncharismatic. It's not always laugh out loud funny the way sitcoms are, but I think it's a very smart comedy. Seasons 1-3 being the obvious best of the series. 

I read or saw somewhere that Tracy doesn't memorize his lines, and people on set find it endearing and funny. I don't. I would have fired his ass years ago for being such an undisciplined, mechanical actor. You can tell any time he's talking how forced his lines are and how much he has to concentrate on saying them. For whatever reason though Tina Fey loves him. I've talked to many people and they either love him or hate him. I hate him.

You expected something to happen, and so it did.  That's what the placebo effect **is**.

Try wearing a series of those bracelets, maybe 20, where only one is real, and the rest are fakes.  Have someone else not in the room be the only one who knows which one is real.  After wearing all 20, try to guess which one was real, and then compare notes with the person who actually knows.

Natural monopolies *tend* to exist via state granted use of land.  That is the big issue with utilities today.  If you look to Europe they have actually more competition in a sense and better ISPs.  I say in a sense because what they really have done is say the existing infrastructure is on government land (up to the phone poles on any land isn't actually yours) thus all companies have to grant use with compensation.  Actually that isn't a bad model, but an alternative is saying you can multiple lines run the same places.  For congestion reasons the socialized model isn't half bad here, but you can dig in the lines if it became a real concern.  If such a competition existed it would probably push itself to the European model anyway.

Andre Santos is playing out of position (he's more of a winger than a left back) and gambles too much on challenges and is not good at spotting runs that come in from the wing. He does make a decent play every so often but it is immediately overlooked because of how poorly he plays afterwards. Our midfielders are not the best covering defensively either. I miss Alex Song.

If healthcare costs don't go down, we're going to have to pay higher taxes to care for the elderly, or we're going to have to provide less care (and send them into perhaps a costlier private system).  Scarborough's answer is to stop providing care *now*. It's actually a pretty stupid argument, esp. considering the fact that trying to ""fix"" it *now* actually hurts the economy enough to make the problem worse (and Joe will never even acknowledge that argument).

I'm actually *very* hopeful that Vermont starts a trend in the next few decades, and many or most of our states end up with a Canadian-style single payer system (for the record, Canada changed province-by-province in exactly this fashion). That alone would make this issue go *poof*.","1359677680"

Now the second lick is also simple, as the chord I'm playing it over is a moveable shape, and where ever you drag it you will be able to enjoy the same result. The third lick... It's an A chord shape shifted up to the 9th fret, any major bar chord rooted from the A string can be accompanied with a phrase like the one demonstrated. Now, there is no such thing as a lesson that doesn't have universal application, as the guitar holds the golden rule,"" what works one place, works everyplace"". Last thing, an arpeggio is the division of a single chord, so by definition, they won't be one size fits all, each arp you learn will be for a specific type of chord, but can still be transposed simply by changing the fret you started on, as you do with your scales.","1359677683"

The low gearing, however, means the bike can accelerate quickly on flat terrain. And they never feel like you're riding through Jello.

...and?

What relevance does this have? Virtually nobody, no matter what angle they come at the PoE from, believe omnipotence implies an ability to do the logically impossible. Why bother continuing to assert something no-one is denying?

An omnipotent being, if they also desired to end all suffering, could still end all suffering, because ending suffering is a purely physical problem - if you could break the laws of physics at will, you could end all suffering.

This thread and those below it will list various awards we would like to have recognize for our conferences. Below are some suggestions.

* Best Conference: Conference with the best teams the ""SEC"" of our alignment as it were.

* Best Basketball Conference: Just because I think the AVC has this on lockdown.

* Best Academic Conference: Make our arguments using whatever criteria makes our schools look best.

* Most Geographical Sense Conference/Worst Geographic Conference: Debate on whether regional or national is the best way to go.

* Best Media Deal Conference: This goes to who we think would be able to sign the biggest media deal and drown the rest of college football in cash.

* Most Pretentious Conference/Cockiest Conference/Worst Fanbase Conference: No matter how good this conference is, their supporters are complete jerks!

* Best Rivalry Conference: Which conference maintains the best rivalry games in college sports.

* Best Deal/Worst Deal: Which teams were grossly overpaid/got for a steal.

You guys add more if you can think of any.","1359677700"

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt;If we had the medical knowledge to marginalize the rate of defects and complications in such early births I'd be far more comfortable with it, but we do not.

This is a completely valid position to hold and something that never actually occurred to me. I knew late term abortions were rare and didn't really have an issue with that, but never thought to consider why they're rare. If the risk of an abortion failing and causing a baby to be born with brain damage is too high then the abortion shouldn't be performed, I completely agree with you there. (This should also address your third paragraph)

&gt;Perhaps this made sense in your head, but I can't glean anything from this. A fetus can be called a lot of things. It can be a parasite, an unborn child, an organism, a person, a gift from god (to the religious folk anyway, but to each their own), etc... Some of this depends on your particular philosophy but at no point have I ever heard anyone call a fetus a corpse or compare it to organ harvesting.

I'll elaborate. I wasn't comparing the fetus to anything. I was referring to the dignity we afford people after they die. We all have say in what happens to our bodies once we die, why should living mothers not be given the same amount of say over their body while they're still alive? ","1359677702"

If you want absolute customization, more rp/ pvp/ pve, it can be done. The rules and creation are clearer then any table top game I have ever seen.

Developing a healthy relationship means crossing this barrier and become a more selfless person, attentive to the relationship in a more common manner in order to give it a long flourishing life.

Sometimes one member of the relationship has crossed this barrier into romantic maturity and another hasn't. I look back and see how former relationships were like that.

I imagine the one that works the best is the one where both have crossed that line of maturity and are more pledged to one another's well-being over what they can emotionally or physically take away from the relationship. Like passing a ball back and forth rather than two people existing together, watching one another dribble said ball.

Warmogs is currently the best item if you are facing a mix of AD and AP damage, which is almost every game.  I pick this or QSS (which sucks vs Vi) in most games.

Randuins is simply better against ADs then warmogs stat for stat, and it has a useful active for kiting someone like Vi.  It should be on your mind if you see her picked, although it is obviously situational because it's shitty against AP damage and expensive.  Tends to be my second most common item vs vi.

Locket is actually a completely rediculous and completely overlooked item.  It's about as gold-efficent against AD as randuins is, and is as gold efficient as warmogs against mixed AD/AP damage in the game (not counting GA with passive up).  It gives you upwards of 600hp including the shield by the time you buy it, 35 armor, 10% cdr, and costs 2000g.  Compare that to warmogs at 1000hp for 2650g.  The problem is, it's slot inefficent, and you will want to sell it in favor of mogs or randuins eventually.  I buy it the third most.","1359677716"

A lot of the interaction seems to be about dominance and respect, so what you call escalation may be him setting the rules of the current engagement and the next engagement, or in other words, establishing himself as someone who is not going to back down and someone who it is not worth it for those guys to mess with.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Both of those men were ignorant. Both were pandering to far right mentality in campaign speeches. Both deserve to be flayed as they were by the media. And both would do well to educate themselves and skip the rhetoric.

In the first quote;

&gt;“Pregnancy from rape is really rare” and “if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.”

This tool bag made the mistake of connecting an actual process observable in nature to rape victims. Many animals, including at times humans, Will suffer spontaneous miscarriage or at times periods of infertility. These coincide with heavy stress on the individual animal. Things such as massive trauma or scarcity of resources are the root cause. So this guy did some shitty mental calculation with facts that he knew little about and were not compatible. He toke point A-animals can at times miscarry or become infertile due to stress, made that an absolute. Then added; Rape is stressful. And came up with the sum of that dribbling oral diarrhea he ejected into the world.

The second one.

&gt;Abortion is “absolutely” never medically necessary to save the life of the mother because “with modern technology and science, you can’t find one instance … There’s no such exception as life of the mother.”

Was a total moron with no working knowledge of the dangers of pregnancy, who was pandering to a pro life audience with something he felt sounded strong and intelligent.

Both of those guys failed hard and both were slaughtered by the press.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","Actually, the way this has worked for me in the past goes like this:

My buddy and his wife were trying to set me up with some chick and they started busting my chops about asking for her number. I don't usually do that; I usually just tell the girl to friend me on facebook or email me or something. They made a bid deal out of it, so I took a picture of their Christmas tree and showed it to her and asked her if she wanted me to text it to her, knowing that she understood it to mean ""can I have your number"". I guess most people would just come right out and ask, but for me, in that situation, where you're being watched by other people like two pandas in a zoo, I felt the need to be subtle. 

This isn't really a trick, it's a diplomatic way that is mutually understood by both parties to get a girls number without seeming like PUA or a cad. The idea is that you're already socializing with the girl and don't want to come right out and ask - some girls will have second thoughts if you make it plain like that. ","1359677718"
"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;(The notion of ""true"" neutral is absurd, in my opinion. I mean neutral neutral.) 

IMO, True Neutral does not exist in real life.  In the games, druids were typically True Neutral due to their obsession with balance.

&gt;Intent is very important to me in how I view alignment.

Good point. It is sometimes easy for me to forget statists mean well, problem is I see them as they are actively trying to restrict my freedom.  I have to look at it from the perspective that ""the state is not evil.""

Either way, I still think you are more Lawful Neutral than Lawful Evil.  Your intent for the system is not to hurt said unfortunate people, but if they fall by the wayside, so be it.  Your system also is not explicitly rewarding the successful folks, the success is their own, and the reward is their success.

I like to think my typical fictional Lawful Neutral character is Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Lawful Evil I do not really have one, I think of tyrants usually... but the most sympathetic would probably be Magneto.  I think you more of a Picard than a Magneto.

What's interesting is every single account has what you described, a drastically lessened fear of death itself. It's a fascinating phenomenon to me, even more so when you consider the cases where people report feeling much more aware, alert, and possessing faster thought processes at a time when their recorded brain activity has entirely ceased.

I'm pretty sure what Wdc331 was disagreeing with you on was the statement ""This happens because insulin causes tissue damage so the body prefers not to produce it any more.""  From what we understand of the mechanism, this is incorrect.

This statement: ""In this respect diabetes is not a disease, it's a protection mechanism of the body, triggered by excess insulin over a long period of time."" is also counter to the current medical understanding of the disorder.  If your body was overproducing insulin you would get hypoglycemic episodes, the same as if you inject too much insulin.  This is not the norm in pre-diagnosis T1 diabetics.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Those are five separate studies that show that the presence of fluoride in water decreases incidence of caries in children. Naturally occurring fluoride is only mentioned in one of the five studies.

&gt;What exactly have you heard/read that has convinced you that consuming micro amounts of poison is ok?

Consuming Vitamin A in small quantities has beneficial effects for your skin and eyesight. Consuming too much can cause liver damage. Exposure to moderate amounts of sunlight leads to higher testosterone, can act as an anti-depressant, and a myriad of other benefits. Over-exposure can lead to skin cancer. Drinking water is necessary, but consuming large amounts can lead to death. If you've ever eaten almost any fish, you've exposed your body to small amounts of mercury.

The point I'm making is that because something is bad for you in large quantities, it doesn't mean that it can't be beneficial in small quantities.

In web frameworks built around the MVC model, it just makes sense to inherit from classes such as Controller and Model - this provides guidance and consistency, and this is a huge part of what frameworks are all about.  Clearly frameworks are also about providing extensibility and customization, but in a way that's limited to a specific context. 

If everything is constructed using object composition, you have too much flexibility, you lose consistency and your code becomes ""noodly"".  On the contrary, if everything must be inherited, you suffer customization issues and refactoring becomes a bitch.  As with everything in life, striking a balance between the two should be the primary design goal of a framework.","1359677726"

Good luck getting through PF/Tank/Ghost with Lings. Good luck getting through PF/Tank/Ghost with Infestors or Ultras. I don't think it's necessary to mention that there was no way Roaches, Hydras, or Mutas would have had any effect either, but it's a safe bet to put that there anyway.

Queue Nukes and drops falling everywhere.

He tried the last thing he could, which was make a lot of Brood Lords. Perhaps he could have left some as Corruptors and gotten Infestors, but then what? Ghost/Viking is by far better than Infestor/Corruptor in that scenario. There were like 12 Vikings and 18 Cloaked Ghosts.

So yeah, maybe it was silly to try and morph that many Banelings, but he was incredibly restricted in what he could do at that point, and the Lings weren't going to do too much good, even when dropped. The sim city in MVP's main would guarantee that.

Ghosts and Shakuras were both ridiculous in TvZ. Everyone seems to forget that on a constant basis. I guess you could call it a throw in the sense of ""Well MVP basically has this game won, but isn't doing anything concrete other than sitting there, I might as well just end it if he won't.""

Going from Pikemen, which make up the bulk of classical/medieval armies (as a rule of thumb) and are actually stronger than swordsmen, to Lancers, is no fun. Pikemen, in addition to their strength, attack cities with no penalty. Lancers do. They are not noticeably strong, cavalry have lost some of their edge, and Musketmen rule the day. This is all in addition to the massive penalty lancers take against cities (being mounted units) making them somewhat useless aside from killing other horses. 

AT guns later on are still very weak, and with the invention of artillery, almost pointless. Massive melee spam is no longer needed to siege cities. All you need is artillery to pound away, and tanks/infantry to march in afterwards. Landships and tanks are also so nimble, they can just avoid AT guns much better than horses could have avoided Pikemen. Helicopters are just the cherry on top of the mediocrity cake.","1359677741"

I've had so many experiences there where I know that given the condition of the pedal, they're giving me about 40%. As soon as I've asked to speak to a manager, they promptly give me the price that it should be. On top of that, if you have any pedals that they don't carry in store, they don't know how to price them very well at all. 

I have started to only buy and sell on The Gear Page. Good user base, reasonable prices, and a LOT of gear. I would say that pretty much every time you want to buy or sell, you'll be able to without too much trouble at all. ","1359677742"

Besides that, the story was beautifully crafted. I immensely enjoyed reading each chapter from a new character's perspective, piecing together the puzzle that is the narrative's timeline.

"YouShouldKnow","t5_2r94o","Well, the main argument I can say against that is this: Reddit doesn't necessarily have to be a daily news/post aggregate to people. There is always going to be content that someone hasn't seen. Do older redditors have to put up with the fact that newer redditors are ignorant to old posts? 

To use an example: many hobby type subreddits are bombarded with posts by new people asking 'What me do?'. /r/fitness is constantly fighting against this type post by having a faq and autodeleting these posts. This isn't 100% similar to the problem with reposts, but the similarity is there.

I mean reddit is an archive of old reddit posts. Unless the Op/Mod deletes it people can go through older content. Notwithstanding, this website's ability to go through archived posts is ridiculously difficult.

I've rambled a bit but, redditors don't necessarily have be bound by their front page on that current day. They can wade through older content. 

All this being said, I don't believe that upvotes/downvotes are legitimate filters. Any growing subreddit that was built with awesome people will add people that are ignorant. These ignorant submit content and vote on content that may go against the general nature that made the community great.

 *Sorry, I despise (not you specifically) it when people say ""downvote and move one"". I've seen this mentality destroy good communities. It is not a strong argument.* ","1359677750"

How exactly does it accomplish this feat?

&gt;It's extremely pro-Britain

It's British, I should hope that it's pro-Britain.

&gt;and it co-opts comedians into the system so they can't fulfill their usual critical role.

So much so that it prevents the comedians which it employs even bad mouthing the corporation itself. Oh wait... it doesn't... comedians regularly do this without any recourse.

&gt;Your government has forced an Australian citizen to hide in an embassy while U.K. troops patrol the front door, ready to extradite him to the USA where he'll disappear.

While I agree with you about the Assange case in general, the UK is obligated to do this. They have an extradition agreement with the EU which necessitates this. There is no threat of extradition to the USA, the risk if from the EU, and it would break our extradition laws for him then to be extradited to the USA.

&gt;You can't walk down the street without being on tens of interconnected cameras.

Which doesn't affect our lives in any way. Yes, there are recordings, but there are so many that they are only looked at if something does happen, like a crime, and then there is evidence of the crime on the film.","1359677755"

I might even have given him a ""Please be quiet"" and then said something soothing to her, in an effort to get her to GTFO--even go as far as to make her think I was on her side. THEN  I could apologize to the guy after she left, and explain. 

However, this clerk appears to be shy as hell, and has learned to keep his head down in the interests of his personal safety. Okay. 

But yeah, ClerkBoy really oughtta have called the cops, if he didn't. Plain old assault. Freaky Lady.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Preface: I have no personal stake in publishing/distributing outside of being a consumer. I read the article long ago and don't remember the exact one. However a few google searches.....

both of these are from 2009

[ ""Amazon ](http://www.teleread.com/ebooks/amazon-losing-money-on-999-e-books/) sells it at below wholesale, as a “loss leader”—breaking even or losing money on the deal to promote sales of the Kindle and grow its share of the market. (Giving away the blades to sell the razor, as it were."")

[""This piece ](http://www.teleread.com/chris-meadows/bezos-ducks-the-questions-kindle-e-books-bleed-money-from-amazon/)does not mince words, pointing out that Amazon loses at least $2 per Kindle title because the publishers price the e-books at the same $12 wholesale rate as hardcovers. Amazon is using these cheapened e-books as loss leaders: selling cheap to get people hooked on e-books (and on the Kindle in particular).""

Here's something from [2012.](http://www.salon.com/2012/03/13/scott_turow_on_why_we_should_fear_amazon/) Excerpt from this link:

""How did Amazon’s e-book pricing affect authors?

One way that 25 percent of net became the standard royalty for e-books was because publishers said, “We all know they can’t go on selling e-books at a loss forever and sooner or later this pricing structure has got to change.” They told authors they couldn’t agree to a different royalty because everyone knew that Amazon wouldn’t be paying them $14 to $15 per title indefinitely.

You’re implying that Amazon planned eventually to use the consumer’s habituation to $9.99 books to force publishers to charge Amazon lower wholesale prices for books. They’ve tried to do that recently with some small presses, removing their titles from Amazon unless the presses agree to sell their books at rock-bottom wholesale prices. And publishers would have no choice but to agree because every other competitor would also have been driven out of the market by Amazon’s predatory pricing?

Certainly, that’s what publishers assumed.

The other thing Amazon could have done once they had the market to themselves — and this is virtually inevitable — is that they would have raised prices to consumers.

That’s part of the less-known history behind anti-trust laws. Once a large company has spent its capital to fund predatory pricing and drive its competitors out of business, there’s no reason to keep selling for cheap. The low prices don’t last.

Right. Look, if what they’re into is maximizing profits, then if they were to have a monopoly there’d be no rationale not to use the monopoly power to increase prices to consumers. Now, if I were on the other side, working for Amazon, I’d say “Show me where I’ve done that.”

Presumably, they haven’t done it yet because they haven’t achieved the monopoly yet. Historically, that’s what monopolies always do.

Correct. That is historically what monopolies do. There is plenty of precedent for that. It’s only rational to fear what they’re going to do with this accumulation of power.

Again, the concern from the author’s perspective is that e-books are putting a tremendous downward pressure on the price of books in general. That’s putting tremendous pressure on publishers to survive. And I think a world in which online book selling is driving bookstores out of existence is a pity.""

As for the [self publishing.](http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/01/guest-post-by-robin-sullivan.html) Guest Post by Robin Sullivan. Who is Robin Sullivan? ""My name is Robin Sullivan and I’m the wife and self-appointed publicist of my husband Michael J. Sullivan.""

[NPR](http://www.npr.org/2012/01/23/145468105/publishers-and-booksellers-see-a-predatory-amazon) piece on ""A 'Predatory' Amazon""

""Amazon makes a good profit on
a) enabling self-publslished books on DTP b) through their imprints 47 North, Thomas and Mercer etc.'""

I understand Amazons loss leader strategy is possible because they are making money in other areas. However the nature of that strat is to destroy the current competition and stifle the new. What happens when that's done?
My feeling is when something has as much power as Amazon has/wants they will eventually abuse it. Doesn't matter what they say or do. Today, tomorrow or in a hundred years they will abuse it. I understand the need for publishers/distributes services(promotion/editors) in our current time and wish there was an alternative.

I'm not sure that we have the same definition for fundamentalist. Fundamentalism by definition calls for reactionary action against advancing social customs for the sake of maintaining old morality. The acceptability of evolution and homosexuality is still a very new phenomena in the United States. Just because the Catholic church has recently changed its stance doesn't mean that sticking to its decision makes you a fundamentalist, it just makes you a devoted Catholic. There are a lot of devoted Catholics and Christians that are fine with homosexuality and evolution. However, there is a large section of Christians, and probably Catholics, that do not consider those things to be acceptable at all, and they doubt the devotion of anyone that agrees, and they militantly oppose any action that would advance the US in these areas. Sticking to creationism damages the credibility of science, reason, and study in the minds of the children who are exposed to it.

I was raised in a conservative Christian home, and I learned creationism (technically 'intelligent design'). I learned that there was no conclusive evidence for the theory of evolution, that Noah's Flood created the Grand Canyon, and the Loch Ness Monster is a real descendant of plesiosaurs. This, of course, is all bullshit, as I realized when I became an adult. However, these claims serve to intentionally mislead people into feeling comfortable that there is a logical basis for a 6000 year old earth. Lying to people and intellectually stunting their children in exchange for their money is disgusting. Telling people that homosexuality is an abomination and that gays are destroying the institution of marriage is disgusting. Refusing young adults proper sex education to prevent the spread of diseases like AIDS and unwanted pregnancies in the name of 'purity' is disgusting. All of this comes from the literal interpretation of the Bible, the holy text that all Christian denominations turn to for their doctrine and source of belief. Don't you see why people get frustrated with Christians quickly?","1359677763"

If that song was an instrumental, you'd think some kid did it in a couple hours at home, which contrasts pretty sharply with some of the instrumental work Trent's done lately/ever. [""Ice Age""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq3pDuJeMqQ) is much better, and better suited to her voice.

By that token, however, I'm of the opinion that incest and polyamory are both fine if the participants are consenting adults who understand the situation they're in.

&gt;I would think when people begin to attack others in online gaming people receive equal amounts of harassment then women also receive gender related harassment. I could see men receiving more harassment since there are more male gamers. 

No, they don't get harassed in a non-sexual way then billy throws it at the end ""Yeah you're also a girl"" if they are known as a girl it will immediately start because it's the most easy target in the world when someone is doing badly because everyone knows even if the girl acts like it doesn't bother her she will be bitching about it on reddit or some other site later, evident by how almost every fucking thread is a giant pity party for women. Yes, males do get harassed more because they play more, and they are the biggest group, which is why when you ask ""Who gets harassed more men or women?"" you might as well put who gets more sexist remarks because nobody fucking cares about anything said to a woman unless it is about them being a woman.","1359677768"

WOW was immensely successful for a long time, but the games D3 and WOW are very different. Different meaning the systems were different, the gameplay was different, the content was different, etc. In other words, the only way they are similar is they are both rpg's. WHat worked with WOW doesn't work as well with D3.

You are right to a point, I will freely admit. WOW was executed poorly, but developed well (thats what gives me a lot of hope for D3). Its slowly dying now, but that point is irrelevant. The reason I implied Blizzard doesn't know rpg's is because very few if any of those WOW lessons has been applied to D3. Both launches, for instance, were less than desirable, and both initial versions of the game were very lacking in content.

The reason I can gloss over PoE is because the game exists now as a beta. Moreover, it is free. WOW and D3 were released as beta games; they fixed them as they went along. The game is decent now, but thats because they had half a year of an expensive open beta period to make it this way. If the game was released on 1.04 or 1.05, most people probably would have been happy. But it wasn't, not even close. The game was released prematurely, it still lacks class balance, and there is still no real endgame besides farming. Blizz may know rpg's, but it is not evidenced very well with D3.","1359677770"

And the TP, because you won't know if there's gonna be any when you get there.

--Consider renting a storage unit close to your new place, especially if there's stairs leading to/from your old place.  Pack up non-essential items and move them over bit by bit leading up to the move in day.  Less stairs = smother move.  Bonus points if it shortens the drive.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","A handful of things, but mainly these, starting with the least annoying:

1) Everything was faster to do in ios (there are fewer menus to get to the same result) meaning that I played with my phone less when I wanted to turn things off to talk to people.

2) It was easier to shut down apps in ios. In Android, unless I turn my phone off and on, they continue to run in the background, draining battery. The battery life is half as good to begin with, but if I forget to turn my phone off and on after playing a game, my battery lasts under 90 minutes.

3) Samsung and Google don't have anything close to Applecare: when something goes wrong with my Apple devices, I know exactly where to take it for immediate service. I dropped my Macbook Pro brought it in, and they changed my hard disk and fan under warranty, even though it technically wasn't covered. 

4) Every Android phone I've had has bugged like crazy (I've had 7 over the last 12 months). For example, on my Samsung, my keyboard doesn't work on any app anymore except the Google Search. I can type exactly two letters before the keyboard disappears.  I've tried deleting everything and restarting it under manufacturer settings. I've brought it into the shop where I bought it and they shrugged their shoulders. I now have a really expensive smart phone that I can't text people on, search for apps, or write emails with. My HTC would call people randomly. I could leave it on my desk and after about 30 or 40 minutes, it would open up the contacts list. If I didn't touch it, 30 minutes later it would select a contact. Again, if I waited, it would call that contact. Restoring factory settings fixed it, but the same phone started hanging up on phone calls at random while I was talking. I could go on, but my point is all 7 Androids have had major problems. 

Over the last 12 months I've spend about $2500 on Androids. I only stick with them because iPhone doesn't support Mobilicity (or similar networks) in Canada and I hate Bell, Rogers, and Telus with a passion. I would rather not have a smartphone than deal with our oligopolistic telecommunications companies.

Twitch aim relies on muscle memory, which maccel is near incompatible with this. Of all CS pros, not one uses acceleration. 

That established, we must now look to the advantages of acceleration in TF2. This will be mainly conjecture, since I favour raw input.

"firstamendment","t5_2se4d","&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.

Congress made no law. No one made any law. What's your point? The First Amendment is pretty explicit on who and what it constrains. If you mean to invoke the broader, more philosophic Jeffersonian notion of separation of church and state, I wish you would just say that instead. I'm afraid to even talk about how that notion relates because I'm not sure that's what you mean. What I'm trying to say is; that statement you bolded was absolutely irrelevant, even with the following premise added.

&gt;If he had stolen from a mosque would they ever sentence him to 6 weeks of indoctrination in Islam?

The Kentucky judge might not, but I suspect there are judges in the US who may entertain the idea. Hell, I would, and I'm a Texan Southern Baptist.

""Being indoctrinated"" requires absolutely any effort on his part to actually listen or care about a damn thing Preacher-Man says. If he decides to, well, then, it's not indoctrination. Unless the rap music I hear from the fraternity neighboring my building is actually indoctrinating me into becoming a womanizing drug dealer, I don't see that as ""being indoctrinated.""

I personally feel like you're slinging that word around as if it could be used in any situation where words you don't agree with reach your ears without your permission. (Unless you're actually talking about religion as some basically dangerous thing we need to quarantine; in which case, you're enough of both a (fairly boring) fringe minority and a jerk that I couldn't be bothered to continue the conversation.)

If he was forced to pray, or if he was forced to read from Scripture, if he was to do anything other than sit as a passive observer to a ritual; you might have a point. All he had to do was ""attend."" Now, I suppose *you* could place all sorts of qualifiers on that, if you like. I've gone to church some level between monthly and weekly most of my life, most of them either Baptist or heavily Baptist-influenced non-denominationals. If all you have to do is ""attend,"" in the vast majority of cases that's really all you have to do. Yes, I've even gone to one of *those* Baptist churches, that are spoken of in twilight hours for fear of the night wind carrying fearful whispers to their ears; an *extremist.* Then I decided that I didn't want to be a part of that church anymore! So....I said the church wasn't for me and left. I still chat with the people I met there sometimes.

&gt;The government isn't supposed to humiliate citizens. The whole point of the eighth amendment is that even criminals should be allowed to have human dignity.

If you consider being forced to sit in a church pew to hear the religious beliefs of someone you don't agree with (which I'll assume Mr. Nickell doesn't for the sake of argument) for one hour, once a week, as punishment for stealing from that person, in exchange for a jail sentence, a violation of basic human dignity...well, I think first you should try the jail sentence. To my knowledge, the numbers of people who willingly go to church and who willingly go to jail are incomparable.

The only way I could make sense of your allusion to the Eighth would be to think that you believe the Eighth implies *no* punishment for a crime should in any way embarrass or humiliate the person involved. So, if I found jail itself embarrassing or humiliating, my Eighth Amendment rights were violated. If I was embarrassed about the publicity of my trial and the fact that all my friends knew I was guilty, my Eighth Amendment rights were violated.

There are plenty of Eighth and other amendment rights being violated in much grander fashion all over the country. Frankly, I think stating that someone's basic human rights were violated because they had to sit down next to a loud dude they don't agree with for an hour is absurd. That means my Eighth amendment rights are violated one out of four times I'm at a bus stop.

--

The Eighth, btw: 

&gt;""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.""

What a cruel and unusual punishment! Sitting in a church pew, something hundreds of millions of people with normal, balanced lives do on a weekly basis. ","1359677778"

* eliminate as much sugar as you can from your diet -- avoid foods that can cause a sugar 'crash'
* make a schedule of tasks for the day, and break up tasks into small chunks
* take frequent breaks from difficult tasks, but keep the breaks short
* exercise at least 30 minutes each day

so, 20kW at 110V is  182 Amps.
      7.5kW at 110V is  68 Amps.

First, I'd read the ""Form and structure"" part of ol' wikipedia's entry on [Free Verse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_verse).  It might help solidify a few things.  Then I would read more free-verse poetry.

Secondly, free verse still benefits from imagery, alliteration, cadence, etc., etc., - the things that make formal poetry thrive.  But if we really wanted to break it down into the simplest base unit, I'd probably say that free verse relies on the line.  Focus on each line reading as an interesting section, and then have the line break be used to some effect - surprise, pause, etc.  

As for this poem, it seems that what happens is: narrator doesn't believe in theology, enters theology class, has some hope, sits down, stares, still doesn't believe in theology.  We don't go anywhere, meaning the poem is a shot of a static scene.  Nothing really happens beyond a little navel-gazing.  And in that thinking, we're not exposed to anything that might surprise us or stick with us or haunt us - we're told the narrator doesn't believe, and we're posed a question (""what should I be feeling"") without any evidence to help us come to an answer.  I'd say the poem needs to take the reader somewhere to make this power - what is it about *this* theology class that affects the narrator?  If the answer is ""nothing"", why are we reading about it?","1359677783"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; As a thinking conservative, let me fill you in:


I would have considered myself to be a conservative several years ago and it is reflected in my past voting record. However, after many missteps and lies from the representatives put into power by conservatives I have found it necessary to reevaluate everything with a great deal of scrutiny. My views today are not only more informed but radically different.


&gt; we must understand that runaway spending by the government - on any program - should be avoided


A view a still hold but not one that is adhered to by conservative representatives since at least the 1980s.


&gt;  the current climate of ""kick the can down the road and print more money now"" will not best serve our long term interests


A common fallacy perpetuated by conservatives. Congress nor the Fed print money and the actions they take to incur debt necessary to cover budget deficits is not the same as printing money. If you want to understand what it means to print money then study the [Zimbabwe hyperinflation and currency crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Zimbabwe#Hyperinflation_2004-2009). That was caused by printing money.


Most conservatives know full well that the ""printing money"" statement is a fallacy and will try to defend it as an issue of semantics but they continue to use the fallacy. The reason of course is that they want to portray this false impression that we are in the same financial straights as was Zimbabwe for political purposes and so they must lie for political gain.


&gt; as they are a large part of our country's expenditures, social programs will have to abide with cuts in federal spending


With which nobody has every argued, however, the conservative analysis of social program spending is once again faulty and portrayed with fallacies or misdirection for political gain.


As you have done here the first thing to do is to complain about the spending, and if you look at [the Federal spending](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42636) it shows that social spending is by far the biggest slice of the spending pie.


But don't look closer unless you truly want to understand the root of the problem. If you do then look close at the revenue chart and realize that 35% of the revenues are taxes specifically assigned to the social programs.


And if you dig further into revenue by going beyond the budget charts you will further realize that the $819 billion in 2011 tax revenues specifically assigned to social programs is enhanced with an additional $234 billion in other revenues from interest income, premium payments, and taxes on benefits as shown in the [SSA Trust Fund Report](http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/tr11summary.pdf).


When you do the actual math and offset social program spending by the revenues specifically assigned to those programs the run away spending on social programs drops from 40% of the spending to less than 17%!


The defense spending jumps to nearly 28% of spending and if you look closely you will realize that the Other and Nondefense portions also include military expenses as well.


And so we have this elaborate hoax by so called conservatives who only want to get control of run away spending who it appears may actually want to requisition revenues that are specifically assigned to social programs to offset the massive hole in the budget created by the real problem. The defense and military spending are the hole in the budget not the social programs.


In the end nobody is asking that what is likely at $1 trillion defense budget be sacrificed to address the $1 trillion deficit in the budget. But it is nonsense to suggest that what amounts to around $180 billion in deficit spending on social programs is the crux of the run away spending.


2011 Budget - Social Specific Taxes and Revenue (in billions)

* Social: $427 ($1,480 - $1,053 in taxes and other revenues)
* Interest: $227
* Other: $545 (includes some military related spending)
* Nondefense: $646 (also includes some military related spending)
* Defense: $700


&gt; But alas, it simply devolves into a shit-slinging contest that no one will win because, in the end, we're all covered in shit.


While some balk there has been an acceptance that there would be cuts in social programs on what today is called the left. If so called conservatives would drop the fallacies and misdirection that is aimed at blaming social programs when the elephant in the room is decades of obsessive and decadent military spending then perhaps the shitfest could end.


It is plain to see that representatives put in power by conservatives have little interest in addressing spending problems unless it includes the implementation of their ideological state that requires the decimation of social programs so they can continue to bilk the payroll tax revenues to fund their military misadventures.


**TLDR**


Conservatives perpetuate myths of printing money and run away social program spending to an ignorant electorate for political gain. Congress does not print money and 35% of Federal revenues are a social insurance tax for those social programs not for military adventures.

Last night, a homeless man came up to me and asked if I had any money, but I only had plastic on me. He followed up by asking for a sandwich. So, I finally put my plan into action and said, ""What would you trade for it?"" He shrugged and said, ""I dunno, my gloves?""

I felt terrible, bought him a sandwich and obviously didn't take the gloves, because I'm not a monster.

I think this is the true reason behind the early advice of election day, despite Gillard's denials. It allows her to claim a by-election would be a waste of taxpayer's money if a death, illness or another case like Thomson appears. That achieves two goals: deferring a possible loss of a majority in the house and avoiding a possible humiliating loss in a by-election.

I also think it is no accident that the announcement only just preceded Thomson's arrest. He was warned of the impending arrest long before and was invited to quietly go to the police; he chose not to. But that prior advice would have reached Gillard too.","1359677791"

The government would deny its existence. The first the outside world would hear about it is when refugees to northern china start dying of a mystery illness. Due to not understanding the full seriousness of the illness it spreads to Chinese medical workers who haven't taken enough precautions. From them is spreads to the rest of china, Hong Kong and a few other parts of Asia. By the time its mortality rate becomes clear it has spread all over the world. International air traffic is closed. Countries close their borders. Anyone suspected of infection is isolated. After many months or years of this the last few people with the disease have died or recovered, and the world slowly begins to reconnect.

I like that they also show me what's going on without that annoying popup that Dropbox shows every single time something finishes downloading.  I also like that I can specify what to keep in sync or not.

What I was referring to is the sharing of files.  If my friend shares files with my account, then their files are not downloaded to my machine.  I have to go to skydrive.com and go to the Shared Files section to view/download them.  Then if I make changes, I have to upload them again through the website.  It also gives me power to create folders, but I can't change the names.  These are the types of annoyances I was referring to, and only relate to shared files, not the straight-forward keep-my-own-stuff-in-sync side of Skydrive.

If I'm wrong, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I am, please let me know how to set it to manage shared files on my local machine.

Edit: Before anyone mentions the ""Show desktop notifications"" setting in Dropbox, disabling that means that I never know when anything has been synced.

Now mind you I was a Specialist and a VC or Vehicle commander for a M-1126 ICV (Stryker). This was a huge responsibility as the chassis alone is worth 2 million dollars. As a VC I was in charge of the driver and the maintenance of the ""truck"" (yes we called them trucks, 33 ton 8x8 and its still a truck) and the primary gunner of an RWS. The remote weapon system allows the gunner to stay hulled up while improving the effectiveness of either a M-2 50 caliber machine gun or a Mk-19 grenade machine gun. I had a 50 cal and knew her inside and out. 

One of my Platoon mates had a Mk-19 on his. Now anyone who knows anything about Mk-19's knows they can be kinda tricky to unload, as its cycle of operation pulls a round from the links and has it ready to present to the chamber, with no effective way to pull it out other than cycling the weapon. 

Platoon mate, we will call him ""billy"" asks me to climb on top of his stryker to help him out(by the time we hit afghanistan i was the resident expert on everything that went bang). I hop on over and he tells me the ""ghost round is stuck"". 

Now this is where everything went to shit. Before I can say anything or even look at the weapon he pulls back the charging handles with a huge tug, which dislodged the stuck round and chambered it. I saw it, but billy didn't. He reached up and pushed the butterfly trigger down with a nice Thump. 

Lets just say I nearly lost my rank, he lost his, and we had to go comb the afghan hillside to try and recover this unexploded 40mm grenade. I was embarrassed for him, I'm just glad no one got hurt.","1359677796"

I actually thought this definition was evident in my usage, but I can see how it can be interpreted as though I were going for a more playful amusement (especially with the use of the word ""game"").  Though we treated it like a game, it doesn't me we weren't hungry.  

This reminds me of another game we played.  We often drove a few hours to places of entertainment (arcades, theaters, etc.) and during the hottest days someone came up with the idea to roll up the windows and crank the heat.  The winner was the last person to not wish for a window to be opened or the A/C to be turned on.  Funny thing was even if you caved you still had to suffer.

It isn't true. Some people, based on a few studies out of hundreds, don't drive significantly worse after one or two drinks. That's different than driving better (or equally well) while drunk. No one drives better while they're drunk.

My point about the marijuana is that one study is not conclusive. One study showing people who are high driving better is not enough to say that, in general, high people drive better. Some studies do show this, but when taken in aggregate the opposite trend emerges with high certainty. The same goes for driving under the influence of one or two drinks, let alone while drunk.

I do agree that it's a shitty friend move. I've put myself in the friend's shoes in my head a bunch and can't imagine going for one of my friend's exes. However, I have a pretty small, close-knit group of friends, but my ex had a LOT of ""friends"", most of which were not close and who he only saw at big group events, etc. This guy falls into that category.

I don't mean to make it sound like he's a bad guy for that, but the mall is a great, high-traffic place to be if you're in the business of selling drugs on the street, and getting kicked out of the place where you sell a lot of drugs would suck... you know.. if you were a street-level drug dealer...","1359677808"

You guys are all assuming every jet is piling onto you, and you alone. Every 2v1 the enemy pulls on you means that one of your wingmen is free to chase whoever the hell he wants. Furthermore, you guys are always assuming you are constantly on the defensive. 

This isn't planetside 2, where you get bogged down by 5 people running with undodgable heatseekers and a flare recharge of 45 seconds. You have 11/12 second flare recharge, below radar, and missiles that are incredibly easy to dodge. 

Yes, if all the jets were after you, and if you had zero wingmen to keep you alive, heatseekers would be awful. But let's face it, DICE balanced heatseekers to a point where they are unusable against all but the worst pilots. Any decent pilot will tell you that the cannon's kill rate is way faster than any missile, and has no counter. BF3 is nice enough that if you NEVER want to be locked onto by a missile, you can do that.

Mundane means every-day, dull. It's a common thing -- of this world. Characterized by happening, well, everyday. The reason these two people have met is unbelievably standard in the US: a student meeting a teacher. The reason is mundane. Every-day, common, practical, ordinary. 

Obviously your point is that spreading knowledge is wonderful, important, etc. etc. etc. But that doesn't detract from the fact that it is super common. There are many teachers meeting many students. You're grasping at straws to assert that my paragraph somehow insinuated that I think spreading knowledge is lame. You just wanted to dramatically sigh at the de-intellectualization of society, right?

What is NOT common and every-day, typical is a felon meeting a teacher WHILE IN the prison system and the romance that follows is even less typical.  

If you tell me a black bear mated with a polar bear it'd be kind of crazy. You'd be like, please -- tell me more -- where did they meet?! But if a black bear mates with a black bear, despite it being a beautiful instance of nature and procreation and life, it's pretty fucking mundane. Of course black bears meet other black bears.

Regardless, I'm not going to sit here and argue about what happened in the city 30+ years ago. It was a generation ago. The people of Baltimore today show up to support the Ravens. They have one of the most consistent and highest selling capacity figures, selling over 100% of capacity every season. The people of Baltimore also built their team a stadium 15 years ago, when they got one back. In fact, Baltimore attendance is substantially higher than Cleveland attendance.

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","If you continuously auto attack the person slowed by Rylai's, you will get off ki strike every time you get vorpal blade off (approximately the same once per four seconds). At the level you have max vorpal blade (maxing it first), this restored 20 energy. 60 energy per vorpal blade, but 40 energy regenerated over the cooldown, and 20 energy refunded per ki strike. The economy remains flat if you do this.

However, comparing the damage and tankiness of frozen mallet versus rylai's is less favorable to Rylai's. Rylai's provides 48 extra magic damage every four seconds, plus 50 extra ki strike damage about the same period. The mallet provides 30 damage every attack, and 70 bonus damage on the ki strike, with the extra 200 health making up for the lost 48 points of shield every feint cooldown. Mallet also slows with every auto attack.

The one place where Rylai's maintains the advantage is in range. Since Vorpal Blade can land at range, that makes Rylai's stronger for applying slow in a chase. However, this again is mitigated by the fact that both items slow for only 1.5 seconds these days, meaning that while Mallet can permanently slow someone while Shen auto-attacks them, Rylai's cannot. Frozen Mallet also slows for 40%, versus the 35% slow of Rylai's.

Between the two damage/health/slow items, Mallet is the clear winner in most circumstances for Shen.","1359677832"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;A little OT, but my best analogy for the US involvement in Iraq is not the Vietnam war, but Alcibiades's doomed expedition in Sicily 2,500 years ago. The US may not have suffered the same number of human casualties as Athens did in Sicily, but I'm pretty sure that the inflated military expenditure of the United States caused by its involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan explains many of its current ills.

No lack in hyperbole here. You just compared a war America won and already left behind and a war largely won already with the battle that single-handedly destroyed the Athenian empire. Brilliant equivalency. The only way you could compare that is if America lost most of its army and all of its navy in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think we can safely say that if the US collapsed today we'd all be shocked while Thucydides writes that the Greeks were surprised that Athens survived the Sicilian expedition by nine whole years.

You should really think about what you write before replacing a bad equivalency with an even worse one. 

Also, idiot economist should know that [the British eventually took control of Afghanistan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War) Afghanistan is not some mystical unconquerable land, it has been conquered and held by empires many times and most of them have not collapsed because of it, indeed only the Soviet union did (and frankly if you think Afghanistan was the only reason you're seriously deluded).","1359677832"

Figuring out how a story begins and ends is often the easier part. The harder part is figuring out exactly what things happen in what order. You know that feeling when you're working on a script and you end a scene and you hit enter twice and type ""INT. - "" and then have *no idea* what to type next?

Around October my godmother took her two kids (11 &amp; 14) to live with her mum. It hadn't been clear to us, but he would occasionally beat my godmother (not severely, but never-the-less unacceptable) and his kids would have to take care of him while he was in a drunken state.

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Hey there – boy do I have a story to tell! I've dabbled a bit with online dating in the past, and met a few people within my local area as you do when talking to a lot of people over Skype with friends. So yeah, there was a beautiful brunette named Charlotte who I had fallen a fancy to, and started a good few conversations with her. Her profile picture was divine, beautiful in every aspect - I couldn't fault her. She spoke with class and was an extremely fun person to talk with, so much so that one day I decided to arrange a meet up with her for a fine-dining experience in a local restaurant (as classy as a student bank account could afford). I thought I could rely on this girl as she was really sweet and kind, and we had so much in common. She accepted gracefully and henceforth the scene was set; a dreary wet Sunday down our local high street. 
I put on some fancy clothing, nothing too over-kill, and left the house as I intended with my noble Oyster Card in hand (bus journey, what a great way to start a date). Upon arriving, I waited for a good two hours after our agreed meeting time – leaving her numerous texts on her mobile and eagerly awaiting her shining personality to appear from around the corner. I’d just about given up hope when a man approached me from the pub opposite and told me that he was a friend of Charlottes. Uh oh, this cannot be good. She was apparently indisposed and couldn't be with me on that night, and told her friend to ‘sit in for her’. I’m sorry – what? Did I hear this correctly? Her male friend was going to sit in for her on our –relatively- expensive date? 

I couldn't really say no, as the arrangements had been made for a table and he was quite insistent that we get inside out of the rain. On top of that, he said he’d pay for the food for the trouble. I now had a dilemma – walk away with a feeling of sorrow and an empty stomach, or walk away knowing I’d be eating a candle lit dinner with a stranger but feeling fully satisfied. It was nine in the evening so I just went with it and ate dinner with him.

A total stranger.

Yeah.

If that wasn't the most awkward moment of my life I don’t know what was. If I remember correctly, he ordered a Pollo Fritto, which is a chicken breast in a light Italian cheese sauce for his main, whilst I had a medium rare steak. Whilst this was lovely, I can’t help thinking that this was not the beautiful brunette I fell in love with.","1359677835"

First thing I'd do for him is to get him adapted utensils...they are weighted differently than regular utensils and are easier to hold, especially if he has tremors in his hands or arms.  The other thing you can do is to prep his food into smaller pieces that he can eat with his fingers if he has to. It may get messy but that's what napkins are for :) 

Foods can be tough because you want to make sure he's eating something well balanced but that's easy to eat. Many people with MS struggle with difficulty swallowing so things that are bite size and easy to swallow may work well for him. For example, baked chicken fingers, cut up fruit and baked potato wedges would be easy to swallow, as well as easy to handle.

-----


King Hussein I of Jordan made that point in 1947. 

An excerpt from his [letter](http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/kabd_eng.html) 

&gt;Italians might claim England, which the Romans held so long. England might claim France, ""homeland"" of the conquering Normans. And the French Normans might claim Norway, where their ancestors originated. And incidentally, we Arabs might claim Spain, which we held for 700 years.

Many Mexicans might claim Spain, ""homeland"" of their forefathers. They might even claim Texas, which was Mexican until 100 years ago. And suppose the American Indians claimed the ""homeland"" of which they were the sole, native, and ancient occupants until only some 450 years ago!

I am not being facetious. All these claims are just as valid—or just as fantastic—as the Jewish ""historic connection"" with Palestine. Most are more valid.

I've only dated two women who have been shorter than I am. Most were 5'7"". The tallest was 6'2"". Of course, if I did online dating I'm sure I'd never get anywhere, but when I meet women in person I don't ever have any issues with my height.

If a woman is so insecure that she can't be seen in public with a man who's a little shorter than her then I don't really want to waste my time with that. If that's just the woman's preference, well, I can't argue with that. Maybe it's not insecurity but just a preference. Whatever. Doesn't really bother me at all.

If you have charisma, are interesting, funny, and can hold a good conversation that seems to go a long way. It also helps if you aren't ugly. I'm not going to lie about that.

The Danglez DB 3 lists the pattern for a 70i EU, that is roughly equal to a 32G UK or 32i US. It also has the pattern for a 75H EU, which is roughly equal to a 34H US. 

I am not aware of any patterns in 30J. But I think that making the band tighter on the 70i to get a 30GG UK or 30J US is a good option since you are sewing the bra from scratch.  

Note that the cup on the Danglez pattern seems to run large. I saw a bra in 90i/42G UK based upon the Danglez DB3, it was signifanctly larger than a Panache bra in 42G, nominally the same size. 

BTW, sewing your own bra is not as easy as you might think. Quite a lot of people start by trying on a lot of bras in order to find a bra they can copy, bc this can be easier than to adjust a pattern to fit you. ","1359677840"

Also greater competition would drive telstra to perform.

Well that's just your opinion, my only suggestion is to try and expand your little bubble you live in, and learn and read up as much as you can about it. It doesn't hurt to push yourself and learn a lot more about other angles.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Your insults are an indication of a lost argument, and bad points.

On the contrary, I am only trying to assess the type of person I am addressing. I postulated that you are young based on your slightly naive cynicism to how America and the world is, typical for Reddit (""omg guys 'merica so bad type"" of attitude). Basically, just not a lot of life experience on which to draw from. Education I question because you seem to be missing the point of basic statistical concept, such as probabilities and rates, which are imperative for comparing two things of differing sizes. 

&gt; Some of the numbers you've stated are horribly off.

The numbers I've stated are directly from sources like the UN, WHO, FBI, and others. You seem to continually ignore the response I said that the numbers listed were ""per year"", like the numbers I listed for Brazil.

For your edification, let me list them again.

In the US, we have approximately 11k-12k homicides by firearm per year. [Here's the state-by-state breakdown from the FBI for 2010.](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls).

As can be seen in the chart, the state with the highest numbers of total firearm murders is California. Now, this would make sense since it is one of the more populous states in the nation. California also has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. In fact, it's the #1 state for gun restriction according to the [Brady Campaign](http://www.bradycampaign.org/stategunlaws/scorecard). This means that it's supposedly got the *best* laws in the nation right now for preventing gun violence. 

Similarly, Texas has a relatively large number of homicides. Again, this makes since since it's got two of the largest cities in the nation, as well as bordering a known dangerous area of Mexico rife with drug and arms traffiking. Have you been to El Paso recently? You used to be able to just pop across the border for some lunch, but not anymore. Texas, on the other hand, is not a Brady Campaign friendly state, yet they have 600 less homicides per year than California. 

So let's look back to Brazil, shall we?

Brazil has a population of approximately 200 million people; The US has just over 300M people. 

Brazil has firearm homicides in 2008 totaling almost 35,000 [according to the UN](http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Homicides_by_firearms.xls). The US, on the contrary, has less than 12,000, despite being more populous. 

So what does that mean? On an absolute level, which statistically we know doesn't mean anything, Brazil has THREE TIMES the amount of homicides with firearms compared to the US. Now, taking population into account, this number INCREASES because Brazil's population is only 2/3rds that of the US. 

&gt;You sound like a politician trying to take bad numbers, and bad facts, and develop an entirely different point out of it.

Please go look at the numbers yourself then.

Here, let's take a look at one of the previous images [you linked me](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17nb8f/developing_story_2_people_shot_at_price_middle/c873wex) from someone's blog (rather than reputable sources like I've been using). 

http://www.juancole.com/2013/01/murders-terrorism-numbers.html

So in that graph, you see that big blue bar says there are, hell, let's round up and say 120,000 gun murders. Now, notice at the bottom on the x-axis it says this data is the sum total from 2002-2011. That's a *10 year* range. So that means according to your source there are, on average, 12,000 firearm murders per year in the US. Which matches up pretty well with my 11k-13k per year assertion I've made (and others have made as well). 

What about that other [image you linked](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS469US469&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=oTIBgNVpEzRn7M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.comedsoc.org/Homicides_Suicides_Guns_2.htm%3Fm%3D66&amp;docid=3-IlekDxeJTD_M&amp;imgurl=http://www.comedsoc.org/images/GunHomicidesSuicides1999-2011_copy1.jpg&amp;w=390&amp;h=292&amp;ei=-uEKUYv2KIeG8QTDiIHIAQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:5,s:0,i:98&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=9278&amp;sig=101462084903406046122&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=179&amp;tbnw=260&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=35&amp;tx=81&amp;ty=84)?

Well, that too shows that there are only 11k-13k gun homicides per year in the US. 

&gt; It would seem to me that you would be the younger one, the less educated one.

I'm not sure how you got to that conclusion, honestly.

&gt;In terms of my age you can look up my links and see that I am in fact a 25 yo male, and am in fact educated.

Other people get so incensed about injustice when they hear of crimes being committed you need to send a message for all to see for this revenge to work. So I would have to say, yes, the harshness is fundamental to it.

I have been a victim of crime; someone burgled my house once. I can't say I really hate the person who did it. I'd like to have my things back. The police caught the person, and he went to prison (he'd burgled a lot, apparently). If I were given the choice though, I wouldn't let him off.

The car finally leaves the spot reversing out between me and the spot.  As this is happening some fat lady in a mini van cuts the person leaving off and takes my spot. I go up and ask her of she saw me waiting to which she responded ""Go F yourself"".  I was trying to hold it together cause that chick was in my car when I just lost it. I was in a rental so i drove my front dumper up to the side of the van and hit the gas crushing her door in. We then left the mall, I dropped this chick off and we never spoke again. ","1359677848"
"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I can somewhat understand your comments.

I was also WOW Player, Hunter semi-hardcore Raider.

There some things I miss from wow, like raiding and to have open world pvp, Horde and Alliance. And other things...

But concerning your points.. it has been already commented, but in wow, at some point it was all about the perfect rotation, best trait/tree , so there wasnt much room for customatisation.. of course was the own gaming playing skills what separated people from identic classes playing the exact rotations, etc...

With GW2 there isnt a ""best"" anymore, plenty of combinations of traits and weapons makes the classes to feel really fun and adapted to you liking.. you got bored using that classes in a certain way, change some things and you got yourself a completly playstyle, thats why i like about GW2 classes.

Also GW2, its much more team orientated, combining classes skills together, combos, utilities. that requires more team effort of course. And its different as WOW raids.. you also needed a coordinated team, but more or less, each one was doing its job were in gw2, all the jobs feel more interactive with eachother.. you can feel that pretty much in high levels fractals.

And for other thing, the grinding is gone, I feel so reliefed that i dont feel forced to log in everyday to get my tokens or whatever to seak for the best armor.. you can get the best stats pretty fast, and because its the playstyle what makes the difference, 2 classes having the best armor will make still huge differences if not played well.

i could go on, but bottom line, I miss some things wow had to offer, but still GW2 is more relaxing and enjoyable for me.. besides that, the game is barely half year old and already in that time anet has improved so much things, that I see this game only getting better and better.","1359677848"

The company I work for is building a new 80,000 sqft corporate headquarters this year. I got really into making time lapses over the past year or so, so I had to seize this rare opportunity.

I arranged to have two 12' poles installed at the construction site in advance and today we mounted the [Brinno TLC200s](http://www.brinno.com/html/TLC200.html) in their customized hunting enclosures to begin taking test footage. Each camera has the wide angle lens accessory. They're both centered on where the action will be at roughly 90° from each other (camera 1 points south and camera 2 points east).

Ground breaking is scheduled for March 1. I'm collecting footage now to make sure my angles look good, play with frame intervals, and test battery life for a whole month. Having played with the TLC200s for a few months I'm very impressed at how long they can persist on four AA batteries. Coupled with a 32GB SD card in each unit I'm hoping to only have to climb up to maintain them once every couple of weeks.

Of course the main downside to the Brinnos is that there's no panning or shutter dragging of any kind. Fortunately I'm able to work with the general contractor (who's big into documenting the buildings he builds) and he's pretty enthusiastic about this project, so he'll keep me clued in on days they're doing really interesting stuff. For example, modern slab construction involves assembling most of the building's walls on the ground and then one day lifting them into place. On that day I'll be on-site, ground level, doing a proper panning shutter-dragged time lapse with a DSLR.","1359677854"

"volleyball","t5_2rcxy","I like running a format that I call King/Queen of the Court (it is not the same as the wave play game everyone has played at some point in practice) that might work really well for your typical game night.

When everyone arrives, they get a playing card and write their name on it. The cards all go in a stack and get shuffled, then teams are dealt just like hands are in a card game. Anyone who has to sit out gets shuffled in a separate stack that is dealt first for the next match. If players leave early, they remove their card from the deck so they aren't shuffled back in.

If you want to make it competitive, punch a hole in the cards of the winning team after each match. At the end of the event, those with the most holes in their cards are the kings/queens of the court. The element of chance/luck that factors in can be a lot of fun. It presents different challenges every match, and lets weaker players to, with luck, win matches and possibly the whole competition.","1359677855"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I understand that Mormon history is replete with conflict with Christians of pretty much all stripes, occasionally violent.  And this has caused some fundamental failures in your understanding about what we believe.

So:

* Just because I go to St. Seraphim's Cathedral (because we *are* the primary church of the diocese, and do have the bishop's throne) does not mean I worship St. Seraphim of Sarov (though he was, to put it mildly, a righteous dude).  I venerate him, yes, but not in any higher capacity than I do, say, St. James, the son of Zebedee (and brother of the St. John that wrote the Gospel) or St. Mary of Egypt, or St. Nicholas of Myra, or St. Tikhon of Moscow, or St. Raphael of Brooklyn, or Dimitri of Dallas...yeah, the list goes on.  
* I *do* venerate the Theotokos above the rest of the saints, though.  She is First of their number, and greater than the hosts of Heaven.  After all, she's God's mom.
* I worship the Triune God alone.
* Yes, I really do believe that the bread and wine become the actual Body and Blood of Christ during the Eucharist.  I make no commentary on how that happens (so I'm a little hesitant to use the T-word, which at least implies some neo-Platonic stuff that I don't even really understand well enough to speak to its orthodoxy).  That's why the Eucharist works.  It is the medicine of Immortality.

I would say that the baptisms for the dead would be, in a way, cooler if they involved actual corpses.  But I understand how unhygenic that would be.  No, I'm pretty sure most of us know that they're proxy baptisms.  But there's a lot about Mormon belief that we plain don't understand.","1359677856"

It reads the 1's and 0's as usual, and every five bits, it either outputs a letter, or doesn't do anything and goes to the next 5 numbers. So if you have a sequence, say 

101010111010011001011110110

 it would read

'TMRD'

To code this into java, if you made the sequence a string called code all you would need to stick in would be. 

int j = 0;

code = code.substring(0, code.length() - code.length%5) + ""M"";

while(code.length() &gt; 1)

{

if(code.substring(0,2)== ""111"")

      j+=1;

if(code.substring(0,4)==""00000"")

if(code.substring(0,4)==""00001"")

      system.out.print(""b"");

//and so on with the rest of the alphabet

code = code.substring(5);

}

That should print out the combinations, I think. I haven't used java in well over a year, so I'm sure this isn't the best way to do it (had to make it very inefficient due to my lack of knowledge), and there are probably some errors in syntax. int j is just how many five letter sets it skips.

If your bootloader is unlocked all you need to do is flash a SuperUser or SuperSU zip file using a custom recovery. (I recommend SuperSU)

[From this guide:](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/14kghb/how_to_unlockroot_your_nexus_4_with_adb_a/#linkt)

Just skip part 3 if you're sure your bootloader is unlocked (would have wiped your phone). If you want to keep stock rooted and get OTA updates make sure you follow the specific instructions under part 5.

Note that the SuperSU zip linked in that guide is out of date. You can still flash it and update it to the latest version from the Play Store after you root.","1359677863"

This is one of those diseases that society has done such a good job of suppressing that the memory of how absolutely awful it can be has somewhat been lost.

Basically, here's how skills in EVE and DUST work

1) Buy skillbook.  You're paying for the skillbook.  You're paying for the ability to spend SP to train the skill.  
2) Inject skillbook into brain (In DUST, this is done pretty much automatically when you select the ""Purchase and use"" option.  You can buy extra skillbooks, but at this point there doesn't seem to be a very good reason to.)
3) Once injected, the skill is at Level 0.  It's not really useful yet, but you have the option of training it.  
4) Train injected skills.  Once it's at level 0, you can either leave it there, or, more usually, you can spend unallocated SP in order to train it.  

Most gear you can only use if you have prerequisite skills trained to specific levels.  Other skills can only be trained once you have other skills to a certain level.  ","1359677873"

The problem people have here is the fact that even if Goth Annie is still buyable, most people who would like having it now will have to pay 3900 RP for a bundle of which they already own probably everything. That's the shitty part.

Goth Annie isn't really exclusive, it's just really expensive for somebody who already owns the bundle. Everybody can go and buy the skin right now, it's just that people don't, understandably so, want to shell 3900 for a single skin. So you have the whimsical people who bought it for 3900 as soon as the rework got announced, and the people who bought it on release and actually got a pretty nice deal since it's really cheap if you don't own anything. Which is why I don't get the deal everybody is making out of just enabling people to pay a fair price (actually more than what the skin costs if you count it within the bundle) for the damn skin.

I mean I don't even play Annie nor want the skin and I still find this pretty ridiculous.","1359677874"

"politics","t5_2cneq","While these are no doubt the right reactions to finding a gun, I question this course's effect on kids. Just how effective do you think those DARE programs and Prom Promises were?

Children already know a lot about guns. They are exposed to them all the time in TV and video games and our popular culture in general. Any kid knows how you hold a gun, what you use it for, and it's effect on the target. Children (particularly boys) are also *fascinated* with guns. They know they are dangerous, but unlike other things like big animals or deep water, they aren't scared of guns at all.

While this might do something to reduce completely accidental injuries in young kids by reinforcing that guns are *serious business*, I don't know how effective it would be beyond the adolescent stages where they naturally start pushing against boundaries. (around 10 or so) After all, guns can really play up that reptilian power fantasy that says ""I've got a *gun*. Nobody can tell *me* what to do.""

All in all, it sounds to me like it would be marginally effective at best. It may even apply more 'bad boy' appeal like the DARE program does.","1359677874"

Personally I'd rather see just the ones from 2012. There's been a simply astounding amount of talent from old favorites and new artists, I think a full year is quite a good range to draw from.

&gt;Should we increase the number of songs beyond 100? This will be a lot more work on my part, but I can probably manage it. The real question is if the increase in amount of music ought to be acknowledged by including more songs, or if we'd rather keep the mixtape more exclusive.

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","Your submission did not meet our posting guidelines and has been automatically removed.

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

They are NOT naturally done.  They are all still actually wearing makeup, including body makeup - it's just done with a much lighter hand.  The lighting is also very complimentary, and often they will publish the pictures in black and white to hide any major flaws. They photos are still retouched as well. They images are just as fake as they always are.  Not to mention, a lot of celebrities have 'semi-permanent' makeup - such as eyelash extensions, body-contoured tans (they apply shading in areas of the body and face to give dimension), semi-perm eyeliner, many of them have had minor botox or lip fillers.

It's all bullshit.  Do not be fooled by it.

It may be in cartoon-y style, but I certainly haven't seen a game other than BOI that melds together violence, female sexuality, scatology, religion, and physical deformity.

While he may think everything is fine at home, the kids or wife may see it really differently. My honest opinion is: if you have to ask people if they think something you're doing is acceptable, then you probably shouldn't be doing it. The fact that OP even asked this question shows that he is having doubts about that lifestyle. But of course people who are heavy marijuana users (as I used to be) are usually in some form of denial about why they have to smoke everyday and that there is anything wrong with it.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","I just flat out don't like them to be honest. It's like they're some kind of joke party that claims to be really left wing in the election and then governs in a deeply right wing coalition. 

Also the name is clearly joke, and one in poor taste. They call themselves Liberal Democrats and yet they want to rig the electoral system so that they are a permanent minority coalition partner. 

Look at this

http://i.imgur.com/YFhke.gif

Notice how AV and STV are more fair for the Lib Dems. They are not more fair for Others. Why is this important?

David Deutsch pointed out that AV is unfair because it has a tendency to make the third party a permanent part of government

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0pZ9LTZW1g

All the proposals for electoral reform are set up so that the fairness (difference between percentage of seats in Parliament and percentage votes) increases for the Lib Dems. It doesn't increase for other. If you look carefully at the Lib Dem proposal for STV they mention it will keep out extremists like the BNP. 

However that is disingenuous. STV as proposed by the Lib Dems would stop any 4th party getting seats in Parliament whilst massively increasing the number of seats the 3rd party gets

http://www.regionaltopup.co.uk/2011/05/08/stv-is-a-poor-choice-for-reform/

&gt; Note that the Liberal Democrats would have received something in the region of 162 seats under STV in the 2010 election. However, a look at the actual votes cast showed that they received 23% of the vote, which should have earned them around 149 seats in the Commons.

...

&gt; For example, in 2010 UKIP received 919,546 votes (3.1%) but no MPs. Under a purely proportional system, they should have had around 20 MPs elected. STV looks unlikely to change that.
&gt;
&gt; Let’s take a look at a specific region, the South East using the same ERS data as above:
&gt;
&gt; As you can see, under STV it is likely that the Greens would have lost their only seat in Brighton. Similarly UKIP, which received 4.1% of the vote in the South East, should have had at least three MPs elected under an ideal PR system. Under STV they still would not have any.

This is very important because as Deutsch said the only way to remove the 3rd party from government is a 4th party getting into 3rd place. Basically they've set the threshold high to stop this and then said it's to keep the BNP out. 

So they're not Democrats. Are they Liberal? Well look at how they react to UKIP supporters (UKIP should not be allowed in the debate), or to Eurosceptics (the public should not be allowed to vote on EU membership) and really anyone who disagrees with them on anything.

They're smug Guardian readers who are a tiny minority of the country and want to impose their bonkers views on everyone else.","1359677891"

"obama","t5_1a8ah","&gt; Spending. Government spending is down, and has been every year with exception to 2009 when we had the stimulus. It's hard to explain this to right wingers, because they simply cannot accept this as truth.

No, this isn't true.  As a % of GDP, government spending has been slowly climbing for the past 60 years.  2009 was just a giant leap forward that was well above the trend line, and it has reverted back to the mean a little bit.

Whether you think its a good thing or a bad thing is another question, but I don't think it is fair to say ""Government spending is down"" on any reasonable timescale.

Collecting on those tickets requires courts and judges and a bureacracy to keep track of it all.   When you figure the total cost of a cop, it's hard to see how even if he did absolutely nothing *but* write tickets, he would bring in more in revenue than you pay and compensate him for.   Municipalities do encourage cops to pick up revenue, of course, but that only partially offsets what they're paying out.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was at a restaurant with a few friends, and this obnoxious man and his wife comes in and sits down a few tables away from us. This was a Friday night, and the place was pretty packed, and service was clearly behind. His waitress had left his table for about a minute, when he stands up and shouts at the top of his lungs, ""WILL SOMEONE COME TAKE MY DRINK ORDER!"". The restaurant goes dead silent, and the waitress quickly runs over to take his order and tries to make an apology (I'm pretty certain she was somewhat new). Despite how busy she was, I noticed that she would continue to check on him multiple times throughout the meal. At the end of his meal, she took his plates, and as she started to walk away from him, he stands up, throws his napkin at her, and yells, ""Bring me my fucking check on your way back! I make more money than you, I should be getting better service!"" The restaurant does dead quiet again, and the waitress looks like she's about to start crying. For whatever reason, (I was already frustrated for events earlier in the day) I slam my fork down, stand up and just yell at him, ""What the fuck, I probably make more money than you, that doesn't give me the right to treat you like shit. Learn some manners!"". The guy is clearly stunned, as apparently no one had ever talked back to him in his life, and he leaves gets up to leave with his wife (the bill hasn't been paid). After he leaves, the restaurant starts to applause, and both the manager and waitress come over to thank me for saying what they couldn't. I ended up picking up his bill and leaving a 100 dollar tip on top, because I felt really bad for the waitress (she still looked a little shaken up from being yelled at twice). As I was leaving, she ran up to me and gave me a napkin with her number and a note saying, ""Text me, I'll buy you a drink"".

Nextel customers seemed to be idiots.

Also, despite only being in Canada, when callers found out I wasn't in America they could usually call me ""camel jockey"", ""sand n*gger"" or something in that nature.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","My personal advice would be to actually just try to get used to it.  I know it's probably extremely frustrating and annoying to you but people will just be like that.  You just have to literally not care.  But I will have to agree it's a lot worse at lower levels for I have no idea why people would even intentionally play on their low level smurfs unless they've been banned and are re-leveling (which probably explains their attitude) or something.

Some of those flamers/ragers on your team might even just be little kids.  Like kids will always look for an excuse or blame you to justify any mistake they made so again, it's best just to not care.  As for legitimate criticism on your play, you really don't have to listen to any of it if it's bothering you.  You can always mute them or even just outright ignore it and focus on your own play to self improve.  

I generally try to maintain a nice/positive attitude, or simply just not talk.  Whenever someone messes up I try not to say ANYTHING.  Could not just be their game, or they're simply bad but I'll try not to talk or provoke them.  It's frustrating seeing people endlessly feed or people shit talking you but whatever.

Although I'm no saint myself.  I'll have my random days of built up rage but generally I try to keep it myself.  I remember back when I was leveling I would be all nice and positive until someone insulted me, then I'd snap, but I've really really grown accustomed to just not care.  Nowadays if someone is plain out insulting me and I really don't feel like putting up for it I'll just straight up mute them instantly.  

Anyways epic wall of text.  Didn't expect to write that much at all but whatever.  It'll get a bit better, but the player base in this game is so large that there will ALWAYS be ragers and shit talkers regardless of what level your account is, so again just not care.  Yeah it's really annoying but whatever, just keep playing and get better.  

Good luck man and remember try to have fun d00d! :3

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","So, I know you said no direct answers, but I get carried away with problems like this, plus I wanted to get more familiar with RegEx anyways.  Turn back now if you'd rather fight your way through this one.

We want to find a string that DOESN'T have 3 y's AND 3 z's so:

    match = NOT(3y AND 3z)

Well Regex doesn't have AND, but on googling around, I found some black magic for ""NOT.""  So how can we make this work?  Well...  Let's bust out some logic.  AND can be re-expressed!  How?  Well:

    A AND B = NOT(NOT(A) OR NOT(B))

So, our A is 3y and our B is 3z.  What does this work out to be?  Well...

    match = NOT(NOT(NOT(3y) OR NOT(3z)))

NOT(NOT()) is equivalent to multiplying by -1 twice, so it can be eliminated to simplify:

    match = NOT(3y) OR NOT(3z)

*This* we can express.  First, how do we express 3y or 3z?  Well, it is at least 3 y's with anything in between.  This can be written as:

    ([zx]*[y][zx]*)([zx]*[y][zx]*)([zx]*[y][zx]*)

Or preferably:

    ([zx]*[y][zx]*){3,3}

3z looks like the opposite of this:

    ([yx]*[z][yx]*){3,3}

But what the hell is NOT in RegEx?  Well after some googling, it appears there is this nice little expression:

    ^((?!expression).)*$

How it works can be found [here.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406230/regular-expression-to-match-string-not-containing-a-word)  So let's toss 3y in it to see what it looks like:

    ^((?!(([xz]*[y][xz]*){3,3})).)*$

Yikes.  Well, it works at least.  So lets OR it with the other one, but let's do something carefully:  ^ and $ are anchors for the expression.  They don't really have any logical purpose, but they anchor the match to the start and end of the line, so we can avoid any nasty multi-match scenarios.  This means our expression will look like:

    match = ^(NOT(3y) OR NOT(3z))$

So let's plug and chug:

    ^(((?!(([xz]*[y][xz]*){3,3})).)*|((?!(([xy]*[z][xy]*){3,3})).)*)$

This appears to work! *Exhales.*

Then desktops were slowly replaced with ones that had cheap integrated graphics cards. We could no longer run any games. Even Windows and eventually linux had some rendering issues. Morale went down, we started to lose people. 

Couple years go by and HR/Heads wonder what happened to the culture.

But the memories and constant intrusions will always be there. The only thing you can do is adjust yourself in the present to expect them, and to handle them as best you can.

In fact, hitting the abs for long periods of time tends to cause pain in my back, and I certainly don't want a muscular imbalance that hurts my posture.

Of course, I supplement with pure ab sessions too (oh vanity, thy name is substandardgaussian), but considering how good I feel making sure I work the whole core, I find that hyper-focusing on abs is incredibly overrated.

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Random thoughts in no particular order:

It's great for some, but not for everyone. You'd be entering in at a time when the military is drawing down a bit, so the slots are more competitive and some of the jobs you might want might not be available. Just remember that until you sign the contract, everything is on YOUR terms. You don't like the deal you're getting, you can simply walk away and try another time. But once you sign your name, you're committed. 

It's hard to beat the benefits- they'll pay for school, put a roof over your head, train you. You'll make friends, you'll develop confidence, you'll possibly learn organization (I... didn't). But make no mistake- your job is to kill people, indirectly or directly. You might never have to pull the trigger outside of the shooting range, but understand that you'll be part of an organization that trains to be lethal. The Army has a saying, ""every soldier's a rifleman""- that means that no matter what your job is, from veterinarian's assistant to radio operator, you're expected to be prepared to commit violence if you need to. Some people will have a problem with that, and will judge you for your profession. Be prepared for that.

That being said, there's a lot of jobs to choose from- be sure you pick something that you want to do. Changing jobs is possible, but rare and comes with certain issues. 

Now, I was in the Army, so I'm familiar with basic training, rather than the Navy's boot camp. But either way, it's designed to break you down and form you into a part of a team. Let it. A lot of kids that you'll see have been coddled their whole life and they try to fight against it- you'll watch them break. I'm not saying, by any means to lose your personality or even your individuality, I'm saying only to recognize it for what it is- it's a game. The drill sergeants don't hate you, they're not going to hurt you, and you didn't forget to lock your locker (they cut the lock, jokes on you); don't take it too seriously and allow yourself to enjoy it. You'll be sore as you exercise muscles that you might not have exercised before and it'll take a while to get used to the field rations, but you can get through it. I had a blast, because I just rode it out. And if you're doing a road march and the chaplain joins your company... try to stay near him. They won't gas the chaplain. If they offer you milk and cookies, don't take it- you'll be going to the gas chamber that day. They will lie to you and tell you it coats your esophagus- it really just curdles in your stomach and makes you vomit.  

Be prepared for the possibility that you will deploy. That's becoming less likely for the moment, but take a look at world conditions. You might never deploy, or you might, but realize that the possibility (almost) always exists. If they tell you that ""your job doesn't deploy,"" be suspicious. Go home and Google it- which is probably good advice for anything they tell you. Don't turn down the GI bill- you pay $100 out of your first 12 paychecks, but it's worth it. They will drug test you before you can sign, be clean. 

If you make it past basic (you should, barring medical issues), take advantage of every opportunity. Take classes- the Army education system lets you take university-level classes while you're in that don't draw against your GI bill benefits. Take correspondence courses, too, they both help you get promoted. Make friends- some of them you'll keep in touch with for life, but watch yourself if you go out drinking with 'em. Soldiers are people, too- some of them are good guys, and some of them aren't. 

edit: smartdrug had good advice about going commissioned. Do bear in mind that more time is required from you in the officer corps, but well worth it if that's what you want to do. If you go commissioned, for the love of God, listen to your experienced NCOs. 

That's all I got for the moment; good luck. ","1359677925"

The issues of access to firearms has never really been anything to get the slightest concern from the British public, in fact frequently when we hear of the school massacres and shoot outs in the USA (of course they happen outside the USA too, but they get far less coverage) there is almost a sense of relief that we have such strict gun laws, and that by on large currently gun crime is an immense rarity (41 homicides committed by firearm across England and Wales in 2012).

Not always true, on fact for more minor accidents they are less likely to be reported to police and insurance. Similarly, factors like overall wealth can impact the reporting rate.

"germany","t5_2qi4z","Where are you from?

From my experience and what I've heard from others, uni in Germany isn't the booze and sex-filled craze it seems to be in some other countries. Mainly because most of us had our experimental phase with those things during school, but also because campus life doesn't have the same bubble feeling.

That being said, it's hard to generalize. From my experience, German girls tend to be less open than in the UK or US, which means that a typical US girl may unwillingly lead men on by simply being friendly and chatty to everyone. Still, you can have your fair share of one night stands and most people won't care. The whole FWB thing isn't big here, it seems that most are in commited relationship or rely on ONS to get through being single (which doesn't mean you won't find a man for an arrangement like that).

As for dating, don't expect too much. You most likely won't be picked up or brought home (except for sex) and the man paying everything is not a very established concept, so be prepared to split the bill, especially on a first date (seems weird, but why waste money on a girl you don't know that well). What men expect depends on what men you date, there really is no way of telling in general. As far as I'm aware, there is no ""three dates means sex"" rule (is that even a thing elsewhere?) or something comparable, so you'll just have to wing it. Talking is key, just like everywhere else.

There's just a lot of ground taking up the image, and I think the sky and trees would be much more aesthetically pleasing than the ground.

I think the bridge is real pretty, but there is way too much ground present in this image.  I think if you stepped down off that woodchip area and maybe focus a little more on the bridge and sky, this would look very pretty :)","1359677929"

"halo","t5_2qixk","Like others have said it's called staying alive and it's a huge deal in team games. Halo is all about dealing damage (and hopefully finishing kills) while taking minimal damage and not dying. The fact that you have shields makes this a key game mechanic. Learning when to push, when to hold, and when to turn tail and run is something that will take an average player to a pretty good player and great team mate.

Kills win you games but deaths lose them. You have to manage your deaths to give yourself a chance to win first. That's why to play at a high level you have to just turn and get out of the fight sometimes. 

To answer the original question it is hardly ever a good idea to chase. The fact that you do is probably more a testament that you don't play with friends or anyone to clean up your kills. Halo 4 and the boltshot punishes people who chase more than any halo game before. You could be full shields and run into someone's boltshot and die when they were one shot. I would suggest playing with friends and calling out one shots to team members to finish the kill that way.","1359677930"

Number three is, you should have your emotions moved to tears, could be happiness or joy.

"SimCity","t5_2ryr3","Not quite sure why this is getting downvoted as it is a perfectly valid question. The last ""proper"" SimCity, SimCity 4, does not appear to have a demo. The 2013 SimCity also does not currently have a demo, though given that last week's ""beta weekend"" was basically a glorified 1 hour demo there is certainly the possibility that EA/Maxis will release something similar in the future, but for now there is currently no way to play it nor any confirmation it will be made into a proper demo. There is in fact a demo for SimCity Societies, but it is different enough from the classic SimCities and the 2013 SimCity that I wouldn't suggest it.

As far as your actual options, I personally see two (and a possible 3rd): The original 1989 SimCity has been released as open source and can be played at [micropolisonline.com](http://micropolisonline.com) under the original Micropolis name due to the name being copyrighted even when the source code is not. Of course much has changed since the original 1989 game, but I suppose deep down the basics of laying roads, zoning RCI, and so forth exist in both the '89 and '13 versions, so it would give you a rough idea.

The other option is SimCity Social, which is a Facebook version. I have no idea what this is like as I've not played it, and given most Facebook games I would recommend the original Micropolis over this. 

The final possible option is one of the two SimCity games for the Nintendo DS - they are not free, but GameStop.com lists them as available in stores for $7 and $10. Again, haven't played these but they appear to be based off of the main line series, so they should give you a good indicator.","1359677933"

The fact that it's harmful to **you** isn't the reason you can't smoke in the courthouse, it's the fact that you are also harming other people through no fault of their own. These types of bans are not there to protect you, they're there to protect the people around you who didn't choose to inhale secondhand smoke/vapor.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","You can choose happiness. That's a fact. But sometimes feelings will get the best of you. I suffer from sudden bursts of pathological intoxications. They are triggered by anger while intoxicated. I've learned to control them somewhat but sometimes they just come out, and it's scary. It feels like my head is about to go up in flames, and then I let everything go, everything goes black, and all of a sudden I'm somewhere else or someone is on the ground bleeding. It's scary as fuck. My point here is that emotions will probably get the better of you at some point- like a trauma or when in love- but that shouldn't stop you from choosing all the happiness you can. I hope you'll be realistic with the wisdom you've gained, because if you're not, the emotional backlash will be more sincere simply because you *thought* you could handle it.

Generally, you will get better performance and slightly lesser resources usage all around.

Next, according to discussions on spigot forums, [Privileges](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/privileges/) is the lightest weight and fastest permissions plugin. So drop whatever you're using and convert to that.

I think your haircut could use some work, check out [/r/MaleHairAdvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice), I have only started lurking the sub today but it looks promising.

I like the outfit but I think the fit could be a little better, check out [/r/MaleFashionAdvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice). I have fallen in love with this sub, and has taken my wardrobe from baggy jeans, cargo shorts and screen tees to well fitting jeans (still looking for well priced pastel/neutral shorts!) great fitting v-necks that complement my figure/face, awesome button ups, cardigans, I'm going to stop because this could go on :P But I really recommend keeping your own style in the mix, alot of what I wear is on the fringe or outside of what MFA advises, but it's my style so its ok. Oh also spend ALOT of time on the sidebar, they have SO much great info. Read everything twice or three times (first read threw the colors section I was like ""I'm not gay enough to have to worry about this shit"" but after reading a couple times it makes sence!)

The reason the moon is a glowing ball is because you didn't expose correctly.    
The Moon is in full daylight. So you have to expose just like you would on a sunny day.  Try ISO400, f/11, 1/500.

"moped","t5_2rd89","My preference would be the NC50, of course because I have experience with them.

Otherwise, I absolutely LOVED my express when I had it (I say had because I sold it a year or so ago). It pulls hills like a 2-speed bike and just doesnt stop running. They are ok to work on, definitely not nearly as easy as a Puch/Tomos, but they are so well built that they rarely require maintenance outside of checking the trans oil and spark plug every now and then. As for finding stock parts, no bueno; there arent really any companies that sell replacement parts for the Express. Plenty of people have parts for sale on flea-bay, but they are generally out of this world expensive. Some companies such as MLM/Weak-Ends are making a few aftermarket parts for them, but stock parts are tough to come by.

There is no need to be angry when people are hurt by the words of others. Take for example this picture. Everyone is freaking out over the title giving a description of the actual picture. ""Girl gamer,"" a picture of a girl gaming. Look at all these negative comments about women who play video games. Attention whoring posers etc... It's not even a real woman it's a fucking painting! There is clearly a problem here. People just want to feel equally as welcome to do things as everyone else. If a person feels like they should not participate in something just because of a certain characteristic they have (that wouldn't affect their ability), we have a problem in society. I don't want men to feel like they can't dance ballet. I don't want women to feel like they can't game. Yet, the ""club"" mentality keeps many people from doing things. Telling these people to just get over it isn't an answer either. We should all just work together to recognize these issues and stand up for each other. Not just in gaming, but in life, we are all just people and we need to quit putting ourselves into tiny groups so we feel accepted.","1359677946"

It's not like you don't have the option of sitting down your kids alone and telling them your side of the story before she can get to them. And if it doesn't turn out well then maybe they would be mad for a while that it was because you wanted sex and she didn't, but as they get older they could probably learn to understand and forgive. But it is harder to forgive when you retaliate with something as bad or worse. A parent cheating can really screw up with the child's ideas of relationships when they get older. Divorcing before that happens at least shows that you have constraint and that it is ok to end a relationship because someone is not getting something out of the relationship.","1359677947"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","The best thing to understand about cunnilingus is that (almost) everything you see in porn is *wrong.* (It's done that way so you can *see* the tongue action.) You want to approach it the same way you'd make out with a girl's ""other"" lips. There are tons of threads on here about technique ... the most important thing to remember is that everyone is different. 

That's why encouraging her to learn to masturbate, and be comfortable enough to do it in front of you (*so* hot!) will be an immense help. If that's too much for her at this point, keep trying different shit, and solicit her feedback about what she loved, thought was alright, and didn't really care for (you can talk about it somewhat at the time but until she's more comfortable, you may have better luck talking about it hours/days later, in a non-sexual atmosphere). 

Another extremely important aspect is rhythm. Changing things up every once in a while is great at first, but once she's getting close, most girls need you to stick to exactly what you're doing or you're going to fuck up their concentration and make them start all over, and/or piss them off. 

Hint: If she's jerking/spasming (and not actually cumming), you're probably going too hard; ease up a bit if that happens. 

Best of luck and enjoy the hell out of the learning process!

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","21% iOS versus around 50-60ish percent for Android (I forget the exact figure). And again that's only with one phone that runs iOS. In what way is that not impressive? An operating system that runs on only one phone has only slightly less than half the market share of an OS that runs on hundreds. That's a win in my book. 

And this ""iPhone is on the way out"" fantasy is just not based in reality. It's an idea that has seeped in since Steve Jobs died, that somehow Apple doesn't have ""it"" anymore, whatever ""it"" is, and that they are bound to lose dominance. But if you look at hard facts, after initially losing market share to Android in the US and worldwide, Apple has been steadily gaining it back. 

In the early adopter tech community, yeah the iPhone can be pretty boring. Of course it is boring to people that want cutting edge tech and get bored of new gadgets after 6 months. But to normal people (i.e. 85-90% of the market), the iPhone is a reliable, fast, and capable phone and is not seen as being dated.

In general though, the team played well, there was no media fiasco or player related drama over the exits and the Red Sox were not better than us.  The Arod years have been filled with drama from a player who thinks more of himself than the team.  The Red Sox won 2 WS.  The team, despite having good records, are painful to watch in the postseason.*  There has been a notable difference.

I mean, I'm not going to say there were *no* bubbles, but they didn't appear on the wet screen.  The canister sat for about a day before I coated the screen.

Ha!  I had been spraying it a while (5-7 minutes) and *nothing* was happening.  So, I figured I was about to re-claim the screen and start over anyway.  Then, I thought, ""see what happens if you rub it"".  I feel like I got lucky, because the edges held.  What's the worst that can happen beyond messing up the stencil (you eluded to something worse)?

Ok, here's a question.  You say keep spraying it.  Well, will anything bad happen if I spray it too long?  I halfway wondered if the whole thing wouldn't start melting away.

I'll try the black black ground next time and tell you how it goes (with pics!)

I'm using the Ryonet starter kit and I just can't help but think they set it all up (wattage, arm distance, emulsion) after experimenting so that the beginner didn't have to worry about exposure time.

In a ""can you do it with a turing machine?"" type of sense, yeah, of course you can't (they're deterministic by design, all of them). random.org uses atmospheric noise (radio tuned to a station nothing transmits on, sampled) which is a good way but not always that easy since interference sources could render it much less than random easily (not random.org in particular, but doing the same thing). You can measure other things like atmospheric phenomena or even go quantum on it (individual events tend to be statistically predictable, but individually separate), but that too is a little hard.

After all no one wants to bore the lords of everything while some IT guy and the prospective hire go all Charlie Brown's parents at each other. An executive might throw a question at you, but it will likely be easy, or impossible (my laptop can't join my home network...), and not that big a deal. 

Something else to think about, the further up in the organization a person is the more they think in terms of money. So explain things in terms of money. One of the largest complaints executives have about their workforces is that the employees don't think in terms of profit and loss, or even understand what their role is in the larger goal.

My zanpaktou would be called: ""The way of the Pisces"" and it's release command would be: ""Let us follow"". My sword would dissapear and my shins and arms start glowing, after that I get silver forearm-long gauntlets and shinplates encrested with the sign of pisces. 

It's ability would be to control pressurized water. I would be able to shoot it from my gauntlets and shingaurds. This allows me to reach incredible speeds by blasting myself of with water and use water pressure to either superpower my punches and kicks or to shoot pressurized water in different ways. Like water blades, cannons, a shield etc.

My bankai would be called: ""Celestial pond"". I gain a light-weight armor of silver scales around certain parts of my body. My original powers are boosted, but I gain an extra power called: ""heavenly fish"". From my hands I can summon fish made of glowing water which are semi intelligent, but under command with my mind. These fish are actually bundles of pressurized water which explode on their own or my command. They can explode in to whirlpools or water jets or even form a cage of pressurized water around someone. Basically small bombs capable of massive explosions of water and capable of becoming attacking or defensive waves are swimming through the air all around you, while you are being attacked by me on top of this.


One of my greatest technique's is constelation cannon, with two pisces circling my stretched out arms I can create an pressurized cannon of water so strong it can demolish almost anything not strengthened by kido.

I have one ultimate technique called: ""Mirror dance of the twin fish"". I would summon two fish, but these two are gargantuan and fast. Before you know it they will be swimming around you in opposing circles. While you try to escape a ripping wall of water comes up and you realize that the fish are both creating whirlpools spinning in the opposite direction of eachother, but the whirlpools don't affect each other. Then the whirlpools close in and you are caught in them. While they do not affect each other or me they do effect everything else in the whirlpool. The opposing currents are so strong, pulling in different directions that they rip everything within the double whirlpool to shreds.

    1. Enter a system and drop 4-8 probes.  
    2. Open the map interface.
    3. Set all probes to max range and scan
    4. Pick a signature.  
    5. Center your probes over your chosen signature (hold shift to move them as a group)
    6. Shrink the probe radius around the signature (shift to resize all at once, alt to move them all in at once).  
    7. Scan
    8. Repeat 5-7 until you lock the sig
    9. Repeat 4-8 until all sigs are locked (or until you find a site you want to run).
    10. Warp to the site and proceed to run it (for the beginning, you'll want to do Radar and Magnetometric sites)

For a beginner probing ship, I would suggest something like this (add a gun of your choice in the last highslot, maybe a 75mm rail gun to keep some more of the agro on you).  Just fly around outside of the NPCs' range and kill them.  Then salvage/hack/analyze and then open the diamond shaped cans that were there when you got there to get the loot.

I had mine serviced/repaired a few years ago, which involved mailing it back to IWC. The final bill was over $700.

I'm looking at [pictures of the 3717 movement](http://www.friendsoforis.com/forum/index.php?/topic/36480-watchmaking-fixing-a-jammed-date-mechanism/), and I'm not sure how different our watch movements are.

I think the current tier/pvp sets as well as the 5.2 ones are a lot like early Cata in the hit and miss department. I love my White Tiger set, I hate the aforementioned rogue set.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","The amount of people who have jumped to slag off Asimov here is astounding. If you read his works regarding himself, you'd realise that he was very much aware of his weaknesses, as well as being aware of his strengths. He was not some sort of ego monster, he was a very clever dude who realised that he was, when compared to the average human, clever. He was also, despite the often serious tone of his writings, not a dead serious man; he, like most humans, were capable of *making jokes*. I might be wrong, but this sounds more lighthearted than anything, like a friend saying ""well, he's good looking, but *everyone* pales in comparison to me"".

But even if he was being serious, are we *really* going to try to bring  down the reputation one of the most prolific and intelligent writers of the past century just because he was open about his intelligence? Whenever it's about other things, like people saying ""I'm not very good, but here's [a picture I drew/song I wrote/whatever], all the top comments are saying ""stop doubting yourself! There's no shame in being proud of a talent!"" So why is Asimov ok to accuse of being egotistical while any Redditor that does the same is encouraged? Right now, if you post a picture of yourself after losing a load of weight, you'll be upvoted to the heavens. All that is is saying ""look at how amazing I am!"", even if they try to dress it up as something else, but they're congratulated.

In the end, I'd say Asimov was likely joking, but even if he wasn't, so what? He *was* a genius, and whether y'all like to admit it or not, if he was boasting about how he lost weight, the majority would be singing his praises. 


Yeah I love Asimov.


EDIT: a Redditor pointed out that Asimov passed from AIDS. Just realised that this makes my comment about him losing weight a bit tasteless... Just pointing out that I never meant to relate what I said to his passing.","1359677993"

Singapore does not have a robust safety net, and there is little poverty and unemployment is extremely low. It is one of the least regulated and economically free countries in the world. Only the very poorest of the poor are subsidized, but this seems to be people literally incapable of working.

&gt;Subsidies add money to the economy by giving it to poor people who go out and (hopefully) spend it on food/shelter/basic necessities. 

It doesn't add money to the economy because the money either came the economy itself through taxes, or through borrowing which inevitably comes out of the economy to pay back.

&gt;Are you asserting that poor people can take care of their children without state subsidies or that they should?

Both, but another part of the issue is increasing barriers for them to be able to, which is due to government regulation, which oddly means the government is further forcing people into dependency by doing so.

&gt;I don't misunderstand capitalism entails.. I just don't see how making more prisons and rewarding incarceration helps our society.

I think we agree there; I think we should decriminalize all drugs, which will not only reduce incarceration for drug use/possession, but also reduce violent associated with conflict resolution in their black markets.

&gt;Of course people with shorter sentences reoffend more often. The ones with longer sentences are still in prison (possibly offending in there).

No I mean the portion that reoffend is larger among those with shorter sentences.

&gt;I've no doubt it would encourage people to adopt/foster. However, I just don't see a large enough percentage of the population stepping up. Orphanages would be the most likely result.

Who said it had to the US population? Making international adoption easier would help even more people.

&gt;Dissolving safety nets for people in need just breaks down the society by forcing more people into criminal behavior (society harmful)

Based on what? Crime goes up when there is less legitimate work available, so again it's about employment and not creating black markets.

&gt;Schools have limited resources - I taught at a State university for 6 years (ending in 2011) and it was hard to find rooms big enough for some of the classes - not to mention when 1 Instructor has 120 students grading and individual attention suffers.

That could easily be an issue of the school being wasteful with resources since they have no incentive to improve or the signal mechanism for improvement are perverse/distorted.

&gt;As for the parents, all to often, they're still children. Taking them away and putting the children someplace else (ie. the arms of an adopting person(s) or an orphanage) doesn't seem to do anything to promote responsibility since all the parents need to do is grow another baby until the state stops taking them away.

It's hard to pump out another baby when you're imprisoning them for neglect. 

You say you want people to be more responsible, but you don't want to hold people accountable. You can't have it both ways.

&gt; Not paying a living wage forces more people into criminal (societally harmful) behavior.

No it doesn't. Increasing unemployment does, and the more expensive employees are the fewer that get hired.","1359677994"

In that case, what has the pregnancy issue brought up during the court's session got to do if Alan is a homosexual? The only current danger involved in his participation in sexual activity would be STDs (now STIs apparently) and that has a different solution than banning sexual activity altogther.

Also, I'd like to protest the very though that the courts might have any say about what takes place in a person's bedroom. That is a private affair and even if he's not intelligent enough to understand the ramifications, the court has no right to intervene if he is legally an adult.

Why not get revenue by taking pictures and giving them to the client? I find it almost bordering on unethical to lock down the client for the rest of their lives whenever they need a copy of a picture or two. And then to charge exorbitant fees to furnish those copies. Some of the pro-photographers go a step further a charge a maintenance fee to back up the high-res images.

Many of these also attempt to put the entire responsibility for fixing these problems on men, completely ignoring that men are nearly as often victims of domestic violence, and that women are more likely to commit acts of violence against children than men are.

The issue is that there is NO GOOD REASON to make laws like this which are gender exclusive. Violence affects everyone and NO ONE deserves it.

Creating special laws to 'protect' half of society from the other half is tantamount to saying that one half of society is inherently violent and abusive while the other is prone to be victims.

And it's not at all about ""how the time travel worked."" Nobody cares how time-travel works. Time travel *doesn't* work; it's impossible. So the more a writer tries to explain it, the harder it is to swallow the story.

It's about having events follow each other in a *plausible* way. *Looper* was not a character-driven film; most of what happens in the movie doesn't happen because of a character's agency. It's a *plot-*driven film. Most of what happens happens because the writer decided it would happen. Problem is, the things the writer decided would happen weren't particularly plausible.

There's a lot of things that it's easy to find okay when you want them to be okay. As humans we can find justification for all sorts of terrible things - christian or not.

From my PoV it sounds like they just wanted each other and the ""helping me find Jesus"" is just something they're fooling themselves with to justify the situation. Honestly I don't think this guy's too much of a stand up christian. He can walk the walk, but isn't interested in making the kind of personal sacrifices to live up to the code he supposedly adheres too. 

Frankly if he were a firm Christian-

*He wouldn't have been okay with premarital sex.

*He definitely wouldn't have asked for an abortion.

*He would have proposed marriage as soon as he learned of the pregnancy.

*He wouldn't have suggested adoption.

*He wouldn't already be with someone else.

I was curious how well they worked since they cost less than a days worth of paint. I asked to borrow it and my buddy and I walked past the safety net onto the field without masks (it was between matches). I took aim and emptied the gun, kept pulling the trigger and had just CO2 coming out. I thought it'd be funny to shoot my friend in the face with some gas, so I aimed it at his head. As I pulled the trigger he slapped the barrel to the side and we hear a pop-splat as the paintball hit a tree next to him. Turns out there was 1 shot left rattling around in there somehow.

edit to reduce vagueness:

violating his oath of office to uphold the constitution by sponsoring mccain-feingold, aka BCRA, Pub.L. 107–155, 116 Stat. 81, enacted March 27, 2002, H.R. 2356, parts of which have been found unconstitutional in mcconnell v fec, FEC v Wisconson right to life, davis v fec, and Citizens United.

Feingold was defeated for re-election on November 2, 2010 by Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson by a margin of 52% - 47%
My hypothesis is that at least 3% of WI voters will vote against an oathbreaker. I think this is also a factor in why McCain lost.

I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.

Use promo code HARBOWL at superbiiz, and it will take the CPU price down to $71-72 after shipping (limited time).

I went with the CPU because for &lt;$100, you're getting a solid CPU that should overclock to 4.0ghz with minimal effort, and a solid budget aftermarket cooler. Even if you're not an overclocker, it will take less than 15mins learning how to change the multiplier in bios and getting this thing to 4ghz. I considered an FX 6300 for this build, but that will cost you $50-60 and I don't think that's worth it.

The motherboard I think is good for it's price imo. Should be fine for overclocking, and has all the features you should want like sata3, usb 3.0, crossfire/SLI ability, etc.

The HDD, you could go with that 1tb, or if you need more space, this [Seagate 1.5tb](http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=70854&amp;vpn=ST1500DM003&amp;manufacture=Seagate&amp;promoid=1292) is $68 after shipping (at the time I'm typing this, could change).

The PSU is a good quality unit with more than enough watts. Only downside is it's not modular. Plus, if you buy it today, you can use [this](http://images10.newegg.com/uploadfilesfornewegg/rebate/SH/Newegg/Antec17-371-031_46057Jan25Jan3113ll97.pdf) MIR in addition to the one on the Newegg page and get another $10 off, making it a steal at $30.

The GPU I picked is a 7870 TAHITI LE. It's performance is between a 7870 and 7950. This card should run every game very well at 720p. If you were to use up more of the budget, I would go with a [7950](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sapphire-video-card-1003522l), but that will set you back $280, and I think the price:performance on the 7870LE higher is imo.

I LOVE how tainted pact plays.  The effect is so much fun and creates some real tension as you flip.  Not an optimal card, but I really enjoy it.

Artisan is a very easy replace in the deck.  I will be taking it out for cryp ghast.  It that betrays is the 2nd best eldrazi after ulamog,  the card is very unfair!

The alter was gifted to me and was done by a local artist.  there is indeed fingerprints in the blood.

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","I would highly recommend that you each have your own pack, unless maybe your wife has some disability that prevents her from carrying anything.  You don't want to carry 50 pounds on a longish distance hike. For one thing you would need a huge pack to carry two sleeping bags, two pads, double food, double water and a tent.  And for another you will be at much greater risk of injury with such a heavy load.  As for what specific gear, go to REI or an outfitter and they will hook you up.  You have a pretty good list of what to bring, so really just get that stuff.  You will want a map and compass **and the ability to use them** too, but that is specific to each trail.  You didn't mention this, but you will need pots to cook in.  The easiest thing for the two of you to do is to get a set of two aluminum pots, and you can each cook and eat out of one.  You can try cooking together but really with the food most people take backpacking, its easier just to cook separately.  

For sleeping bags, get something rated ~10 degrees lower than the temperatures you expect to see at night.  Down is best if you are going to keep doing this, as it is lighter and packs down smaller, and lasts longer, but you have to be responsible about keeping it dry.

For sleeping pads, Thermarest is a great brand, but there are many other good ones too.  Inflating &gt; foam, in my opinion.

For tents, the REI Half Dome 2 is a classic tent, not super heavy, big enough for two people, and priced pretty well.  You can get lighter and smaller, and you can get roomier and heavier, but the Half Dome 2 is a good compromise.

For packs, Osprey and Gregory both have great reputations and warranties.  Deuter and REI are also good.  ArcTeryx is great but way too expensive imo.  Gregory packs tend to be heavier and more expensive, but I find them to be more comfortable, to the point where I don't mind the weight.  You will want to try them on before you buy or you might be very miserable if they fit badly.  Get a capacity that is suitable for the rest of your gear, but 45-70 seem to be the most common.  Be careful with the smaller sizes though, don't get a 45 unless you know all your gear will fit or you can be in a bind.  In the same vein, don't get a huge pack just because.  Unless you are really disciplined about it, you will naturally fill the extra space with unnecessary items.  That said, (and I am sure others will *strongly* disagree with me) a 70 L pack isn't a bad thing if you can strap it down when you don't need the room.  I would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.

For stoves, the simplest option is to get an isobutane canister stove like [this](http://www.rei.com/product/660163/msr-pocket-rocket-backpacking-stove).  They are fairly cheap (30-50$), easy to use, small and light.  Homemade alcohol stoves are smaller cheaper and lighter, but they can be finicky in a number of ways.  If you are cooking for lots of people or want something super rugged and dependable in any weather, a white gas stove like the whisperlite would be the way to go, but it's a bit overkill for most applications.

For headlamps, get something small that works.  90% of what I use my headlamp for is finding something in my pack at night or going to the bathroom, you don't really need to go all out here.

There are a few options for water purification.  Tabs and droplets like iodine and aquamira are the smallest and cheapest, but they take awhile to work and some people don't like the taste.  You can get a super light filter like the sawyer squeeze, which is what I use, but some people have trouble with them breaking.  Bigger filters are more rugged, but heavier.  Finally, UV filters are becoming more common, but they are expensive, need batteries, and require the water to be prefiltered if it is cloudy.

As for looking like you're reliving High school, those jackets (IMHO) look like they are worn by kindergarten baseball coaches pretending to be in the MLB or whatever it's called. 
I've heard whiffs of people saying that the classic high school varsity jacket on older-ish men is coming into fashion, I've even seen them used in some good street wear inspiration albums - look to jdbee's recent one for example.

Honestly, it's wise to go cheap until you find your style, so buy that blue one you like, excitement with how/what to wear it with and then go more expensive when/if you want to.

EDIT: on my phone, so can't find the link, but go to the French connection website, it's a darkest navy with Red ""F"" varsity jacket, I really like it both for fit and quality. Easily the most quality jacket I've bought so far (I'm a noobie)","1359678038"

conversation about the assignment ensues.     maybe I take her out, show her a good time. she's recently divorced, I'm single too. we can get together maybe when the kids are at their other parents house. oh, your kids are gone next week too? maybe we can go bowling, then to a malt shoppe!

You might also want to hold off on the changes until after the Warpgate switch.  I suspect quite a bit of the Magrider K:D imbalance is due to having the ""high"" warpgate on Indar.

Perhaps they have put some error detection in now to compensate for errors like yours, but you were definitely screwing up your URL encoding.

&gt; This should also work, but it doesn't in iOS 5.x and 6.0:

&gt;     itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=http://mydomain.com/my%20test/my%20App.plist

No, that should not work.  The `%20` gets decoded to a space, which is not a valid character in a URL.  The `url` parameter contains a space in the URL when it should have an encoded `%20` in the URL.

You need to encode the space as `%20` to put it in the HTTP URL, then you need to encode the `%` as `%25` because you are putting *that* into an itms-services URL.  The end result is a double encoding of `%2520`, which represents a space in an inner URL which is wrapped in an outer URL.

You're sill struggling with this weeks later?  If you had just listened the first time, this would have been working for you weeks ago.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","Att tidningsjournalisters - och även politikers - kontakt med vanligt folk inte är särskilt stark är förmodligen det enda vi kan hålla med varandra om. Betyder inte att de skulle bli rasistsvin (eller förlåt, ""oroliga invandringskritiska medborgare"") som du om de helt plötsligt fick den kontakt du efterfrågar.

Om du redogör för din källa kanske jag tar din ""statistik"" under beaktande, men erfarenhet säger mig att det antingen är du eller din källa som förvrider verkligheten. Förövrigt har jag svårt att föreställa mig att asylsökande skulle aktivt begå handlingar som skulle äventyra deras redan låga chans att få stanna. Låter väldigt ologiskt och kontraproduktivt.

&gt;En svensk domstol har sagt till dem att ge sig av.
&gt;I vilka andra fall anser du att man inte ska lyda domstolen och svenska lagar? Skita i svenska myndigheter.

""Lagen framförallt"". Så nobelt. Synd att du inte lever som du lär. Fast i ""ditt Sverige"" kommer ju inte förtal eller hets mot folkgrupp vara några lagbrott längre, så det kvittar väl.

Anyway... ja, jag anser att de har den mänskliga rättigheten att inte lyda rättsväsendets beslut när deras fri- och rättigheter, kanske tillochmed deras liv, står på spel om de skickas tillbaka till sitt ursprungsland. Skattebrott eller fyllekörning går knappast under rubriken ""handlingar att begå när du befinner dig i livsfara"".

Många utvisade flyktingar har gått döden till mötes. Det är inte för inte som Sverige har kritiserats för bristande respekt för mänskliga rättigheter, och tillochmed fällts i internationella domstolar.

**TL;DR - Din världsbild är felaktig. Man blir inte rasist som tror att alla icke-vita har brottsligheten inprogramerad i sina gener så fort man har ""kontakt med verkligheten"". Det mänskliga livet och värdigheten är överordnade lagen. Att skickas tillbaka till exempelvis Irak är som att utdöma tortyr följt av dödsstraff för brott som inte begåtts (straff som Sverige officiellt har avskaffat och fördomer, men tydligen inte ser några hinder att möjliggöra att det äger rum utanför våra gränser)**","1359678047"

""I'm sorry, what was your name again?""

Anyone who has an unusual name should be used to spelling it out to people over the phone.  My last name isn't *too* weird but it's a bit uncommon so I automatically spell it out every single time someone asks for my name.

Actually it doesn't just apply to names, but any time you ask someone to repeat something.  I have friends that can get to talking fast and run words together sometimes.

"food","t5_2qh55","So, the idea here is basically spinach burgers covering hardboiled eggs, much like scotch eggs (traditionally covered in sausage). If, like me, you love scotch eggs but, for whatever reason, have quit eating meat, this is a great recipe for you!

Directions:

Make a spinach-burger mixture using whatever recipe you can find. My wife and I really like to use [this one.](http://thevillagecook.com/spinach-burgers/)

Hardboil 7-8 eggs and allow them to cool. The mixture recipe in the link covers about 7 eggs, but I prefer to leave myself one extra in case something goes wrong.

-Preheat oven to 350 

-Peel the eggs and roll them in flour so that the spinach mixture will stick to them.

-Cover your palm with some spinach mix, pat it down, plop on your egg and roll it around until it is covered completely. (I picked off extra spinach and patted to fill in holes because I was concerned I wouldn't have enough mixture for all 7 eggs, but it was about the perfect amount.)

-Prepare a baking tray with cooking spray or oil and put the eggs on. I spaced mine about 2 inches apart.

-Bake for about 15-17 minutes, then carefully turn over with tongs and bake for another 5 minutes. The spinach burger mixture will be just a little crispy when you take them out of the oven.

-Serve with whatever sauces you like!","1359678051"

If an intruder came, the beaver has an escape route. The African, however, only has one entrance, leaving it vulnerable to an attack. The beaver also has used more stable material. The beaver uses sticks and pieces of hard wood to make his home. The African, on the other hand, has used flimsy straw to make his uncivilized hut. The structure of the beavers home is more stable as well. The beavers home has a lover center of balance, preventing it from wind gusts or other forms of push on the side. The African's hut has a high centre of gravity, is not very stable, and can easily be destroyed.

I have no evidence provided to convince me that there is a cookie in the opaque jar, or evidence to convince me that there isn't. Both scenarios are possible.

**or** 

I've never seen solid evidence for god, or solid evidence for a lack of a god. Both scenarios are unprovable, and therefore it is a fruitless endeavor to attempt to establish either case.

I'll tell you what, if you can complete a scientific case that provides substantial evidence for the non-existence of any sort of god, I will consider myself an atheist.

I grow tired of your repetitive attempts to disqualify agnosticism from being a valid viewpoint with logical fallacies.

Toure is terrible, but thanks for proving my point, MSNBC is obsessed with the ""both sides"" meme. I'm having a hard time seeing why you can't grasp this when I've said it three times now. Fox is not trying to create a ""both sides"" narrative, they're not even creating a one-side narrative, they're creating their own narrative. That is very, very different than what MSNBC is doing. To simplify it even more, Fox is anti-liberal, MSNBC is not anti-conservative, MSNBC is anti-Fox.

He asked a question, and some dumbasses shouted some dumb shit that had nothing to do with the question. The question was ""why do you *need* this type of weapon. The answer was ""ERMAHGERD, SERKEND AMERNDMERNT!"" That's not an answer. That's like in the movie *The Strangers* when a bleeding Liv Tyler asks her assailants why they're murdering her, ""because you were home."" ""Why do you need this type of gun?"" ""Cuz I can."" I'm not surprised you sympathize with that level of derp, but c'mon.

Trolls are just going to come around no-matter what... and honestly, if the community has stuck up attitudes or act prudish about others (not saying this in an accusing way), then that's just something that tempts potential trolls even more.

If you look through that thread, you'll see the account he accused her of being a sock-puppet of is deleted, I deleted it around the start of 2013 after a relative discovered it.

His accusations are baseless and **seem to be fueled by his jealousy that my SO presumably has the body type he enjoys, denies him nudes, has a well-endowed male partner and the internet's well-known law of TITS OR GTFO.** (highlighted portion is my speculation)

Funnily enough, she texted me earlier (before he edited his comment) to tell me that people like him are exactly the reason why she does not want to do any sort of modeling but especially AGT modeling because they're specifically seeking women whom their target audience won't find threatening (attractive yet technically knowledgeable) with personalities that will cause said target audience to develop crushes and emotional bonds with these women they've never met. In short, they're targeting creepy, socially awkward obsessive fucks.

Edit: Further disclosure, this is the second time I've submitted my SO to subredditdrama. The first time was in yet another NSFW subreddit where she was pounced on by Redditors and the famous /u/violentacrez and berated for her opinions as a woman.

&gt;2) It was easier to shut down apps in ios. In Android, unless I turn my phone off and on, they continue to run in the background, draining battery. The battery life is half as good to begin with, but if I forget to turn my phone off and on after playing a game, my battery lasts under 90 minutes.

&gt;3) Samsung and Google don't have anything close to Applecare: when something goes wrong with my Apple devices, I know exactly where to take it for immediate service. I dropped my Macbook Pro brought it in, and they changed my hard disk and fan under warranty, even though it technically wasn't covered. I have yet to have a single good repair experience with an Android device. If I can't fix it myself with information I find online, I can't fix it.

&gt;4) Every Android phone I've had has bugged like crazy (I've had 7 over the last 12 months). For example, on my Samsung, my keyboard doesn't work on any app anymore except the Google Search. I can type exactly two letters before the keyboard disappears. I've tried deleting everything and restarting it under manufacturer settings. I've brought it into the shop where I bought it and they shrugged their shoulders. I now have a really expensive smart phone that I can't text people on, search for apps, or write emails with. My HTC would call people randomly. I could leave it on my desk and after about 30 or 40 minutes, it would open up the contacts list. If I didn't touch it, 30 minutes later it would select a contact. Again, if I waited, it would call that contact. Restoring factory settings fixed it, but the same phone started hanging up on phone calls at random while I was talking. I could go on, but my point is all 7 Androids have had major problems.

&gt;Over the last 12 months I've spend about $2500 on Androids. I only stick with them because iPhone doesn't support Mobilicity (or similar networks) in Canada and I hate Bell, Rogers, and Telus with a passion. I would rather not have a smartphone than deal with our oligopolistic telecommunications companies.

I will add to this that that Android does have some good things, but the negative has vastly outweighed the positive. I think the only reason they are outselling iPhone is that people like me have to buy a new one every couple of months. ","1359678059"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Nothing ""works as a placebo"" better than ""another placebo"", that's the whole point of the placebo effect. You could take a glass of tap water and say ""Candy Man"" five times above it, if that's what you think would work, and that glass of water would work exactly as well homeopathy.

The placebo effect isn't a property of the substance you intake. 

Basically, say that a certain condition heals on its own 30% of the time. Then you do a double blind test with one group of people taking nothing (30% of them will heal on their own), we'll call it Group A. You take another group of people, Group B, taking some remedy you want to test. If the number of people who heal in Group B isn't significantly larger than Group A, the substance they tried doesn't work. 

Countless studies have shown that if you try homeopathy against a placebo, it doesn't heal more people. Therefore, it just doesn't work, and it's (incorrectly in my opinion) referred to as ""a placebo"", because there's nothing in it and you can use it as one in your experiment.

So there is no such thing as a ""placebo that works"" as opposed to a ""placebo that doesn't work"".

Also, not sure how valid this is, but I think I read somewhere that the placebo effect works even when the subjects are aware that they're taking a placebo.","1359678060"

The reason, IMO, that teen-adult relationships are frowned upon (or  illegal) is because generally a teen won't have very much life experience, and act more impulsively.

I would guess possibly 2 different scenarios (both of which I've seen happen)

1.) When you ran that suspicious file.. .it either contained (or automatically downloaded) some Rootkit components that hooked into your Hard Drives MBR (Master Boot Record) which would survive through a reformat. A tool like TDSSKiller should tell you if your MBR has been modified/hooked. 

2.) You've got a particular Make/Model of Router that's susceptible to DNS Cache Poisoning (which has been another popular spyware tactic lately)... and anytime you try to access any Google-service,.. it hijacks your request and points you back to the spyware/malware. But since you haven't told us what Make/Model,etc of Router you have.. I'm kinda shooting in the dark on this one. 

But it seems plausible to me that either of these two scenarios could be true. It's about the only thing that would survive/bypass a hard-drive Format. ","1359678071"

The best part about this is when schneids finally gets back in after not playing in over a week he's going to be cold. And the goalie controversy will crank up another notch. 

I can understand wanting to ""showcase"" a tradeable asset such as lu, and stating you're happy to keep him all year. But effectively benching the guy you have stated is your number one does nothing but shake his confidence.

what point are you trying to make? you told me to

&gt; Question feminism in any subreddit

stop making up more bullshit, jesus christ

&gt;Top comment (with more upvotes than the post itself)

so, now, /r/mensrights is no longer the only place on reddit where feminism can be questioned but the only place on reddit where feminism can be questioned... and ignore any disagreement?

&gt; Also not questioning feminism.

really? saying feminism is a plot to receive money isnt questioning?

&gt;Another comment. Doesn't question feminism. Literally just says 

really? attributing a quality that no feminist has ever advocated for to ""feminism"" (not just one stroke of feminism but all of feminism) isnt questioning feminism? 

&gt; Specifically targets feminist organization (NOW). 

reading is harddd

&gt;If you honestly think feminism is JUST about men and women being treated equally, then you should reconsider who you're aligning yourself with, as many ""feminists"" aren't really advocating for equality, but extra privileges now.

yep. by ""feminism"" s/he totally means ""NOW""

&gt; Supports feminism's campaign for ""equality"".

YEP. attributing the act of punching someone to feminism is supporting feminism. not just reddit's fetish for demanding that ""equal rights means equal lefts""

&gt;you're a legbeard from the fempire

um, okay? why not throw out a meaningless insult to women who dont shave their legs?

"design_critiques","t5_2roqr","Thanks for the input, that's really what I was looking for. I agree the site looks too amateur. I feel partly due to me being a programmer and not a designer, but a lot of it is also due to the company not wanting to depart too far from the original site. It's very clear that the logo is liked inside the company, and it's also clear that the colors are well liked. (Even though they don't work well, I'm supposed to try and mix in the reds, greens, and yellows into our Intranet). 

I don't actually really see the problem with the typography. Out of everything, I thought that the typography was one of the most solid. I found an article on Smashing Magazine about all of the ratios and line heights and everything and followed it to the letter. I'm by no means even experienced with typography, and I'd love to know what's wrong with it.

Here's the problem: we don't have the budget for a designer. While I'd love to hire a design agency to just fix everything for me and be the voice of change, we can't. I can't do anything at all about the logo, but maybe if I find a design good enough we could at least drop it from the header. 

What are some changes that I, a non-designer, could make? What needs to be done to the typography? How could I structure the content to make things look better? Is there just no hope and a designer needs to be hired? I've got no hope at being able to pull of anything near the links you gave me, I think.","1359678080"

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Sorry, you're right. That was vague and disjointed. I'm having a similar discussion right now and I think you got the response to the other question.

Regarding your point, the whole reason why Flash is so widely used is because it IS standardized and implemented uniformly across all browsers. The discrepancies between using Flash on Chrome vs Firefox vs IE are very small. You're supposed to write the code once and release it, not come up with a Chrome friendly and IE friendly version, then detect which browser is running and execute accordingly.

Yes, an open source Flash would be nice, but I fear that the innovation will drop off considerably if that occurs. Paying a fleet of highly trained and specialized engineers to work day and night on a the Flash Player as opposed to relying on the charity of an unorganized mass of developers will fuel a lot more progress. Adobe MUST come up with new features every couple of years, because at its heart Adobe is a tools company. They need an incentive for their hordes of customers to upgrade to Creative Suite 7, 8, XP, etc. 

Personally, I like my open source small in scope. As a game developer, it makes no sense to pay for... say... an entity framework, a sound manager, or a framework to render images on screen. I'm a huge fan of frameworks like Starling, Citrus, Flixel, etc. All open source. But, as a developer, I am very willing to pay someone to handle an aspect of development and implementation that is clearly outside of my skillset. Hence... the acceptance of the proprietary Flash Player and AIR framework. Hell, that's what's driving a lot of Unity's success right now. Their market place is exploding with new plugins and augmentations to handle asset management, 2D development, peripheral support, etc. And more power to them! Who cares if I don't have full control over their code. So long as the functionality matches the feature list, we're good.","1359678082"

Additional reading, Sheetz decided to 1-Up Subway years ago, and offered the $4 Footlong. Subway got enraged, took  Sheetz to court stating their ""$4 Footlong"" campaign would cause ""customer confusion"" and that their use of the term footlong was inappropriate. Trying to dig up the older links is rather hard, as Google has been overtaken by the recent news of it.

The judge ruled that Sheetz was in the right, since their footlong was a footlong, and only $4, calling it the ""$4 footlong"" was merely truth in advertising, not meant to cause confusion.

'Out of the wreck rose the Black Rider, tall and threatening, towering above her. With her cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his mace.  Her shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over her like a cloud, and his eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill. 

But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his stroke went wide, driving into the ground. Merry's sword had stabbed him from behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the hauberk had *pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee.* 

'Eowyn! Eowyn!' cried Merry. Then tottering, struggling up, with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great shoulder bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shares. The crown rolled away with a clang. Eowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and cry went up into he shuddering air, and faded to a shrill wailing, passing with the wind...'

Would your average man/woman in this same situation remain expressionless and void of emotion, or is it more likely for them to feel anxiety and concern?  That farmer was careless and irresponsible, and this is made even more apparent by his nonchalant and disinterested attitude when interacting with the recorder.","1359678090"

        $result = $refined_results[$result_num];

        printf(""&lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;"", $name, $vicinity);
    }

now, some comments / suggestions:

**You should use better names for your variables**

It's easier to read variables that reflect the real world. Ex: $result becomes $contact or $person.

**foreach is simpler**

    foreach ($refined_results as $result) {
        // printf etc...
    }

**If you're going to output HTML**

You can do it like this: 

    ?&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo $name; ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo $vicinity; ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;?php

There are arguments for and against each method, I like this one better because the html will be colored/formatted/debugged differently in your code editor. 

**in Javascript this would be better performance-wise, I don't know about PHP:**


    $refined_results = $results['results'];

    $result_num = count($refined_results);
    while ($result_num--) {
        // printf etc
    }

&gt; im working with an array supplied by an outside source

If you don't trust this source 100% I hope you're escaping characters properly to prevent attacks. (cue: htmlentities)

&gt; i want to stop it from printing, if its empty

if count($refined_results) returns 0, it won't even enter your while loop, so you don't have to worry.

**If I had to rewrite your code**

    $contacts_list = $results['results'];

    foreach ($contacts_list as $contact) {
        ?&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo $contact['name']; ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;?php
        ?&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php echo $contact['vicinity']; ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;?php

7. Reading and Writing

Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.

 It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.

 He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers—and spirit itself will stink.

 Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.

 Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.

What the fuck. You just completely misrepresented what I said, only quoting half of my sentence. Go back and read the other half before you start calling me selfish and conceited. Here, I'll quote it for you:

&gt; Also, it's completely nonsensical to complain that manufacturers shouldn't have to support custom operating systems, **and then at the same time complain that a manufacturer would prevent custom firmware**

By the way, PCs are not ""designed for Windows"" in the same way that Macs are designed for Mac OSX, or that iPhones are designed for iOS. The sticker might say that, but actually they are built to a set of sophisticated technical standards that ensures cross-compatibility between hardware and software. And again, this has nothing to do with what OS you are running. A buggy driver on Windows could cause the exact same thing to happen, yes, *even within the manufacturers supported environment*.

&gt; ""Anything"" is possible, but you seem to be totally ignorant about the costs and penalties involved and whose responsibility it should be to make things impossible. I have to ask you, is any cost too high to stop this from happening?

Well obviously it's up to the manufacturer if they want to implement these things or not. But if they're going to do things like adding secure boot in the name of security, it would make sense to secure the BIOS too. Now maybe you have more experience with hardware design than me, but I doubt any of that would be especially complicated to add. In fact, I've already thought up a very simple way to implement it - I'll explain it to you if you want.

&gt; Poor you, everything isn't idiot proof.

I'm not asking for it to be idiot proof. What does any of this even do have to do with being idiot proof? The laptop getting bricked wasn't caused by the user being an idiot, it was caused by a software bug. That probably wasn't even caused by the programmer being an idiot - they probably just made a mistake. Bugs happen, all programmers know that.

&gt; We're not living in a nanny state yet, but we're almost there thanks to you.

I don't think you know what a nanny state is. The keyword here is ""state"" - i.e., something enforced by a government. How a hardware manufacturer chooses to design their hardware has nothing to do with the government, and doesn't cause lead to a nanny state.","1359678098"

Redditors rally for Restaurant B.
More online news reports.
More facebook posts in favor of Restaurant B.
Restaurant B profits.

Now I know you aren't stupid enough to think restaurant B would actually advertise the exact story in front of their store. They would just report it quietly to some news website, and let the good PR roll in. Those that have no idea what happened, will continue to give business to both. Those that do know what happened, and support the girl (a LARGE majority more) would no longer go to restaurant A, and go to restaurant B. 

I guess it was too complicated for you. Or maybe it was that closed mind of yours. We may never know.

Just consider Queer to be a label in the same catergory as purple.  There's also specific shades of purple.  There's lavender, and royal purple, and mauve, and lilac (and well, other specific colour names, like teal, which is technically green) but they're all still purple.  She's got a label, it's just not a specific one.

And labels are just as much for the person being labelled as the labellers.  I was reading an article the other day about a girl who identifies as straight, but is currently planning on marrying her girlfriend.  Her reasoning was that if it wasn't her girlfriend, it wouldn't have been a woman.  And I can get that too.

The position that the second amendment is not about hunting has merit, yet when the GOP takes that position they are mocked. 

Immigration; Bush, McCain, Romney are for steps toward amnesty, yet were mocked because they said ""secure the border"". Democrats want the border wide open, no, but they don't get the same criticism. 

Education reform, make teachers accountable. The GOP gets zero credit for saying it instead get mocked.  Democrats say they are for accountability, they are ""for"" the children.

"television","t5_2qh6e","If you allow me to give an opinion ( it's only that ) :

Dexter got annoying pretty quick, I watched 2 season of it I think, and I got bored since I never could see any form of resolution for his problem except the ""will they find out"" which could last forever. And Debbie was awful.

The Office peaked at season 3 with the Jim and Pam love story. Afterwards they guilt the audience into watching because of the emotional investment but it's not such a good comedy or mockumentary anymore. And after Steve Carell left, the show was absolutey not justified to go on. 

30 Rock got me bored for the same reason as Dexter. She's not changing, she's not evolving and all the characters became more and more a caricature of themselves making them dumb with no redeeming quality. 

Parks and Rec is not becoming bad per se and it's true that season 3 or 4 were kinda interesting but it deserves to have a good death. It will become bad soon enough. 

Fringe is ridiculous in a Lost way. They had some interesting arcs but the constant false ""resets"" are too cheap and the stories get less and less original the more the show draws. It became more serialized which is good for a long running show but at the same time, the story itself was convoluted and hardly plausible to say the least proving a lack of long term vision for the show. 

Mad Men is still quite good, but it's because it has no story and is not trying to trick the viewers with a false hope of resolution. And the writing is still incredible. This show is all about building tension and up and releasing it in an explosion of emotion. That's probably why the Suitcase episode was the best of the show. 

I still enjoy BB but I don't agree with the way the story is playing out. I think they should have skipped a part of the story, made the rise of Heisenberg faster, and be more focused on his downfall and how life at the top is. Right now what should have been the Scarface of TV shows reminds me too much of Moonshiners. 

I think most shows don't hold up the test of time. They hit their peak in season 2 and people keep thinking it's still good even though the writers don't make any effort anymore. British TV shows are both shorter and better constructed. American shows who get 5 or 6 seasons only do it because they're extremely profitable which is why they can pay the actors those enormous amounts of money. It has absolutely nothing to do with quality and it actually works against it. ","1359678104"

"FL_Studio","t5_2rig0","this is an lfo using a triangle wave.

/\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\

Basically what you got going on is that the wave is going up and down. You can also modulate (change) how fast that it is going up and down. So you got this cool little thing that can go up and down at different speeds. 

Now that you've got that concept, let me expand a little bit on what exactly an LFO is. Low Frequency Oscillation means that at the start of the wave (start&gt; /\ &lt; end) all of your higher frequencies are cut out, as the wave goes up to it's peak you hear the higher range of your sounds and then as it descends to the end of the curve it cuts out all those sounds again. That's how you get the distinctive wob wob wob sound. Cutting out and reintroducing the higher end frequencies. 

That's pretty much the classic definition of an LFO, atleast in my words, and I may have said things incorrectly cuz theres always some asshole on the internet who knows what you know best better. 

Also you aren't going to get any effect from an LFO unless you assign it to a sound or parameter (i.e volume, attack, decay, sustain, release, panning, basically any setting that you can change you can modulate with an lfo, and it'll do something, whether or not it sounds good is gunna fluctuate greatly when your first starting but thats how you learn.

Basically LFOs are cool and assign them to shit and you will learn loads about them.

The motivation and madness were brilliant, to want to be the last man alive alone with God, and killing off all of humanity to achieve it, that was really well done. Pinbacker also has one of the best quotes I have it hanging on my office wall. ""At the end of time, a moment will come when just one man remains. Then the moment will pass. Man will be gone. There will be nothing to show that we were ever here... but stardust."" ` Pinbacker There are also some truly great Sci-fi scenes in it, like Kaneda's sacrifice, also get to see Searle's obsession with the sun at this point, was just heart breaking and an edge of your seat scene. Capa's jump was also a favorite, the moment when he trips and has to get up, the weight of all of humanity on his back was incredible.

I would recommend hanging out a couple times before moving beyond just hanging out; make sure everyone's comfortable with each other before getting ahead of yourself.

The American government could become entirely populated by pacifist tree hugging vegans, though these kinds of people have a bit of a stereotype of feeling guilt and the need to apologize for the actions of others.

Anyway, this is not what you said... You stated:

&gt;""Of the set of humans that make up the United States government, there exist some humans that are terrorists""

This statement was made in order to justify your early assertion that:

&gt;It is a fact.

Which was made in response to:

&gt;""The United States is a terrorist state.""

Like I said in the post, he won't eat and has lost and lot of weight and energy. He's not even the same dog any more, it's heart breaking. My worst case scenario is waking up one day to let him outside and finding him dead. I want him to go as comfortable as possible, but I don't know if he is suffering or not.

One end of the band around the handle of the tripod, and pull the other end in the direction you are needing to go. The rubber band will absorb shock from the movement and will smooth the action out. Maybe this will help you in future! 

As far as post production software, I've use After Effects for stabilization. Go to VideoCopilot.net, they have a really good tutorial on stabilizing video with After Effects. Of course, AE files can become quite large, so unless you system can handle it, it may become a bit cumbersome.

It could be much worse, you could be dealing with something permanent instead, so consider yourself lucky... there are starving kids in africa.  I think of it more as something to keep me humble.  You didn't ask for it, don't deserve it, can't explain it.  But every now and then you have to go around with some obvious humiliation, some people don't care, some people assume things.  It's an easy way to understand and relate to other peoples situations/appearances, you inherit a little more empathy.  With some good medicine and dietary changes you can get that shit down to never really ever appearing.  Medicine is aciclovir (you want the crazy shit from mexico), you just need to apply it when you get that nice first tingle, over time they just kind of stop taking over.   I personally think it's a set of complex variables that can trigger it (hot sun, freezing cold, acidic foods, lots of salt/sodium/sugar, lack of sleep, chapped lips, dehydration), each of those as its own or the permutations of all of them.

She cosplays some revealing character outfits, but she was scared that he asked and said no, and tried to block him. She couldnt figure out how, so she just ignored his chats, wallposts, etc. Then, since she had included her phone number in her personal info viewable by ""friends only"" he had posted it to 4chan and she got BOMBARDED, I MEAN FUCKING BLOWN UP, MOWN DOWN, AND 24/7 JUST PLAIN HARRASSED.... for allegedly being a ""weird chick with a fetish for emo boys, who wouldn't stop sending him sex messages that 'made his girlfriend angry' and stalked him no matter what network site he used, girlfriend broke up with him over it and he is just destroyed, she shows his pic around and pretends he's her bf, and is sickly obsessed with weird cybering that makes me uncomfortable like she just wants to control me and have me at her mercy"" and begged 4chan to get her to feel as bad as he has made him feel, etc.


Well, the hive mind mob of 4chan four years ago (I've never had 4chan enter any of my www's, I hadn't even cared what it was until this, and still wasn't inclined to check it out. I'm proud to say I've never seen the place.) whatever it's nature, jumped the gun time zone by zone texting her horrible shit and if she answered a call they'd assume she answered for the local area code and say things like ""I saw your fat fucking ass while you were at school today bet you didn't expect someone you went to school with to hear about your sick obsessed fetish, you better watch out I can find where you live"" and one voice message, which I still have copied and saved on my phone in case anything ever happens, verbatim went:

""So, Elle [lastname], you live in Corpus Christi and you're a freshman at [her school]. Raven (the stupid kids emo alias) let me use his FB to check you out because unlike all the usual insulting callers you get, I am the real deal. I have found you out little girl, and I can make you disappear just for fun if I felt like it. You're quite the cosplayer, you'll be shocked to know you have a photo with me on your page from the Con, but you take pictures with lots of strangers there so I'll let you worry. You better fucking worry. We could work out a deal though, if you do what I want, anything I want, then I'll get everyone to leave you alone so you can stop crying yourself to sleep every night. But then, maybe you'd just get all sick and twisted over me instead and honey you ain't SHIT. think your little fooly cooly bunny suit made you look hot? Did you look in the MIRROR?! Lose some weight trashy bitch. If you don't call me back in 24 hours, I'll be waiting in your room after school. I know your dad works late and you'll be alone for two more months until mommy moves in and MAYBE your freaky fucking sister. Until then, better to listen. [his #] x 4,"" then heavy breathing, clacking of a keyboard.

My dad called back and threatened the guy with his promise that if anyone came inside the house he would shoot to kill. Kid sounded all scared and said he was just joking, broke down and started admitting that it was him that played Raven, and posted her number on 4chan, and called to scare her because he was surprised how many people responded. Cops found out he lived way over in Vermont, and only knew the things about her from saved conversations.

Police said if he contacted her again to get in touch because there wasn't anything LIFE threatening in the voice mail. But I was fucking pissed, trying to get her to tell me anything I could go on... She didn't know about 4chan until after my dad called and scared the fuckin kid until he spilled.

If mods had taken her number down as soon as it was getting any kind of notice, she could have gone through so much less fear, insecurity, and bullshit. The calls kept coming even after he said he would delete it, so we changed her number. ","1359678120"

Like you said, Minecraft is dandy with it, and they say so on their site.

For example, I didn't find anything on Perspective, so I asked them through a facebook message, and they said it was ok. Not the best way to do it, I'm sure, hence my question.

"singing","t5_2rlcx","Hey, I remember you.

You have great tone on your bottom range. Are you sure you're a tenor, haha?

Some minor pitch issues at 0:42, 1:04, 3:45. I thought you might have problems with higher notes, but you sing the melody from 0:42 and 1:04 later on and hit the notes pretty well, so I can only imagine it was nerves or something.

Your ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" is not sung with the original melody, but is still in key. Was that intentional? I agree with some of the others to drop the riffs on ""tonight"" and ""where we are"". As a person who grew up singing along with the Lion King and later became a fan of Elton John, I'm pretty partial to original melody and long sustained notes. I don't think modern pop singers appreciate the sustained note anymore. Riffs can be great when done well, but if done poorly, it makes you sound like you're hiding something.

I also agree with the others that you're separating the song into too many phrases. If you have the lyrics written down, try to divide the song into longer phrases and mark the places where you would take a breath. The goal is to sing this song like you would when you're having a conversation, i.e. breathing between complete sentences.


Overall though, great job. Don't worry about this copyright nonsense. It doesn't apply to original content, especially if you're not marketing it.","1359678130"
