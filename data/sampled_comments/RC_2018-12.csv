"MadeInAbyss","t5_3k4lt","Mods, there's [too many good flairs in this chapter not to make](https://imgur.com/a/onYoL48). 

I feel like that at the end relic is what transforms people into a Narehate like Nanachi without completely killing them and that it works on the IF Units as well. Part of me feels like this will also be Reg's origin story. I mean, it seems that Faputa became the thing that she most desires, like Nanachi. So, would it be a stretch to think that the IF Units would most desire to be human so that they could fit in more easily? I mean their mouths. They all have that [saw tooth design just like Reg's little hair band](https://i.imgur.com/XrGrNlb.png) ~~it's a little less saw toothy.~~ ~~but aren't egg shaped relics supposed to be really common with little value~~. I'm just spitballing here. 

[Something about this Guy](https://i.imgur.com/QK9vopS.png) reminds me of [Srajo](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/miabyss/images/3/31/Srajo_Manga.png/revision/latest?cb=20170710013551). 

Akihito really nails [this look.](https://i.imgur.com/5nN3K2J.png) That sense of wonder and excitement towards something new. It's the exact [same look that Mitty](https://i.imgur.com/W4K8YbF.png) had. 

The mother/daughter relationship of Faputa and Veko is too good. I *really* hope that there's no bad blood between them in the present. Please don't rip my heart out Akihito. 

[Faputa's fear of abandonment is also explored.](https://i.imgur.com/f9LMT4P.png) I guess we now know why she was so broken up by Reg leaving her and not remembering who she was. 

I really really hope that he's foreshadowing us with some of these monsters. They look too sick. 



Also, if you don't read the chapters while listening to the anime OST you're really missing out. It just fits in perfectly.

"Blind","t5_2qpec","Hi! I use tinted contact lenses (sometimes). The ones I have cover the iris - they are entirely tinted.

I have albinism and therefore am photophobic and my acuity varies wildly depending on lighting. 

Take the following with a grain of salt because everyone is different 

The pros :
- you can add sunglasses on top of them 
- you can choose the tint you want (there aren‚Äôt a ton of options, but there are a few gradients) 
- they are pretty effective in situations with fluorescent lighting
- better acuity - I can read a  line Lower than with regular contacts (not the whole thing but a good chunk of it) (like from line 2 to 3) 
- good in snowy, reflective environments 

The cons: 
- they are thicker than regular contact lenses (or at least that‚Äôs how they feel to me). It takes a little while for me to get used to then when I pop them in, but afterwards it‚Äôs fine.
- I have yearly contacts. The closer I get to the end of the year, the less comfy they get and the less I will wear them
- my main issue with them is that I‚Äôve had multiple pairs and after a while I have trouble focusing with them . Probably an issue with how they fit me personally.
- the ones I have make me look creepy. 
- not great at night, unless I am going to a concert. Makes the bright lights less annoying. 

That said, if you are photophobic or light sensitive, they are definitely worth a try. They take some getting used to, but if they turn out to be a good fit, than that would be excellent because I do see sharper with them (at a certain distance) and most importantly I am not as bothered by the sun or crappy overhead lights. 

I don‚Äôt know where you are located but when I was in Canada i couldn‚Äôt find them (actually got laughed out of multiple optometrists offices....) so it would be about finding someone who is more knowledgeable. 

I live in the Uk now and the eye hospital here is amazing. I get my contacts from them the overall  care at my eye hospital is top notch. Regular follow-ups and check-ups.

Two quick things to clarify: Phos' legs are not powdered in a stripy pattern, despite looking similar to that most of the time. The lighter layers on their legs are a different material all together and the entire legs are unpowdered, seen most clearly in [this shot from today](https://imgur.com/FwAnKiS)

The Amethysts did not actually split into two despite the initial reveal making it seem like it, the second one just walked up from the back of the room out of view of the reflection before they did their little dance. (Trivia, the 'pattern' of twin gemstones known as 'Japanese Law' is the angle of 84Àö33"", hence their numbered names).

---

*Sorry for the wall*

So in my infinite wisdom I gave myself only an hour and a half to write today's post, and then decided to cover one of the most possibly complicated topics: Buddhism. (My Sword of Damocles post took over three hours and I was already exceedingly familiar with that myth)

**Houseki no Kuni and Buddist Symbology**

Buddhism is a large part of Japanese culture, and many asian cultures. Unfortunately Buddhism is an incredibly complicated religion with many different sects, particularly between each country, and I'm mostly familiar with the Chinese schools. However there are some core associations and symbols that transcend across all the relevant schools and those in particular I found particularly interesting from today's episode.

Buddhism has many different tenants and philosophies attached, but the one I want to focus on today is the 'Three Marks of Existence' which states that all of known existence is impermanent (always changing), unsatisfactory and non-self (soullessness, not really covered today). If I wrote this post later I'd be able to say more on the other tenants, but I think it would be interesting to cover it now in a basic way so people could have this perspective while watching later episodes.

---

While not specifically a Buddhist symbol, the butterfly symbology pops up a number of times today, [one lands on Phos](https://imgur.com/LcQOLOm) and the Lunarian's sunspot today gives a vivid image of a [human figure with butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/LEBCVvH). Impermanence is what ties into this, the idea of perpetual change. Phos exemplifies this most vividly in today's episode with the function of their new legs revealed, and quite dramatically. Sensei's note here that Phos has particularly strong inclusions only held back by their frail earthly body ties greatly into our first Buddhist association below. 

The Lotus is a particularly symbolic flower in Buddhism. It is one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols that hold great importance, representing the enlightenment that can reach up through the muck of earthly existence and unfold into something beautiful. While not visually related to a Lotus, Amethysts role in this episode draws on the concept of one. During our first meeting with Amethyst, the camera pans down to the water as their two figures [unfold](https://imgur.com/uBlWEI7) from one another like the [unfurling](https://imgur.com/D4wsdOp) of a flower over the water where we have previously seen Phos spend a lot of moments contemplating their purpose and role. Lotus plants are always drawn with one, three or five stems, never two, and so Phos joining them completes a required set of three. In joining with the Amethyst twins, Phos is able to rise out of the 'muck' they have been stuck in all this time as their role as the youngest and weakest of the gems. Purple Lotus in particular represent mysticism, so this is not just a physical growth for Phos but a spiritual one in understanding their place in this world (more on this later).

Despite Phos' dramatic change and the strength they can now use to stand up and forge their own existence, there is still a deep unsatisfaction present. While they are quite strong now in some ways, they still find them-self unable to effectively do many other aspects of this role they had hoped for. Despite the huge progress, the bar has simply been moved ahead once again. The end result of this perpetual cycle of change and unsatisfaction is this painful mirroring between the loss of [Phos' legs](https://imgur.com/eKfD2d1) in a previous episode and the shattering of [Amethysts joined arms](https://imgur.com/bkIx4vs). Phos who is the only gem with a true awareness of mortal death finds themselves inert. Though most gems would not see the difference between [death and rest](https://imgur.com/tvSsTuM) due to their regenerative capabilities, Phos who now sees the 'death' in their friends on the moon, and having suffered the lost of their own self with the loss of their legs memories is struck all the more by the risk the gems are burdened with because of their physical bodies despite their immortality. 

---

[The empty throne](https://imgur.com/uc1UI9K) is another important visual from Buddhism, representing the seat left behind by the Buddha when he achieved enlightenment. Last episode, without telling anyone Phos achieved an awareness of self in their determination that prompted their legs to move again. Leaving behind an empty seat as the only sign of their achievement for those who looked, until Yellow Diamond, the oldest and one of the more spiritually broken of the gems is able to find them again and guide them back to the others. Shortly after this we get a scene where Phos' brutal honesty, as we have seen through the show, shocks the gems to silence, honesty being one of the five precepts (rough western equivalent: ten commandments) of the Buddha's teachings that Buddhists aim to follow, teaching them through their own experience the value of honesty and change. (I'm not saying Phos is a Buddha for clarity, only that they are closest to the teachings as of now due to their awareness of mortality and experiences of change).

And lastly, the shot that started it all by making me decide on this post for the day, [The destruction of the Lunarians](https://imgur.com/saSTv63) at Sensei's hand, turning them into a cloud of colored dust. The [sand mandala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYVcjFhpsHc) while being a Tibetan Buddhism ritual rather then Japanese, ties in greatly here. No two mandala's have the same meaning or purpose, each is unique, much like the gems, but in a broad sense the creation of a mandala is a way to connect to ones role in the universe, the collection of positive energy to be bestowed on others, and a 'house' for the deities being called upon, much like Sensei is a center for the gems. A very important part of all mandala's is the ritual destruction of it at the end, the important representation of it's impermanent state, that material things do not last. Sensei's destruction of the Lunarian's giving that vivid throw of color across the sky, as if destroying their 'house' from his mandala and sweeping it clean of their influence.

[Some stuff for the rewatchers](/s ""One aspect that I will quickly mention is also that Phos' agate/shell legs, and later their gold and silver arms are three/four of the Seven Material Treasures that pop up in Buddhism as well, materials that represent various parts of faith, virtue etc. I'm NOT going to go too much into this because firstly not all texts agree on what the treasures each are strictly, and also that's a whole other matter that goes way, way deeper into symbology. But if you're interested that's also something to look at. Just remember not to go to Phos' wiki page looking for answers, its not safe"")

I'm also not as stupid to compare a not launched game that has only just started its marketing push (they do have to avoid overlap with big titles like RDR2 ya'know) with big titles that already have a standing, like the Division, or games that already have years and years of content, like Warframe, or games that have tons of DLC put out already like Destiny2.

Can Anthem compete with the amount of content of Warframe and D2 right out the gates? No, probably not. Can Anthem match up to a game with an already developed title like the Division 2? Lmao, no. And who would expect either of those things? It's unrealistic. That is my only argument.

A Twin Crystal has two terminations at the same end that have developed from a single base.

Twin Crystals are exactly parallel to each other and there is no boundary between the two crystals. So that's why they mirror each other.

Amethyst is also the stone that represents February.

Tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the Buddha and make prayer beads from it. I may be stretching when I say this, but this is the first time we've seen a Lunarian of this type and when it breaks Amethyst into pieces it looks like its looping parts of them on the wire like beads.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; I work in construction. Sometimes we use large granite stones for seating walls or whatever. The tolerance on these MACHINE CUT stones is to 1/4"". This means, even though we may get four of the ""same"" stone, they will not be exactly identical. They can even be so far off sometimes as to not be usable stacked next to each other, because of the profile differences.

&gt; These stones are more precise than what we can do and we have no idea how they did it.

This is exactly wrong. These techniques have been repeated in the modern day.

The reason that you can't compare it to the tolerances of your modern construction projects is that you're using blocks that were manufactured to fit with any other block. THAT was impossible at the time that the structures in question were made, and is a much more impressive feat.

On a small scale, what they did is trivial. You can take two sandstone blocks of about 5-10 lbs. and just rub them together until they've sanded each other down to fit perfectly together. Now you put the next one on top and repeat.

For these blocks, however, more sophisticated techniques are required because they're too heavy to just rub together freely.

Modern recreations have used simple tools that would have been available (straight edges, string, etc.) to measure and then file down the stones to fit very, very closely to as perfectly as these ancient structures, and that's someone with no real experience in doing this. These civilizations spent hundreds if not thousands of years figuring out how to do this through trial and error and lots of master-to-student teaching.

I‚Äôm on mobile, so do forgive any spelling or formatting errors. 

Let‚Äôs dive right in...

Lately my (25F) live-in boyfriend (29M) has been encroaching on my ‚Äúme time.‚Äù 

My ‚Äúme time‚Äù hereby being time I elect to go watch a show I am into he doesn‚Äôt care for in the bedroom while he watches TV in the living room,  or take a long ass bubble bath, or sit at the kitchen table coloring instead of being in the living room. 

Lately, he‚Äôs had a habit of following me after 10-15 minutes. 

He‚Äôll come into the bedroom while I‚Äôm trying to watch a show, and attempt to talk to me, tell me stories, show me memes, etc...Which is all well and good, but I‚Äôm trying to watch Stranger Things for the first time and it isn‚Äôt a good show to interrupt every few minutes. 

He also will come into the bathroom while I‚Äôm having a bubble bath and sit on the floor by the tub. Again, to tell me stories, show me memes, etc. 

And as for interrupting my coloring, I like to zone out with my headphones on and he will come up and take them off/wave in my face until I pay attention to him. 


Recently, I asked him to please leave the bathroom so I could continue my soak in peace. This appeared to really upset/hurt him and he has been acting a bit akin to a kicked puppy since. 


So, Reddit...AITA for wanting my alone time to be...Mine to spend alone?

You can still get a gun in these nations like Canada, Germany, and Japan.  It just isn't so damn easy and dangerous.  Especially the high capacity rapid fire shit.  That isn't for self defense or hunting!  I have a friend with mental illness, on meds, who attempted suicide before and he loves his guns.   

Anyone who has ones a gun should understand they they are a lot more likely to shoot themselves or an innocent person then they are to shoot a bad guy in self defense.  A lot of people just kill themselves on a whim because it's easy.  Cops and military have high rates of suicides cause they often have guns within easy reach.

First.  
\-Pick your species, for ease we will talk about deer in general  
\-figure out where it is legal to hunt for your species  
\-Make sure you know what rules you will need to follow and write it down on a small cheat sheet or wallet card  
\-Things like how many antler point minimum, what counts as antlers, does it even need antlers etc.    
\-Find the area you would like to hunt on google maps, for now just grab any piece of legal land you can use and scout it.  
\-Find that same area on [Windy.com](https://Windy.com) Learn to use that website via the different tools and layers to find the wind direction and what time the wind will be blowing etc.  
\-Once you find a couple spots you like, print out a few screen shots of where you want to go and circle your spots you want to check.  
\-Take all your gear for sitting in a spot and wear the required amount of hunters orange.  Bring two articles of hunters orange if they are cheap, wear one and hand the other above or around your spot your going to sit.  
\-Your going to pretend your hunting but don't bring your rifle or bow etc, just bring a pistol for self defense.  
\-now here is the scouting part.  Look around the area for active trails that you think might be deer.  Your looking for foot prints and scat.   The wetter the scatter means it was recent, more dried etc means older.  Your looking for wet scat.   The more scat in the area means the closer to the bed site your getting, try to stay out of these areas so they still feel safe.  
\-Once you find a suitable trail system, find a spot you think you would like to sit as if you were hunting.  Or place trail cams in the directions you think it will take proper pictures/video. (reminder that trail cams can be stolen)  
\-Sit quietly and listen and watch, also pull out your map and start taking down any notes and trying to draw trails etc.  You can sit this one spot all day, or move on and find more trails and make them down.  This is where game cams are wanted so you can watch multiple spots at once and over a few days.  
\-Lets assume you see the deer that you want you and its legal etc. mark the time you saw it and the day and just watch what it does until it leaves.    


You have now successfully scouted the area and found your target.  Try for the game cams as your in and out with out leaving much of a scent.  Also if you found the deer you want, don't keep coming back, wait till the season opens up and then go back to the spot ready to take him.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","What a bland yet also tacky name. It means absolutely nothing. What the hell are they thinking?

Earlier I joked that they should use one of Stroll‚Äôs brands in a similar way to how Red Bull‚Äôs owner uses Red Bull as his teams‚Äô names.

Basically, I had that idea because this season Stroll already brought one of his major fashion brands, Hilfiger, to Mercedes. 

Michael Kors, the fashion brand that made rose-gold the cultural icon it is today, is the Stroll-related brand I chose. Yeah it‚Äôs tacky to nerds like us here on /r/f1 but the brand itself has a lot of fans. Crucially, Kors fans are almost exclusively not F1 fans yet they are religiously fans of the Kors brand. If Kors was the brand under which the team was established, then those fans would suddenly start caring about F1, which would be great, more fans for the sport is good for us all.  

And the ‚Äòglamour‚Äô of F1 could add to that brand‚Äôs cache, as well as boosting F1‚Äôs own glam-status in the minds of younger women. as the team name because, despite that brand‚Äôs literally tacky image, at least they‚Äôd do some good for the sport by attracting the interest of Kors-fans and Kors-mockers alike. Pretty much all young women in the western world appear to be firmly ensconced in either of those camps, which means that that brand is gold in terms of spreading the message across that young female demographic, it‚Äôs well known and out there and generates buzz and conversation. And oddly for a fashion brand which has a tacky image, even Kors-mockers don‚Äôt hate the brand perse, it‚Äôs more of a gentle joshing kind of vibe. So there‚Äôs be little to no genuine bad press, unlike a lot of F1 associated brands such as alcohol, oil companies and even Red Bull &amp; Monster who have been at the center of recent parental concerns over how much sugar and stimulants is appropriate to allow for children. With Kors, there is none of that bad press, they just sell shiny bags and watches to young fashion-conscious girls.

Could have been a total win-win for both Strol and Liberty. 

Liberty have missed a huge open goal by not seeing this opportunity and making some sort of approach to Stroll to get Kors, or one of his other female-focused fashion brands involved in a major way. More fans is always a good thing. 

Racing Point as a brand name is as random and buzzless of a team name as it gets. Still though, hoe great is it that Force India has been saved and its future preserved? For that, we‚Äôll all be extremely grateful for this move, whatever the name ends up being.",1543622416

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","For what it‚Äôs worth, I take 0.5mg of haloperidol every day, a different kind of anti psychotic. That‚Äôs a low dose. It helps with my anxiety, mood, impulsiveness and obsessive thinking.

I tripped for the first time in a long time recently and wasn‚Äôt sure how the haloperidol would effect things. I look 250ug and tripped pretty good. I was really high but didn‚Äôt have a ton of clear visuals. Thinking back to the past, it felt more like 200 or maybe 175, at least on my mental scale. 

Which is fine by me. My trip still felt like an awesome acid experience. I‚Äôll take 300 next time to amp it up a little bit. Maybe that will feel more like what I expect from 250. 

Maybe haloperidol is less disruptive to tripping than risperidone. Could be an alternative medication to consider. I think risperidoneis an atypical anti psychotic which I guess makes it closer to abilify, which I know is a stronger medication. 

I‚Äôve been on and off a lot of medications in my life for better or worse, dealing with issues like depression and anxiety and a little craziness. Having tested a variety of things, I‚Äôm a big fan of anti psychotics as compared to any other type mood affecting medication. The side effects aren‚Äôt bad, they can be effective, and you can trip on some of them if you are on a low dose.

Tripping on lithium can be deadly, on the other hand. And tripping on SSRIs isn‚Äôt great and is not healthy either. 

Btw I‚Äôm really careful with my approach to tripping given that I have anxiety issues and whatnot. A little risk but I love the experience.",1543622418

Tbh I don't really see the point in us trading for a SP anyways though. Kershaw/Buehler/Urias/Hill/Ryu/Maeda/Stripling/Wood are a lot already, and that's not including any of our prospects.

It's the cause of a hearty, direct enjoyment of life, and hearty, direct enjoyment of life is what Eightishness is. If you look at many Five and Nine descriptions, you'll find a splendid take on what low Extraversion properly means - not social anxiety, per se, but the world just not seeming to offer enough hedonic profit for many things.

The card that made control hunter decks (somewhat) viable and a clever use for all the beasts released in each new expansion. Loved it since it was revealed in the KFT announcement trailer and I will be deeply disappointed when he inevitably rotates this april.

2. Baku the Mooneater

More varied than her even counterpart, Baku alongside odd paladin was once the bane of standard, but now that those days are over her other decks (such as odd paladin) have had the chance to flourish. That combined with the upgraded hero powers feeling fantastic makes baku one of my personal favorites




3. Reno Jackson. 

Not really anything to say here, he is the heart and soul of an entire deck archetype, one which I really like to play (seeing a pattern here?)

Card I love for memes: Shudderwock.

"RedPillWomen","t5_2xing","Don't be snarky. No one is arguing that beauty and fertility decline with age. Women do not understand ""sexual peak"" to mean that they are at their most attractive. It means that we are more sexual, desire and enjoy it more through our 30s. Someone else here said it's a ""going out of business sale"" of sorts as fertility declines. 

It's not about thirsty and desperate because most of the women commenting in this thread are married to men we are attracted to. We're not saying this because it helps us in any way. We've already won the game so to speak. 

All anyone here is suggesting is that a woman's experience is this:  sex is better and desired frequency ticks up *for her* in her 30s. It's not a conspiracy. We're not trying to convince single men that they should have sex with us in our 30s. Most commenters have husbands that are happy to do that. 

The point isn't even if it's better or not *for men*. I'm not naive to the messages that are out there trying to change gender dynamics. This just isn't one of them. Rollo is conflating 'sexual peak' and 'desirability to the opposite sex' and that's simply an incorrect interpretation of the term. 

My experience of sex does not need to impact you. You should approach dating in whatever way is best for you. No one is trying to convince you otherwise and this post has it's place on the men's subs.  However, on RPW it's trying to explain women's experience to women and we're all disagreeing with it on a personal level. And again, I'd point out that the women disagreeing with it are those who have locked down a man and have no personal stake in the matter. ",1543622424

It‚Äôs a learning thing, all the killers are viable, even Freddy. 

I will say though, depending on map and how good the survivors are, you may get destroyed no matter what, but those games are as common IMO. I got farm as Mikey today and I P3d him so no ruin yet, I got destroyed. Then next game I used scratched mirror and game offering and 4kd.

I can't believe you just tried to pull a ""if the president does it, it's not illegal."" Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice for the exact same reason Nixon was. I don't know where you got the idea that being in charge of the investing body means you can't commit obstruction of justice, but it really just shows how poor your understanding of the law is. If a sherif murders someone and then fires every police officer who tries to look into it, he's committing obstruction of justice.

The violation under Obama was very minor and the result of an error. In Trump's case, violation of campaign finance law is what he will be charged with for collusion with Russian nationals.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt; I've gone around this thread asking people what one-dimensional LGBT characters they are thinking of when they lament how annoying the ""only interesting thing about him is he's gay"" character.

Will and Grace, the TV show.
The token gay dude on a long list of late 90's, early 00's movies, which is literally the same character with different face - super catty, quick with fashion-based insults, etc.  A good example is the gay kid on Nick Kroll's Netflix cartoon.  

I don't care how the gay character acts.  I, like the OP, is just asking that the character have something else going on about them that's interesting other than the novelty of being gay.  That's how you normalize homosexuality - show a lesbian couple being affectionate, show two guys doing stuff that couples do...but not make their same gender be the focal point.

It's really not that difficult of a concept.  If you want homosexuality to not be a big deal, you have to portray it as something normal.",1543622426

Infertile males are interesting in some species. For example, in wild horses, a male stallion will not tolerate a another stallion. However, there are some cases of them tolerating geldings. Infertile males generally don't compete for females like fertile males do, and that can create an interesting dynamic, as other males may completely ignore them at times when they would normally chase them away.

that's nothing to get out from under the boot of communist mentality in politics and law. How much do you think will change in a government in 30 years when most politicians make careers out of their positions. The harsh reality is you need to wait for this mentality to die out. And you can see it with the younger generation today in Poland vs the older.


Poland is probably one of the least shitty places in Europe even after being invaded four or five times in history. Maybe Poland's economy would be stronger and there wouldn't be as many in poverty if the rest of Europe could keep it in their pants and stop fucking them with troops, destroying their infrastructure, people, and cities reducing them to rubble. Europe doesn't have very high standards, but Poland stays strong on policy, resists tyranny even under occupation, and I'd take them over the shitholes that inhabit most of western Europe.

Oh, and you're also probably wrong about whether Bitcoin is a good investment or store of value. As a speculation, sure, but so are penny stocks.

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","Bringing on 1 player doesn't change *everything*, however I would argue that it changes some things. With the right player changing the right things, the outcome can 100% be affected. A player who is a bit more creative, confident with dribbing in midfield, and taking on opposing players can change enough such that we create a few more chances.

There's no way to say ""Start Keita and we win that match"" or ""Start Ox and the outcome is 100% different"". No, but it gives us a better chance of securing a result.

I realize the start was poor, however we're going to Paris playing against Neymar, Mbappe, and Cavani up front. I'm not saying we go there thinking we'll lose, however it's also not unreasonable to think they could score a few goals against us. Playing with a 'safe' midfield is fine unless we find ourselves needing to score a goal - then we're going to miss a creative outlet in midfield - which is exactly what happened.

I will also say that Verratti was excellent for PSG. As soon as he turns upfield, you're in trouble. He's great at finding dangerous, forward passes that put your defense under pressure. It's the exact midfield quality we are lacking this year.",1543622434

I'm not sure that those words apply the same way to you and me, as they would to conservatives. It seems that conservatives *don't* have ""genuine beliefs"" per se, they have objectives that they want their words to advance. So if they think saying ""climate change is a conspiracy!"" will advance some objective, then that's what they will say. If another objective becomes more important, they will then say ""we owe no duty to inhabitants of islands sunk by rising seas!"" without acknowledging any contradictions.

Another example: ""immigrants are degenerate and incompetent!"" and ""immigrants will take our jobs!"".

Conservatives appear to have no drive to maintain intellectual consistency.

"Braincels","t5_3pci5","Entitled' is a fairly meaningless term that does not accurately describe most of the incels on this sub or elsewhere on the Internet. On one extreme, the word 'entitled' is used to describe men who literally believe that they should be able to force women to date them. On the other extreme, the word 'entitled' is used to describe men who are merely frustrated or sad that they can't find anyone at all to date them. This type of frustration is reasonable, since sex and romantic relationships are regarded by many as one of the most fulfilling things in life. The problem with using the word 'entitled' for both categories of men is that it lumps them together, demonizing men in the latter category by comparing them to men in the former category. If you wish to criticize our views, please be more specific than merely calling us 'entitled.'

I believe the miraculous events more or less got over played to try and covert pagans from their magical and mystical Gods. What pagan would want to just believe in a simple philosophy (which is what Christianity is) when you can just believe in Thor who can hurl lightning bolts and smash giants? Or Mars who will win battles for you?

Read up on Arian Christianity which was denounced in the Council of Nicea. A lot of good ideas there that separate the metaphysical from the actual man. I could be misstating their ideas slightly but from my few readings on it Arius believed Jesus to be a man, just like you and I. The claim ""Son of God"" was meant to say that God is inherent in everyone. He was the Son of God in the same way you are.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsnapchat).

 It was pretty amazing when it was released in 1987, absolutely. 20 years later though, when they were selling the same bike almost unchanged, there were better options. The 650 from that year is so far ahead in handling, ergos, power delivery, all that good stuff.

We had a bunch in the training fleet for the first few years I taught, but dumped them as there were just simply better options out there that were less top-heavy, ran better, were smoother and easier to ride, and students after riding a handful of different bikes throughout the course rarely fell in love with the EX500 and actively avoided it when it came time to choose a bike for the test.

It's a decent bike, not a piece of shit or anything, but it was an antique even brand new by 2007. It is what it is. My bike was even less popular than that and sold even worse, but we all like what we like, and that's okay.",1543622437

My dad also had a drinking problem, yelled at me and blamed everyone and everything except himself.

He tried to chase away my supportive friends and even blamed the medication I was taking and my hormones. If he yelled at me and made me cry, ""it must be mental illness or my period"".

You can't change him, and honestly it's up to him if he decides to change and make the relationship better. If it's an option and you don't think he's a total loss, I'd recommend family therapy. But that only will work if he wants to salvage the relationship and is open to change. I tried dragging my dad to it, and it was a no go :/ He went with the expectation that I would change and he would change nothing. I kept going to therapy and eventually got to the point where I realised I wasn't the problem.He's not in my life anymore because he is the one who refused to change, and his behavior continued to hurt me a lot.

You can get the blood test if you feel it's necessary, but the depression is probably related to growing up around your dad. If you still live with him, it's better to move out and get that distance so that you can see who you are apart from him and under your own rule.",1543622437

In the [documentation for cellfun](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cellfun.html), you can see in the Syntax section how they have `func` and then `C1, ..., Cn`.  Each of those C's is a cell array of the same size.  You can't use `'Trial'` there.  What you can do is make `@eg` a 'wrapper' for your real work function, extract the contents of the cell in there, then have it call your real work function to pick `'Trial'` out of the table contents and return the scalar as `B(idx)`.  Then `eg` can return those to the cellfun iteration and so on.

Exactly -- unless a guy is really (and truly) some ""microdick"" dude -- then ANY woman that **complains** about her guy's dick as being too small...

Well that's cause to ""curb"" her ASAP (literally open the door {car or building} and kick her ass to the curb) ... because she's just outed herself as a total slut.

--
BTW, -- if I weren't MGTOW, and were still chasing pussy -- well I really think I would; and that GUYS in general *should* also do the same kind of thing with women's height.

Specify that they HAVE to be at least 9"" shorter than you, and also HWP. Why? Because they're gonna want to wear ""high heels"" (which will add 2"" even 3""+ inches in height) and ideally you want her to APPEAR be at least 6"" shorter than you.

It‚Äôs especially wrong when the only motivation for doing so is to harm caricatures of people that don‚Äôt exist and to satisfy your apparent hatred for rural areas. This whole discussion ignores the fact that the article‚Äôs subject, Trumbull county, as well as Ohio as a whole are urban, not rural.",1543622438

"news","t5_2qh3l","As with every single earthquake, there is a statistical chance that the main shock ends up being a foreshock for a larger quake. This is roughly between 4-6%. If they are talking about a bigger quake from the 7.0, that may be what they are talking about. A reminder though that 94-96% of quakes don't result in a bigger earthquake happening. 

If they're talking about a large aftershock, you can typically expect the largest aftershock of a sequence to be between 1.0-1.1 magnitude smaller. Now the 5.7 that followed the 7.0 may have been this quake, or there may be another large one. Around 5.9 magnitude. 

Either way, there is no way to predict an earthquake, so it's important to remind people of that. Anyone saying they have seen something that predicts it are being lied to. Don't blame the person, blame the publisher.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","&gt; yeah its maybe because of the autistic player base the game has that praises the game like a god because they force themselves to, lmao enjoy calling bug fix updates major updates lmao

Okay, you literally ignored the first sentence. I literally said **We never said a bug fix was a major update**, idk, can you read or...?

&gt; lmao r/tf2autism thinks a game being top 10 on steam means its okay and not in a bad state

Okay Mr. KnowItAll, what do you think being in a bad state means? If you think not getting a silver plate of updates every 2 months with a team of 4-5 coders means the game is in a bad state, then I'm trying to teach a baby to fly a plane.

&gt; see if this game literally gets an update that is literally adding a Shit emoji as a hat you guys will still play it, because what else is r/tf2 going to play ? overwatch ? ZOMG !!! r/tf2 no want no Sjw Game noooo !!! r/tf2 play MEN game !!

We play before an update and after an update, in order for a game to be in top 10, it's gotta have at least 50k consistent players. Sure it reaches higher levels than average with a given larger content update (not just bug fixes and medals) but it doesn't need updates to thrive at all.

&gt; lmao people stream tf2 with 100 viewers or less because they are stupid like the rest of the community, thinking there is hope for this dead ass game lmao

You are absolutely deluded, how can a game be dead if it is in Steam's top 10 with 50k+ consistent players? That's literally impossible. Stop doubling down on this idiotic statement that it's not new like Overwatch so it's dead. Holy shit. 

Also, people who stream this game aren't stupid. They just like to play legacy games, this game is over a decade old and even the players who stream this game regularly like b4nny, surny_, RobTheAwsm, etc. don't have endless hope for this game ever getting the attention it once had, they just play it cause it's fun and if they can get paid for it? Why not play it? Getting paid to do something fun is the opposite of stupid.

&gt; 90% of this sub doesn't know what TF2 really was because most of you guys are Post MyM Mercy mains that turned into Pyro mains and called themselves skilled with the epic reflect, lmao libtard soldier destroyed in epic reflect style !! time to secretly jerk off to Overwatch porn and call fortnite a shit game !! TF2 is in a good state if its retarded fan base says so !

Are you sober? I never once said TF2 was in a ""good state"", I said it was stale. Do you think games can only have a ""good state"" and a ""bad state"" and nothing else? We're in a fine state, there's nothing that needs extreme updating, the game is just stale if you play it for over a few hours/day, which can be said about any game, whether it gets updated or not.",1543622438

&amp;#x200B;

So I could postulate a rationale it in a number of simple ways, but I think it's multiple things interplaying and reinforcing each other. The big ones I see are a couple of evolutionary factors (if nobody has kids, the species dies, therefore it's advantageous for evolution to select for breeders, and also the explicitly competitive factors of our psychology that were also evolutionarily advantageous), a religious factor (most religions promote reproduction as a means to grow their base and keep relevant), and a group of interrelated sociological factors (we tend to value those we know over strangers, which ties back to the evolutionary points, and if we view our offspring as extensions of ourselves then their offspring are a sort of theoretically perpetual outgrowth of the self, meaning that we never die \[until the inevitable heat death of the universe, the collapse of the sun, or whatever cataclysm ultimately ends human society\]). It's sort of a web of different things telling us that having children is the way to keep ourselves alive forever in some way, which makes sense from a certain perspective, but it wholly unfounded upon deeper analysis. Add to this the fact that people pretty much universally fear change, and there's a possible answer.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the return from childfreedom to parenting again, there are a couple of different directions I could argue from.

The less complicated one is the nostalgia factor. Our memories are incredibly fallible (remembering a thing changes the memory) and we tend to reinforce the aspects we want to remember. Rewatch a movie you loved as a kid with fresh eyes and you probably won't enjoy it as much (though exceptions apply) but in your memory, it's still amazing and awesome. Negative people you knew probably throw up way more red flags in your memory than they did in real time. And since the popular position is that kids are awesome (which I sincerely doubt from 98% of my experiences looking in the general direction of a parent) it's likely that parents will subconsciously edit their memories to reinforce that position, downplaying the ""oh god, how did you get shit on the ceiling?"" moments and highlighting the ""this is when she first said 'mama'"" ones. When you choose how the samples are weighted, you can make any average sit anywhere you want.

The slightly more complicated argument comes from the subjectivity of the idea of ""normal."" I'm from a portion of the US where fish isn't super readily available, meat is a must for every meal, and the three most commonly consumed items are beef, chicken, and potatoes. I'm 34 (as noted in my flair) and I first tried goat last year. There are parts of the world where beef isn't a food, where chicken isn't a staple, and where potatoes aren't on the menu. There are also parts of the world where goat is the principal meat. From the perspective of here, those places are weird, and from the perspective of there, this place is weird. All are actually weird, all are perfectly normal, and normal is absolutely relative. This is really highlighted in people living in traumatic environments: for someone who endures a trauma on a regular basis, that trauma is just part of their normal. Going back to the fear of change, stepping out of that normal (even if it is into an objectively better situation, such as moving from a literal cage into a studio apartment) is scary and stressful. Yes, there's possibility of the other situation being better, but there's also the possibility of it being worse (in the above example, you could fail to get the apartment and also lose the cage, leaving you with nowhere to call your own, and at least the cage has a solid roof and decent heating in the winter time, and it gets really cold this time of year). You also see the same behavior patterns in addicts (""yes, I know that all this drinking is bad for my health, but it helps me get through today, and even if I stopped drinking my other problems would still be there, and I don't know that I could handle them, so give me another bottle""). While I wouldn't suggest that every parenting situation is traumatic or that every parent is an addict, we've all seen parents who show parallels.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously it's more complicated than this, and there are probably thousands of other factors at play, and every situation is a little different, but these are the ones I see most clearly in most interactions. I could also be completely wrong.",1543622442

You just need to start going to bed earlier. when I was smoking my usual sleep pattern was 12am~8am now it's 11pm~7am by that I mean I'm in bed by 10:30pm and assume I fall asleep around 11pm.

If you find it too difficult to go to bed at that time then I suggest a more rigorous work out schedule. Now that you're not smoking you have a lot more energy and stamina. Your body can keep going for much longer than you think it can. When I stop smoking I have to start going on jogs through the mountains otherwise I run into sleep difficulties. Best thing to do is to work yourself hard enough that you can't help but want to go to sleep at that time (whether that be occupational manual labor or recreation work out). Heck, even just spending more time under direct sunlight can help as it helps your body naturally produce melatonin. ",1543622443

I very much do believe that while RPGs are not DM-PC competitive games, it is within what is expected of the DM to ensure the game world is not just there for PCs to exploit.

- AT fron i am used vonchi sakiel hammerus(before jibril), now i am looking for first shot max damage, before lighgk i am thinking about ella or kyoko

- AT the mid, i am trying to use ariel, dont max her and after nerf didnt use her, i had maxed crosel, his weak spot that he is opendoor when he is atttacked cose he had 0 steal, and he cant steal, so i am lose mid and for example xing more maxed then ariel so use him and isillia hold enemy to go across her, so duke anihilating and wining me mid fight, that crosel lose. before xing i use victoria but she is not maxed. now i can max kiera that i will do after draw and dstone. 

- AT defence i had not maxed pinol that sometimes was enoght but not always cose he is not maxed. i have in addition that i wrote milena, today from mileage i draw jinmaen and khalid, i think i will use jinmaen to ramp 60% decrease to 78%. or at least 40% to 52% if i will be twoshoted. i had chundo to use building him with kyoko. 
I think nabi active pass ability in decreased cose of kiera intercept. but its in pvp but! i think they will add intercept in pve more and more, maybe. if honest looking at all legend i think that jiho will help in pvp cose of 20% pen and 20% cd. and this will help in pve to. i dont want to buy aske for pve cose i can use jibril and friend aske, i found that i can use jibril and fenrir forself. i dont know did is serestia better for pvp. cose she havent defence buf like decrease damage and etc. 

looking again i am think that jiho had top kit, what did u guys think? oh i forgot about that i can buy miri, hey how strong will be upgrade from ella\kyoko to miri, if anyone had miri\ella\kyoko\beatrice, or lev or william in penetration, wrote what did u think about how their damage differ, thank u!

B: Characters that were explicitly white in the source material got cast to black actors. Which is a great opportunity- because adaptations don't technically owe anything to their source material- to inject some diversity and diverge from the source material to create an original work but just the fact that this sounds great tells me they wont commit to it and will instead just sit there with a dumb look on their faces while they insist that the character can be black and completely missing the point. 


C: At one point they were genuinely considering making characters that really shouldn't be black, black for no clear reason. As in, ""My dad's white as bird shit, and my mom's from a blood line of people who are basically humanoid mayonnaise so of course I'm black, why do you ask?"" no reason. 


And they did this in lieu of fleshing out the lore for an element of the universe that isn't well explained- Witcher's extended lore describes an explicitly African coded continent, and we already have people who are basically coded as Middle Eastern- and building a reason for what would compel brown and black people to move to the ass-end of racist Europe. Like, we know how Turks ended up in Germany- they came as cheap labor after the Second World War. We know how Indians speak English- there was that whole Colonial affair.

"sports","t5_2qgzy","&gt;	For some people, sports is their only way to actually make it in this world, and if you got talent, you go for it.

I am certain that someone with the athletic ability of McGregor could easily apply it successfully to non-combat sports if MMA were not an option. Besides, I would argue that the harm widely broadcast combat sports do to society as a whole (by celebrating and monetizing violence) far outweighs the benefits it provides individual athletes. I would also argue that only the most successful athletes experience a net benefit since the unsuccessful ones get all the physical punishment but none of the payout.

&gt;	When you look at the live discussions over at /r/mma it often seems like the highlight of many people's weeks and they embrace a few beers while watching other blokes hitting each other. Then theres also people who train themselves and watch it because they are invested into the sport and want to watch it to learn some new tricks or see what the top of the top has to offer in terms of skill.

All of this applies to non-combat sports, but without the glorification of violence and inevitable brain damage. Baseball, soccer, basketball, cricket, track and field, powerlifting, volleyball etc etc are sports that bring people just as much entertainment and joy. 

&gt;	You get hurt in every sport. Fucked up joints in tennis, fucked up miniscus in football, broken teeth in hockey, the list goes on. 

Give me a break. Let‚Äôs not compare tennis elbow to a concussion. The obvious difference is that injuries are an unfortunate side effect of most sports, but they are the *object* of MMA. These fighters are *trying* to hurt each other while the crowd cheers them on. ",1543622446

"TheBlackList","t5_2whmr","So I guess you don't believe the impostor story. Assuming you are right you now have a few options:

* The DNA match that Garvey, Tom, Liz, Jennifer and Ross relied on to determine the bones were Raymond Reddington's was dubious in some manner. Either it belonged to some other person who was Jennifer's father (if the match was familial), or there was some other thing that led to that inference but a lot of people were mistaken about whatever led to that inference.

* At the same time the bones belonged to someone whose identity Reddington wanted hidden regardless of the mistaken identity talked about above.

* Not only did Reddington want that identity hidden, but whatever the connection between that person and Reddington was, it was known in some way to Garvey. Because Garvey thinks having those bones gives him some modicum of control over Reddington.

* Also Kate either knew who the person was and had some idea that the knowledge of that person's demise, or Red's hiding the person's demise would impact the relationship between Red and Liz. Or Kate thought it was Reddington's body and the secret she was trying to disclose was that Red was an impostor.

* Whatever the secret is associated with those bones it is sort of peculiar in that Red doesn't want Liz to know it. Kate thought Liz finding out would be detrimental to Red's well being, for some reason. Yet Dom and Dembe don't necessarily think the secret is one, whose knowledge by Liz,  is going to actually be harmful to Red's well being.

I guess you could find some entity that would meet all those requirements, but I can't think of one right now. At least not one we've seen or heard about, and I don't think those bones belong to some third party who hasn't been brought up in the story in a substantial way. It could be, but I don't believe that the secret. This is someone we have seen or heard of in a major way.",1543622446

&amp;#x200B;

Starsector is extremely friendly to *fun* trade.  The mundane trading between colonies is automated as much as possible and the player is left to perform the fun parts, like [piracy](https://starsector.wikia.com/wiki/Pirates), smuggling or perturbing the market.

&amp;#x200B;

For example you have discovered that selling at pirate bases can be lucrative but why?  Well they usually have very low [accessibility](https://starsector.wikia.com/wiki/Economy) which limits trade &amp; at those critically low levels creates shortages.  Shortages drive up prices dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this isn't a unique mechanic to pirate bases.  If you can potentially [Raid](https://starsector.wikia.com/wiki/Raid) the Starport / Megaport of a larger faction world to artificially shut down it's trade and create more enormous shortages (and profits!) in it's larger &amp; more well-developed local economy than you'd see on a typical pirate backwater.

&amp;#x200B;

Installing Comm Sniffers on Comm Relays will also give you advanced information on particularly valuable cargo convoys, which will trigger shortages if they happen to get waylaid.  What a coincidence that the convoy didn't arrive and you happen to have exactly what is needed to end the shortage, fallen off of the back of a space truck?

There is lots to dig into your comments as well. I want to start with Papadopoulos. Here is a link to the statement of charges against him: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Papadopoulos#cite_note-48

The professor Papadopoulos was in contact with claimed to have Hillary's emails. The emails were stolen in a hack. Was Hillary negligent with here cybersecurity? You bet. But that doesn't change the fact that the 'academic' was in possession of illegally obtained information. How he got them is a story for US intelligence and law enforcement to find out. Papadopoulos is accused of lying about the timing and nature of his correspondences with someone possessing illegally obtained documents.

&gt;Yes they did. Just like we do. Just like Israel does. Or China. Or Iran, Saudi Arabia, France, South Korea - or literally any country with a foreign diplomacy agenda, an intelligence agency, and an internet connection. 

Just because we influence other's elections, that doesn't mean it's right. Do we want Russia to have the capability of influencing our politics to benefit their interests?

What do you think Mueller's motivations are? What makes you so sure that he's, to use Trump's phrase, ""gone rogue""? What proof is there that Mueller is trying to bring down Trump rather than just exposing a lot of inconvenient facts for Trump?

The Benghazi investigation took 2 years to wrap up, and that found nothing. We are at two years of Meuller and he's actually found things. I don't know how long you expect these investigations to take. I guess you just assume there is a whole lot of nothing and they are just drawing it out to make Trump look bad. If this were the case wouldn't they have released a ton of new information right before the midterms as support the Democrats. Did that happen?

&gt;His [Manafort] crime was that he helped Trump win the Presidency, and somehow we blundered ourself into appointing a Special Prosecutor who's been intent on trawling back decades and decades to find any crime he can to use to pressure and intimidate people.

His crime was that he committed tax fraud. By we, you mean Trump, blundered HIS way into the investigation which was appointed by HIS deputy attorney general. Manafort was under FBI investigation since 2014.

In it, he is an obnoxious, oblivious and indignant mix of Ron and Hermione raging with hormones and angst, fed up with the family ignoring and teasing him. Teddy is seen as the responsible adult but has his own thing going on and resents being the GO to babysitter. Ron is not the most understanding of Dads.

This article ([https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/wavy/here-are-the-top-5-mistakes-wavies-make-when-starting-the-curly-girl-method](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/wavy/here-are-the-top-5-mistakes-wavies-make-when-starting-the-curly-girl-method)) has me convinced that I need to do a sulfate free as my hair is similar.

Should I just go ahead and plan on doing low poo washing or should I give the co wash with no low poo  a while before adding the low poo to the schedule? 

According to the schedule she does my next was would be with low poo in a couple of days.

To me, that‚Äôs the merit-based argument: fix your fucking life before becoming a burden on society and passing your difficulties on to your children. That‚Äôs precisely what responsible people do. When they can‚Äôt afford to live in the city, they move to the countryside and live a more frugal life.

That‚Äôs what my parents did. My dad didn‚Äôt blame the system and the soul-less bastards who were doing ok and didn‚Äôt want to have to forcibly give up the fruit of their work so that he could scrap by and live closer to the soccer stadium. He sucked it up, packed his things and moved to a cheaper, less glamorous, less convenient part of the country. 

That‚Äôs how i was raised. If things suck, you buckle up, you put your preferences aside and do what needs to be done.

I understand you were raised different. When things suck, expect others to do whatever they can to fix it for you, and call them names if they offer resistance.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, and I‚Äôve got a wife. I have friends who are shorter than me and married. Height isn‚Äôt an issue. There‚Äôs enough people out there that don‚Äôt care about height. 

Personality matters more than looks. I know it‚Äôs cliche, but it‚Äôs true. Be confident in yourself, go out, meet people and make mistakes (and you will). Focus on improving yourself. 

I was shy for a long time and was concerned about what I should do with girls- I went on a trip with a large group once, decided ahead of time I‚Äôd just do whatever and if it failed it would be with people I‚Äôd never see again. But it worked, and I made tons of friends and flirted with girls- once you realize you can do it, you‚Äôll find your confidence. Build on positive experiences and learn from negative ones. 

If you‚Äôre still concerned about your looks... Join a gym or a spin class, try eating healthier. Go somewhere good for a haircut and ask what the barber recommends. Get some nice clothes. Be confident about how you look. ",1543622455

This move is really sad. It indicates that this club is concerned about multiple offensive spots, so they trade a talented offensive catcher (a position where  the margins between good and average is smaller) to fill out multiple positions. I guess that‚Äôs what small market teams must do.

Muslims aren't Islam, though. Fervent followers of religions such as Christianity and islam may cause lots of bullshit, yes, but you're conflating moderate Muslims (think - they're like Christians that don't follow the Bible as much as some people do) with the fundamentalists.

Like with many religions, there are moderate Christians and Muslims which aren't crazy nutjobs, and there are fundamentalist Christians and Muslims which are crazy nutjobs.

&gt; Islam hates gays, isn't feminist and Muslim countries have some of the worst human rights in the world. Let's not even mention how terribly they treat other religious minorities and apostates.

Agreed - fundamentalist supporters of Islam are pretty bad. That doesn't make moderate Muslims bad, though, like how moderate Christians aren't as bad as fundamentalist Christians.

&gt; So on the one hand these people are saying we love gay rights, if you disagree we will call you a bigot. We love women's rights, if you disagree we will call you a sexist.

Yes, not supporting human rights for a certain group of people based on their gender or sexual preferences does qualify you as a bigot.

&gt; They are so morally and intellectually confused that they tolerate bigotry from certain groups because they want to be seen as tolerant. Yet if any Christians or white people behaved similarly they'd be a pariah to the left, they'd hate such a group.

&amp;nbsp;

It helps so much to write to them; about them, about us. I am honored to protect my child and hold her confidence. I support her decisions and respect her in a way I can‚Äôt describe. However, my thoughts and unspoken words felt like they would choke me. 

&amp;nbsp;

It has been hard to keep A PERSON a secret, I felt like a liar for a little while. I‚Äôve always tried to be age appropriately honest with my children, and continue now with them as adult offspring. So keeping something so monumental from her siblings and other family kind of felt like betrayal. I also don‚Äôt ever want anyone to think my grandchild or their adoption, is a dirty little secret. Because their not. 

&amp;nbsp;

I would love for my child to feel comfortable enough to share that information with the world. But, for now, she‚Äôs not. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs ok for several reasons. Most imoortant, my daughter. I will give her the utmost respect and considerstion, just as she did for her child. I will wait until she is ready or my grandchild turns 18. After that, I will brag and with hope, I‚Äôll patiently wait for an introduction. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another big reason I believe it best to wait to tell our family, is because we‚Äôve suffered so much loss. And we have learned and lived and soldiered on. We take our lumps and for the most part, we‚Äôve understood when it‚Äôs not in your control, you have no choice but to go through it. That applies to this situation too. But this time, I have the opportunity to meter some of the pain and loss and as their protector, I‚Äôm gratefully taking it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Something else I considered as I sat with my discovery for a few months... We deserve to celebrate the next ‚Äúfirst‚Äù. This grandchild will always be first, but we didn‚Äôt get to say hello or goodbye. We didn‚Äôt get to celebrate. Next time, we do. My daughter, her siblings and I deserve that ‚Äúfirst‚Äù experience too. My child and her boyfriend and his family got to experience the first grandchild/niece/nephew, even if it was bittersweet. The adoptive family got their ‚Äúfirst‚Äù moments too. I think it only just, and healthy and fair that my family get to enjoy that next birth experience in all its wonder. Without a cloud of pain from a loss we can‚Äôt negate. It feels like the best way to proceed, it helps my heart and mind to come together in a reassuring truce. So it is the plan for now.

&amp;nbsp;

My daughter and I are good, borderline great. Not full great because, well, life. And communication. And growing up. And learning better communication. This experience gave me opportunuties that were obviously being missed before, opportunities to listen more and role model less ‚Äúpeople pleasing‚Äù behavior. That stuff is nonsense and unnecessary and distracts from what is really important. I told her I trust her even more now. I‚Äôm not sure she believes me, but it‚Äôs true. I have nothing more I could teach her about sacrifice and love. And in reality, I believe she‚Äôs teaching me a thing or two. 

&amp;nbsp;

One day it will be time to announce the birth of my first grandchild. Oh! What a glorious day! Until then, we will find joy in every possible moment in between, because life is miraculous and hard and exciting and scary. But it‚Äôs worth it, and I‚Äôm/we‚Äôre in it for as long as we possibly get to be. We appreciate each other, my grown ‚Äúchild‚Äù and I. We always have, this just gives us specifics. 

&amp;nbsp;

Which is terrible but not what I was talking about. I was talking about it being a huge failure for the alt right.


&gt; What about Corey Long, an Antifa protestor at Charlottesville wielding a flamethrower? https://www.newsweek.com/corey-long-charlottesville-flamethrower-black-lives-matter-sentenced-unite-970849

.
&gt; Long, who is African-American,¬†told The Root last year¬†that the August 11 and 12 far-right-wing rally started as a ‚Äúpeaceful protest‚Äù bu¬†turned ugly after one of the Confederate flag‚Äìtoting white men, Richard Preston, allegedly pointed a gun at Long before firing a shot down at his feet. As¬†seen in AP photographer Steve Helber‚Äôs now-famous picture, Long¬†sprayed¬†a blast of fire using a modified aerosol can and a lighter. He told The Root it was his only defense after it was thrown at him earlier in the protests.

Do you even read the stuff you link? 

&gt; https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/8/12/17681986/antifa-leftist-violence-clashes-protests-charlottesville-dc-unite-the-right

So? That's not cool. What do you expect to happen now? Me saying AGAIN that some people do shit while calling themselves antifa? Me disavowing anti-fascism? 


&gt; When Antifa assaulted Police Officers who had done nothing but try to keep the peace? 

Since you demonstrated several times that you love whataboutisms I will throw a bit of an whataboutism in: it's well known and generally agreed on that police management of the situation in Charlottesville was beyond terrible.

&gt; June 14, 2017: James T. Hodgkinson, a supporter of presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, was distraught over the 2016 election of President Donald J. Trump, and opened fire on an Alexandria, VA baseball field where the Republican congressional team was practicing for the following day's Congressional Baseball Game. Majority whip Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana was one of four who were wounded. Hodgkinson was fatally shot by police who arrived at the scene within a few minutes of the shooting.

How is that related with our discussion. Stay at the topic or you can be ignorant to yourself and I won't take your critique of antifa as serious anymore since you seem to act in bad faith.

&gt; No doubt you wouldn't think that about how they labeled Proud Boys an extremist group?

The difference being that I follow the proud boys activities and know about their actions as a **hierarchical and well defined group**. It would be an appeal to authority if I would argue that the proud boys are bad because the government says so, which is exactly what you did.

&gt; they're the fucking FBI, you can read their reasons if you really want to, but I doubt you do.

You are supposed to argue your case. I'm not going to search your sources and arguments for you.

&gt; Since you think one idiot represents a group

When did I do this?

&gt; do you also happen to think that this BLM supporter who killed six cops is a good indicator of BLM? 

No. Are you ignorant or do you not understand me? 

&gt; But Antifa is certainly just as bad as the Alt-Right. 

Aaaand here we go! Lmao I'm sorry, but this is such a dumb point, I will let it speak for itself and let the readers judge. A group whichs only connection is that they follow the idea of fighting fascism is as bad as actual organised fascists. 

&gt; Proud Boys also aren't Fascists, so at last you reveal your political bias, Leftist alert.

My best advice is one, self care. Make sure you are doing things to nurture yourself. Be your own parent. Two, what are you afraid of? Why? For me, personally, I am coming up on a lot of big life changes that are requiring me to relinquish control and of physical possessions. What do those things do for me that I must learn to do with or without them? Three, in losing those things and in accepting the changes, what is it that I *truly* want? There's always that generic question of ""what would you do if money weren't an option?"" I know a lot of things I'd do and while some of them require money to do it, it also requires me to let go of material possessions and even relationships (the weaker ones, that is- strong ones will remain and you learn that quickly during these times). 

These back to back Rx's are trying to tell us something. What is it trying to tell you with this girl? What are you ignoring or denying? Focus on that and see where those thoughts lead you. 

In terms of astrology reading, see what Mercury Rx is aspecting in your chart. This will all pass eventually. &lt;3",1543622461

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I have four thousand worshippers on Hades, and I've played him since He Bo's remodel back in the beta. Here's my take.

quite a while ago, Devour Souls' detonations used to deal double their current damage to enemy gods. This was quite fun for the Hades player. Not so much for the opponent. If caught in a minion wave or if they were playing a character like Nu Wa or Arachne adding minions for you to blight, one-shots were hilariously common with the 2&gt;3 combo. 

This move is Hades' bread and butter, so it comes as no surprise that this change tanked his win rates. He was widely regarded as a trash bucket character before this nerf, actually, until on a livestream Bart revealed that Hades had the highest winrate in the game (Something like 67%) due to dedicated Hades players knowing how to blow people out with him. So in actuality this change only brought him down to about 50%-ish, problem solved? Not quite.

Remember, Hades had a very high winrate because dedicated players understood his strengths well and enemy players did not appreciate his power in lane. So this Nerf only exacerbated this issues; In order to keep up, Hades players had to play much smarter (A good thing) but enemy players had to learn to play against him less; They were no longer being punished for standing in minion waves, and often could win lane in spite of Hades' overbearing lane presence due to his now pitiful damage.

At this point, I think a full rework or at least the Odin/ Nu Wa treatment would be the best option. I think his Shroud of Fear is an excellent ability and on a more potent Mage it would be borderline insanity. 2 second silence in a massive cone, you aren't rooted while casting it like with Ymir freeze, it applies Fear if the enemy is debuffed and it applies that debuff itself. It's a great ability, shouldn't be changed in my opinion if they're just tweaking numbers elsewhere. 

His Jump has long been an awkward ability. It deals a good amount of damage and incentivizes leaping onto an enemy to lay the hurt on them, but it has a long startup animation, and slow travel time, meaning against plenty of enemies you'll only hit if they play poorly and don't dodge it at all. This may seem fine at a surface level, but when you have to rely on your opponent making mistakes to win, no matter how high your skill level, it means something is off with the ability. It's an aggressive tool; it needs to behave like one. If Hades was more of a defensive character, designed to counter-engage on enemies then I could see this ability working as-is, but playing Hades defensively simply does not work. All of his abilities have short range and require him to be in the thick of a fight; if you're Hades in a team fight and decide to ""play defensively"", that basically just means sitting back with Autos. He is a character that needs to take initiative in a fight and break his opponent's back with overbearing presence and threat, though not necessarily burst damage.

His Ultimate, actually, is in a fine spot I think. I can't mentally envision a Hades build without Bancroft's Talon and Typhon's Fang, so usually there isn't too much issue even when you've got three or four enemies caught. Unless you're facing a mass Antiheal team, they usually can't burst you down, especially in a teamfight where your allies will be laying the smackdown on them once they're caught.

However, I will admit that its uses are few and far between and compared to, say, an Ah Puch ultimate or a Zeus Ultimate, both of which are large AoEs that deal damage over time and deny area access, Hades puts himself in almost infinitely more danger. I'm not sure what the answer is, really. There are plenty of ways you can completely rework the ability into something new, but aside from the obvious ""Let him move around a hoover everyone up like a Roomba"" (Which I believe is a terrible idea, balance-wise) or the ""Let him stick it somewhere like a long-duration Poseidon Kraken and walk away"" (A slightly better idea, which would also put him into his brothers' theme of placing a circular AoE ultimate somewhere, but would allow him to Silence enemies caught inside which could be overbearing), I'm not sure I have a solution. Keep it as-is, I'd say. Maybe give him %Mitigation, or, in my opinion a better idea, a Thorns-like effect that gets more powerful as the Ult levels up. 

I love Hades, but it's hard to say he's in a good spot with a straight face. He's been on the backburner since before the Season 1 Conquest Map existed. It's high time for some major changes. I can think of few other characters that have been played so little for so long; He's featured in one or two high level pro matches each year, but never puts up enough of a showing to convince anyone of his strengths. And rightly so, considering he seemingly has none compared to the newer roster of kits to choose from.

With this energy it can destroy souls, travel through time and worlds, and even has the ability to corrupt all realms which makes it multuversal. It can summon demons and control hell.

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","200 was a tent pole event according to... Ariel, Luke Thomas, John Morgan, Bret Okamoto among others. I personally respect their opinion more than yours.

I never said NA wasn't more important for a US based organisation I said that MVP/Daley fight happening in the US isn't disrespectful to a UK audience because of the DAZN deal. Bellator 200 w/ Mousasi fight and MVP fight was alot bigger to MMA fans. Just look at the views and traction it got on MMA Junkie and MMA Fighting compared to 198/199. It's not difficult to find the info, a quick search comlete destroys the notion 200 was less of an event than the two events prior. 

I also have to guess your not educated on the moves Bellator are making in Europe right now? You alluded to the not being interested in the market yet fail to make a comment on their cannibalisation of Bamma and creation of European shows. 

Here's the Coker interview that backs everything I'm saying.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I wanted to look at the daily wire to see how they were covering this.  I despise Ben Shapiro or rather I consider him a fraud and partisan hack.  It was the day after it was reported Manafort had been lying to Mueller and was working with the Trump defense team.

How did Shapiro's site cover this huge story?  They buried it first of all not to unpredictably of course.  The story was like 15th.  But most importantly they reported it in such a dishonest way.  They made it sound as if Manafort was now speaking to Trump's lawyers after Mueller ended the plea deal. **The headline was ""Manafort‚Äôs Lawyer Is Now Talking To Trump‚Äôs Legal Team"".** Ok so that's true but what about the most important part that Manafort had in fact always been talking to Trump's legal team? Yup not mentioned.  Not mentioned was the fact they never ended their joint defense agreement.  Gee why would they not mention this?

Total bullshit!  It was written in a way that in itself didn't actually lie it just left  out such important details and was worded in such a way as to paint a completely false description of what was really happening.  How long can the right ignore the truth?  This truly was an amazing piece of propaganda for trump supporters.  It totally removes from the article that trump and Manafort were working together because most people recognize such as unethical at least or illegal.  Can't allow Trump supporters the idea that Manafort was working to get a pardon or that Trump was using Manafort to gain insight into the Mueller investigation or so the two could corroborate their stories.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","Actually, most of that Info isn't known to the vehicle. Oil pressure on cars without a gauge is just a simple switch, either pressure is above a certain point (No light) or it isn't (light) Very few vehicles have fluid level sensors. That's also what your eyes are for to check your dipstick and coolant levels. Your car will tell you how your transmission is doing. When it sees a problem, it turns on the check engine light. It doesn't have a sliding scale of good to bad, and that would take a ridiculous amount of sensors (which would also have possible failures)

And oil life timers are notoriously bad. Especially as the car gets into higher mileage. Your manual has recommended mileage service intervals, use those if you want the car to last

Adding a bunch of sensors to monitor stuff just adds more failure points and more people doing damage. If you're the type of person to never check your oil, you'll likely just add oil if the ""oil level low"" light comes on. You may have plenty of oil, but the sensor  just failed 

Adding a ton of expensive sensors to monitor stuff that takes literally seconds to check isn't cost effective.

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","&gt;""'I think this is harmful, so let's harm it out of existence'""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum

What's actually being discussed here is arresting the growth of a contagious system of mind control so that humanity is not swallowed up completely by it, which would result in a great many important truths being buried forever, and the never-ending repression of women, gays and apostates.  

&gt;""Your 'justification' for forceful 're-education' /torture of Muslims is that Christians have gay camps...???""

Muslims don't have those kinds of camps because they [murder their own children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing) if they are gay or apostate. This is not a rare exception but the norm, and the only reason it isn't seen more frequently is that gay and atheist children in Muslim families generally conceal that about themselves out of fear for their lives. As /r/exmuslim about this sometime. 

&gt;""I didn't quite imagine that your ego would be so unprecedentedly overgrown that you genuinely believe, without a shadow of doubt, that you have discovered the great truth about our world.""

You don't have to be a genius to know a cult when you see one, any more than you need to be a genius to conclude that there probably isn't a Nigerian prince looking to share his fortune with you. You just need to know how to identify various forms of fraud by their structure and operation. 

&gt;""I am religious, and yet I am able to accept that I can't fully know for a fact what the truth is. You are someone who is so caught up in his own cult of non-belief that you are no longer capable of any critical thinking that questions your pseudo-intelligence.""

Haha, really? Not being in a cult, is itself a cult? Ooohhh, that's insightful! That cuts me right to the bone! I bet you tie your shoes all by yourself, you big clever boy! 

Where did I ever claim to be particularly smart? Haven't I said over and over that you don't need to be, simply to recognize fraud. All it takes is an understanding of how various types of scam work, like introducing dead viral husks to your immune system so it can safely learn to spot them. 

This threatens you because having read my posts, you can now identify the same red flags in Christianity and other Abrahamic religions that I do. The resulting cognitive dissonance has made you defensive.

&gt;""I want you to read that sentence again, with an open mind, and maybe try to consider that you're really not that different at all from the bible bashers who can't see past their own 'truth'.""

If your only criteria is certainty. But that's a narrow, single-point comparison designed to arrive at an outcome that is rhetorically useful to you. You apparently don't think it matters who is right, probably because you do not value truth. I value truth. I think it matters very much who is right. Truth should unapologetically supplant falsehood, and while the truth of a matter is not always knowable, this isn't one of those times. 

&gt;""You've trapped yourself in a cult of your own making, and anyone who points out your error-littered logic is clearly just a sheeple blinded by religion. It's really somewhat sad that people become so deluded without even realising it :/""

That's you, though. This is some classic /r/selfawarewolves. But you're misusing the term cult. Not just anything is a cult. Somebody who disagrees firmly with you is not ""in a cult of their own making"". That's you throwing anything at the wall you think will stick.

&gt;""BTW dude, if your interest is piqued by barnyard animals, maybe you should go live with them. We as a society needs less people who are that mortifying mixture of dangerously uninformed, and blindly opinionated.""

I think I'd rather be the one who decides where you're going to go live. As [more and more people realize the truth about your religion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religious-affiliation-is-rising/), the developed world will increasingly turn against it. Ironically, more or less as predicted in Revelations. Only there will be no supernatural last-minute rescue for you. 

&gt;""Please see a therapist.""

You're the guy who worships a deity that [explicitly permits keeping slaves](https://steemit.com/religion/@alexbeyman/what-do-christianity-islam-judaism-and-mormonism-all-agree-on#comments). Including underaged girls abducted from conquered lands and forced into marriages with the men who killed their families, or used as concubines.

people eat each others shit and drink each others piss.

people self mutilate themselves and castrate themselves without anaesthetic.

the limits of a fetish do not exist.

one man even had a cannibal kill and eat him after attempting to bite off his penis. willingly let a man kill and eat him for his own sexual pleasure.

now, training one on purpose may be more difficult, especially through masterbation alone.

but if you found a way to associate beans with whatever your fantasy is, over time you could develop a synaptic relationship between beans, and pleasure.


here is my weird story that draws a similarity. i used to jerk off in a bathroom before taking a shower, as a teen, i used to dip smokeless tobacco, specifically grizzly wintergreen. be cause i always took a dip of snuff before and during jerking off, even to this day years later when i do not even dip anymore, when i smell the smell of wintergreen snuff, it triggers my brain into being aroused because ive experienced so much enjoyment associated with dipping, beating off. taking a preshower shit, and then showering.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives who draft and share model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.[2][3][4]



ALEC provides a forum for state legislators and private sector members to collaborate on model bills‚Äîdraft legislation that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures.[5][6][7] ALEC has produced model bills on a broad range of issues, such as reducing regulation and individual and corporate taxation, combating illegal immigration, loosening environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, weakening labor unions, and opposing gun control.[8][9][10][11] Some of these bills dominate legislative agendas in states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Maine.[12] Approximately 200 model bills become law each year.[8][13] ALEC also serves as a networking tool among certain state legislators, allowing them to research conservative policies implemented in other states.[10] Many ALEC legislators say the organization converts campaign rhetoric and nascent policy ideas into legislative language",1543622473

First.  What you're wearing/weather.  That's gonna be the biggest thing.  It won't be particularly cold, high of 55, but it looks to be rainy.  Wear waterproof stuff.  Raincoats and ponchos are allowed.  Umbrellas are not.  Seat cushion or a towel is also recommended.  Sun (If it comes out) will drop behind the home side seating area so you may never see the 55 degrees.

Parking and Tailgating:  Early is key if you don't have a place lined up.  But if you run along King Street there are a number of lots that allow parking for $20 and they seem to allow tailgating from what I saw last weekend.  There is also a lot available on Poplar Grove connector but that's too far of a walk.  This is in the 2-3 hours before kickoff window.  

While I haven't seen it since I stayed at my tailgate til it was time to walk in, there is apparently now a beer garden right outside of the stadium.  Again, haven't seen it but I've heard good things.  Also a good option and gets you right by the stadium for kickoff.

Any restaurant you go to is gonna be a zoo.  So that just kind of is what it is.  But I think Macado's is cool, though I haven't been there since they expanded.  Our Daily Bread is also downtown and pretty awesome.  Coyote kitchen for the vegan/vegetarian/hippies is good, but not at all near campus.

After using that Twinzer and then trading it away, I just wasn't content going back to Octane.  I immediately went out and grabbed an unpainted one for a couple crates and haven't looked back.  I still miss that Black version though, it was pretty.

I still love the Octane but it's super annoying to see everyone and their grandma using the same setup.  It feels like 90% of pros/Champ3+ players are using Octane + plain looking paint finish + Christiano wheels.

- If it is a multiplier (like 7x frenzy), click the ""Force the hand of fate"" in your wizard tower (upgraded with a sugar lump).

After about a year the family mom called up my mom saying their dog was too much to handle, too expensive, and they couldn't keep up with so many kids and a dog so they were going to re-home him (more of a hint hint, take the dog off our hands since he plays with your dog) so we adopted him. 

About three months later we hear the same neighbors adopted two labradoodles... The best part is, the two new dogs are WAY more hyper and wild than the doggo we took in, and all the time I see themplaying in mud, romping through puddles, and chasing cars up and down our road, meanwhile the dog we ""took off their hands"" is well behaved and low maintenance.

I think this is why graphics APIs using pipes end up using names like `add_axis()` and `add_legend()` (cf. **ggvis**). Addition is a nice abstraction for plot creation!",1543622475

"PokemonLetsGo","t5_j7skv","I feel like I am throwing this advice out to calm my own nerves over this stuff but I suggest creating a second account and using that one as your Legendary Hard Reset bot. That way you can pull yourself away to actually play your game on your main account when you want and dedicate some time resetting on your other account at your leisure (for birds and Mewtwo). Transfer it to a friend and back to yourself when you get them!  


Maybe having someone else help you fill your dex ahead of time for the shiny charm is the best route but so far, this idea seems like the best option to people like me that don't want to pause their main game for weeks + hard reset endlessly and would rather stumble on a shiny legendary in the wild :(   


Either way, sorry to hear it is still taking so long.. I was just thinking that maybe finding them in the wild would be better but I suppose when I think of the math, having a guaranteed encounter every couple minutes is much better odds... make that second account and save yourself from wiping all your efforts so far.

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","Look up CWS (Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome).

Pot supplies THC to our body, which moves signals to our brain in a strange fashion, causing the high, the enhanced tastes, the funnier jokes, the relaxation...  

When we supply too much our bodies stop producing the chemicals that we normally use for that process.

Then when we decide to quit our bodies are broken.  It takes a while to start up production again.

While we can clear the THC out of our bodies within weeks those chemicals take much longer to return.

There are guides online for getting through this.

I had never tried Meditation until I quit pot.  It's a great way to accelerate your bodies resumption of calming chemicals by forcing yourself into calming situations.  

I am also trying beginner Yoga which has helped to relieve the pressure in my chest and back from the heightened anxiety of quitting.

I haven't reached a month, yet.  I'm at 25 days.  But I only smoked for 4-5 years.

I am feeling pretty good but my Dysphoria is pretty bad (taking no pleasure in anything) and I lose my temper too much.

Good luck!",1543622477

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Everyone has moods. Everyone is being toxic in your game is simply stressed out. Whether they are depressed, had a bad day at work, they are on a losing streak and don't know why. Toxicity will always exist in this game because it is a stressful environment and players are anonymous. Bans and reports do it's job when people are going overboard, but everyone gets mad and flames at times. How you react to flame is just as important as reporting toxic players imo. It's important to realize that it isn't a problem with you, it's a problem with them. So there's no reason to take it personally and retaliate. If you play to win, learning to keep your train of thought on the game rather than on players will help you win dramatically. If you play for fun, maybe take a break after playing a particularly toxic game and have something non-league related to do to clear your mind. Because unfortunately you will inevitably get attacked in this game from time to time. ",1543622477

I wouldn‚Äôt mind but this issue will be taking deliveries off riders in that area as well as making me lose out on deliveries in the area I‚Äôm booked in. Also the area I‚Äôm getting delivery requests for is in the city centre of Liverpool.

The whole reason I don‚Äôt work in that area is because I deliver in a car, the city centre is a nightmare due to the one way system, a lot restaurants being in pedestrian areas and finding somewhere to park, not to mention the nightlife, traffic &amp; taxis on a Friday &amp; Saturday evening.

I tried it once but it just isn‚Äôt viable in a car. It‚Äôs far more suited to cyclists &amp; scooter riders.
There are 2 other areas outside the city centre in normal urban/suburban areas, 1 of which Rider Support said Im registered to that I have always booked &amp; I‚Äôve never had this problem before.

It‚Äôs just frustrating as other riders will be missing out as well as myself having to constantly reject deliveries. What is the point in having specific areas if your going to be getting pick ups in other areas?!

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","&gt; As for the split - if there are 0 differences you should see a 50/50 split. That's how it works. That isn't an assumption. Do you need it explained to you?

Yes and my point is that you haven't observed a ""split"" so why would you assume there's a difference at all? Do you need *that* explained to you? I'm not taking the subject matter seriously; I'm taking the faulty logic seriously - because I always do. Your starting position is that right handedness is correlated with preferred stirring direction when you have absolutely 0 reason to believe there is such a correlation - because you have 0 data on preferred stirring direction. 

&gt;my whole point is that I don't think it's 50/50. Here are some simple anatomical reasons

&gt;which may possibly contribute to a difference we don't know exists.

Why investigate the reasons behind something you don't even know exists? That's what's confusing me about what you're saying here. 

&gt;None of it is credible. No shit.

The information may not be credible but the logic can be assessed for credibility nonetheless. And I'm saying your logic is flawed because you're making unnecessary assumptions and attempting to defend a position you don't have any reason to be taking. Maybe you're right that there's a correlation between these two phenomena, and hell, maybe you're even right about the mechanism behind it, but arriving at the correct conclusion via incorrect reasoning is just as bad as getting the wrong answer. The goal in approaching problems scientifically is to both get the right answer and have gotten there via the correct path. ",1543622480

"Goruck","t5_2w0zr","I'm actually right about your size, 6'3"", \~285lb, broad shouldered overall big dude I actually have three GR bags now, a 15L bullet, the 26L GR1 and a 40L GR2 for travel. The GR2 is arguably the most comfortable but I've had the GR1 the longest, just over a year now. I had the exact same concern when I first got the GR1 as the straps were let out practically all the way and they felt so stiff, I was troubled and thought I made a huge mistake. 

However just in using the bag as a daily carry for work it started to break in a bit and once I started to weigh it down with ruck plates and use it for walks with my dog it definitely helped with the straps. I never got physical pain from it (other than wearing a heavy pack on ones shoulders lol) but I would say it's definitely more comfortable now than when I originally purchased the bag. I would love if the straps were just a bit longer but it does fit me well now.

"MadeMeSmile","t5_2uqcm","A few years ago I lived with my sister. She's wheelchair bound and has had service dogs since middle school. 

One day I was home alone when I noticed blood in the hallway; just a few drops on the floor. I followed the drops and noticed the drops got bigger and there was some on the wall. The blood trail kept going into my sister's bedroom. When I got to get bathroom there was a huge splatter on the door frame and on the floor. 

I called her at work to see if she had injured herself and she said no, why, and I told her what I found. She asked if our dad had been there to fix something but I said no. I started to get a little freaked out, thinking maybe a stranger was in the house, but all of a sudden my sister yelled 'Elf', her service dog's name and said there was blood on his tail. 

Turns out the silly dog had wagged his tail so hard against the door frame to my sister's bathroom that he split the end in his tail open. She didn't notice until I saw the blood.

- bow only run

- freeaim only pure caster run

- no rolling, blocking, parrying

- can make a low level coop char and fight off twink invaders. Ideally something like level 11 +1 weapons and help in high wall. Is a pve pvp merge and it's hard to defend fresh char hosts but also pretty fun imo.


- can do a [dried finger run and cosplay something fun](https://youtu.be/JPgpJCDfL-M) Also a pve PvP merge challenge.

Even last season while at PSG Messi still scored 17 more goals than him. I mean he is a little closer this season but he is still playing in a less competitive league.

Young Dalinar was very self-absorbed and Brandon did say he wouldn't see the consequences his actions had. Thus, this one scene, I think it made Dalinar see with his own eyes how his sons were having a reaction to his behavior.

Afterwards, Dalinar stopped drinking so heavily and stopped yelling at his sons. So yes, I would say Renarin helped Dalinar though not in the way he thought he did.",1543622484

"Vermintide","t5_36d6l","&gt; I don't but I need to dodge side to side so unless there is some pressing need to spray your beam right beside me it's your fault if I take damage from your beam.

So your presence means a ranged character can't even fire in your cardinal direction? Any area that you might potentially dodge into is off limits? How mich real estate do you feel entitled to?

&gt; Me being in a horde does not mean you can't get involved. Ranged classes have melee weapons

Oh so I'll just forego my weapons and talents and perks and just pretend I'm a completely different class. Wouldn't want you to have to inconvenience yourself by, I dunno, using *your* ranged weapon, the whole world needs to bend over backwards to accomodate you.

&gt; expect a melee focused game to not be ruled by classes that can run basically the entire map without switching off their ranged weapons.

So somebody not standing aside for you, babysitting you, and tailoring their playstyle to accomodste you is **ruling** the game?

&gt; If you pay attention you can avoid all or almost all of that damage

Same with melee. That's what stamina is for. Block, push, dodge, you don't need temp HP if you just GIT GUD BRAH.

But you shouldn't have to GIT GUD BRAH, you deserve temp HP. It's the people you don't like who need to GIT GUD BRAH because they don't deserve temp HP. When you get whittled and backstabbed and chipped down, it's not your fault. You lost your health fairly, you get temp HP back fairly. When I get whittled and backstabbed and chipped down, it is my fault. I lost my health through failure and don't deserve temp HP.

I turned 27 this year. I started HRT about 5 months ago. Before I started, I was convinced that I'd never be able to pass and that I might as well not even try. Well.

Maybe you've forgotten, but Dark Dawn [ends on a psynergy vortex returning and threatening](https://youtu.be/RKXIF2bedM8?t=1115) the land. It's literally a post-credits ""What will happen next?!"", at least from my perspective. That was the reaction/interpretation most fans that I interacted with at the time had.

&gt; Like advance wars dual strike

Well, you say that, but remember that Dual Strike's poor sales led to them rebooting the series with a fully different cast in a completely different tone as a way to revitalize the series. And while I adore Days of Ruin and is still the best game in the series for me, it launched with horribly suspect conditions. It didn't even launch in Japan is how little faith they had on that game. I fully believe that Wars was given one last shot exclusively because of how old a franchise it is.



&gt; Cancelling a series that was still doing good numbers while continuing other series which still aren‚Äôt (metroid) and others for 1 or two more games which weren‚Äôt (advance wars) is a weird business decision

For sure there's some funky reasoning there, but remember that at its peak Metroid did pull some pretty impressive numbers and is massively better recognized than Wars or Golden Sun are, by a landslide. They gave Advance Wars one final go at it and, after DoR criminally underperformed, the series was axed in favor of Intelligent Systems making Fire Emblem forever. Metroid as a brand is just more valuable.


Believe me, I'd also kill for new Advance Wars and even am willing to give them a chance at redeeming Golden Sun. But it's undeniable that Dark Dawn did not do enough to keep interest in the series going.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Don‚Äôt know how tax works in your country but you pay per bracket where I live. So 0-20000, 20000-40000, 40000-80000. Or something similar. It should be the same in any western country. It depends on what type of bonus it is. Most countries have a seperate tax bracket for variable income that‚Äôs not in your employment contract and therefore not considered to be part of your yearly base income. That‚Äôs the advantage, so you don‚Äôt get put in high tax brackets when your pay is low but bonus higher. Disadvantage is isually, the special bonus/commission tax bracket takes a bit cut (usually half or more) and you‚Äôre left with not much of your bonus after taxes.

If your bonus is however in your employment contract or you‚Äôve signed a seperate variable compensation plan, then it is considered yearly income and it coul put you in a higher tax bracket. In this scenario though, you pay the full 85k in the higher bracket, but then we later when doing your taxes. You get the difference back.

So let‚Äôs say your current bracket is up to 70k but now you are at 85k. You will only pay the higher tax number from the higher bracket for the 15k that‚Äôs above the 70k limit. Everything below will be in the tax bracket you are used too. They usually do this after you pay taxes as it‚Äôs too much work to look at each individual on a day by day basis and they‚Äôd rather calculate for the whole year after.

I am just making up numbers as I don‚Äôt know where you live and what tax brackets you have there.

Just know: it will always happen fair because if you were always earning 85k you‚Äôd have to pay the extra tax anyway, so if it‚Äôs one time only, just this year, it is only fair that you pay it.

Finally, some countries have an arrangement, for people with extremely variable incomes, where you can add the yearly incomes you received from the past 3 or 5 years and divide by 3 or 5 to get an average per year. Which would likely result in a lower tax bracket and getting money back.

Hope this helps and hope you actually live some place normal where all of this or similar is applicable.",1543622489

Some brief thoughts after a quick listen:

* Sample 1 - Just no. Horrible compression artifacts. Somewhere **way** below 128kbps would be my guess if you didn't mention it's a VBR test (or did you set the max bitrate super low for this?).

* Sample 2 - Little better than 1, but not much. Still gives those late 90s ~ early 2000s flashbacks.

* Sample 3 - Keeps getting better, but still some audible compression artifacts and swishiness in the cymbals.

* Sample 4 - Getting good now!

* Sample 5 - The best sounding to my ears, though not 100% sure... #4 sounds quite similar when switching between the two. 

* Sample 6 - Similar to 4 and 5, but perhaps slightly more highly compressed?

Ranked best to worst sounding: 5 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt;&gt; 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Out of the six, samples 1, 2, and 3 stood out to me as clearly the worst - I'd stay away from that much compression.

I was late to a job interview by a couple of minutes due to congestion and closed streets the day of my interview. My recruiter told me the VP is not for tardy appearances so I know I am out of the running for this job.

It sucks that attempting to be ten minutes early made me two minutes late for a company I would love to work under but things happen and if it happens to you, just own up to it and apologize profusely.

The interviewers were nice and even acknowledged that the meeting started a little later; we went 15 minutes over and the first interviewer took a bit more time than the VP for the immediate second interview.

If it happened to you, there's nothing you could have done and move on to the next interview. I haven't been told I didn't get the job but my recruiter told me it doesn't look good even if I have a good excuse so I'm just not expecting an offer.

Have a good weekend everyone and good luck to those in the job hunt process. Lots of interviews from companies happening to start off the new year so keep your chin up.

Somebody told me to arrive half an hour early. Would love to if I was 5 minutes away but it takes me half an hour to get there.

"GestationalDiabetes","t5_2w321","Not Asian myself, but married into an Asian family. My husband's family lineage stems from China. My sister-in-law never had GD, and as far as we know, none of their cousins have either. So simply being Asian isn't necessarily a guarantee, but risk could very well be skewed by region.

Also, based on what I've learned since getting here is that your weight really isn't a determining factor for GD. There's plenty of us here who were a healthy weight prior to pregnancy, and I have several obese friends who never got the diagnosis. 

I know it seems really scary. I'm severely needle-phobic, and I was so upset when I got diagnosed. But as others have said, it's really not that bad. Yeah, it sucks to need to monitor your blood sugar and abstain from certain foods, but it truly is manageable.",1543622491

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Fallout 4 was a step down from Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, but it had its moments. I didn't give a shit about the settlement building system, but I liked the weapons and armor crafting system. There were several moments in the main quest where I thought the writing was actually good. Some of the characters in Fallout 4 are my favorite and in my opinion the best written in the whole franchise - Piper, Nick Valentine, Kellogg and so forth. I like the overall theme, of losing your identity and then building yourself a new identity in a new world.

&amp;#x200B;

The story really should have been the Railroad against the Institute, with those two factions more fleshed out. I'm not opposed to having the Brotherhood of Steel involved in the story, but they should not have been a main faction. Also fuck Bethesda for killing off the Lyons dynasty. The Minutemen were totally unnecessary, the game would have been better without them.

The problem is that Bethesda learned all the wrong problems from Fallout 4, and amplified everything that made Fallout 4 crappy in Fallout 76, when they should have gone in the other direction.",1543622492

First, I'd tell your manager that you cannot work nights anymore, no exceptions. Make it clear that in your current position, you're job description is a daytime desk agent. You're happy to pitch in when necessary and cover shifts outside of that scope but not to the extent she's abusing that flexibility. You chose to move to days for a reason, they/she agreed, so from here on out, that flexibility is gone and you'll work the shifts you were hired for. 

Second thing I'd consider is reducing your hours to part time. Treat it like a two weeks scenario and say that in two weeks you'll need to reduce your hours because of school. You could even explain that the way the schedule has been it's forced you to reevaluate priorities. School is more important and work is becoming a detriment to your education. ",1543622493

It even reminds the reader in the article, this doesn't necessarily mean that more hate crimes are happening, simply that there are more reports of hate crimes.

There is a huge confounding variable that we could just be experiencing the result of more awareness of the problem as more people are reporting it, or expecting police to deal with it now.

Another perfectly valid claim that fits this data is that the incidence of hate crimes could have decreased, but due to more awareness in society more of the remaining incidents are being reported.

&gt; The six Western Balkan states - Albania, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia - are at different stages on their paths towards EU membership, with Serbia and Montenegro being the most advanced, while neither Bosnia nor Kosovo have candidate status yet.

&gt; Montenegro and Serbia are the frontrunners in the region&amp;#039;s EU perspective, and a European Commission strategy published earlier this year proposed 2025 as the accession date for both countries.

&gt; &amp;quot;With all energy focused on adopting and implementing reforms, in particular in the rule of law chapters and on the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, more chapters could be opened in the months to come. The European Parliament stands ready to further support Serbia on its European path,&amp;quot; the statement quoted Igor Soltes, EP rapporteur on Serbia, as saying.

I know he was trying to be fair and maybe he would start making better points eventually but he‚Äôs kind of just speculating on stuff he doesn‚Äôt really know about. Analytics only tell half the story. The eye test is just as important. Watch the games, watch the players, and don‚Äôt focus too much on the stats. CoJo is fat and above a better defender than DC and Myles is a better defender than Domas. You can see the differences if you watch the games much more clearly than you do by studying box scores and advanced analytics

Every year some of the buyin (20-50% of the total) goes to a separate ‚Äúempire‚Äù pot. Every year goes on the same until one team wins the league 2 or 3 times in a row (depending on what you guys pick). That owner then collects that year‚Äôs pot, the empire pot (which could be equal to or ten times the yearly pot by that point), and initiates a total reset in the league, new startup draft and all.

This gives bad teams a reason to keep fighting instead of leaving the league (since some of their money is still out there), allows for the hope of some fresh air in the league to those that are unhappy, and gives a great ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù point for teams that realize they don‚Äôt want to do dynasty anymore without them leaving a husky of a team behind.",1543622495

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","To directly answer about their ‚Äúposition‚Äù on the periodic table, I think it‚Äôs important to point out that the high atomic masses of these elements have a large contribution to their properties. As the nucleus of the atom in question gets larger, relativistic effects kick in to a higher degree, and have a more prominent effect on the properties of the atom. 

The overall result is a metal atom that behaves in a more ionic way (keeping electrons near it, but not sharing with other atoms) rather than in a covalent way (sharing electrons with neighbors). The atom‚Äôs orbitals are drastically different from other metals, in that they do not extend outward, and their electronic properties are largely determined by spin-orbit coupling instead of things like ligand-field theory. 

This results in rare earth elements having a large number of orbitals that are close in energy, meaning that they can house a high number of unpaired electrons. This results in interesting electronic and magnetic properties.

Seriously, she feels guilty for stupid shit all the time. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense as to WHY she would feel guilty about it. It drives my step dad crazy.

My dad believes in the same religion (they met in Christian school, but divorced years ago), and forced me to go with him during his weekends. It was such a waste of time and we went TWICE on Sunday‚Äôs. I HATE church so much I can‚Äôt even properly express it. We wasted so much time together because of church. 

All that my grandparents talk about is church, God, abortion, how climate change isn‚Äôt real, God is coming back soon, etc. They don‚Äôt see my mom or their grandchildren very often because all they care about is the church. They put church above family. 

The kicker about all this is that my grandmother was extremely abusive to my mom. Beat her all the time, cussed her out, mentally and emotionally abused her. And the church people knew about it, but still worshipped the ground they walked on. They did nothing about it! And yet, I‚Äôm going to hell for being spiritual. But it was completely okay for my grandmother to beat the living shit out of my mom because she ‚Äúasked for forgiveness‚Äù. It‚Äôs fucked up. 

I left that religion a few years ago and I am completely spiritual. I believe in science/energy. I‚Äôm not completely free from it though cause I sometimes will feel guilty or fearful of hell. It‚Äôs getting better, but all that fear can really mess you up. I am so jealous of my friends who never had any religion forced upon them and could freely decide for themselves.

I don't say directly bacon, but if they hear that it's meat, they ask what kind of meat.

I also said that to my atheist friend who is also a cashier, that many people don't know that there is bacon inside. but he says it's their responsibility. What he means by that is : I don't care about them.

&gt; The six Western Balkan states - Albania, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia - are at different stages on their paths towards EU membership, with Serbia and Montenegro being the most advanced, while neither Bosnia nor Kosovo have candidate status yet.

&gt; Montenegro and Serbia are the frontrunners in the region&amp;#039;s EU perspective, and a European Commission strategy published earlier this year proposed 2025 as the accession date for both countries.

&gt; &amp;quot;With all energy focused on adopting and implementing reforms, in particular in the rule of law chapters and on the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, more chapters could be opened in the months to come. The European Parliament stands ready to further support Serbia on its European path,&amp;quot; the statement quoted Igor Soltes, EP rapporteur on Serbia, as saying.

However, I do not agree that we should resign from our de facto position as a global leader. This is where I can tell you don't really grasp how geopolitical gain benefits a country. 

We benefit at home *a lot* by virtue of the fact that we have more allies than anyone and access to more markets than any other country. Why do you think we try to preserve that order? Because we benefit from it. We also benefit greatly from our military deterrence abroad as well (again, we could achieve this and still spend way less on our military) and since WWII, despite the sensationalism in media that makes it seem otherwise, are experiencing once of the most peaceful periods in the history of human kind. We should preserve that. The majority of people on this planet benefit from that fact.

I am all for helping Europe deter Russian aggression, before their attempt to conquer Ukraine ignites the next world war, which we inevitably be dragged into. Deterrence is the name of the game.

What we need to stop doing, though, is invading countries that don't pose an existential threat to us or our allies. Like Iraq and Afghanistan.

When I was growing up in HS (grad. 1976) my Dad was a revered teacher, several times Teacher of the Year, and so by happenstance, I was well known as ""Teacher X's Son"" over many years. He taught Biology and Sciences, many was the time I graded papers for him (and changed a few grades), anyway, long story short: I am somewhat recognizable to the 5-0 in our town, simply b/c many PO PO had my dad for biology back in the day.

Fast forward: the 5-0 has always let me slip by, w/ a warning, ""Go Home, Son."" Nary a ticket or even a glance, when day see mah name, it usually goes ... ""Say, Man ... didn't I have your Dad for Biology??"" and we cool.

At least three times I should have been dead to rights, but the 5 say, ""We cool, we just leave this here, and PLEASE ... just go home. We escort you home now.""

I figure my nine lives are about up by now, so I don't put my self in those situations any more ... but back in the day ... I got many passes, just from Officer McJudge having been in my Dad's Biology Class back in HS.

I still get letters sometimes, for him, from ex-students wanting to thank for his teaching style and inspiration. They don't make 'm like that anymore.

Miss you, Dad :)

Say that you are a socdem/marLib/socCon. If the legal system doesn't allow anyone to set up a private business, you can't really have any right wing economic policy other than having a referendum to make it legal again.

So, your party can only advocate for social reform, foreign policy,  military policy and the level of government centralisation in the economy. This means that de facto every political organization is some shade of socialism,  since workers own the economy no matter what (or the party does for totalist countries)

I think overall kaiserreich present an interesting view of democracy. Citizen of the commune and UoB have electoral rights; they have a right of free enterprise (you and your pal could start a new technology coop to develop syndie televisions, perhaps with government lending ressources to get going); the only thing they can't do is have a financial sector.

In real life this is the greatest problem of worker coops: how does one get financing? It's obviously impossible to sell shares to get initial financing.  I can imagine the UoB and the commune having a central ""bank"" that invests in research institutes and in defence contractor coops.",1543622499

This isn't a fucking movie, and Mueller knows the intense gravity of indicting a sitting president, hence why he's going to take his laborious, methodical and intricately detailed time to process this out.

The entire fucking reason he's only charged people like Flynn and Pap with lying to the FBI is that he's has a mountain of charges ready to drop on them if they don't play ball, and furthermore, the state has a plethora of non-double jeopardy charges as options in case Trump pardons them, for the very reason that Mueller played it like that.

People need to remember, this was the guy that took down Enron. That was an incredibly large, and mind bogglingly complex fraud created by some of the smartest and most successful tax consultants in the world  - one that to this day, needs an entire fucking book just to explain it.

And Mueller not only unraveled it, but he painstakingly took down all the major players and the entire company.

This isn't a sprint for Mueller. It's a Marathon, while playing chess.  

It's costing a pittance compared to the Contra investigation by Reagan and the Beghazi investigations by the GOP, so money isn't the issue. Shit, it's actually made a profit due to the Manafort forfeiture.

&gt;Most of you are racist cunts.

&gt;There are real issues that need to be talked about and they're being drowned out by you morons.

&gt;A lot of you are taking a few screen shots of messages as gospel from, let's face it, the media, and talking to someone that has shown nothing but respect like a piece of shit.

&gt;I don't know the whole story.. nobody does.

&gt;Who here is Christian? If so.. I assume you're as guilty as the priests involved in the systematic abuse of children.. no? Read the bible it's as bad as the Quran.

Please tell me what it is that I said that has caused you to get so defensive and talk crap. Was it this line?

&gt;The Syrian boy had **allegedly** threatened to stab the boy.

Or maybe it was me pointing out that this happened weeks ago? Or there are thousands of children being bullied, including a girl from the same school that was hospitalised after being attacked, and there was no front page story or nationwide outcry? Was it because I pointed out the **fact** that you do not know the reason he did it? Maybe me saying that the kid obviously needs to be taught a lesson wasn't said with enough vilification? It can't really be because I have Nazi in my name? Did you notice the liberal in it too? It's an oxymoron my man. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't mean anything.

Especially if your goal is to pump out multiple settlers quickly in your capital in order to compete with the AI on higher difficulties. Toss on Colonization with the Limes and Magnus and you can easily get two settlers and some bonus production toward something else out of a single chop.

2077: Great War, Sole Survivor and family froze in Vault 111, Brotherhood founded by Roger Maxson in the West. Enclave founded by President John Henry Eden at Raven Rock. House saves Vegas and goes into coma.

2081: Fallout 3 begins, LW born. Roger Maxson‚Äôs best friend Owyn Lyons is sent east to scout DC for remnants of pre-war military and government. Makes stop in Pittsburgh...

2087: Kellogg and Institute take Shaun from Vault 11.
2091: Vault 8 opens, Vault City founded.
2092: Richard Grey exiled from Vault City. Winds up at Mariposa with Harold and becomes the Master. Spends 8 years building FEV army.
2095: President Eden dies. ZAX super-AI at Raven Rock adapts itself to recreate him.

2100: events of Fallout in the West, Albert Cole defeats Richard Grey, exiled from Vault 13, group of admirers follow. NCR founded at Shady Sands.

Also 2100: events of Fallout 3 and Broken Steel in the East, Enclave retreats west to Poseidon Oil Rig.

2102: events of Fallout 76 in Appalachia. Village Elder born to Albert Cole and Pat in Arroyo.

2130: Chosen One born to Village Elder in Arroyo.
2138: House regains consciousnesses.

2147: events of Fallout 4. Nate released from stasis by Shaun, hunts down Kellogg, you know the rest.

2150: events of Fallout 2. Enclave resurfaces, Chosen One takes them on, you know the rest.

2157: Edward Sallow and Joshua Graham found Caesar‚Äôs Legion in Arizona. President Tandi dies in Shady Sands.

2164: Mr. Bishop, son of Chosen One, takes control of Bishop family at age 13.

2184: Hoover Dam taken by NCR Scouts, Mr. House finishes renovating the Strip. New Vegas Treaty signed.
2185: Ulysses and Legion scouts spot the restarted Hoover Dam, Caesar begins planning invasion.

2191: events of Fallout New Vegas. Courier sides with Yes Man, NCR wins Second Battle of Hoover Dam but evicted from to Mojave Outpost. Caesar and Lanius die, Legion collapses into anarchy.

This represented less than 0.1% of the 1,895,546 crimes (excluding traffic violations) that were reported by police services that year

Only 563 of these crimes were violent (for example, assault, threats, criminal harassment and other violent offences) - 740 were non-violent, and 528 of those were simple 'mischief'

Of these violent crimes, only 67 involved bodily harm, and the rate and number of violent hate crimes continue to decline each year

This is in a nation, one of the most diverse in the world, of 37 million people

"windows","t5_2qh3k","I bit of an update.  These three PC meltdowns I described may not have been caused by the 1809 upgrade process itself.  The fault seems to be to do with account corruption.  Over on the Microsoft forums one regular contributor described this as an ""epidemic"" currently.

The fact that there are valid System Restore points suggests that the problem happen either before the 1809 upgrade or well after the upgrade - Long enough after that at least one Restore Point had been created.  Account corruption also explains why a successful System Restore doesn't fix the problem.

I'm now curious to know if the PC's I have seen with this fault are running 1803 or 1809.  I will enable the hidden  Administrator account on one to gain access to the machine, then report back.

"Cubers","t5_2r6a3","I am a bit slower than you, so I don't know how much my advice will be helpful, but I'll try. 

1. You use a lot of forward slices and very few back slashes. Try to alternate forwards and backwards as much as possible. I don't always do it perfectly either, but especially in algs you should practice that. 

2. Many algs contain /(-1,-1)\ (often called ""M2"") - this is really easy to fingertrick, if you practice. The second slash is always backwards. Also practice fingertricks in algs in general. 

3. Nice parity alg. It's my favourite. And you nicely exploited it for CP skip! 

4. In your first solve your AUDF before the slice correction was weird. You aligned the U-face with a U3, then flipped the slice only to do another U2. First do slice correction, then AUDF, as the slice correction will perform a U2. 

5. Learn which of your EP algs flip the slice (most of the simpler ones don't). If you need to flip the slice, cancel into it. 

6. Learn scallop-kite cubeshape. (-4,-4)/(1,2)\(-3,4)/(1,2)\(0,3)/ is how I would solve the second scramble case (notice how I alternate forward and backwards slashes). Similarly, at 3:14 you were one slice from scallop-scallop, but you went to 8-edges first. 

7. On the fourth solve, if I have adjacent swap on top and W-perm on bottom, I like to set up a Z-perm (M2 D' M2 D M2). I don't know whether that's ideal, but I like it that way.

Nobody is outraged at the ""violence"", that happens every single play on the football field.  1 game suspensions are handed out for fights that occur during a football game.  In hockey, it is a 5 minute penalty when two men literally drop gloves and exchange punches to the face.  But Hunt kicks a woman in the butt with 1/4 force, after she slapped him and called him a N-word, and he should be suspended?  Does that mean that every father that spanks their child should be in prison?  Or is it just when a father spanks his daughter?  Is spanking a son ok?

You go to India and you'll see South Indians complaining about how sexual and disrespectful North Indians are, North Indians complain about how backwards thinking South Indians are. North Koreans believe the South are weak or stupid for allying with the US, and Southern Koreans think that North Koreans are stupid to believe in a Dead Leader. 
Each Country outside the US and the EU do not think that it's a bad thing to believe that their country is the best, they will belittle other countries behind and in front of people of that country. It's funny to see how citizens of the West think so little of their own countries when their governments haven't actively committed genocide against their own citizens recently, while governments in the Middle East and Africa are willing to kill their own minorities just to make the majority happy. 
Check out the history of Uganda, Rwanda, the fighting between Sikhs and Muslim across the world, How Christians are treated in Egypt, the Korean/Japanese/Chinese perception of the other Asian countries, or the opinions of the Latin American countries with other Latin American countries and a very important example, the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany before WW2. The list goes on and on, these feelings of resentment to other cultures go deep in to ones being, it takes generations to forget about them. Americans and Europeans only think white people are racist because, guess what, white people happen to be the majority in those countries. However if you look at the entire world, they are the minority by so much.

The fastest way to end racism is to get to know people who are racist, don't ridicule them, respect the fact that they are entitled to their own opinion, but show them that a person is still a person regardless of the color of the skin or where they were born. Read up on Ron Stallworth  if you don't believe me. Martian Luther and Gandhi thought the same, so did Malcom X AFTER he converted from Nation of Islam to Sunni Islam just before he was assassinated by the NOI.

So I'm sorry but it's not the White Mans fault, they are at the moment a very popular scapegoat for our own races hatred towards others not like us. Once the white man goes away, people are gonna find another group of people to fight or bring down. Post European Africa and India are perfect examples, even after Europe left these countries, I accept the fact that the Europeans didn't really these countries in the best of states before leaving them, but my point is that you still have Indians hating on Indians and Africans hating on Africans based on castes in India or religious beliefs in Africa and India, and that stuff isn't going away anytime soon.

PS. If you belong to one of the races I mentioned from above and you don't agree with me, congrats you are in the minority, like I am and so many people I know are. But this is how the MAJORITY of the people in countries around the world think. ",1543622508

Korra was really upsetting for me for a number of reasons, but I won‚Äôt say it was a bad show. It had some neat characters and sometimes a good storyline. 

I hated korra almost exclusively for the part where the evil spirit god thing cut the link to the previous avatars. This infuriated me because it messed with my favorite fantasy universe. It would be one thing if korra would have just been a part of the cycle, but NO the show took it upon themselves to sever the lineage of avatars, and restart the cycle. This was simply meddling too much with my favorite fantasy universe ever.


With regards to the sporadic negative sentiment for korra on the ATLA sub... well I understand it‚Äôs annoying and usually involves weak arguments and opinion shouting, but please accept that this is not the korra sub, and there shouldn‚Äôt be anything wrong with criticizing posts that exclusively pertain to a different show.

Feared supercomputer should destroy the World Championship - now the chess world is responding to the mystery

LONDON / OSLO (NRK): AlphaZero chess computer shook the chess world a few years ago. Therefore, they have chosen to hold back information after the World Championship match.

In December 2017, Google released a number of chess games that shocked the chess community.

They had developed a chess computer that used artificial intelligence and played at a level that the world had never seen before. AlphaZero taught itself to play chess.  Over 100 games against the computer Stockfish, AlphaZero won 28. The rest ended with draws.

Eleven months later, the computer is so good that the developer believes it could create trouble for the players in the World Championship.

Therefore, Demis Hassabis, the man behind the computer, chose to hold back a scientific article with new games from the supercomputer.

""We did not want to get it out before or during the match.  It could affect it.

- In what way?

""If we release hundreds of new games, the players will come up with new ideas. I'm not strong enough to understand how they could have learned, but it could affect the World Championship match. Therefore, we are waiting for the World Championship, Hassabis answers.

Playing very aggressively

The computer learned chess in four hours. It did not get any other information about the chess game than how the rules work. Then it started playing against itself.

Hassabis estimates the rating to be around 3600, but says it's hard to say anything exactly. The chess players who have seen more games say that this is something brand new and that they feel that the board is bigger. Even Hassabis says that ""the program plays a completely different chess than the usual computers.""

There is more room for ideas. And that can be a huge advantage to the player. So if we make it available, everyone must have access, says Demis Hassabis to NRK.

The games that are published show that the computer is playing more aggressively than usual. In addition, it looks so far forward in the game that it is impossible for a person to understand.

- Do any of the players use it now?

- No. I think maybe Caruana uses Leela (a kind of copy of AlphaZero),   but if we make this available, it must be available to everyone. If   not, it will be unfair, ""says the developer.

Not sure about the importance

Until now, it has been difficult to really use the games for learning. Now there are more games, but the question is whether it's playing at such a high level that even Magnus Carlsen will struggle to understand.

- It's so deep, the program plays in a way computers have not done before. They took it to a whole new level. There is still a part that is kept hidden, says chess journalist and founder of the website Mattogpatt, Tarjei J. Svensen.

He suspects that the people behind the computer exaggerate the importance of their own product.

""They have been good at creating a lot of blast around AlphaZero. I'm very hard to believe that this changes a lot, but I think many in the chess world are excited about what comes from there, says Svensen.

The developer, of course, does not agree. He believes that players like Magnus Carlsen, who play a special kind of tactical chess, have a lot to pick up.

""I think AlphaZero fits a player like Carlsen, who plays so dynamically. He has the best style to work with AlphaZero's ideas,"" said Hassabis.

- Bugs and crashes happen with any game. They also don't happen all the time with every device. They are going to be better on some devices than on others.
- I don't think raids are uninteresting, but that's probably a big reason they're adding pvp, to give more variety to the game for folks bored with raiding
- EX raids are not great but they actually have improved quite a bit with their changes
- Child accounts are child accounts. Any child account in any game is going to be heavily restricted, that's kind of the point
- I swear if gen 4 pokemon were not rare you people would complain about how they're too easy to find and catch. Rarity is not a bad thing, it extends the life of the game

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; But you actually do... In a national election for a President that is elected to represent all Americans, you want a vote from one state to be worth more than a vote from another state.

I want all places within the United States, every single distinct place, to actually have some say in how their country is run.l, to have their distinct problems heard and accounted for. 

I already agreed that the system is unbalanced. I do not agree that your solution to the electoral college is a solution that will balance the system. I think your solution will imbalance the system in a different way, which can be argued as better or worse form of an attempt at balance, but cannot be argued as a balanced system. 

&gt; You talk about States rights... to which I  point out that the states are represented by the Congress. Do you not agree with this?

Yes they are represented like that in the legislative branch. I agree. 


&gt; The executive branch was setup to represent US citizens as a whole, not the individual states.

The executive branch is to enforce the laws created by congress, and is thus accountable to both individual representation through its connection to the house and its state obligations through its connection to the senate. Both are equally in power within congress, so the executive branch represents the will of both. 


&gt; Why should other branches of the government also give greater representation to the states with small populations?

Because as much as we all like to assume all Americans are one people, we are not. Each state has its own industries, its own issues, and its own ambitions. The lives of people in Rural Mississippi are no less important than the lives of people in Chicago. The people in the Rural Mississippi do not have such a large voice in the media, in political debate, and in any nation wide issue. A crisis in Mississippi will be ignored much more than a crisis in Chicago. They are a ‚Äúminority‚Äù at the whim of the majority. It is only when we give unbalanced power to the minority can we protect the country from a tyrannical majority and respect the livelihoods of the minority. We made that commitment a long time ago. 


&gt; But you actually do... In a national election for a President that is elected to represent all Americans, you want a vote from one state to be worth more than a vote from another state.

No I don‚Äôt *want* to discount anybody. But whether I don‚Äôt want to or not, either policy I support will end up discounting a region or group of people. Your solution discounts rural America just as much as my defense discounts those in cities. It‚Äôs an abstract concept and is difficult to explain because measuring it in equal voting power seems to be the most fair solution, when I am asserting it is not. That goes against your intuition and I understand that so I am going to try to explain it to the best of my ability so that you at least get a reasonable chance understand the perspective. If you can‚Äôt understand it, then it‚Äôs a failure of my part to explain it in an understandable way. I am in no way an expert of written communication and think that if we had an hour long discussion over a beer it would establish connections I can‚Äôt make in writing. 


&gt; Why should a vote from a citizen in California be worth less than a vote from a citizen in North Dakota?

I will use this example of North Dakota in my attempt to explain this. If our executive branch moved away from the electoral college to a system of direct democracy, then North Dakota citizens will no longer be able to influence how the executive branch functions in a way that actually matters. When someone reads that their first thought is ‚Äúwell no they all have equal votes‚Äù, which is true. They do have an equal vote. However, giving them the equal vote does not give them equity. Their votes are so minuscule comparatively to other regions of the Country, their issues no longer become equal in terms of national attention. Their chances for success and to have their voices heard exponentially decreases, as made evident by their minority. Unless the majority becomes attentive to their issues, despite being unfamiliar with them, then the rule of majority will gain more power and (possibly) lose respect for the minority. As a nation that believes that every American deserves to have their voice heard, we have to try extra hard to hear the voices of those who typically go unheard. Even though the system is currently unbalanced towards the majority, is it better that way than to create an imbalance it towards the minority? The minority are inherently easier to be abused by the majority than the majority is to be abused by the minority. 

Philosophically, I stand by that and reluctantly tolerate the fact that people in the cities are being somewhat discounted, even though I wish there was a perfect system that did not discount anybody. The majority can withstand the abuse more than the minority can, and can reestablish power much easier. If the minority is abused, there is no mechanism upon which it can reestablish itself without the mercy of the majority. Because of this, I believe balance of power, when unbalanced, should be biased towards the minority rather than the majority. I believe by making our election a pure democracy, we will rebalance the system towards one that is biased towards the majority, leaving the minority forgotten as their problems become ignored over time. That is unacceptable to me, because their lives and problems deserve the same care and devotion. 

It is principles like this that make me favor things like affirmative action.

Asexual reproduction is possible (and occurs in some real world reptile species) but that is a whole other discussion.

I think that people of all races embracing other cultures will only bring us closer together. Its important to have individuality of course, but creating ideas like cultural appropriation only cause segregation in my opinion. 

I wont lie, Ive been mocked by cafeteria ladies and classmates when I was young and my mom would pack me little bits of dumplings and sushi and other strange foods. Its incredibly embarassing to be unable to open your thermos, but refuse to ask for help from any cafeteria monitors because youre afraid they will laugh at your food.  But now that its much more popular, Ive only seen benefits, rarely do people mock me for food choices. 

I am Chinese, ethnically Hakka. Recently a girl wore a qipao to prom or hoco or a school dance. While some of the poses and dances she participated in are very untraditional, and border on disrespectful I think she looked beautiful! I hope that qipaos and more chinese style clothing become popular because I want to see more integration of my two cultures. I am not only Chinese, I am Chinese American and there is not enough to represent both sides of me.

For the first circle, you can see that it has a x range between -3 and 3 (found using the radius and the x midpoint). For the second circle, you can see it has a x range between 1 and 5. Since 1, 2, and 3 fit between the ranges of both circles, they work as possible integer x values solutions. 1 and 3 I found out don't work because they are at the edge of one of the two circles. So the only possible integer x value that could work is 2. By plugging in 2 to the equation, you have found out the maximum y values at x=2 for both circles. You forgot the +- though, so the minimum y value would be - radical 5/3. Since 1, 0, and -1 are less than radical 3 and 5 and greater than - radical 3 and 5, that means those three y values work at x=2. Graphing the circle helps a-lot for visualizing this.",1543622521

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","First off, if you decide to get Morrowind, I recommend to get in on PC (it's also on GOG) for the mods.

In regard to bad aging, it depends what you value; You can pretty up the graphics quite a bit with sharper textures, new effects, higher view distance, lens flares, shaders, and so on. Animations mostly stay as bad as they were sixteen years ago, though.

At its base, it's not yet an action game, meaning the combat can feel pretty lackluster, especially in the beginning when your weapon skills, armor skills and attributes are all still low.

It *is*, however, a role-playing game with all the trappings; It's considerably more sandboxy than the later titles: You can enchant your own gear with a myriad of effects, craft your own spells, you can levitate, water walk, confuse NPCs by locking their doors; You can find the best gauntlets in the game half an hour in, since loot does not yet level scale. There *is* an intricate fast travel system in the game, but unlike Oblivion/Skyrim, it's actually integrated into the world and its lore, it functions across multiple different modes of transport (Mark/Recall, Divine Intervention, Almsivi Intervention, Mage Guilds, Boat Travel, Siltstriders, Pylon Chambers) that you will need to understand and effectively utilize to zip around the island. Factions have a ""counterplay"" mechanic to them in that you can't be grandmaster of all of them at once, because certain factions despise each other, and you belonging to one will make them not want to deal with you.

Narrative-wise, this one blows the newer titles still out of the water with ease, even though NPCs are not voiced, and world-wise, it's still the most intriguing setting by *far*. Hell, on PC, it even has a better interface than either Skyrim or Oblivion, not that that is hard.

All in all, I would say: It looks a bit dusty (though with the right mods, it can still look breathtaking on occasion!), it plays a bit clunky, but if you are interested in the world, in rival factions, then it's still absolutely worth the two or three hours it needs to get you going (yes, it does start out slow). Also, I heavily recommend you read up on how the leveling mechanic works, because it's very easy to screw yourself over in that regard - it's grotesquely counterintuitive.",1543622525

There are a slew of extremely important differences between the two, but that list is much smaller when it comes to social issues. The Fascist movement tended to oppose Conservative parties, largely because they weren't accomplishing the changes that they supported. 

From that reference:

&gt;Many of fascism's recruits were disaffected right-wing conservatives who were dissatisfied with the traditional right's inability to achieve national unity and its inability to respond to socialism, feminism, economic crisis and international difficulties.

Once again: Fascists largely hold conservative social values, but are revolutionary in nature",1543622529

I did not say you said worth. This is you lying.

 &gt;If you‚Äôre going through move the goalposts and change or add to my words, I‚Äôll step away now.

Thing is, I didnt. I quoted your words, unchanged. I even make it abundantly clear in the text which words are yours by quoting them. Again, this is you lying.

&gt;Tell me what those two reviews say. 

Do I need to do that because you had trouble reading them yourself? Here's the first one:

""Sad to realize so many people accept this level of child abuse in the 21st century. This book should be banned and they should be in jail""

That is a person saying how sad it is that **so many people accept this level of abuse on the 21st century**. They're literally saying it's part of our culture and you linked to it as proof not??


&gt;Tell me where this is govt and not some batshit crazy lady...again, moving goalposts and adding words. 




You're lying again. Here are your exact words (emphasis mine):

&gt;A young man got flogged in Singapore for graffiti.  That doesn‚Äôt happen here **because we don‚Äôt have the same rules and culture.**  

You, in your own words, claimed that such beatings dont happen here because we dont have the same rules and culture. That **is not** a claim that the government doesnt beat people. It's a claim that floggings dont happen here because of differences in rules and culture. I showed you where it pops up in our culture. **You** linked to a review that points out it's part of our culture. The same page you linked to further down confirms that the book has sold over 1 million copies and yet you think two reviews (one of which confirmed it is part of our culture) prove that it's not?

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I can def relate (ftm to a now 12 wk old, mostly sleeping in the living room so hubby can sleep for work, and dealing with loneliness/depression). I‚Äôm sure you are getting lots of great advice but My two cents are as follows: 

(1) talking to your OB about what you are experiencing... you can do this at your PP appt but it also never hurts to take action now and call the office and speak to an advice nurse or send a message direct to your provider over the patient portal if that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs available. 

(2) finding a mom group or mom-friend to spend time with. Or even family. I am/was fairly withdrawn but my friend who also has a young baby pretty much forced me to FaceTime with her (I had a lot of excuses why I didn‚Äôt want to... even though I knew in my brain it would be good to do) and it did wonders to connect and relate/commiserate with someone. 

(3) going for stroller walks if possible. I remember trying to get my LO together for a short stroll in the neighborhood and it seemed like so much work getting the timing right (fed + napped) just to walk for 30 minutes but it felt good to get fresh air. And it is so good for your recovery. 

I felt pretty bad until a couple weeks ago.  I feel I am starting to surface from being plunged into the depths of doing new-momhood alone and really feeling the loneliness. The FaceTiming with my friend and also spending time with my sister has really helped. Probably also just the stabilization of hormones that causes new moms to be more emotionally all over the place.  I also noticed a marked difference after talking to my OB at my appt. I felt silly/vulnerable but she was very understanding and gave me good advice/options for coping. 

If you are desperate, pm me. I‚Äôd be happy to video message with you. You‚Äôll be amazed at how nice it is to just have someone who understands.

"Ingress","t5_2vij9","In my play and from others around here, VR items are hoarded over a long period of time because of the low drop rate and low dup rate in caps. Agents are very selective about when they are used. They are also hoarded because the only way to get a decent slow drip of regular duplication is to have enough to nearly fill a cap. This change will lead to even less use/more hoarding. This will be especially true for agents in areas with far fewer portals than urban areas. Only difference is they won't dup. Perhaps that's what you are trying to do, maybe to help newer agents at the expense of long time agents.

Large inventories of them don't make them VR, the inventories are a product of being VR. 

A move like this would be OK in POGO since you don't have burn out and can spin all day long without needing any gear on a stop to increase output. Ingress, well not so much.

Is the gameplay really that different from other FPSs, I know that tactics matter and information/good communication is key if you play in groups, but apart from the gadgets/skills, the game in it's core is similar to shooters that came before it, is it not? Or are there any other game mechanics I should be aware of other than destructible walls/objects?

* [Another curious situation that's not possible in Beta 7...](https://i.imgur.com/Lbdrgt8.gif)

Also decided that I'll be doing a little release this month before *Beta 8*, just something fun for December to tide everyone over until the actual major update (this month I'll mainly be fixing a few annoying bugs/QoL issues, but also want to add something... special and fun :D).

Next week will be all about the new map I'm adding. The lore for it is already written, though there's still dialogue to write, NPCs to put together, then designing and building the map itself. (Also next week will be able to get back to streaming--had to skip that this week since my son was sick.)

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","&gt;The dirt floor could have settled.

It's not the basement floor, just one section, about 3' sq, of the basement ceiling/main level floor.

&gt;If you made your argument, what was the response?

I haven't responded yet, I wanted to get feedback first.

&gt;why the fix was completed before this was agreed upon.

I was going to be out of town and suggested he look at it while I was gone and then we'd discuss it when I got back. When I returned he'd already done the work. I just received an email giving the costs ($1800) and asking me to pay half. 

&gt;I imagine the bill in question is pretty low, so you might consider paying to stay on good terms in case something else needs attention.

And that's part of what I'm weighing as I decide how to respond. It's almost entirely labor. Materials were just a couple 4x4s, a bag of leveling compound and a small bit of sheetrock. The $900 isn't a problem, it's the idea of paying to fix something that shouldn't have been a problem in the first place.

I just don't know why the floor sagged in just that area. As I mentioned in the original post, I thought the joist above the duct work might have been cut but I was able to use a small mirror today and see into that area and the joist is there, connected to the cross beam. 

So I'm left with a mystery of why just that area. There's about 15' of floor to the west, east and north of this area that is just fine, it's just this one 3' square area above the new duct work.

I expect I'll pay it, for the ""stay on good terms"" reason and since I can't point to something that was done wrong, other than the floor sagged and shouldn't have.",1543622537

Which does not make you an expert on this topic.

The actual result of that period of sociology was something along the lines of ""let's leave individual phenomena to psychology and societal phenomena to sociology""). I wouldn't use my knowledge of IR to try to make psychological profiles so you should not use psychology to make economic observations.

He's on record saying he knew he wasn't a ""regular"" fighter who had to step into the ring on a weekly basis, so when he was in there, he'd absolutely sacrifice his body for the show. That Titantron-scaffold jump he did was bonkers (even if he landed on a pad... fuck anybody who thinks that it's not skillful, scary, or life-threatening to throw an elbow drop from that height at full strength/concentration, let alone exhausted *at the end of match*), and the match with Kurt Angle is just below Foley's infamous HiaC match in terms of sheer punishment.

Dude knew how to throw down and do what he felt needed to be done for the show, regardless of his own safety. There's more work ethic and heart in that dude's socks than all of the Trump's property in the world. ",1543622537

Then they take their time finishing the other side - but the pillars and underpass tunnels were all built at full width already. 

Here are some examples on the Ken-O expressway that opened in 2016(?). Only one side is open, and only has full separation at junctions, which were fully built. Those are the ""passing lane"" sections for the normally 1-lane sections.

Just because the Discovery channel says it is unexplained and weird doesn't mean it is. When people believe every presented conspiracy at face value without doing any real research or reading what any actual experts have said (Giorgio Alex Tsoukalos is not an expert on anything), or presenting actual arguments, that have the same amount of rigor applied, they just sound exceptionally credulous.  

I think it is sad that 'Ancient Aliens' has had such an impact on people that now searching for real information on anything they presented is 90% false information spurred by that program which had no real experts to begin with.

Well, that doesn't really matter, because YOU are not the one making a value judgement. **Society** has set a standard for what is **normal health. You will not admit this fact.**

The definition of normal is:

Conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.

In this example, society sets a standard for normal. If no one was around to set a standard for what is normal, with nothing to compare the blood test results with, it is not possible to refer to the results as ""normal"" because you have no reason to expect it, given that you've had no other results to compare it with. In order to have a set standard, you must have something to compare. Do **you** understand this or not? You are the one dodging here.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I came home from a 12 hour shift as a waitress one night. I originally was supposed to work 8 hours but then my relief called in sick so I took the job. I called my husband and told him I was going to be gone another 8 hours. About four hour in to the new shift (at the 12 hour mark), my boss saw how tired I was and told me to go home. 

I went home and walked in on my husband fucking the waitress who had called in sick (a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of mine). They were both very drunk. I was so mad but I was more heartbroken. After a lot of arguing he guilted me into driving her home so that she didn‚Äôt drive drunk. Made me feel bad that if she died trying to drive home, that I would never forgive myself. He also blamed me for working so much as to why he cheated but he refused to work (ever) so I had to do double shifts all the time to feed us. I was also going to college full time and pregnant.

I guess this is more a sorry about how broken and weak I was than how much of an ass he was. 

Bonus story:

My dad had a 1988 (maybe 87?) ZX that my husband LOVED. It was in mint condition. My dad gave it to my husband and I so that my husband could have a car to drive to go job hunting (something he never ended up doing.) my husband was so excited he stole money from my dresser and got a ‚ÄúZX‚Äù logo tattooed on his hip. 

A few weeks later it wouldn‚Äôt start and my husband put it on Craigslist and sold it at a rock-bottom price without my permission. That car was my dad‚Äôs baby and he gave it to us in the hope that it would stay in the family. The guy who bought it from him popped the hood after the sale and cut some air conditioner belt that had seized up (I think? I don‚Äôt know a lot about cars) and drove it away. My husband was so pissed that the fix was that easy. I can‚Äôt remember the mental gymnastics he did, but in his head it was my/my dad‚Äôs fault. ",1543622540

##Rule 2: Repetitive Content, Generic Content, Unrelated Content.

#Repetitive Content

&gt;Re-posts are not allowed.
&gt;
&gt;If your post is removed under this rule it means your topic/question/etc. has already been posted numerous times in the past, or has been posted recently. [Search the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) before you post.

#Generic Content

&gt;A post is considered generic when it fits into one of the groups listed below. These are commonly low-quality, low-effort and repetitive posts and are usually removed unless you put actual effort into them or your post is otherwise extraordinary.
&gt;
&gt;* Reviews
&gt;* Chat logs
&gt;* Store tags
&gt;* [Game news feed](https://i.imgur.com/BUB5wqB.png)
&gt;* ['Funny' system requirements](https://i.imgur.com/9PopsfF.png)
&gt;
&gt;These are just examples to give you a sense of what type of content falls under this rule.

#Unrelated Content

&gt;Posts must be about or be related to Steam, Valve or this subreddit.
&gt;
&gt;General *gaming-culture* and *game-specific* posts are treated on a case-by-case basis.
&gt;
&gt;We don't allow fluff/bug posts showcasing products that were deliberately designed in that way in order to be posted and showcased on different communities en masse.
&gt;
&gt;If your post is about a specific game and is not relevant to this subreddit in anyway other than the game in question being sold on Steam it will be removed. 
&gt;
&gt;Exceptions can be made in *extraordinary cases*, for example when a long time classic is finally sold on Steam, a product is/was pulled from Steam, or when an event is relevant to Steam as a whole. These are decided on a case-by-case basis.



If you feel your post was removed by mistake or is an exception, feel free to message the moderators using [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Steam&amp;subject=Appeal%20of%20my%20removed%20submission&amp;message=Can%20you%20please%20take%20a%20second%20look%20at%20my%20case%3F%0A%0AReason%3A%0A%0A%0ALink%20to%20the%20item%3A%20https://old.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/a1xvtc/-/).

"7daystodie","t5_2xdtu","I have to admit I love that they put this in. I might want them to lower overall block damage, or increase block hp, to compensate a bit though and balance out. It causes a bit of an issue in A17, where due to them ""sensing the weakest block"" they go to that location and tries to bash it. In A16 it was more spread out, so damage dealing to individual blocks was slower even during a horde. Now, single blocks can be wasted very fast, and then the AI will path through that for all the zombies in the horde... 

But that's something which can be tweaked! There are some ways to mitigate, but it takes advantage of the AI being predictable in certain situations, but I feel we risk having to build a rat maze instead of a castle just to beat them, perhaps a bit too much AI changes :)",1543622541

It *is*.  It's about truly loving your partner.  But that's *also* why it's about sex.

It's about 'speaking' that love to them the way they need it to be 'said' to really *feel* loved.

It's about their needs, and their happiness being equal to your own.

It's about truly *wanting* to do what makes them feel loved, for that reason alone - even if the activity has no inherent meaning or desire for you.

...

To answer your direct question: *Lots* of things - and they do make me feel loved.  But (for me) sex is so integral a part of me *feeling* loved that its lack *cannot* be made up for in other ways.    All the food you can eat, no matter how great and how necessary itself, won't assuage your thirst.

"BFS_RP","t5_3bdqq","Hans was already suited up after he learned of an announcement that they would be having a flight training session. It might be for the best, Hans did need to take his custom and recently updated Gaplant for a test drive. He heard both good and bad effects that the pilots had from driving these monsters. He climbed into one of his primarily grey Gaplant's cockpits. Hans fastened himself and made few checks on the systems as Gaplant was moved toward the launch pad.

-

Before Hans finished, he was already up on the launching pad. He formally announced his name and his rank before moving his mobile suit into place. All of this feeling being back on the official front lines and obeying orders brought back memories. He swore to himself quietly, he thought he had lost the memories over these years. ""This is Gaplant Hans Custom, ready for launch."" His senses sharpened once he heard the familiar beeps as the lights ticked down on his launch. With a familiar beep, Hans suddenly was thrown against his seat. He struggled to speak as the Gaplant was dragged across the launch pad and is thrown into the black void, ""Launch is successful. Moving into position."" Hans spoke as he opted in for the Gaplant to transform into its Mobile Armor form.

-

The transformation was a phenomenal experience for him. Hans never had piloted a mobile suit that had the transforming perk built into the frame. Hans had driven several suits that specialized in either stealth, close quarters combat or even both. The Gaplant was of a caliber he never had the chance to drive, and it threw him out of a loop.

-

Regardless, Hans jerked his hand forward and the mobile suit obeyed as it tore through the starry sky toward his squadron, taking the left side of the ship.",1543622545

Using the numbers games, i would guess almost all guys will have some random social interact at least once in 5 years and i am low balling those figures, the distance of once in 5 years to never is a fairly large one.

As for how would i feel, well as with any ""life"" situation..... its never happened, ive never seen any interest, so if it happened now, theirs a setup, theirs some prank going on i either happen to walk in to by mistake (hidden cam stuff on youtube) or a setup aimed at me by someone (i have no friends so i would assume its a youtube prank).

* Invited to VIP open night events, free parking, free food etc (had one few weeks ago for a new restaurant catering for high class people (food wasnt great, wouldn't go back, way to expensive)
* Offered to use fairly expensive cars for free to see what i really think, most are nice, not worth the money though so i wouldn't buy them (BMW just invited me free (personal invite from BMW Canada to me alone) to see the new car (8 series i think?) not going to it, not really wanting to buy a sports coupe, they chased me to ask why i declined",1543622546

It also gave the player actual choice in how to attack the objective without forcing them into the trope of a specific class. Do you want to defend the skies or make a quick taxi drop off? Grab a Warhawk. Do you want to defend the skies without going airborne? Grab a rocket launcher, or hop in a flak gun. Or get lucky with a tank or a sniper rifle.   
Want to sneak around? Grab some proximity mines and tag up enemy bases and wait for the kills to roll in. Or throw a proximity mine on a truck and drive it at an enemy base and dive out. It also either made you feel like a complete boss, or like your death was your own fault because you KNOW the mechanics pretty quickly.  
It was great because it gave players the tools for creative engagement and allowed us to PLAY instead of WATCH the game. Something I have a big problem with in modern games.

I see. People talking loudly during a conversation hurts my ears, and sometimes there will be a louder inflection that just sounds piercing, ugh. I don't know why I'm so sensitive. I'm really sensitive to like cymbals, hihats and sh/s sounds in music, so that makes me lower the overall volume as those always seem so painful and disproportionately loud for some reason. 

Yeah that makes sense, that it's hard to tell objectively. I hope the fact I have sensitive ears means I won't expose myself to things that are as loud. It does mean though that constantly I'm noticing things that really bother me and seem too loud, that no one else is remotely bothered by. What perplexes me most is fire alarms - how the actual fuck can people stand walking around with one blaring without cringing, eyes watering and instinctively covering their ears?

One thing I want to remind you of is that you‚Äôll also need to pay for housewares like furniture, dishes, etc. when you move out if you don‚Äôt already own them. Since you‚Äôre not moving out until March, you should have some time to save up a little bit of money for them. You can get them fairly cheap at second-hand stores like Goodwill. Try to take stock of the little things in your home that you use everyday, so you know what you need to get. 

When I first moved out with my boyfriend, we forgot so many little things like cooking utensils and dish rags. We were at the store almost every day for the first two weeks lol. 

Also pay attention to if the house/apartment you‚Äôre looking at comes with appliances and which ones. You may have to buy your own washer/dryer, oven, or refrigerator if they don‚Äôt. So also be aware of that.

"PharahMains","t5_3ejtz","&gt;Not only did you get my point, and i agree with you, but this is exactly what i meant and you said it better than i could ever articulate myself. Thank you for your reply

Ok, glad to hear it :-) And you're very welcome. This sub is about the only place where Pharah mains can vent our legitimate frustration without the rest of the OW community losing their shit. Sorry it took me a couple days to send this reply.

&gt;They did mention to me how they felt after the hanzo buff and especially the hitscan buffs was that they were able to be more effective, more often.

I have no doubt. Those were the first in a long line of balance changes that have made the game more and more difficult for Pharah. It could be argued that it's gotten to the point where unless someone is an actual dedicated Pharah main, it's not worth someone trying to play her. And so low risk, high reward characters like Brig and Doomfist were able to flourish without enough capable Pharah players around to keep them in check.

&gt;Im used to fighting 3-4 hitscans + zen ana comps just to try to tear me out of the sky. I don't like it but i like Pharah enough to try to bear through it. It is hard though.

Exactly, and this is what people who don't play Pharah fail to realize...the enemy team can field a perfectly viable, balanced comp that's *full* of Pharah counters...Ana and Zen as supports, Dva as one of the tanks, probably a sniper, and quite likely another hitscan, or even Sombra. One of the most exaggerated myths perpetuated among the ignorant OW community is that ""only 25% of the cast can even touch Pharah"". Only Pharah players realize that that is patently false. 

But I'm right there with you...I love playing Pharah enough that I do my best to play through all the shit, because otherwise it would never be ""sensible"" to play her at all. No other hero gives me the same enjoyment and satisfaction as playing Pharah does, because her playstyle is so unique. I don't know about you, but when I do play another hero (such as in mystery heroes or 3v3 or something), being stuck on the ground just feels very ""foreign"" to me after having played a ton of Pharah XD

&gt;All of that could have been accomplished by instead either not proxy nerfing/countering Pharah, or even giving her a small actual buff. Not this buff/nerf bs.

Exactly. Just further proof that Blizzard is either ignorant of Pharah's role in the game, and/or simply indifferent to it. And now more than ever she does need an actual *buff*, whether the rest of the OW community want to admit it or not. 

And regarding what you said in your first comment about GOATS, you're exactly right. I'm not an expert on this stuff, but if Blizzard actually took Pharah into account when balancing the game, people wouldn't be complaining about GOATS nearly as much. Pharah's kit gives her the potential to be *the* counter to GOATS, but because they've made her so weak against her own counters, one quick swap to hitscan on the enemy team and she vanishes, and back to GOATS it is. The risks of playing her outweigh the rewards. So now apparently the only way to counter GOATS, is with GOATS. Because God forbid Blizzard actually do something positive for Pharah.

2. Neither does liberalism. Not to mention comparing caring for another human being to ""stealing"" sounds like you value a small amount of money over the wellbeing of others, making your position soundly immoral. 


3. Liberalism is about raising the floor for everyone to be treated equally. In order to do that you have to focus on some groups of people at a time. Not recognizing that is just another demonstration of a lack of empathy and a massive case of short-sightedness both for history and the future. 


4. Maybe, and maybe in a perfect world that would be enough. We don't live in that world however. Trying to apply your fantasy idealism to the real world has been demonstrated time and time again as ineffective.

"F13thegame","t5_3abo0","Practice, Practice, Practice!  If you're new.. or want to get better as Jason, take advantage of the ""Offline Bot"" mode. While the bots are not all that challenging, even on hard mode, It's still good place to find your ""Jason"". There you can try them all out, learn each Jason's strengths and weaknesses, learn the timing on the cool-downs, practice throwing your knife quickly, and get more familiar with the maps.

Grab as many knives as you can. Learn when and who to throw them at. And try to get good at throwing them quickly and not having to stop and take the time to aim. It's hard for the counselor to dodge your knives if you don't give them time to react. Throw them when a counselor attempts to climb through a window or after a counselor jumps through a window. And throw them at the counselor when they crouch or when they stumble.

Don't let them see you coming!  If you happen to observe a player (via your sense ability) who is a long distance away from you and is unaware that you are within striking distance, before you ""morph"" to them, activate ""stalk"", as more often than not you will catch them off guard for an easy grab/kill attempt. 

Where to morph first. Most, if not all experienced Jason's will morph first to the phone-box and trap it right away, then over to the cars. Which is a good strategy. However I recently changed from doing that to hitting a power-box first, then the phone-box second. The reason why I started doing this was to hopefully it will knock out the power Tommy Jarvis Radio house, preventing him from being called at the least right away, if not ever. If the power-box I choose to destroy first did not kill the Tommy Radio, no big deal. Second.. nobody (at least while I'm playing as Jason) has ever found the phone fuse, installed it, and called the police within three minutes of the round, especially on the larger maps, which is how long it would usually take for me to morph for a second time to the phone-box.

Traps. For me, when it comes to the phone-box, I found using 3 in the triangle pattern.. two in the front, one in the back being the most effective in not having the police called. Having one or two traps on the phone-box is fairly easy to disable unnoticed, especially if you have a pocket knife. Seeing three traps gives MOST players pause, however there are the brave few with the tough skin perk and some health spray who will just step in the traps. For the cars.. just one each. The right side of the hood of the car is preferable, driver side door if the battery has already been installed. never the gas tank. And dont bother placing traps around the boat. 

Don't focus on hunting players until your ""shift"" ability activates. Early in the round while you are placing traps, destroying doors/windows, grabbing knives.. do chase them them away from cabins, cars, or boats.. but dont focus on trying to catch them, because if they are an experienced player you wont. They will just try to kite you so others can complete the different objectives that you haven't trapped yet. If you see a target of opportunity that you know can kill.. sure go for it, but otherwise first, set the traps, grab the knives, and break as many doors and windows as you can. And then once that shift ability activates, then you should start the killing spree.

&gt; and he is the only grunt commander on the ship, but he doesn't get lonely cause he is popular and everyone wants to be his friend

.

&gt; Near the aft wall of the hangar was a line of floor-mounted methane-recharge stations. These clusters of tanks and hoses were designed to service dozens of Unggoy, but Stolt was alone. In fact, he was the only Unggoy‚Äîand the only non-Sangheili‚Äîin the Half-Jaw‚Äôs crew.
But if Stolt was lonely for his own kind, he never showed it. The Unggoy seemed as relaxed as always (...)

&gt; The Half-Jaw knew that Stolt had faced similar scrutiny when he had joined Shadow of Intent‚Äôs complement of rangers during the human war (...)

&gt; Unggoy rangers weren‚Äôt unheard of, but they were rare. And at first, most Sangheili on Shadow of Intent had regarded this Unggoy as a Grunt who would never be their equal.

&gt;They were wrong.

&gt;Stolt had survived encounters with human soldiers that saw many of his comrades fall. When he wasn‚Äôt battling the enemy, he outfought any Sangheili who sparred against him, enduring their melee strikes until they tired, and then pummeling them into submission with his chitinous fists and feet. After a chance encounter with one of the humans‚Äô fearsome Spartans, in which the Unggoy wounded the enhanced human so grievously that it was forced to withdraw, even the Blademaster approved Stolt‚Äôs promotion to ranger leader.

That's his characterization at the start of the novel. Referring to the points you made, we don't know if hes lonely, he just doesn't show it. He was discriminated against until he proved he could easily match any of the other elite soldiers, and they learned about his past accomplishments.

&gt; I personally find it lame and unbelievable.

There are many other examples of powerful grunts even from the Bungie era, Stolt just takes it a step further.

&gt;On top of that i find it hard to believe elites would follow orders from a grunt, the Covenant races have always displayed biases towards one another and while I could buy that he might get enough respect to be allowed to serve on the shadow of intent I just don't see those biases going away that easily.

They did have bias towards him, he beat it out of them. Cross species animosity isn't really that large in most cases, even back in Halo: The Flood there was a [grunt](https://www.halopedia.org/Yayap) bossing around an elite, aswell as leading a group of jackals and gaining their respect.

One of the points that gets brought up in halo every so often is the fact that [grunts are often underestimated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06hW9liM2uc)",1543622550

Social stratification has never not existed, and communism has been tried dozens of times. Anyone who tells you that a society with social class cannot be communist is one of those delusional communists who believe that communism has NEVER been tried.

China is communism. To say that they are state capitalism is a misunderstanding of how their system works. The people who say that China is state capitalism don't know that state capitalism is a euphemism for socialism. The idea of state capitalism is that the state has tight control over the economy to the point where the government dictates how specific businesses should run. State capitalism is a euphemism because capitalism seems to mean business progress, but in fact, most societal infrastructure development has come from socialist projects such as the New Deal, TVA, and the WWII wartime industry effort. In fact, your local infrastructure development is socialist by definition. So the difference between democracy and communism isn't who builds the roads, but instead who votes. In communism, the people don't vote for the federal government. Furthermore, in communism, there is no realistic opposition party, not to mention third parties. China has one party and people only vote for local elections. China is communist.

In China, since the citizens don't have much power over the federal government, they don't have much objection to what the federal government does. Furthermore, they don't have innate property rights. The state allows people to own things, but it doesn't give them the right to do so. In the US, the right to own things means that the government cannot take your business without a fight against the whole body of citizens. In China, you have no real expectation of protection from the government in your business. This means that the Chinese government owns everything. The US government defaults property rights to the citizens. The government owning all property makes them communist. And since they own all property, any opposition party infrastructure is owned by the majority party. That's why communism is only one party.

Communism never results in equality. Equality is a symptom of labor shortage in the economy. Adam Smith talks about this in Wealth of Nations. We want to have equality, so people instate dictators who promise equality. This promise of equality for instating a tyrannical party is communism. Plato talks about how the idea of dictators promising equality has been around at least since 400 BC. Karl Marx thought he was a genius for reinventing the labor revolt, but it's been around for as long as government has been. In reality, you only need to look to the most equal societies to see how they got there. The most equal societies are democracies. Communism has never resulted in equality. It has especially never resulted in more equality than democracy.

Now, is it bad that China is the industrial engine of democracies? Um, yes. Absolutely. How can you have an equal society without a labor shortage? If China promises as much cheap labor as the business owners want, then it will crumble our equalities by making people value-less. Most importantly, powerless communist labor will always be cheaper than democratic labor because voting and civic education are expensive. And again, we will only see our rights and equalities stripped away when there is no reason to hire laborers in democratic countries.

Wouldn't communist countries just fizzle out like the Soviet Union? Likely, since communism has worse mechanisms protecting against nepotism than democracies. But China has decades until nepotism takes hold. Not to mention that they understand that seizing the means of production gives one power. If China seizes the means of production from the entire West, then they have the power, just like how the proletariat seizes the means of production to seize power from the oligarchs, they will bend other countries to their one-party will.

Let me know if you have questions. Few people really get communism, but it's nothing new. The difference in modern society is that governments sink more investment that government sinks into industry compared to in the past. ",1543622551

I am feeling pretty good for having gone almost 24 hours without any k, but 8 was at 2 gram doses 2 x daily yesterday. I did some exercise yesterday, so ,maybe my aches come from that.


 
 I agree with others that such a large drop probably got most of the wds out of your system. You could probably jump now without much extra wds added in. If you stabal8ze at 6gpd and drop to 4 after a good night's sleep you could probably walk without much effort next week, or you could finish out your wds not and get a head start on recovery.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I think you're in the basic keybinds. It's super counterintuitive to enable, but I found a guide on how to enable them: https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/7lrciy/notice_for_kbm_users_how_to_enable_advanced/. That should give you access to decoupled mode.

As for the angle of ascent, for most ships, you get an pitch ""ladder"" which is sort of aligned to the horizon, as parallel horizontal bars with the angle to the side of each bar. I think some ships (like the Aurora?) may be bugged and don't show it. The displayed numbers increase as you pitch towards vertical - however this is just the angle your ship is pointing, and isn't your directional vector indication (which frustratingly is disabled around planets, moons, and all armistice zones). 

This is a terrible picture (it's weirdly hard to google a picture of the atmospheric hud) but the ladder is the horizontal lines in the center of the Eclipse hud, and your pitch angle is on the sides: https://preview.redd.it/xthc5evx09111.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfcb4dacdf79530bcc0a4eebb5ee19f7991c5d6e

If you don't see that, it's probably bugged.

In previous versions, though, there was a trick I used when the pitch ladder wasn't displaying. If you accelerate with vertical strafe to your maximum speed to the point that you hear your engines cut off or spool down (IFCS is preventing you from going faster), and you know what that speed is (eg, 110 in the caterpillar, or 50 when you have landing gear down in all ships), when you pitch up in decoupled mode, you will be vertical when your speed indicator displays the maximum speed. That's because the speed indicator is only the forward component of your speed, so it'll increase as you point your nose towards that vector. Good luck!",1543622553

I really liked triples and quads for a little while, because it was fun having super-bright turbo modes available for the occasions I actually had a use for it...  but it got old.  It increased costs and complexity and diameter while making the beam extra-floody, all for the sake of a few seconds of glory.  But I rarely ever want more than ~100 lumens or so.  I miss the simplicity and beam patterns of a single LED in a reflector.  Triples and quads seem like kind of a fad.

That said, I really like the FW3A,  Not because of the ""3"" part though; more because of everything else about it.

&gt;  
&gt;When I compare my shots to professional shots, it looks like they have more dynamic range and have a lot more clarity.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would love to get a better lens though, which is more affordable than a whole new camera and lens (due to the crop/sensor size) and saw a recommendation in another thread for the Canon EF 85mm f1.8 USM. Which would crop to about 135mm on a T3i. Which I've also heard is a great focal length for portraits. I've looked up some images and they look great but I don't know enough to be able to tell what is the camera and lens and what is the shot. Ultimately I'd like a lens that is true to life and doesn't have a lot of distortion. Is there any reason why 135mm is better than 85mm, or is it just preference?  
&gt;  
&gt;Any recommendations of lenses would be greatly appreciated!

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt; According to you I used an argument used by terrorists, which allowed you to not have to argue against my point. 

I also stated that the argument is baseless and that Israeli land was lawfully obtained. [Those lands were lawfully purchased from arab landowners following the fall of the Ottoman empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine), and now there are violent terrorist groups who aren't happy about Jews returning to lands that historically belonged to them for thousands of years prior to their exile and violent forced conversions to Islam. You're welcome to side with these terrorists if you wish, but your narrative that Israel is ""oppressing"" them is false. If anyone is being oppressed, it's the innocent Jews who are murdered by insurgents every day for having the audacity to live on the land of their ancestors, which they legally bought back from the descendants of their oppressors after spending generations in exile and being oppressed by antisemites in foreign lands

&gt;NASA = good so Nazis = good? Don't know why you commented. You said Nazis stopped existing after WW2 yet they continued to work for NASA. 

I don't actually think NASA is run by nazis. It was you who implied this. I was just playing off the left's ""abolish ICE"" movement (since the left believe ICE are nazis) - if you think NASA employs nazis, you must want to abolish NASA too, right?

&gt;Again with the smearing tactic. He has some of the best Nazi Discord videos I've seen but I get it, ""if I don't look at then I don't have to admit Nazis exist"". But in the real world if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck then it's a Nazi. :D

Pointing out the fact that you posted a random leftist youtube video is not a ""smearing tactic"", it's a perfectly valid response. Youtube videos aren't a credible source in a debate. 

Naturally, any leftist youtube videos you link to are going to be sympathetic to leftist views and will be biased against right wingers. It's intellectually dishonest to claim otherwise or suggest that I'm ""smearing"" you by pointing out that your youtube link doesn't mean much. 

I could just as easily link to right-wing youtube videos with a totally opposite narrative from yours, and it would mean just as much as your video does (nothing.)

&gt;In many American Christian circles, they think Israel has to exist for Jesus to come back again and fight off all the non-believers (including Jews if they don't convert before then). Which is why many hardcore Christians obsess about Israel and wants the US to do everything possible to make sure of that. 

Ok? Thanks for sharing this random observation? I don't really understand how this is relevant to me or our discussion at all. In many anti-semitic circles, they think Israel has to cease existing because they think Jews are all evil and should be destroyed.

&gt;So Palestinians willfully became refugees in Jordan and other surrounding countries? 

""Palestinians"" are a mix of Arabs and arabized ethnic Jews who converted to Islam during the Muslim conquest of the holy land following the exile of the Jews.

&gt;As far as your 1000 year claims, why did they need British help (now American help) if they were already established there for 1000s of years. You would think after 1000s of years a nation would have formed. 

I don't understand how needing British help to fight the Ottoman empire has anything to do with the verifiable historical fact that [Jews settled Israel thousands of years ago and had established a nation there long before the concept of ""Palestine"" ever existed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel)

Again, there is abundant archeological evidence of Jewish settlements in and around Israel dating back thousands of years, and multiple accounts from numerous ancient civilizations corroborating their presence there.

Jews were subjugated and exiled from Israel a long time ago, and most of the few who remained in that land were forcefully converted to Islam by Muslim crusaders. The return of the Jewish people to Zion was subsequently prophecized and after the British overthrew the Ottoman empire, we finally had the opportunity to reclaim and return to our land, which we did by lawfully purchasing it back from the arab landowners who currently controlled it

&gt;When did we kill off everyone who was part of the Nazi created ""German American Bund"" and ""Friends of New Germany"" in America. 

The Nazis lost the war and were killed or imprisoned. Their party ceased to exist. They are dead and gone.

&gt;And in the modern era why would Hitler want to kill off people openly trying to fight ""the Jew"".

Hitler hated anyone who he considered ""impure"" and not part of his fictional ""aryan master race."" This would include swathes of people that we consider ""white"", many of whom include people who label themselves ""nazis"" today (for example, modern day Russian neo-""nazis"" would have been killed since Hitler detested slavs)

Also, you can try to watch some professional streamers and some tournaments, as they really help you to understand whats in the meta and a lot more.  
And you can try out some guides inside Dota for heroes, that you play! There are a lot of guides that will help you understand what hero's spells do and how to use them.  
Also, check dotabuff, some winrate statisticks and how you counter one hero with another.

1. Whether a female server wear hair ornaments (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19368623.2012.624296)
1. Whether the waitress touched their customers or not (more touching is better, btw http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-25061-001)
1. If they're female and attractive (https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1159&amp;context=articles)
1. And lastly, how good their service are.

In fact, by the Cornell study, none of the factors matter for lunch tip, only for dinner ones. 

By this more recent study (https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1036&amp;context=articles), ""The percent tipped in these studies was related to group size, the customer's gender, the method of payment (cash or credit), and in some cases, the size of the bill.

Notepad (and many other Windows programs) will only recognize a carriage return &amp; newline together (`\r\n`) as a new line. If only `\n` appears in the file, then Notepad will not display the lines correctly; but Wordpad should be able to handle it.

IMO, the problem with Fenn's statements is that people either think about them WAY too much or not enough. This particular comment about a structure I hadn't really given much thought to before, but now that I do it really tells us nothing that the rules of the chase don't already.  

Another non-clue that I think people make too much of - and I've mentioned it before - is the one where he says that physics tells him the chest is ""wet"".

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Hi,

It's not negative. It's human to draw comparisons with others. There's a ""however"" here. However, comparing yourself to others isn't healthy. You see, you can literally always find something someone else has that you don't have. Always. And it's easy to indulge into that thing, devote your entire attention to it, until all the positive things you did are drowned out.

Consider a mosquito bite. Sure, you had a lovely summer evening with your friends. Good times were had by all. But this insect gave you a bad bite on the calf of your leg. And now you forget about all the good things, having a good time in the here and now, as you indulge in scratching. And focussing on the ""why me again? life sucks! even a mosquito ruins my night!"" 

See what I mean?

The point isn't to ignore others. Or the mosquito. Or even the itching. The point is that to give yourself the validation that you seek. 

""Yeah, that guy did a swell presentation and got a job offer. Good on him! But I - me - did a swell presentation today, whereas I couldn't do that last year. And that's HUGE. That means the world to me! A job offer would be nice. But that's just the cherry. I got on stage and did the presentation. And that's already more then I hoped to accomplish!""

That's validating yourself.

It takes time and effort to learn how to do this. You need to sit yourself down sometimes and tell yourself that. Treat yourself right and proper. Stick out for yourself. Show respect for who you are as a person.

There's a great Native story about [Two Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzKryaN44ss). It tells you exactly how everyone struggles with what you're going through. It's about which side of yourself you want to let dominate your life. 

It's great that you want to grow. And that you want to work on self-improvement. But you got to do it for the right reason. You got to do it for yourself first and foremost. Not because someone else gets on stage, makes it look easy, and you indulge in feelings of jealousy or disenfranchisement. That's NOT how you become happy. Practice your presentation skills and confidence levels for yourself. Otherwise, you're just trying to emulate someone you're totally not, who's far removed from who you really are deep down your bones.

You're not alone. I often give presentations, workshops and such. People tell me that I'm great at this stuff. But really? When I look at presentations on YouTube of professionals, they sometimes make me feel like I'm an amateur when I have a bad day. That's when I feel just as much insecurity and anxiety as I did when I gave my first presentations back at Uni or in school Luckily, I'm much older now. And I recognise those feelings and triggers. That's when I tell myself not to take things too serious. Those professional speakers? They are just human, like me, and they have to go to the toilet too. Just like me. They aren't that different. They are just in another spot in their lives which put them on that stage with a powerful presentation. And that's totally fine and valid. I just let go and try to be myself, giving presentation I feel are good enough, and I try to listen to the feedback I get. That's all I can do. 

Oh, that, and just enjoying life, having a cold beer, and having a good time. That's an important one. Just, think ""screw it"", kick back and relax knowing that I did what I had to do, and that doing that was enough.

Hope that helps!

Best of luck!

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","\&gt;Securing the border and enforcing existing laws are both extremely pure libertarian ideas.

I'll ignore the laws comment but let's focus on securing the border being an ""extremely pure libertarian idea"".

Every libertarian knows that the non-aggression principle is at the core of libertarian belief. The NAC states that people are free to do anything they want so long as their conduct is peaceful. That is, so long as people are not initiating force against others, they are free to engage in any action they want.

Thus, liberty necessarily encompasses such principles as freedom of association, freedom of travel, freedom of movement, economic liberty, freedom of trade, and liberty of contract.

Those principles necessarily lead to but one conclusion: Open borders. In fact, restricting border access breaks the NAC. 

Think of this. I own property on the border between the USA and Mexico. I have a friend on the exact opposite side of that border. The end of his property, is the beginning of mine, and the boarder is what divides our two properties. If I want to invite my Mexican friend to dinner, he needs to cross that border. He is welcome by me, he wont be trespassing, or hurting anyone - we're peacefully engaging in freedom of association, and movement. But if the government gets word of this, under a system with a closed border, they can forcefully come on my land and detain my peaceful Mexican friend. They can likely also detain me. They trespassed on my property, possibly damaging my house if its locked, or gate if it prevents them from getting on, and forcefully removed my friend and possibly me. If I keep trying to associate with my Mexican friend they could seize my land through eminent domain and erect a fence, or harass me and my family with border patrol agents.",1543622566

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","The defense would have more than a chance.  The offense would have *no* chance.  Holding occurs across the entire line on every play *by necessity*.  If you start calling holding by the book rule, you're going to need to either need max protect, like you said, or there aren't going to be any passes more than 10 yards down the field.  Running the ball becomes a chore, too, because both safeties would essentially be in the box and fewer linebackers would need to worry about coverage.

Not sure how old you are, but calling holding this way is analogous to how MLB suddenly decided in 1988 that they were going to call balks differently.  ""Players will adjust"" was what everyone said during spring training when the umpires were out of control.  They didn't.  The single-season record for balks was set in mid-May and barely slowed down.  After the season, the league admitted they fucked up and reverted to how they used to call them.

That's what will happen if holding is called by the book.  There's the holding that offensive linemen are taught to use from birth, which helps you remain engaged as a blocker and keep a guy in front of you, and there's the holding that offensive linemen do when they're beat and don't want to lose their man.  It's the latter that's called now.  Start calling the former and you break the game.  They won't adjust.",1543622566

The problem arose when everyone was finding out that they got two specific questions wrong by one millimeter. The exact same two questions, and the exact same wrong lengths throughout every test.

I'm aware that the boost won't be at that level, but the thing is I don't feel there was a need for it. I'm still fresh enough to remember how it was when I was leveling up. If your argument was ""in order to support low-density portal areas"", I'd try and understand the move. But balance is a hard thing to achieve, and I don't think it's a move in the right direction, and feel my opinion must be stated even if only to echo what I know many other agents I know are feeling right now.

To expand a bit on what I said on another comment, and to give a small insight on why I think the Aegis nerf in particular is something I think is going to have a big impact: in my daily gameplay, I don't use Aegis to hold a portal up, I use them to buy time. Time to get there and actively defend the portal, deploying and reshielding. Anomaly sites are... well, anomalous in that matter, there's always someone actively there or near the portal. Nerfing Aegis' stickiness will render them a lot less useful in that particular strategic view.

To expand a bit more on the multiaccounting statement, and continuing to be perfectly blunt, most agents I know, from either faction, use backpacks. I don't and I feel silly sometimes.

He's an unpopular politician who won a flukey minority victory, against the run of play, with help from Uncle Vladimir and Comey's improper letter. People shouldn't over-interpret that result. Donald has no superpowers except his physiological incapacity to feel shame. And so, Donald can be defeated like *any other* unpopular politician.

But SpaceX exists because Elon wants to make humans a multi-planetary species. So they build Falcon 9 and Heavy so they can make enough money launching satelites to pay for BFR.

Consciously and purposefully shifting that disgust and anger to where I believe it rightfully belongs: on my abusers. 

For me, imagining my inner child as someone else‚Äôs child allowed me to feel more empathy and compassion for that child self. I would think to myself, ‚Äúhow would I react if a child came to me in the middle of a store and told me all the terrible things that were happening to her? Would I feel disgusted at her? Would I blame her for these terrible things? Would I shame her?‚Äù And I usually found that the answer was no. Which leads me to my other point.....

All of that blame and shame and anger and disgust you feel is perfectly valid. The problem is that when you are abused, you are taught from infancy that all of those negative emotions belong to you and are because of you. This is, sadly, very effective conditioning on the part of our abusers. Learning to recognize those negative emotions for what they are and funnel them into **very righteous and appropriate** anger and shame and blame and disgust towards your abuser, the person who targeted and violated and poisoned the mind of that innocent child you once were, will help you learn how to better empathize with that child.

Or sometimes repot because the plant has become big enough that it's essentially tipping over the too small pot and you need a bigger pot to balance the weight of the plant.

Some examples:

* you're in the USA and find out there's a show on in New York, you decide to go online and book tickets to the show
* you're in Japan and need to pay a bill you forgot about back home, so you go online to pay it
* you're in China at the airport on-route back home on a stop-over and you decide to order something online for delivery back home for when you arrive

&gt; My girlfriend has recently had some money taken from her account by someone shopping online with her card details. It‚Äôs very easy for people to copy card details such as paying for petrol late at night etc.

It is your responsibility to keep your card in your sight at all times.

&gt; Having an extra security check certainly prevents a large amount of money being taken and makes such crimes less appealing for those carrying them out.

The point of the article is OTP codes to your mobile phone is fine for, maybe, 95% of the population. The other 5% are screwed.

The problem is that these ill-considered ideas are being forced upon the public which will significantly hurt some people.

One-Time codes to phones is the absolute *worst* idea for security. At a minimum support for Google Authenticator (or FreeOTP by RedHat) should be considered so people who do not have immediate access to a real-time communications network (SMS or Internet) can still authenticate.

If you were a little more cynical you might think the banking sector, or perhaps the EU which is bringing down the directive, wants to ensure that you can be physically tracked at all times - requiring that you a) have a mobile phone to make any payments and b) have that mobile phone register with a phone network so your location is always recorded.

If you had any concern, care, or respect for privacy you should be outraged at this idea.",1543622574

Would the kind of ""soft"" border controls mentioned here (i.e. levying higher taxes on companies employing large amounts of unskilled immigrant labor in order to pay for social services targeting the lower earners in our economy) be the kind of compromise you guys could get behind?

Fortunately the court system is aware that such circumstances exist. As I know quite well from the court proceedings for my order of protection against my ex-husband, you can use a P.O. box, request that your address be withheld for your safety, or even use your lawyers address for court filings. There are also many free resources available to help such women navigate the situation and give them advice for these issues.

&gt;According to you, there are literally no circumstances under which you would find it reasonable to not try to get it?

That's not what I said at all. I said these circumstances mentioned do not seem good enough given the provisions the court system has for protecting victims of abuse, and the fact that OP states that his significant other is barely scraping by. Being a victim of domestic violence is not fair or easy, but when you have children depending in you, I believe you have to push yourself for their sake when methods to do so safely are available.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","I don't have too much experiences with goldfish, but dropsy seems to be a major issue with the fancy species. To shed some light, dropsy is a common term for edema, a symptom of a broad array of underlying medical issues. Particularly, the heart, kidneys, and lungs/gills (least likely) are the primary issue.  


Fancy goldfish, due to excessive inbreeding, have many anatomical issues, and can bring on edema a  lot quicker. Recovery from infections, imbalances in nutrition, and even reproduction would leave more lasting damage compared to wild type fishes. That being said, prevention is hard, and finding out what is killing your fish would be harder unless you are willing to dissect. Your best bet is to target treatment: either slow the heart or increase the filtration of the kidneys. There are human prescription medications that can effectively do this, but readily available natural remedies usually involve clove oil, which without monitoring can euthanize your fish. Magnesium salts can help kidneys, but can take several weeks.   


Also, for infection, antibiotics can worsen edema by damaging kidneys directly or indirectly (antibody-antigen complexes).   


Can you provide any more history (new decorations, new tankmates, new food, odd behavior, etc.)? That could help narrow some possible choices. Hope for the best!",1543622575

""Antidepressants"" including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin‚ÄìNorepinephrine‚ÄìDopamine reuptake inhibitor.

The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.

For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.

Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.

GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label."" (if you wondering why it's 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.)

I absolutely do not mean to demean or downplay absolutes, but in this scenario, to me, it seems that she is feeling insecure and she latched on to the first thing she could cling to that would make her anxiety go away. IE therapist or someone close to her mentioned that you're younger, it's weird that she makes more AND she's older than her husband, etc. and she latched on. 

I don't know what the deeper seeded issue is, but I would definitely suggest seeking therapy from a second opinion and build a repertoire with someone other than the therapist she's been with for 8+ years.

Never hurts to get a second opinion in general, but a few others have provided solid points that 8 years is really long time to see a therapist.

We saw ours for 2 years, and to both of us, that was way longer than needed.

This is true for AW totems, and perhaps it was a bad example going for them. I was simply trying to create an easy to digest example to highlight the point that you can't use 2 different types of totems with a single Multiple Totems support gem. It is yet to be seen whether or not the cap can stack with multiple skills linked (either in the same link, or in separate links with a second gem), of course not exceeding the cap such as +4 to any given skill, but +2 to multiple skills if both linked, such as in the case of multiple skills being able to be affected by a single GMP if all connected. I would assume it doesn't work that way (or else you could end up with 20-30 totems with enough skills), and that only a single instance of +2 being available on a given character, but the wording of the gem doesn't state otherwise.

&gt;When you said you want the +2 to apply 1 totem to the gem it is supporting and 1 to a different gem in a different slot. The support would need to globally apply to get 1 of each extra support gem.

I'm fully aware of this, which is why I made the thread in the first place, and why I find an issue with the double placement to be unneeded, and with the hazy wording of how skills affect the total cap when in the context of multiple gems.




&gt;The only ‚Äúsupport totem‚Äù you can effectively use is Searing Bond since it gives you free +1 while active.

To be clear I'm not planning on even running a totem build at all, this was simply an example, and in retrospect a shitty one as I've had essentially all of the responses come in context to the logistics of why you shouldn't use this Gem in a separate link in an AW build, which is true (but **only** if 1 gem is the max).",1543622579

1. Welcoming and fancy are not synonymous. We have all been in fancy places that felt like museums where you were afraid to sit down lest you wrinkle something.

2. It probably isn't as bad as you think it is. For example, eclectic, bohemian, and shabby chic are all styles for people who don't like matching stuff. They are also more casual and comfy.

3. Try inviting a true friend over first as a dry run. 

4. Thoroughly clean, you will feel better about things.

5. Close the doors to the rooms that they don't need to go into and focus on the rooms they will use.

6. You like your land. Do you have a patio or outdoor area where you can spend your time? (depending on the weather in your neck of the woods)

7. Candlelight, twinkly string lights, slipcovers, and throw pillows hide a multitude of sins.

8. A more minimalist look also looks fancier, within reason. If there are fewer items, there are fewer things to clash with each other.

9. Still anxious? Google for free diy home staging tips. There are tons of ideas for using what you have already to improve the look of your home. I found a really excellent one once, but now I can't remember the name. I will go on a hunt. Edit: here it is: http://www.diyhomestagingtips.com/

The building will be far more likely to lose part of its facade than to collapse entirely. Leaving the building means leaving an area that has a small risk of danger in order to pass through an area that has an extreme risk of danger, in the hopes of reaching an area that has a smaller risk of danger.

Seismic events last a matter of seconds, *maybe* minutes, and attempting to go from inside one of these buildings to outside means you'll be in this extremely dangerous area for a large percentage of the time the shaking is occurring. You will have put yourself in extreme danger for a large percentage of the duration of the earthquake. You are far better off remaining in the area that has a small risk of danger and taking shelter under something sturdy. Then leave as soon as the shaking stops and get clear of any structures.

**3-13 Archer: Devoted Defender** - or, if you'll allow me the grace of naming him, **Archibald**.

To say ""the man, the myth, the legend"" is difficult in a post full of them, but he certainly warrants it. Archer, siege engine expert, badass mofo. It takes a great shot to fell a lightning quick Laguz; it takes [a higher quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIymxwyDhiw) to it in style, *in their face*.

Justly or not, Daein has long stood at odds with all Laguz, and his weapon was honed just for that. And as he showed operating under the direst of conditions with peerless accuracy is no concern for him - as the rest of his skills seek to display. 

If he has any weak point... [probably his voice actor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0lX174N8IM).

---

**Rallyman: Brother in Arms** - or as I prefer, **Subaru**

If even heroes on the frontlines can go unsung, their comrades on the backlines have it even worse. How can any soldier distinguish themselves through anything but feats of arms?

The simple fact he ascended to legend regardless says everything. He... okay, I haven't actually played Fates, so I that's where my praise hits a wall. tl;dr rally person good. I think.

I did at least bother checking what he wields - and though not his credit to fame, it could be a blade like none we've seen yet. Can't say the same for his class skills - but again, that's why not why we're here. We're here because when a man can rally his army to victory without dulling his weapon, you follow.

**JavCav: Mila's Chosen** - or **Javier**. Parents weren't creative, not the man's fault.

...yeah, I haven't played SoV either. But even then I've heard to him, a testament to him being kind of a big deal, I guess. Big enough to be favored by Zofia's goddess, perhaps.

And with her favor, the javelin he earned a name for will surely fly true - no need to merely poke with it, aside from defense against peons. At full strength, it's even said ^([citation needed]) it will return to his hand's embrace so swiftly as to strike twice before the enemy can get more than one attack in. May they pray to Duma it connects.

All that with one cavalier's might and a proper implement of war. The goddess' additional blessings in healing and an occasional burst of power are but added perks, but welcomed nonetheless.

---

...alright, I hope I didn't sound so fancy as to be utterly incomprehensible, but the occasion did call for it. And to answer the inevitable question: Penta-Axe and Leather Shield Merc are complete mysteries to me. Perhaps they're simply greater warriors I'm not worthy of gazing upon, but I'll leave them for who can make them justice.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

* Ground transport to Tokyo 

* NRT-SEA, ANA economy

Should be 155k ANA miles with the fees mostly coming from the ANA economy leg. And you'd save all your UR for hotels or other travel expenses which is where MR suck. You could also reverse it and do business class on the return. 

Alternately you could look into ANA-metal biz class RT to Japan and then fly RT to Taiwan using a cash fare or JAL with Avios. The fees and points cost would be higher for this method and you'd end up with more travel time.

But, they are making changes. They are by far the [biggest investor](https://qz.com/1247527/for-every-1-the-us-put-into-renewable-energy-last-year-china-put-in-3/) in clean energy and they [produce most electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources) from renewable energy compare to any other country in the world. 25% of the total electricity production is from renewable energy. By comparison it's 14% for the US (which by all means is a massive number). If you see the list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_China) they are also cutting down dependency on coal from 78% in 2007 to 66% in 2016. Although the total consumption is increasing in this years but it also shows the amount of investment China put in renewable energy.

Back when the US was still making goods by themselves they are also heavily dependent on coal as the source of energy as a matter of fact they only cut down the dependency [after 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_of_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Electrical_Generation_1950-2016.png).

We vacation in Vermont and I was driving home.  My husband fell asleep and I took a shortcut through NH.  He woke up and asked, ""Where the hell in Vermont are we that it's so ugly ?""   I said ""we are in NH"".  Him ""ooohh...""  

Billboards, strip malls, Walmarts and fast food places cover NH and somehow the road sides, even in the prettier areas, are less attractive.  Gravel and dirt instead of wildflowers and rolling hills.  

It is a bit of a generalization, but  I don't know what Vermont's magic.  They somehow made so much of it really beautiful.

Anyone who has been raped takes a different amount of time to heal, and it can be especially difficult if this event was also responsible for robbing her of her virginity. It is extremely important to make sure she knows that you are there for her, at whatever capacity she is comfortable (hinging on the fact that you are willing to support her through this process). What that bastard did to her does not define her, and she is not at fault for what happened . She did nothing wrong.  
A lot of social currently is placed onto a woman's virginity, whether she be conscious of it or not. Beyond that, many women/men who have been through traumatic experience(s) are afraid to speak up to anyone, especially their closest friends because they are afraid of the ramifications that it may have.

Then you said I deserved better and that it's sad I've only known this reality, that hit me hard because I've never heard that once before. So thank you for that. That gives me a lot of hope. 

I am very codependent, I didn't know what that was until your comment. I have always relied heavily on relationships validating my self worth and take break ups and rejection very hard. I'm assuming this has been the effect of low self esteem due to mental and physical abuse from my sister. I also didn't know what gas lighting was until a few days ago, and I have been a product of that since I was a child. Realizing that everything she says is an attempt to control me has really lifted weight off my shoulders. I look back at her texts and realize that she literally rants on about things that don't make any fucking sense but are harmful toward me and I can finally see through that bullshit. It feels great. 

I am going to really take what you said about learning to love myself seriously, that is something I have simply never learned how to do. Her manipulation and mind games would never have allowed it. I called the VA today and got an appointment to see my doctor. I am going to ask to see a therapist. Especially one who deals with childhood trauma who knows a bit about BPD. I am going to take back control of my life and put my own health first for once. This is day 1 of recovery I thought would never come. 

Thank you so much for your kind words, you really helped someone with your comment. If you need to talk about your own issues regarding struggles with someone with BPD, please message me. I'd love to talk to someone with the same struggle. 

Wish you the best. ",1543622593

What you have made is an informed, well-thought out hypothesis: that Sloane is the best commander in the game. It SEEMS that way.

The only way to validate that, to find out if it is true in any objective sense, would be to look at win rates of the commander versus other commanders weighted by player skill and the stakes.

Yes. Many things are not quantifiable. I also happen to be a behavioural scientist and psychologist, my entire world view is that people are irrational - not rational actors in the traditional sense. I appreciate that players might not be completely rational in their choices and I whole-heartedly believe (and know) many big decisions in gaming, sports and business are bad and ill-reasoned.

But our entire society functions on the capitalist notion that given enough incentive and freedom, the best solution will eventually rise to the top. Whilst I see a multitude of issues with capitalism, the last century has proven the idea extremely effective at providing more or less the most effective solutions, with some kinks in the system.

Given that players preferably want to win tournaments rather than lose them, given a large enough sample of players in enough tournaments - the best list (given the context) can be deduced to some extent, with some certainty.

There is no data-based reason to find Sloane overpowered and you simply disregarding that is both silly and unintellectual.

As for your availability hypothesis... err. It ia certainly a factor, but I will question whether it is even a factor among top level players.

I've had two Quesars and 6 of each squadron pack (9 of R&amp;V) in my hands in the last 3 months and I'm just a casual player - I resold quite a bit of it. I found it easily and at 50% if retail price in the UK eBay. Shit tons of this is available used if you want it. I've seen 6 lots (4 UK, 2 US) with enough squadrons to effectively field Sloane and Quesars in the last 6 week's on eBay. If you want them badly, you can easily have them. There are always overpriced Quesars and squadron packs available in the US at any given time and everyone can pay international postage.

Hard-core players bought them at launch. I don't believe availability would be a significant explaining factor at all here.",1543622593

* Actions: Gets along with all of Shou's friends, is interested in the nerdy thing Shou likes, listens to Shou, needs his help, participates in the nerdy thing he likes, compliments him on his work and abilities. Zero red flags, tons of things that would bring people together, checks the ""must protect"" box in multiple ways.
* Situation: Both are straight. Both are single. Shou doesn't have feelings for anyone else before Hitomi shows up.

"cpp_questions","t5_2tdbd","Old-style C strings have all kinds of problems.

Depending on how they are allocated, deallocation might not be automatic.

When passing a C string, one ends up just passing a pointer, which forgets any size information. And figuring out the size (which is required for many operations) is slow.

`string` objects, in contrast, know their size, know how to deallocate, and include useful functionality: copying (with the move optimization, where applicable), concatenation, substrings, and character search.

`string` objects also have sensible semantics. Consider an assignment:

    a = b;

If `a` and `b` are `string` objects, then the above does the obvious thing. If they are C strings, then it does not.

A C string does not support modern iteration. A `string` object does.

    for (auto c : s)

"RocketLeague","t5_30cz1","The top one is not going to be ""better in literally every situation you could imagine."" That's a huge exaggeration considering every position has strengths and weaknesses.

Regardless...

Yes - you want someone mid, which is why I suggested moving last-man there. Not only can that person challenge balls that cross high to the middle, but they're in position to easily defend as well if it comes down to it.

And I agree that following too close to not a good thing.   But the distance of the 2nd player is dependent on the opponent's distance. He can follow closely and back off when the opponent challenges, which is why I also suggested taking the top example and moving the mid player up in order to better illustrate that. It's more beneficial to have someone supporting behind the dribbler and covering the line instead of the closer player being positioned at mid-field, especially in this situation because the player is going to get challenged.

There are 3 opponents in defensive position. A pass through the ground in the middle at this point is probably risky. So, their goal should be to draw the defenders out by either (a) forcing a player to challenge (the player in the corner), or (b) get a high cross to the other side of the field.

In (a), the second player needs to be supporting line because they need to step in immediately and continue the play, which they couldn't do from the middle. Player 1 rotates back to a supportive position and now there are 2 defenders left instead of 3. Player 2 now has a clear cross that another defender is going to be forced to commit to, drawing another defender out without the possibility of a clear down-field, or getting the opportunity to hit a high cross to play 3 who had the advantage since both defenders are grounded.

In (b), the cross has to be high because any cross that isn't high is going to be easily intercepted by one of the defenders and isn't worth committing to. If the top example were the positioning here, then player 2 could pressure immediately, but there's little point because they wouldn't have an angle to shoot from and would be forced to pop the ball up for another cross to player 3 anyway. There's less opportunity to stay organized and control the speed of be game, not to mention player 2 is forced to challenge while blind to the defenders and the right side of the field, and it's more likely to result in 2 teammates trying to recover on the same side of the field. And player 3 likely wouldn't want to take a shot anyway because there are 2 players in goal. The better option would be if they could force a challenge from one of the defenders in the air and pass the ball off the backboard to player 1 who now only has to beat 1 defender. Player 1 is less likely to be available for that in the top example.",1543622599

I would like to hire a photographer that is experienced in weddings and ""traditional"" posed wedding shots to get those classic keepsake photos.  But I also want more artsy and unique photos. My problem is that I cant afford a photographer that is capable of both (or so my research shows).  

I had an idea that I could hire the traditional photographer and also hire a student at the local art school who will be a little more edgy. I could pay them a bit and feed them and help them build a portfolio.  My question is: is this offensive to either photographer? Can you see any problems or issues with this plan?

The law requires that the court must have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration.

The court has extremely broad discretion to effect that, usually by making, upon the application of a party, a child arrangements order.

They can order contact, or no contact, and the form and scope of that contact, information to be given, or not given, financial orders to be made etc. etc. etc.

So, if you cannot come to an amicable arrangement, you need to chat to a solicitor and apply for such an order - the courts will work from the principle that a child should form, or continue to have, a relationship with its parents.

This is very bread and butter stuff for family law practitioners, so ring around a few and find one that you can work with.",1543622603

To free roam, basically 95% of the car in this game is fast enough for anything if you upgrade the vehicle performance, however the Vigilante, Scramjet are fun options

To heist, Armored Kuruma

To PvP, any car with high acceleration to pop around, have solid back panel to block bullets, have 2m price tag just to make your enemies to suffer 20k insurance, cyclone is a good one.

To PvE, Weaponized Tampa

To flex, totally up to you, pick whatever you think you look good with

To stunt race, Vagner, RE-7B, X80 Proto, Nero custom, Zentorno, Osiris

My best advice is this - if you really aren't going to do anything to lose weight, you can also lose weight by *not* doing things. Maybe you don't have the fortitude for exercise, but you could have the self-discipline to stick with better diet.

And a diet doesn't have to be kale and tofu. It could just be water instead of soda.

"muacjdiscussion","t5_342em","Very much agreed! As a skincare junkie who started with my mothers leftover Clinique and Clarins samples, I remember when there were general ‚Äústeps‚Äù in skincare but with acid exfoliation becoming the norm for so many people (I‚Äôm right there too!) I think skincare is honestly becoming a larger market due to the damage so many people are doing by jumping in the deep end with 2 feet.

Without research, if I‚Äôd picked up the entire DE line and started using *all of it* right away, I would‚Äôve recked my skin. Honestly, 6 months of DE acids, even with building up resistance, and I *still* wrecked my skin. With skincare, it‚Äôs easy to end up buying a dozen products to try and fix something(s) that were never wrong in the first place. I also agree with your guess that companies will start releasing lines to be used as a whole and in conjunction with their makeup or sponsored/joint makeup lines (like DE) but I think they‚Äôll primarily encourage overconsumption like DE does. Unless people know what their skin can tolerate, no one should be immediately introducing high percentage Vitamin-C and AHA serums daily, along with a weekly even higher percentage AHA/BHA peel.

I also think we may be seeing an uptick in skincare-makeup hybrid lines, such as what BECCA is doing. I personally am not interested in those types of items but as consumption decreases, hyping up some makeup as ‚Äúgood for skin‚Äù may capture both markets, along with people for whom combination products are more desirable (working mothers, high school/college kids, etc). Another anecdote‚Äîmy friends who are just becoming mothers are increasingly interested in 2-in-1 products so makeup that is advertised as skincare, aka, I‚Äôm doing my morning skincare and makeup routines at once, is more desirable to them than when they were going out clubbing 3-4 nights out of the week and wanted to luxuriate in both of those routines.",1543622607

"X4Foundations","t5_3nn44","Somehow I've managed to play 5 hours straight.  Here are my assorted thoughts:

So far so good - If you liked X2, X3 and played from launch you'll feel right at home. There are bugs, it's clunky as hell and performance wise it's sometimes a slideshow. It's also fun, immersive for the most part and has quite a strong X2 feel to it.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot to the game and I keep finding new stuff. The UI is vastly improved and there are lots of little nice to have features throughout. I keep stumbling on things that I really like. I just made a trade and it remembered the price I bought the goods at and told me directly how much profit I made. There are some nice player empire features, you get a logo to put on all your ships and there are some cool graphs to keep tabs on things like money made.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a bit lost without an opening story to set the scene - I think a lot of people will, it took an hour to get into it and just start exploring and from then I found stuff to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The tutorial is clunky and I've hit a few bugs where I can't progress (thankfully you can abort bits of the tutorial).

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely an ""X"" game and not a ""Rebirth"" game. I'm excited to see what comes once the patches start to flow and of course, this is Egosoft, the patches will come. I remember the launch of x3 Reunion when several of the Argon ship models were missing and the Ore belt system ran at 0.5 fps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a really cool moment going through into a new system, NPC ships that had better engines than my rust bucket were speeding past me and the sound was really cool, it was graphically amazing.

Kylo was portrayed as emotionally unstable. Literally the kind of personality that would define a school shooter, someone prone to fits of uncontrolled rage and misplaced anger. In that regard he‚Äôs fantastic. But he was supposed to be portrayed as conflicted and tragic, not necessarily threatening or menacing in the Vader kind of way (I can‚Äôt be the only one who sees the inherent double standard of criticizing TFA for being a ANH clone while simultaneously constantly comparing Kylo to Vader and how he doesn‚Äôt match up, especially when that‚Äôs literally the point). 

TLJ doubling down on his evil side and making him the only surviving antagonist is the absolute worst way to go. Kylo Ren was never supposed to be a villain. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to be threatening. He was arguably meant to be the main character, a duel protagonist with Rey most likely. Maybe as a foil. But he doesn‚Äôt work as a villain. Even the Joker, who is also mentally unstable, always has a goal in mind or point to prove that contrasts the protagonists. What‚Äôs Kylo‚Äôs goal, or his point? As far as we could tell from TFA, he was resentful of his own family and felt he had to live up to a false legacy, one he believes in due to brainwashing by snoke. But by TLJ, Snoke is dead, he‚Äôs smashed his Vader helmet, but still serves the dark side. Why? 

It completely throws away everything about the character, throws out his conflicted nature in favor of making him *just* an unstable school shooter. He‚Äôs not threatening as a villain and he has no *motivation* to be a villain either. So TLJ leaves IX with no real villain, except for an emotionally stunted man child. ",1543622610

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Let's go back to my question. **How do I know someone saying ""I am willing to be convinced"" being genuine from someone who is deceiving me and has no intention of being convinced at all?** 

The point is flat earthers have infinite reason not believe that the world is round no matter the evidence you provide. If that is possible, then what makes you think facts of god's existence would magically convince you?

&gt;Anything is possible, sure. But I require evidence to believe it.

I am not forcing you to believe it. All I am saying is to assume it does exist for the sake of argument since you admit it is a possibility.

&gt;Because the assumption is that god is all knowing and all powerful. 

And I am explaining it to you now and you suddenly bring up another argument which is the existence of the spirit world. We started this argument assuming god and the spirit world exist so I don't see any reason why suddenly bring up the topic of its existence.

The bible gives us clues on what we are which are equal of god and our ability to create reality. Take a look at dual slit and quantum eraser experiment if you want proof of the conscious mind actively creating reality we experience now. So since we create reality, then we have the capability to tune out god completely and stay in isolation or hell as long as we will it.

&gt;If it isn't a demand, then why do we go to hell if we don't?

According to religion that is. In truth, you are not forced to worship anyone because of free will. It's a reaction of understanding god's power and benevolence. Nobody is sent to hell by god. People in hell got there because they chose a world without god and created it. The question is are you willing to be saved? If yes, then what do you think you should do if you are trying to escape hell?

&gt;I am perfectly willing, as I said, provided proper evidence that stands up to basic scrutiny.

Again, **How do I know someone saying ""I am willing to be convinced"" being genuine from someone who is deceiving me and has no intention of being convinced at all?** You can keep saying that to me but you know yourself. Are you really open to be convinced or are you just saying that in an attempt to win this argument? You can deceive others but never yourself. That's why people in hell are miserable because once they are isolated, the only thing they experience is their own self that is full of negativity and immorality.",1543622610

"news","t5_2qh3l","Hi! Very unlikely. 

There is always a small statistical chance that a mainshock is actually a foreshock. This is between 4-6%. That means there is 94-96% chance that the 7.0 is largest. This simply means, treat each aftershock as it's own quake and take cover if you feel in danger. Don't underestimate aftershocks and do what makes you feel safe.

It is currently impossible to predict earthquakes. Anyone who claims to be able to is simply lying or misguided. No matter how good the intentions may be, it's important to listen to officials and not to panic others. If you have the opportunity to remind others of this, please do. Understand though that this is a normal reaction to an earthquake, and to have compassion when talking to family, friends and neighbours.

Stay Safe.",1543622612

The walkers pass, but she's too weak to make it back. She tells Magna and Eugene to deliver a message to Rick, Carl and everyone else she cared about before blowing her brains out with her revolver.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Regarding the anti-Nate bias on r/NFL ...

We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Nathan Peterman.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into football in the last couple years. So you never watched Nate in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: football isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""passing yards"" or ""QB rating"" I know they know nothing about football.

Nate's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest QB ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that Tom Brady is better than Nathan Peterman, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Nate in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched football for a significant amount of time, so I know that Nate is better.

You might be jealous of Nate's five INTs this season, or jealous of his status as the greatest passers in Bills history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bills fan who watched football in 1999, or a Bills fan who watched football in 2017, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win football looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Nate isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Tom Brady The Best QB in the World‚Ñ¢, but leave the Nate talk to the adults. Fair?",1543622614

The animation is gorgeous too, but that goes for any Disney Picture, doesn't it.

2. Beauty and the Beast is an instant classic. It deserved the Oscar nomination that it got for Best Picture absolutely. The story has a lot of great moments, the characters are fantastic. It's just great and its pretty close to being number 1 for me. 

3. Fantasia. I love the music, the animation. So many memorable skits and scenes from Sorcerers Apprentice to Chernobog. It's just a fantastic thing to experience. 

4. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Wholesome, good fun. It's just such a nostalgic piece for me and I'm biased to Winnie the Pooh as a franchise. You can't hate such a wholesome character and series.

The problem says a=70 yards and b=93 yards. We then plug into our theorem above to receive the value for our hypotenuse (70 yards)\^2+(93 yards)\^2 = c\^2, and then we isolate c as a single variable, no exponent: sqrt((70 yards)\^2+(93 yards)\^2)=c = 118.2 yards.

2. I need to get my GPA up.

My GPA is not awful, architecture simply has a 2.5 minimum and I want mine up. My architecture GPA is over a 3.5 and is what I actually give a shit about but it also takes a way from my gen ed/university courses and has caused my common GPA to tip a bit.

So..long story short. Yes I get it, but also I‚Äôm making the decision for myself and it is the best one for me ",1543622618

I used a grinder full of ground bud, maybe two grams and decarbed it in the oven for 30 minutes at 240 degrees. Once decarbed I put some Nutella on some graham crackers and sandwiched the weed in them, wrapped them in tinfoil, and popped them in for another 30 minutes.

I made two, and ate a whole one. The peak was really psychedelic, insane closed eye visuals, closest I‚Äôve been to a 10 in a long time, I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes without being overwhelmed.",1543622619
"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","I wasn't planning to post anything today (needing a break), but I reflexively checked the price and wanted to share one last thought... of course these are all my opinions/analysis so take it for what it's worth.

Yesterday I posited that we might see a [rounded bottom here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zlIv84vm/) which seems to [have played out.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TzthjaEu/)  I think \~$3800 is an important support to hold if this is to move up further, and I suspect we'll see bounce here towards $4k - $4.1k range.

I think we're close to a 'bottom' but unfortunately I just *don't think we're done with this drop.*  We broke a multi-month consolidation pattern at $6k and we're only 2 weeks in.. these kinds of global moves usually take at least a month to manifest.  The final capitulation event in 2014 started on December 1st and ended mid January - 6 full weeks to resolve.  If we happen to move above $4600 with volume in the next couple weeks, then I think the local bottom is in, but I wouldn't be surprised to see something like: [failed cup and handle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oKvJEwMU/) before exploring the [bottom of the weekly order block](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aYEFTimC/) with the possibility of wicking towards \~$2800.  I don't say this because *I am short* or want it to happen... but it seems very plausible at this point given the above as well as the additional explanation below.

Last year's bear market, which we're now decidedly following, more than many of us would have liked, saw price move under 200MA weekly just briefly [which marked the very bottom of the bear market.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/piHN9hvP/), and in my view is the gold standard metric for Bitcoin's continued insane log run.   Past performance is not a promise of future performance...blah blah.. but it's hard to deny that global momentum actually supports a retest of weekly 200ma now that we've broken down from the long period of consolidation at $6k.

[While 1D and 3D RSI are at historically low levels](https://www.tradingview.com/x/itL79IkV/), it actually starts to look a bit more sane when using non-ordinary time-frames like [2W RSI which suggests we have a bit more downside when comparing to the last bubble.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8JCth1hP/).  In fact [weekly RSI looks to be sputtering in the same way as 2014 just before one last gutter candle to finish this thing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pibuB6Su/)

Finally, and most importantly (to me at least), I want to see massive volume coupled with price in order to feel more confident that a bottom is in... we don't *need* this to happen, but in the parlance of poker, another big move up or down coupled with a big influx of volume is just about as close to pocket aces as you're going to get when playing out the probabilities.  Retail [volume looks good](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GVZ9BEdh/), but considering how low we are, I want to see retail volume close to prior peaks... I want to see a shit-ton of people flocking into BTC as a buy before I push in another big lump of cash.

Hope this is helpful.  Safe trades.",1543622619
"PS4","t5_2rrlp","I even said I wasn't sure, there were elements in the trailers that interested me quite a bit unlike those other games.

I really disliked playing Last of Us, and Horizon- but God of War always caught my eye abit more, glad I got it.

The first 3 hours I wasn't too impressed with it, but after I got to the Witch's cabin I really enjoyed it, it was really fantastical and pretty, Alfheim was interesting too- probably 5 - 10 hours in.

I put it on the backburner for abit to replay the FFXIII trilogy again, but once I'm done, I'm looking forward to giving God of War my full attention.",1543622619

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","As the other person commented, it was simply about variety. 

Chateau is a middle tier map. On absolute mob count it's an A- (but it's no Armoury, HM or UGS), but on time to traverse it's a C-, making it around a B- overall.

Given you have Armoury, HM and UGS that are A on absolute mob count and B or even B+ on time to traverse, it was basically always a wrong choice to Elder Orb Chateau.

So this meant that prior to the card existing it was only ever a meme choice. Chateau was a tier 4 map (sometimes 9) and once you levelled past T4/9 maps you never ran it again. 

This meant it wasn't part of endgame. The card's intent was basically to add a new tileset to endgame.

In the new atlas with Chateau being T11, it will have less of this effect as people still semi-often run off meta T11s. However it's still one more option at T16.

"brazilianmusic","t5_2vr7h","your question has several assumptions that need a review and a closer look at the experience of our phonography. I do not want you to misunderstand what I said, I'm only taking what you asked seriously, because it's really a big question, that is, congratulations on your sensitivity.
Notice that as you approach our 'show' as a rock show, you put on a homogenous experience of concert senses, which is not verifiable. Thinking back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, we have two major influences in organizing the experience of an urban popular concert here in Brazil: (1) the ‚ÄúSamba-Can√ß√£o‚Äù of the 1950s, in which musicians - singers and instrumentalists - were sedimented in ""nightclubs"", with a specific climate that gave contribution to the sonorous senses proposed by the genre. that is, staying in a show house was an aesthetic necessity. (2) ‚ÄùOs festivais da can√ß√£o‚Äù, in which they most resembled the major festivals as Lolla or Coachella, than rock concerts, but they have a much more extensive complexity than I could say here, quickly.

but you see, there are a multitude of other questions that involve your question, even with respect to each of the artists you mentioned.
An exception to this ""static"" show rule, known as the University Circuit, from the beginning to the mid-1970s, is notorious for example, where artists from major record companies, such as the ones you mentioned, went to the campus of major universities (usually in the states of Minas Gerais, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) to hold concerts for this public, consumer and aesthetic agent.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I appreciate the responses touching upon the utility of of a foreign language proficiency vs programming language proficiency. I think it's an interesting point to admit that you are correct that these two subjects are fundamentally different, but some people are arguing that the result of knowing a few years of programming is more beneficial by some metric (the average person making more money, getting a job in the US, etc.).

I do however, worry that the arguments here are all highly biased by reddit's computer/tech savvy community and are extremely reliant on anecdote and feelings.

Is understanding a foreign culture and some of it's language less important than understanding some computer programing basics? Is that computer programing basics more important than calculus? What metric are you basing this on? Is it US specific? Is it a recent trend that will likely go away once we saturate some fields? If understanding some basics of computer programming is necessary, why sacrifice foreign language? Why not some year of English, mathematics, art, etc?",1543622621

&gt;Jordan Peterson has never ""blamed chicks for being sluts""

This is not true. https://youtu.be/wb1f-brq5-o

Watching it again also made me realize another issue: Why is it that Peterson sees male aggression as an unavoidable byproduct thats need to be catered to but then doesnt offer the same charity to female sexuality? Aren't they both supposed to be ""natural"" impulses? Why are we stigmatizing sex but not violence? I think there's an underlying assumption that violence and aggression is somehow immutable to the human condition. 

&gt;Neither Peterson nor I (by your implication) have ever said anything remotely like that

He absolutely has said this. 

&gt;&gt;He was angry at God because women were rejecting him. The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That‚Äôs actually why monogamy emerges. Half the men fail.¬†And no one cares about the men who fail.



https://www.indy100.com/article/jordan-peterson-enforced-monogomy-violent-crimes-new-york-times-incels-men-8359431

&gt;Dude. That's awfully eugenic-y.

Eugenics is when theres an organized effort, usually racist, to manipulate natural selection. Women deciding to leave these men alone is natural selection. Deciding to murder a bunch of random innocent is not a normal reaction. Why are you sympathizing with these people and not the women you'd be their being ""culturally enforced"" onto? This is a problem and its a problem precisely because Peterson permits male violence as simply am effect of evolution and therefore inevitable, in other biological determinism. These people are murdering people because of how society treats them, thats a romanticization. You CANNOT have such a degree of a lack of empathy without it being pathological.

&gt;That is Peterson's exact take. His answer to it, however, is not to condemn them and banish them from the gene pool

That sounds very nice but I refuse to empathize with mass murderers. I think what is happening is biological, they're being edited out by women because they can see that something is wrong, like the behavioral version of the Uncanny Valley.",1543622623

"FIFA","t5_2qxh7","I was complaining about the patch and even thought about not playing this WL because of all the things that got broken with it... but just played fastest 10 matches in this fifa, got literally 8 rage quits in first 30 mins of the match, every time after scoring 3 goals, few times even in first 10 mins of the match, people struggle so much with player switching in defence... 

But EA had to fuck up my games, one match finished on penalties, i won and game wouldn't let me go back to main menu, after few mins i got disconnected and got loss, fun times... 

In that game that i won but got loss guy was just as bad as others, but he was defending with slide tackles, just randomly without thinking slide tackle into my players as soon as i come close to his box, didn't get a singe foul even though some of those were from behind without even touching the ball",1543622623

But it was never going to take the big fortnite streamers away from fortnite.  Ninja, Tim, Lupo, nickmercs cannot leave fortnite, even if they wanted to.  

Ninja is synonymous with fortnite.  Tim changed his entire personality for fortnite.  Lupo wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere without ninja and fortnite.  And nick is very polarizing and burned a lot of bridges leaving cod.  He could never come back to it. 

This leaves the likes of shroud and drdisrespect as the main streamers of blackout.  JoshOG as well I suppose.  But these are smaller streamers who aren‚Äôt bound to one game as the fortnite crowd is.  Shroud can pull 25k twiddling his thumbs, so if he doesn‚Äôt feel like playing blackout, he won‚Äôt.  Doc does whatever he wants, and he complains about everything, which I think is hurting his stream.  This isn‚Äôt the case for the fortnite streamers as they HAVE to play that game or lose half their viewers.

I mean I know that Sparta was known for its spears but it has EIGHT different types of spearman.  There are so many units with really marginal differences in stats that I feel its really hard to tell how you should strategize for a fight without having to check the numbers which really ruins my immersion.  I mean how am i suppose to know if my 4th best spearman beat someone else's 6th best swordsman off hand?  This is coming from someone who majored in Latin and loves the time period.

@Totally Pointless I am far from a flower. Unless you mean a death flower

that is a flower to you, then I am a poisonous one. I believe everyone should 

have the right to be treated equally without bias, bullying, or judging others. 

Despite wanting to see humanity end, while I am here I want to see attempted 

fairness. But i know that I will not see it, Who says I am human, some people 

would consider me more a demon than human based on my views of the world. 

I just hate bigots, racists, religious people, republicans, and trump supporters 

more than other people. I want everyone dead, but I want those people dead 

first. No one cared about what you said over the video, they just watched the 

videos. Next time get better clips of higher quality, I seen all those videos in 

better quality at other peoples channels. Steal better next time.

"WeightLossAdvice","t5_31a4o","Get an app that can count your calories. Around 1200 on rest days and 1600 on workout days. Workout 4-5x a day. Have 1 cheat day(eating a few more carbs(1300 if rest or 1700 if workout) that day) every 2 weeks to quicken your digestive system. Eat 6 small meals a day (breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner). Drink lots of water!(bring a bottle of water wherever you go). 1.workout day -Abs and legs 2.workout day-abs and arms 3.workout day-abs and back. Then just alternate between those three. Stay away from fast food and processed foods(hotdogs and chicken nuggets(like at McDonald‚Äôs)). No candy and sugary drinks(soda and lemonade or tea). I drink the drink Naked periodically throughout the day it makes you feel full and you eat less. Remember/ THE GREENER THE LEAVES THE MORE NUTRITIONAL VALUE(kale)! Nothing oily or greasy!

"hardware","t5_2qh18","&gt; Anyhow, Oculus has been talking about how their next iteration of the oculus rift will arrive in about 2021/2022

Oculus *was* talking about that a few years ago, during [a keynote in 2016](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/oculus-teases-its-next-vr-prototype-moving-lenses-finger-tracking-wider-fov/).  A *lot* may have changed since then.

For example, [their CEO quit about a month ago](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18010030/brendan-iribe-oculus-ceo-leaves-facebook-quit) and rumors are than their next headset ( more like a [Rift ""S""](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/31/after-canceling-rift-2-overhaul-oculus-plans-a-modest-update-to-flagship-vr-headset/) that a Rift 2) is going to be a spec bump in resolution at best and a change to inside out tracking (so basically a current Windows Mixed Reality headset).  

If true it means the [Half Dome prototype](https://uploadvr.com/oculus-half-dome-prototype-140/) they showed off a few months ago is effectively dead (and that [wasn't ""4k""](https://uploadvr.com/oc5-4k-oculus-half-dome-prototype-would-be-straightforward/) itself). Meaning Oculus is not going to be pushing as hard for resolution upgrades.  Which ultimately means 4k x 4k is probably not going to be common place for VR... at least for a while. (I'm sure people will try though....)

Of course that isn't a bad thing because you can bring a 2080 Ti to it's knees in VR right now on a 2880x1600 display, depending on in game graphics quality. I seriously doubt there's going to be a GPU capable of driving games at 8000x4000 resolution with 90+ fps within 2-3 years.",1543622625

By simply not allowing the traffic to flow as it should the cars and other vehicles will not be able to make way as they easily would, Or hell, terrorist attack, Of cause that mostly potential harm, I would think forcing the vehicles to sit in location for a long amount of time with the engine running would do the harm


it also harms their cause because, if you are the one being forced to wait, you're not going to care about why they are doing it, only that they are now getting in your way, wasting your time, it's a Friday, people want to get home because they have a life, when compare to someone protesting with all that free time they have.

Just as Christians wish to see less atheists in the world, you wish to see less religion. Confirming again that you don't just lack a belief of any god, but you actively oppose yourself to the idea and are thus anti-religion.

When the track was posted on the official Devil May Cry YouTube channel, it generally got negative feedback from fans, the music video went as far as get above 7k dislikes before it was eventually deleted from the channel. 

One of the singers, Eddie Hermida, was accused of sexually manipulating a 17-year-old girl in 2017. Capcom was not aware of this until after the music track was recorded.

Once they found out about the allegations, they stated that ""we will not further highlight the Dante battle theme for promotional purposes at this time"" and that ""We are also currently evaluating what options are possible for the full game at this point, which is dependent on various factors such as resources.""",1543622627

Yamcha hides behind a wall in Capsule Corp while the ten fighters, Beerus and Whis are in a circle ready to go to the Tournament of Power. Right before they are transported, Yamcha jumps in and kicks Tien out of the way, taking his place. Yamcha is now forced to participate in the ToP in the place of Tien. From now on he does his absolute best to not pick up a fight with anyone. Like literally anyone. Everything else goes pretty normal, someone from another universe can eliminate that bird guy that Tien kamikazed. When the arena is pretty messed up, he pretends he took a big hit from an opponent and then hides right near the edge of the arena. Then everyone just sort of forgets about him because he is Yamcha and doesn‚Äôt really matter. On the last episode when Goku and Frieza eliminate Jiren, Yamcha suddenly jumps out of his hiding spot and kicks Android 17 out of the arena while he is distracted. Yamcha is now the champion of the Tournament of Power. He then wishes to be more powerful than Zen-Oh and fucks up everyone.

Obviously it‚Äôs not the right thing to do, but I definitely don‚Äôt think Kareem should be getting called a POS or all of the other hateful things that people are saying. I read through the real old article posted in Feb and I read through the comments of the post of said article again on r/NFL, and after reading what the article said and watching the video, this looks like the article is exactly right. I think one of the things that‚Äôs blowing this up is that it‚Äôs on video and not in a text article. I‚Äôm not siding with Kareem and just fanboying and saying he shouldn‚Äôt be punished, because he should, but everyone is calling him a monster for arguing with someone in the hallway who supposedly wouldn‚Äôt leave. If she‚Äôs 19, I completely believe that she was underage drinking. I think there‚Äôs a real chance that Hunt and his friends actually might‚Äôve kicked them out but they stayed. 

No saying Hunt is innocent, but definitely don‚Äôt think he should be called a monster or anything else people have been calling him. This is extremely mild and everything was open handed. The kick was a nudge. He didn‚Äôt even push her into a wall, his friend fell and as he fell, he pushed the girl. On accident. He didn‚Äôt maliciously push her into the wall and she was drunk when she hit it. She wasn‚Äôt knocked out, she was drunk. 

This is blowing up, but I don‚Äôt think the hate should be this aimed toward Hunt because he didn‚Äôt do things that everyone just assumes he did in the video that we‚Äôve got BIAS information about from TMZ. They just posted it and are getting loads of views from the video so they‚Äôre gonna make money off of it.

TL;DR: Hunt isn‚Äôt innocent but he‚Äôs certainly not a monster for arguing with a woman who is underage and drunk outside of his own living space. 

Also, if she wasn‚Äôt instigating anything, she would‚Äôve left instead of walking back toward Hunt‚Äôs door repeatedly.",1543622628

I've always found this interesting because her conceiving jesus via God makes it sound like what everyone thinks, because it sounds like a miracle. But, no. Mary was conceived the old fashioned way by her mom and dad, SO she could be the mother of God later on.

Not saying any of it is true or what people believe is silly. Just that this is one that has been said for so long, and (to me) it makes so much more sense that she was chosen at conception for the huge task, versus that she was a virgin when she conceived jesus.

"georgism","t5_2tq7a","&gt; Exclusion from opportunity is not a negotiation the excluded will be paid money collected from Land Values

Foreign policy is *always* a negotiation unless you are advocating for imperialism. The difference between sharing land rent equally within a nation and the difference between sharing land rent outside of a nation, is that your military does not control the other nation, and you cannot collect the rent from it. It is impossible to collect the rent of the other nation to ensure reciprocation and equal rent sharing without a treaty negotiation or political union. The only other solution is a military conquest, and military solutions will create deadweight loss for all parties involved, and are often high-jacked by rent-seekers.

&gt; The Land Rent will be distributed to all People

Giving the land rent to dictatorships without a land value tax who do not wish to share the land rent with all People is suicide. You would just be giving them money to lobby against sharing the land rent equally.

&gt; Exclusion does not magically stop at your Nationalist Borders

Borders are not solely a product of governments. Borders are created by land ownership. Without a national government there would still be borders and conflict over the appropriation of resources and rent. A nation which divides the rent equally within its borders will have completely eliminated economic exclusion within the territory it controls. A nation which divides the rent globally by population outside of the area it controls will fail to divide the rent equally, as some of its citizens may hold land in foreign countries which have not implemented a land value tax, allowing them to collect an unequal share of the rent from residents of their own country, and the rent given to other countries without a LVT will be captured by the rulers who do not wish the rent to be equally share, and they will reinvest these rents in lobbying against geoism globally. We see this today with Saudi Arabia, they control the oil fields which yields the highest economic rent, and they reinvest the rent globally to influence the foreign policy of other countries.",1543622632

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt; Wow, that's impressive. Can your encoder/decoder be parallelized? 

Short answer: yes. Long answer: currently, there is thread contention on accessing the tree of mempool transactions sorted by TXID. I did a PoC implementation that first iterates through the tree and copies all the TXIDs into a sorted vector, and then does the encoding using that sorted vector instead of the tree, and that ends up being slightly faster overall even in the single-threaded case. However, the code ends up being a bit more complicated, so I've stashed that for now, and am focusing on the single-threaded case on a locked mempool tree.

&gt; At what block size should we start worrying about collisions?

Xthinner checks each block transaction against the transactions in the sender's mempool, and specifies as many bytes as necessary to disambiguate that specific transaction.

Xthinner's probability of collisions does not increase with increasing block size. For bigger mempools (i.e. bigger blocks), Xthinner just ends up with more bytes on the stack for each transaction. 

There is an increasing chance of errors with increasing mempool desynchrony, but the checksum schemes allows errors to be isolated to a small portion of the block, so only the affected transactions (usually 8 tx) need to be retransmitted in full. The probability that a transaction missing from the recipient's mempool causing an unrecoverable error is below 2^(-40) with the standard checksum scheme.

Xthinner-blocktorrent will use the full SHA256d merkle tree check on each packet of 256-512 transactions, so in the worst case (when the checksums fail), it would only need to retransmit 512 as full transactions.

&gt; But how many RTTs are needed to push 3.4MB through TCP (or any other closed-loop congestion controlled protocol)?

3.4 MB is about 2266 packets. If the CWND starts at 1, and doubles every RTT, it would take about 10 RTTs to transmit 2266 packets with 0% packet loss. That's about 2 seconds for a 200 ms RTT. Most of the problem with TCP comes from packet loss, so real world results will often be worse than that. This is 2 seconds per hop, btw.

&gt; A UDP+FEC-based protocol with some out-of-the-loop measurements of bandwidth and BER/packet-loss rate should still be faster, right?

Absolutely. A 100 Mbps link should be able to send 3.4 MB in about 272 ms for the throughput plus 0.5 RTT for a total of around 372 ms. A good UDP+FEC protocol should be able to get close to that.

&gt; Also, what is your opinion on the centralized nature of FIBRE/falcon?

We should not assume centralized protocols/platforms to work when choosing safe limits for the system as a whole. My target for a safe limit is 20 second average propagation+validation time. If we can get 20 seconds on 128 MB without FIBRE, and 2 seconds with FIBRE, that's cool. If we can get 200 seconds on 1 GB without FIBRE, and 20 seconds with FIBRE, that's uncool.",1543622632

"HungryArtists","t5_2wx1w","You want your OC drawn? Want a cool background on your PC? Maybe you even want some weird kinky stuff in your secret folders? Or you're thinking of giving someone a Christmas present? Well, guess who's doing commissions...ME! So, without further ado, let's announce it:¬†

COMMISSIONS OPEN!!

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the rules:

1. THE PAYMENT CHART IS FOR ONE CHARACTER/OBJECT. So if you want a sketch of one character/object you pay 5$. If you want sketches of three characters/objects in the same picture or separately you pay 15$. It doesn't matter if you want a bust, half a body or a full body picture. The pricing is the same with every pose and every angle. I can also do logos and banners, the pricing would be negotiable.
2. I AM COMFORTABLE WITH DRAWING ANYTHING. It can be furries, kinks, fetishes, gore, ANYTHING BUT characters that are under 16 doing the graphic sexy stuff (meaning no genitals/boobies/butthole in the same picture with them). I can also do objects like vehicles and robots but keep in mind that I am specialized in character and animal drawing.
3. I TAKE PAYMENT IN ADVANCE because it's more likely you will run off with my artwork without paying than me deleting all of my social media and disappearing with your 15$ :D My PayPal info is down below. If you live in Finland you can ask me for my bank account number in a private message :)
4. PROVIDE GOOD AND VERY DETAILED REFERENCE PICTURES AND TEXTS. It is very important that you give me aaaall the details and little things that you want me to include in the art work. If I'm not satisfied with your references then please don't be mad if I refuse to work for you. The references don't have to be images (but it helps). I promise you it will help the whole process if you give me all there is to know AT THE BEGINNING of the commissioning. Which will lead us to...
5. I WILL NOT MAKE BIG CHANGES AFTER THE SKETCHING PHASE. If you want really big changes at the last minute, I might have to charge you extra. Small changes like colouring, strands of hair, some text or maybe some accessories is fine. If you ask me to redo the whole image, I might charge you everything that I did up to that phase. EXAMPLE: If i have completed a full coloured character with a background, and you request a completely different pose, I will have to charge it as an extra character. Things like the background could be used for both images and wont be added to the cost. You will receive both finished works.

SKETCH - 5$¬†- This includes a simple sketch with light shadowing.¬†

LINE ART - 10$- This includes a cleaned up line art with no shadows.

COLOURED - 15$- This includes flat or shaded colouring.¬†

BACKGROUND + 5$- I will add a background of your request into any phase, be it a sketch or a coloured version for an additional 5$. A flat colour in the background is not considered as a background so I will not charge for that. More complex backgrounds or scene may cost more.

Another thing to consider is time.¬†It might take me many days to finish the artworks (up to two weeks) SO BEAR WITH ME. I will keep you updated during the whole process of creating the art work so please remember to check your messages! I do only digital art work but if you want a real physical piece then we can talk about it directly with different pricing. Also, if you want to just randomly donate I will be forever grateful and kiss your feet since for me money doesn't exactly grow on trees!¬†

So there you go! If you have anything to ask, please email me or send me a message on reddit :3

As we've seen, many of these companies have no interest in playing a fair game, and being able to take it to Reddit evens the playing field.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","People like you keep saying that line about deranged liberals/lefties/whoever unfairly calling people fascists or white supremacists or whatnot, but maybe it's just because we're better at reading context.  Assuming you aren't arguing in bad faith, anyways.

We think these people are fash or fash adjacent not just because we disagree with them, but because we see the ends that their arguments serve, and see that they make the sort of introductory-level arguments towards fascism and white nationalism that drag the 'center' ever rightwards.

You post a lot in /r/jordanpeterson (and /r/pussypassdenied, *yikes*), so you probably sort of hate that all the people who have been calling JBP right-wing were proven right during the midterms when he came out in support of Trump.

"poland","t5_2qkmn","You mean asylum seekers? They reside in Germany under different law, and to install a cap on asylum it would need a change in constitution which is not going to happen. Some get asylum, some subsidiary protection, some are rejected and live in a legal limbo because it's extremely difficult to deport a person without any kind of documentation back to a 3rd world country, as his country of origin has to accept him back, which often doesn't happen to be the case. Influx of illegal immigrants has been significantly reduced since 2016.

Germany is currently running a campaign of voluntary return, offering 12 months of financial assistance.

https://i.imgur.com/PAtjCkW.jpg

Germany is focused primarily on Balkans when it comes to influx of non-EU workforce. Right now citizens of Balkans don't need to go through a job market check, they only need a contract with a German company and to get a visa in German embassy, and then they can start working. This happens to be the most difficult part because waiting time is long, sometimes up to a year, since only a few clerks work with thousands of requests. New law will make it easy to immigrate - professionals from Positivliste will no longer wait for visa, making visa approvals significantly faster for people who have a contract with German company, but are not on Positivliste and don't have B1 in German.",1543622633

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","So thought about this for a while, and, again, just going to tell it like it is. As a dude, we go after girls in their prime in terms of their physical looks. According to science that's basically women of legal age to 25. Whether we're 30 or 50, guys like their girls in roughly that age bracket unless they have made a significant emotional investment in them (and even then the majority probably still check out younger women).

Why do I bring this up?

After re-reading your profile, I see you mentioned you do exclusively online dating. The problem you're going to have is guys will, particularly in online dating where no-one is going to judge them, go for the younger women. I'm not saying this to be mean, but you're not just competing with women your age. You're competing with women younger than you who are in their prime from a biological perspective. If you are interested in older men, I suggest you try make an effort offline, where the desire to conform to societal norms will likely work in your favour.

"trackers","t5_2rjuw","Sorry, but if someone would have bothered to upload Bitme's stuff on any other tracker, everything would still be available. Cross seeding is easily doable, you could even automate it, assuming Bitme had some sort of quality control.

&gt; All I'm saying let us make a huge E-learning platform. This platform will be better because when a person wants to upload a tutorial then that content will be present in all platforms like torrent, usenet, ddl, irc, etc. So you will have multiple choice with multiple platforms of the same file.

Wait, ""torrent or ddl are very bad when keeping old files"", so you suggest using ""torrent, usenet, ddl, irc, etc.""? I can't comment on Usenet, but IRC seems even worse. Unless you just want to post DDL or torrent / magnet links there.

Hosting an additional platform that just gathers links would be kinda pointless, I mean there are already sites like https://www.xrel.to/ that just save the NFOs, so you can find the same upload via the file name on multiple sources.

&gt; So even if the file is taken down by dmca or website goes down like bitme. There will be other platforms available. 

There were other trackers available, that are still running. That's the users fault for not uploading their torrents on multiple trackers. I mean you could even split the work, like have regular uploaders upload new torrents, and other users upload it to different trackers, while others keep seeding it. Maybe even upload it on a DDL hoster too.",1543622634

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","If you don't consider cocaine as an antidepressant then you don't consider the drugs labelled as antidepressants as one either.

""Antidepressants"" including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin‚ÄìNorepinephrine‚ÄìDopamine reuptake inhibitor.

The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.

For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.

Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.

GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label."" (if you wondering why it's 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn't include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide.

""Antidepressants"" including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin‚ÄìNorepinephrine‚ÄìDopamine reuptake inhibitor.

They cause extrapyramidal symptoms

such as Parkinsonism (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity)dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions), AKATHISIA (motor restlessness), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), tremor, and tardive dyskinesia (irregular, jerky movements).

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","The problem is that hairs grow in growth/rest cycles so many follicles will be dormant and therefore resistant to treatment during any given session.  Some follicles will even host multiple bulbs so an electrologist will need to zap the same follicle several times over the course of six-to-seven months as each hair wakes up and starts to grow out.  Sadly--tragically--it takes several full passes over several months to properly and completely ""clear the lawn"" and kill ALL the hairs with certainty.  Cutting corners on that will lead to regrettable results (hairy vaginal canal and inaccessible abscesses due to infected ingrown hairs) and, personally, it would take a lot for me to trust anyone who says they have an easy solution.  Human biology being what it is and our current technology being where it's at limits us.  

Some surgeons offer a follicular scraping method where, during surgery, they remove the follicles from the underside but that has been shown to increase the risk of tissue damage and slows the healing time because it severely disrupts the capillary networks.

It really sucks.  It's hard.  I know it's hard.  I don't know your pain but I know mine and it has driven me close to suicide on many occasions.  It's driven me to self-injury hundreds of times.

&gt;I do wonder how accepting women are of these changing times. Do they tie masculinity into status and if so do they view men who are not doing as well as them in life as lesser males?

  My job is not the best paid and plenty of people do it as a stop gap or cos they can't do anything else. When I was single, just saying what my job was could get me deleted on tinder. On the other hand, some women would question me about how much I enjoyed it and if I were ambitious in it. I think they were looking for you having passion in what you do.

  The other thing I always say is people stick to a similar economic bracket. So while it'd be nice to marry up, it's not a realistic goal and still especially not for men. So I'd advise that you just stick to people within your same range. 

 Recently I've been thinking about the future of how we work, and in my opinion it probably doesn't look good. A lot of jobs are heading for mass automation is one point.

"EnoughMuskSpam","t5_3blr7","It doesn't appear that Tesla took any tax payer money.  Neoen paid Tesla for the battery and Neoen gets $4 million a year from the South Australia government for grid security services.  And it appears to be totally worth it:

https://reneweconomy.com.au/tesla-big-battery-turns-one-celebrates-50-million-in-grid-savings-95920/

It is also making money, and lowering costs. The battery cost $91 million, but has likely lowered costs by around $50 million, according to Neoen CEO Franck Wotiez.

‚ÄúIt has been an amazing project,‚Äù Wotiez told RenewEconomy this week. ‚ÄúIt is amazing, too, for us and for AEMO. It is really positive.

‚ÄúI was with premier of South Australian on Friday and we were highlighting the savings to the taxpayers, thanks to added competition to the market. I think the common number is $50 million of savings from FCAS.‚Äù

What is already known is most of those savings have been achieved by smashing the cartel of gas generators that was controlling prices in the FCAS market.

The battery‚Äôs presence means that a network constraint imposed in South Australia that was repeatedly rorted by those generators is no longer needed or imposed.

Neoen revealed details of the battery‚Äôs own performance when it issued detailed documents to support its recent initial public offering.

That revealed total revenues of $A13 million in the January 1 to June 30 half year, including $2 million from its South Australia contract, and another $10.8 million from its market operations, mostly from FCAS and some from market arbitrage (buying low and selling into the peaks).

Dylan McConnell, from the Climate and Energy College in Melbourne, has used OpenNEM data to crunch some numbers for RenewEconomy on the battery‚Äôs first 12 months performance, and it shows that ‚Äì as we predicted after the half-year numbers came to light ‚Äì the battery is likely to have delivered revenue of $24 million in its first year.

That is made up, as this graph above shows, of $2.86 million of net revenue from energy market trading (generation revenue minus charging costs), and another $16.75 million from FCAS market. Add in the $4 million a year it gets from the South Australia government for grid security services, that takes it close enough to $24 million.",1543622637

Episode 6: Phos is the name, speed‚Äôs my game!

I think this is the first episode without a cold open.

The bell, as you probably guessed, means Lunarians. Sensei‚Äôs already here though, so that‚Äôs a bit of a wash. Yellow Diamond shrugs off an arrow with mild irritation, but his comparatively excitable partner Zircon [isn‚Äôt so lucky.](https://i.imgur.com/dhnuhSO.jpg) Despite pretty minor damage to the rest of the body, decapitation renders him unconscious quickly. The gems must have a higher concentration of inclusions in their heads, or something.

Yellow is our oldest gem at 3,597 years, and [he‚Äôs not all that happy about it.](https://i.imgur.com/z7LINCP.jpg) Losing a whopping four partners has understandably left him with a nasty case of survivor‚Äôs guilt. You can see the world-weariness in his eyes. Is this the inevitable fate of any gem that survives for long enough‚Ä¶?

[The butt wiggle!!](https://i.imgur.com/DAZlGbH.jpg) Diamond‚Äôs like a cat, she just wants scritches.

[Phos‚Äôs new legs are a little too fast for her own good.](https://i.imgur.com/63xZPi2.jpg)

[Whoops.](https://i.imgur.com/7UcDl62.jpg) Phos is fast now, but still as fragile as ever. She wastes no time requesting [the role she‚Äôs always wanted](https://i.imgur.com/UnNgdTU.jpg) regardless.

[Sensei is not amused by Phos and Yellow‚Äôs banter.](https://i.imgur.com/CSnyRRt.jpg)

[Phos blurts out an unspoken truth](https://i.imgur.com/qq1LFLq.jpg), and the reactions are great.  Rutile is embarrassed, Yellow is too old to have any shame, and [Sensei is downright shocked](https://i.imgur.com/Fss958e.jpg). Phos‚Äôs subsequent giggle is positively delightful. Please never get a filter, Phos.

Phos gets to be a lookout, which isn‚Äôt exactly a combat role, but she‚Äôll take it anyway. It‚Äôs a damn sight better than making an encyclopedia.

[The color palette changes as suddenly as the tone of the scene.](https://i.imgur.com/Haed9rI.jpg) Phos looks down at her legs and realizes she remembers almost nothing about how she got them. But one word she does remember provokes a [*very* strong reaction](https://i.imgur.com/pnPuYF1.jpg) from Sensei. What does he know that they don‚Äôt? Why is he upset at the prospect of a gem learning about humans? Lucky for Sensei, Phos‚Äôs lack of recollection allows him to let the matter go for now. One has to wonder what he might have done if Phos‚Äôs memories of the sea had remained intact.

[This comes off to me like Rutile is trying to convince herself in order to avoid questioning Sensei.](https://i.imgur.com/tamPRWb.jpg) His change in demeanor upon the mention of ‚Äúningen‚Äù was way too obvious to seriously argue that he was just frustrated with Phos‚Äôs bad memory.

[The Amethyst twins‚Äô reveal](https://i.imgur.com/pIRcYPf.jpg) is pretty cool. They‚Äôre quite, uh, handsy with each other, but then I suppose you would be too if you couldn‚Äôt touch anyone else without worrying about cracks.

[Repeating, of course.](https://i.imgur.com/pS8A5dY.jpg) Jade has Lunarian prediction down to a science, as if it‚Äôs a weather forecast.

[The twins are easily distracted](https://i.imgur.com/HJCqVbp.jpg), which only adds to Phos‚Äôs first-day-on-the-job anxiety. Somewhat surprisingly, they make it through the day without Phos attracting any Lunarians, but Phos collapses from exhaustion anyway. Lifting that sword and worrying about combat is hard work.

[Rutile sees more broken Phos in her future.](https://i.imgur.com/dE0MW5E.jpg)

On day 3, Phos‚Äôs luck runs out. [Symmetry is the name of the game with Amethyst.](https://i.imgur.com/dtPtuFy.jpg) All of their movements are almost perfectly mirrored as they cut a swath through the Lunarians.

[Is this some kind of machine??](https://i.imgur.com/BX2XYAB.jpg) This Lunarian adaptation is particularly menacing. If you recall Yellow‚Äôs list of lost partners from earlier, it looks like the blades are made of Sapphire.

[That‚Äôs a haunting scream](https://i.imgur.com/wr2fplR.jpg), especially with the way they scream *after* being shattered. [The shape the Lunarians form](https://i.imgur.com/nCtYTNe.jpg) as they retreat has a similar shape to the anime‚Äôs logo.

Thankfully, Bort arrives just in time to save the day, but man, this has to be a real kick in the teeth for Phos. For all her newfound and hard-earned ability, she could only watch as Amethyst was taken away in front of her, paralyzed by her fear and weakness. Running fast just isn‚Äôt enough to be as useful as she wants to be. She needs to get stronger still. But how? Will she have to make another sacrifice of body and mind, or will she find another way?

[Does Sensei feel sympathy for the Lunarians?](https://i.imgur.com/Q8JOOtz.jpg) The mystery surrounding him deepens.

And with that, we‚Äôre halfway through! I have to say, though I‚Äôve always preferred the back half of HnK to the front and still do, taking a more critical eye in this rewatch has made me appreciate the first 6 episodes more. I and other watchers noticed a number of subtleties that I never picked up on in the past, and others that I picked up on but never thought too much about. So, thanks for that, everyone. Anyway, things are about to get even more interesting, so buckle your seatbelts.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I listened to a [podcast about scalping](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/11/28/671580422/episode-468-kid-rock-vs-the-scalpers) the other day, and it's fairly relevant here.  Scalping exists because artists sell tickets to go see them at much less than people are willing to pay.  As a result, scalpers use cunning, persistence and technology to buy the tickets first and then re-sell them for a profit.

If people are scrambling to buy ships from CIG, and they're ""running out"", that means there either aren't enough ships available, or the price is lower than the market says it should be.  If there were more ships available, they might satisfy all demand.  If the prices were higher, they might satisfy demand with the existing supply at that higher price.

Of course, for the same reason artists don't want to sell at crazy high prices, CIG doesn't want to sell ships at ridiculous prices.  They don't want to be seen to gouge their most dedicated fans.

For performing artists, there are various options.  Kid Rock hates scalpers, so one thing he did is to not directly sell any seats in the first 2 rows of his concerts.  Instead, he decided to have a lottery where everybody who bought a really cheap seat had a chance of being upgraded to one of the first 2 rows.  Taylor Swift looked at who was trying to buy tickets at a low price and if an algorithm determined they were a real fan and not a scalper, they were eligible.

CIG could do something like one of those two.  For example, whenever there's a really high demand ship for sale, people who backed the game early could get a first shot at it (but it would have to be bound to their account for a while, so they couldn't just re-sell it).  Or, any time someone bought a cheaper package, their name was entered into a lottery.  If they won that lottery they could have a chance to get the new in-demand item.

Unfortunately, to get rid of the artificial scarcity entirely, they'd have to do the other thing that both Kid Rock and Taylor Swift did: raise prices.  For Kid Rock, the first 2 rows are upgrade-lottery winners.  The 20 rows after that are extremely expensive platium seats selling at whatever people are willing to pay.

In editing they realized we should wait to meet Leia on Takodana since cutting to Leia earlier hurt the pacing. 

You can watch that here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rDhP-pOSYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rDhP-pOSYs)

Basically, they clearly set up that The Republic doesn't have really have a military, considers The Resistance unnecessary, Leia kinda of crazy and the First Order sort of a fringe group. The Republic viewed the First Order more like how we view white nationalists. They're definitely evil and need to be watched, but kind of a fringe group that aren't as dangerous as more pressing issues. Only, in this case, it's as if that white nationalist group planned a massive terrorist takeover of the Government. The entire ST is basically about The First Order having a coup de tat over The Galaxy in real time (days to a week), and the last group that can stop them, The Resistance, are their primary focus to attack in The Last Jedi so they can complete their takeover. 

There's also a deleted scene from The Last Jedi between Poe and Finn that make this a lot clearer too: You can watch that here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL-SQyxBEzA&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL-SQyxBEzA&amp;t=3s)",1543622642

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Most people fear hackers.  They do everything they can to prevent their digital lives from bring taken over.  Firewalls, antivirus programs, complex passwords.  Every trick in the book is used to keep themselves safe from hackers.

Sally Greene welcomed them.  She loved hackers, and did everything she could to invite them into her digital domain.

She did not always do this, of course.  Once upon a time, she feared the electronic invaders just like anyone else.  She took all the usual precautions to prevent herself from being hacked, just like everyone else.  That ended the day she actually did get hacked.

The first day, it was odd emails.  Then websites started popping up at random.  More and more odd things were happened to her computer.  When she figured out what was happening, she was understandably terrified.  She had to change her passwords, get new virus protection software, check her bank accounts.

That last one made her pause.  She saw a deposit she had not made.  It was not much, just a single cent, but it was there.  At first, she dismissed it as a mistake.  She still had work to do to rid herself of the hacker.

She fought to end the onslaught of pop ups.  Until she actually looked at them.  They were all websites presenting her with things she needed.  Financial advising, tips on home ownership.  Everything she needed in life simply popped up, unbidden.

She dove deeper.  Everything the hacker was doing benefited her in some way.  Nothing substantial, but it was there.

Sally wondered why it had happened, but it was all harmless, so she rolled with it.  Then the next hacker struck.  This one activated her computer's camera without her say-so.  At first, she was worried that dangerous pictures would begin surfacing online.  Pictures did come up soon after, but she found she did not mind.  All of them were very flattering.  They all seemed to catch her at just the right time to present her at her best.  And she was always fully clothed in them to boot.

The photo taker stopped after a few days of excellent pictures.  Sally almost wished he would have continued, just to get a few more shots of her best self.

The next hacker struck, yielding equally desirable results.  And the next, and the next.  Somehow, Sally Greene was getting all the nicest, kindest hackers there were.  So much so that she actually began to get suspicious.  How could one person get so lucky?  Maybe it was one hacker using different methods of helping her?  No, that was not it.  Somehow, she knew that was not it.  But then what?

Her answer came with a single email one day.

Please stop.  We're sorry we tried to hack you.  We'll be good from now on, we promise.

            -WorldHack

The sender was, of course, unfamiliar, but she could guess who it was.  It was the hackers.  Every single one of them must have belonged to a single, hidden hacker collective.  And by some miracle, Sally was counter hacking them.

She had no idea how, since she had no such skills, but she was hardly complaining.  She would figure it out with time.  All she had to do was put herself out there and find more hackers.  

Sally placed her hands on the keyboard and felt more at peace and more confident than she ever had before.  A smile crossed her lips.  She felt the computer in ways she never had before.  And then, even without being hacked again, she understood.  She understood everything.  About computers.  About herself and her more...unique qualities.  About many things.

Most people did everything in their power to avoid being hacked.  They put up firewalls and changed passwords.  Sally Greene did none of those.  Sally Greene loved getting hacked.  After all, hackers made such good victims for a technopath.",1543622643

They simply provide better traction. 

If it‚Äôs an icy slope, you run into a stability problem. If you are at risk of falling, you are obviously less safe on your feet. But this isn‚Äôt ice, it‚Äôs snow. You can tell by the footprints depressing into the snow. If they were on their feet, they would sink in and have decent footholds. They could even stomp a bit to get a better footing.

Called her doctor, but they wouldn't see her until the following Monday and this was Wednesday or Thursday.

Called a new doctor a day or 2 later, that she was planning on switching to and they got her in right away. they ran the ultrasound, and took some time to find the heartbeat, and then took the time to measure it. Then called another doctor in. they scanned some more and broke the news that it was Ectopic. It was horrible to hear/see the heartbeat and know there was nothing that could be done. Can only imagine how much worse it'd be to be further along.

She went in for surgery, the tube had ruptured and had severe internal bleeding. They weren't able to save the tube either, but by some miracle we were able to have 3 more. Thought we were done after the 3 girls and but were surprised with a boy a few months ago.

Kyle isn't my favorite driver. But i wouldn't wish anything like this on my worst enemy. Which if you ask my youngest daughter, she'd probably say KB is my worst enemy.

Edit:
oh. i forgot about the lady that worked at the hospital who congratulated us when we were leaving after the surgery... From that point on, Ive never brought up asking about people about having kids or having more kids while making small talk. Dunno what their situation is, so best not to bring it up.

Now almost 100k people have up-voted this post, a lot will buy the game. Based on what? Nobody knows if this is actually a solid game, they're just buying it to stroke the guys ego and because the game is aesthetically pleasing.

There's plenty of aesthetically pleasing, shit games out there. Why not let the community decide that your game is good enough to promote? Is that not a more sincere way to sell your product?

I'm not a cynical asshole, I'm really not. Usually I see the best in people/posts, but this is like people posting pictures of writing on /r/Pics and getting up votes for an *emotional* post.

Okay, so you're a person. Everything you do creates disorder. Sure, you personally are orderly enough: you're made of distinct organs with a purpose and cells with a purpose and those cells have a supply of oxygen that used to be out randomly in the air but is now sent down networks of blood vessels to where it's needed, and you have a brain with thoughts and feelings and various subroutines, all working tirelessly to keep you ordered.

But the act of keeping your little tiny pocket of order in the universe creates an awful lot of disorder. You'll produce more than 11 tonnes of shit in your lifetime, and that's just scratching the surface of the disorder you create through exhaling CO2 that used to be complex sugars and protein molecules before you came crashing through and trashed the place. And you even leave a corpse when you die, too, which will turn to mush.

You, an ordered system, create disorder: you create *entropy*. The universe is more disorderly because of you.

And *now* bear in mind that the mere act of keeping you alive requires the death or partial destruction of *other* ordered systems: plants, animals etc., all of which created disorder of their own.

""Ah!"" you might think, ""What about the circle of life? My poo makes more plants, and so will my body, and it goes around like that forever, right?"" Well, if it weren't for the Sun producing energy to power the plants that feed on the waste produced by the microbes that break down the mess you leave in your wake, every human on Earth would leave a trail of devastation in their wake and nothing would clean it up. So we have to look to the sun.

The sun itself does the same. It formed out of a fairly disordered system (a cloud of hydrogen, helium and a few other things), and when it dies it'll leave a slightly *more* disordered, slightly less usable system behind: there'll be less and less stuff that new stars can make decent use out of as the Sun turns some of its mass into energy through nuclear fusion and leaves behind useless iron atoms that can't be used.

The sun, an ordered system creates disorder: it creates *entropy*. The universe is left more disorderly because of the sun.

And *then* we start looking into the deep, deep future. It's a hundred trillion years after the Big Bang. The stars are all dead. Black holes reign, but even they are evaporating. Slowly, they're boiling away as Hawking radiation. Eventually, they're all gone. All that's left is radiation, and as that radiation gets further away from its source it gets redder and redder thanks to the expansion of the universe between its origin and its current location stretching it out. Eventually, the last photon emitted by the last evaporating black hole is too long a wavelength for it to ever affect (or, indeed, *effect*) anything. The universe reaches peak entropy.

The black holes, ordered systems, created disorder: they created *entropy.* The year is now well past a trillion trillion years since the Big Bang, and the universe is left more disorderly because of them, and there is no possible state of more disorder that could ever exist than that which now does.",1543622645

What helps me is to:

1.) Break down tasks into manageable pieces.
This is going to look different for all of us, but putting the scope of the project on paper can help one wrap their brain around it.

2.) Make the steps novel, add some fun into it! I *think* it's normal for ADHDers to enjoy new things, it's very simulating you know? So add challenges to what you are doing, but be realistic when setting them. Did the dishes in 30 minutes last night? Bet you could do it in 20 tonight, you champ.

3.) Be content with knowing your brain is different, and grow wiser in learning how to run it. Or to put t frankly: don't beat yourself up over failures.

I think the solution to pay-to-win elections lies in campaign finance reform, and while voting is a related issue, it's separate. In 11 out of the last 15 elections the biggest spender won so it's not likely to exacerbate the issue.",1543622646

When Republicans fight their subpoenas in court they‚Äôll howl ‚Äúwhat do you mean I have to appear?  Whatabout Comey!?!?!‚Äù.  Then they‚Äôll argue that they can appear but only if they don‚Äôt have to answer questions about daddy trump.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean I can‚Äôt dictate the terms of my own hearing!?!

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F or W, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or #**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagor4r/submit?sidebar&amp;amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;There are people who cannot focus on someone else, because they are ugly or have some issue that causes them to not be desirable for marriage, such as being poor.

There are a lot of so called ugly people who are married, the same with poor.

&gt; Many women would have sex casually with someone with less concern about overall attractiveness than if she was forced to consider him for life, since one has to wait for marriage and all.

Not me. Not any woman I know.

&gt;This means that they are stuck into sin, either they have a Christian community that gives them sex,

It wouldn't be a Christian community.

&gt;they find a prostitute, which in my opinion is worse in terms of sin than casual sex, or they burn with lust.

Both options (although I'm replacing Christian community with social community) are the same sin and have the same risks, so it doesn't matter.

&gt;and the sin will be considered worse than casual promiscuity. 

No it won't. It's still sex with someone you're not married to, same sin whether with one or multiple people.

&gt;Lust is permanent, at least until libido is decreased, for example menopause for women, in which case lust does decrease significantly,

When spouses love each other they don't lust (lust is considered in Christianity to be sexual want for one that one isn't married to and/or selfish sexual wants with no regard for one's partner or spouse).

&gt;It never 'goes' away. It can decrease in intensity however, which is what I think you were referring towards.

It can, in a loving marriage. You confuse lust with sexual desire for one's spouse.

&gt;Sexual rehab costs money, which is generally unaffordable for the poor, who generally have the problem of lust and not being able to attain sex.

Then I guess they ought to save up or find something else to concentrate on, talk to their spiritual adviser. You're basically saying that if someone can't get rehab for a coke addiction, give them free coke.

&gt;Jesus always helps you with sin, yes you cannot just say, I have no more, and not do anything, but he will never not help you with your sin. Jesus loves all and wants to help everyone.

We have to want help, and we have to be repentant for sins committed and not commit them with presumption.

&gt;Problem is rehab costs money, which the poor cannot afford, who are generally the ones suffering from not being able to satisfy their lust.

Maybe they ought to concentrate on making money to live. That's what we do as adults.

&gt;I think that it can wane, but I don't see it going away completely. Many people have lust for their entire lives, just as people live in sin for their entire lives.

It sounds like you have a problem.

&gt;However sadly many other Christians do have lust, this is the problem that I am trying to fix among Christianity.

By leading them to sin and ultimately out of communion with God in the end. Good job! I hope no one listens to you.

&gt;It is a difficult situation, you are not wrong, as I am not wrong. Honestly I would ask Jesus to fix this for those who suffer from it, as I'm sure you would too. 

You are wrong in telling people to commit sins. Your way won't fix anything. Also, not everyone is a raging nympho who would go nuts without sex. You make it sound like everyone is animalistic and needs to get it on with everyone. That's not reality. Humans are higher animals and thus we can control our sex drives, they do not need to rule us. In Christianity we work to control our passions not by indulging like a pagan hedonist but by discipline and prayer with the one God.",1543622647

However, almost every veteran of this sport (I‚Äôm 26 to clarify) says the same thing: almost everyone trains like pussies now. It‚Äôs insane because it‚Äôs totally true. 
Yes you can maintain your physique with what you said, and please, I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt train hard. But I would love to see the awareness thrown back into goddamn hard training. 

You know what I‚Äôm talking about. The kind of the training that makes you feel like an absolute killer, the kind of training that Arnold set a standard for, the kind of training that Tom Platz would approve of. Women didnt fuck with me until I gained 30 pounds of muscle.Those hot trainer bitches that fuck with select guys only...they send me nudes. I swear they can smell an animal when they meet me.

I'd tell the letter writer that this sounds like it's partly a spike of bad feelings, that I bet she feels better even now having let it all out, but that it's partly sincere. I'd also tell her that if she's no longer happy living in the city and working at glam jobs but being broke all the time, she doesn't have to anymore. Move to a smaller place where her money will go further. Plant a garden. Stop drinking (actually, whatever you do, cut back on the hooch). Get a job, not a career, not a passion, just a job, and be a Sunday painter/writer/whatever for the beauty of making art, not because it's your One True Purpose or will make you famous.

My dad has a saying, ""root, hog, or die."" It comes from the first European settlers in the Appalachians, who during winters could no longer afford to feed their pigs, but the pigs weren't big enough to slaughter. So they set them free, and told them to forage or die. And the hogs learned to dig for roots, and there are still wild pigs up there even now. I think the letter writer might do well to think like that--pick a place and a job and work it as hard as she can, without always thinking that upping sticks is the option she has in her back pocket. It's a big old world, and she's seen a lot of it. Maybe it's time for her to start staking her own claim.",1543622649

If we're at such a disadvantage in the game due to injury, talent, point spread, whatever, you don't play conservatively.  Mike McCarthy's decisions throughout the game were so conservative that the individual fuck ups throughout the 2nd half killed us.

Example A: Up 19-7 with 3:52 left.  We run the ball 3 times by Lacy and punt it right back.  We don't use the best player in the league to try to move the football.  At that point in the game and knowing how much we were apparently out-talented and their elite defense, despite having the best QB ever in TD-INT ratio, we needed more points.  He took the ball out of his best player's hands.

Example B: Fake Punt up 16-0 in the 3rd Quarter.  Up like that in the game with their offense doing nothing, you have to expect them to take risks.  They did and it got them on the board.

Example C and D, and probably the MOST important: Two back-to-back drives stalled at the ONE FUCKING YARD LINE.  TWICE, on 4th and Goal from the ONE with the BEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER IN THE GAME, we kick the fucking field goal.  Fun fact, score once from the 1 and you have the equivalent of TWO FIELD GOALS and the extra point.  Against a team which you had on the ropes and the defense playing great.  And if we didn't get it, FUCK IT, they're at the 1 and have to go the length of the field.  

I could go on.

TL;DR.  Mike McCarthy had a chance to step on their throat in the first quarter and ended up losing to a QB who had a 44.3 QB rating.  He lost that game because he isn't innovative, is too conservative, and, frankly, just isn't a great coach without top 2 ALL TIME Quarterback level play spraying Febreeze all over the stink of his playcalling and intra-game decisions.

Since that game and exemplified in the article, McCarthy has drastically underperformed despite elite QB play, not adjusted to his personnel, has not challenged Rodgers, and has not modified his offense for today's game -- so much so that his playcalling cannot beat man coverage.  He is stale and needs to go.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC478945/

On mobile so sorry for formatting, but TL;DR is this:  

The suicide rates in the UK in the 60s was 16 per 100,000.  The majority of suicides were caused by people turning on coal stoves, locking themselves in and asphyxiating on carbon monoxide.  In the late 60s coal gas was replaced by natural gas due in large part to reduced prices of natural gas and government intervention.  The suicide rate plummeted over 5 years to about 8%.  Suicide by other methods stayed roughly the same.  

The suicide rate in the UK has never reached the suicide rate in the early 60s.  It‚Äôs pretty close today at 15, but that‚Äôs roughly what the global suicide rate is, whereas in the 60s UK Was almost double.

If we banned guns and did a buyback like Australia, we would likely see the suicide rate plummet.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs feasible.  If we just reduced the accessibility of those at risk for suicide, we would likely still see a drop, and it would give us an opportunity to provide help to those who need it.

I also request either the first or last appointment of the day so that I can go before or after work. Sometimes that's not possible and I have to take the available time slot, but I'll go on my lunch break if I have to. 

When I say doctors appointment, I mean ante natal with my midwife, which according to my company policy, and the law, I am entitled to attend during working hours as it's a necessary appointment to ensure that myself and baby are both healthy.

I have co workers who take time off work to take their children to the dentist, or take a day off because their child is sick and they can't arrange a baby sitter at short notice. I never complain when my co workers do this because I understand that life is unpredictable and stuff inevitably comes up. My department manager skipped out of work and had a half day one afternoon because he had parents evening for his child. He let us know that he was doing this the morning of his appointment, when surely he would be aware of parents evening well in advance. Hes also booked 2 days off over Christmas, which we are not supposed to do, and hasnt advised anyone that he was doing that or checked with the team, which everyone else does before booking holiday. 

Why am I not entitled to use my holiday, but he is ok to skip work without notice and book holidays without checking with the team first?

I'm doing the company a favour using my holiday when I'm actually entitled by law to go to ante natal appointments on company time. I use my holiday because I don't want my co workers to suffer when we're already short staffed. Yet I still get told by the manager that I'm not entitled to use my holiday, even if i book it in advance. I have never witnessed him behave that way with another employee. As stated in my post, he even allowed 2 other members of staff to take the same week off, leaving me to struggle with the workload of an entire department (covering 5 people's jobs). 

Other members of staff have even approached me to say that they have noticed he has been acting petty towards me lately and it's demoralizing. ",1543622651

* (**Rule #1**) All posts must be wholesome memes.    
We're not saying this is **un**wholesome! Just that sub's focus is *uplifting*, OR nicing-up existing rude memes. There are already great subs for cute (/r/aww, /r/eyebleach, /r/rarepuppers), things that make us smile (/r/MadeMeSmile, /r/HumansBeingBros, /r/AnimalsBeingBros), or that give us the feels (/r/WholesomeFeels or /r/baww). This might also fit better in another sub in the Wholesome Network (see sidebar).  It's not a ""no"" - it's a ""not the best fit here,"" and another sub will be better.

We appreciate you thinking of us very much! For more on our rules, please check out our [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/about/sidebar).

If only Friedgen was healthy enough to move and/or Godsey (starting QB in 2000 and 01, and backup to Heisman Runner-up Joe Hamilton in 1999, and 1998) had more experience calling plays, still not happy about O'Brien throwing him under the bus in Houston.

"learnpython","t5_2r8ot","&gt; I thought it would be somewhat simple. 

It is simple for someone experienced. Note that I don't mean that in a negative way, just most of the stuff you'd have to do is probably stuff you haven't done before if you're asking this question. So you'll have to learn a few different technologies and how to integrate them together. I think a newbie could do it, but it's going to take you a lot longer than a week or two.

&gt; I used to work at a data company and can tell you how companies are a joke at protecting data. I want it to be used by internal employees only.

While businesses often suck at protecting data, that doesn't mean you should, of course :). The reality is that it's not like particularly difficult to protect data in a circumstance like this, but it can be easy to accidentally expose stuff. 

&gt; With each staff member in our office contacting these companies I want to be able to have them see the previous logs and history.

How? Like are they going to be typing terminal commands? Or are you going to be building a web UI? Or a desktop UI? Does it have to be cross-platform? Etc.

---

You could also consider some simple non-programming solutions for this. E.g. just have a Google Sheets of all the logs, make it read only for people to lookup previous data and not mess it up, and create a Google Form whenever they want to add to it. Alternatively, you could use Excel to store the data and SharePoint to create an intranet site to add data and look up data. ",1543622656

Look I get it. We get treated like shit and we deserve better pay. But this isn't how it's going to happen. This isn't even a plausible suggestion, it's just naive.

ETA: I deleted the dupe check in `addToFiles` (now `processFile`) because you should never see dupes while walking, and if you want to dedup your user inputs, you should do that before it gets there, rather than doing an expensive search across the whole files slice (which doesn't exist in this patch anyway).

Being graded as a 95 is more important than being ranked the X player in your class, because the grades can show the perceived difference between two players, while the ranking just shows the # of players ranked between two players (or, if looking at only one player, it can show how elite or close to elite they are, vs. how many other players are rated similarly or better in that specific class).

The player *ranking* is **determined** by the player *rating*. The rating is the cause, the ranking is the effect. The fact that the rating provides a more complete sense of how different players compare (in the eyes of the recruiting website's scouts) only further emphasizes it's greater importance.",1543622659

I try my best to spread out news sources; reddit is great bc itll give links to a variety of sources, NBC is free and has videos, WAPO and NYT gave me a month free (being a google guide gave me 3 more months free for NYT just for a picture or two at state parks), and this new app I got smart news gives a crazy variety but I like it the least.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","Rey went from looking for a father figure and kind of accepting her destiny to literally face her fear of being a nobody, just like her uncaring parents, and still choosing to fight for her friends and her beliefs.

Finn went from a coward that acted very selfishly most of the time to almost sacrificing himself to beat his worst fear.

Poe went from hotshot to leader in the second most developed arc in the movie. He was demoted and threw a tantrum because he wasn't chosen to lead after Leia was incapacitated, you can see it in his face. Then he goes and faces the new leader like he deserves any kind of special treatment, stages a secret mission and mutiny that literally get most of the Resistance killed because his infiltration plan brought up a person that explicitly told the enemy what the plan was. Holdo was right and even compassionate considering she sacrifices herself for him and the remnants of the Resistance.

The fact that Finn and Rose didn't have any chemistry IS why her character was developed in the first place, you send Poe with Finn and they just hace the same perspective, no conflict to build upon.

Your last argument about what Finn thinks in TFA and TLJ holds some water that merits further discussion but, in your own words, everything else is a matter of opinion. You find the movie boring or maybe not concrete enough, and that's perfectly fine, I get you.

Seriously, 6.0 was the best example of what happens when design and development has long lost any form of direction. It's simply a matter of keeping it alive with as little effort as possible and making sure it earns some cash before they're gonna bury it once and for all (which, I suppose, is going to happen within the next 2 years).

Aion EU has been p2w for quite a while, Aion KR became p2w with 6.0. The transformation is now complete.

It was once a fun game, until 3.x, it was great, 4.x was fine until they started to rip out stuff without reason, or trying to make up reasons out of silly and unbelievable lore.

I quit with Signia, I skipped 5.0 completely, because of sillyness all over the place. I tried to come back with 6.2 to find ""the Aion we always wanted"" (according to GF).

A lot of other state also are in heavy debt. The Utah legislature will not end a session without a balanced budget. So that means if you want to increase the funding for the department of transportation to do this road project that money will be cut from something else. What it gets cut from will probably be health or education spending. You are way oversimplifying the issue.

I bet any amount of money the ""PC masterrace"" a long with you would be whining and bitching about why is it taking so long. You do understand we have been patiently waiting for part one and PC is about to get part 2. Dont forget xbox and Sony players also contribute tons of money towards this game which in turn allows de more opportunity to create more content for PC players along with us. The fact is, PC is about to get part 2 and we were promised part 1 before the end of the year. This makes me worry. They are focused on pc and forget about us console folk. We were promised threads and updates and have received a few words, a sentence or 2. We always hear, it's coming and then silence. How would PC enjoy that? PC players get content and then a week later complain they need more. Meanwhile we sit 2 months behind. Imagine our content drought. Stop being so self absorbed and think about the other tenno that spend money on this wonderful game.

&gt;During her Liberal Party preselection for the Victorian seat of Chisholm, one female preselector had asked Banks, a mother of two, who would mind her children while she was in Canberra when Parliament sat. When she explained that they were adults in their late teens, the Liberal preselector then wanted to know how old she was. Implication: if you're a woman with kids, you're either too young or too old to be a Member of Parliament. Banks is 56.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;At the first fundraising event of her campaign, she was told who would be making speeches. There were two male officials listed, state president Michael Kroger and an obscure local branch official. She wasn't on the list. ""I'm the candidate; shouldn't I make a speech?""

&gt;""Don't you worry about that darling,"" said the local official. ""We'll give you the raffle.""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The new Prime Minister tried to mollify Banks. ""Julia, we can get you away from all this, we're going to send you to New York"" on a three-month, all-expenses paid parliamentary fellowship at the UN, said Morrison. She declined, sensing an effort to buy her silence. Morrison then offered to organise a parliamentary ""pair"" so she could take leave. ""I'm not sick,"" was her blunt rejoinder. But at no point, after her August public outburst at bullying and intimidation, did anyone in the party or the government ask her about her experience.

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","When I was a child my older sister used to read me all sorts of fairytales and tell me stories about witches and fairies and trolls and other magical creatures. Like most children I didn‚Äôt really question their existence much and I think in the back of my mind they were a bit like mythological figures that maybe existed somewhere else or had existed in the past. I feel very similarly about Father Xmas. He wasn‚Äôt a big deal in my house but the stories about him were a lot of fun (my father always used to tell us about the time he was little and woke up in the middle of the night hearing noises and saw just a corner of Father Xmas‚Äôd sled from the window as he flew away) and part of the Xmas atmosphere. Father Xmas only bought little stocking presents or one present and other people got the rest so the whole aspect of being good or bad never factored into it. The same was for another similar figure which is more common in my country who brings presents and sweets on January 6th. 
I just remember having so much fun sneaking into my brothers‚Äôs room and coming up with crazy plans to catch one of them in the act of filling our stockings, just as we made crazy plans to go into the woods when we went to the Dolomites in the spring to catch the fairies that lived there. It was just part of the magic of being a child. 
So I hope to create a similar environment for my children growing up. 
I really dislike the whole ‚Äúpictures with Santa‚Äù thing (it doesn‚Äôt exist in my country) and I think it takes away from the mystery. I also think it‚Äôs creepy to force your kid to sit on some random person‚Äôs lap. I also don‚Äôt like the reward/punishment aspect of it or the elf thing which is even weirder. Personally to me father Xmas is just a part of Xmas folklore and I don‚Äôt see the point of making a big deal of it one way or another or to micromanage what other people and relatives say about it.

"bestofstc","t5_s0yuz","Btw I didn't mean, why are you here (Botania), I was referring to what Luke says to Rey, about *her*.

Literally, I mean what is her purpose as a character in the story? It doesn't seem to be about choosing for herself what her 'orientation' will be as a character, since she seems to have very limited options, and had been set on a direction by all the circumstance and people around her. She literally gets in a space-coffin and flies into the enemy because oooh dark space prince bet he can be turned. 
I dunno, perhaps she sees the future, but then is gutted when the future comes true as she sees it, but it needed to happen anyway, which makes her and all characters fated according to the rules of seeing the future. 

Or perhaps she's a horny space young adult. I can no longer tell.

Leia, on the other hand, seems to have ALL the options at her disposal (the plot opens Leia up to be a pansexual space princess with huge following) and seems like she is putting a lot of pressure on Rey to conform to her expectations of Rey's usefulness.

Of course the backdrop is a giant space Death laser, but that then means it is ""listen to old ladies or the giant space laser will get you!"". That's a quite cheap motivation.

So, is that the advice of The Last Jedi? Young people should listen to old ladies and shape their lives around them? Disney's track record for young women in films is usually marry prince or defeat old lady. Usually both.
So, what's changed this time? Or will it be all set according to Disney tradition by the time of the third movie?",1543622670

But like feeling down after a shitty day at work? Turn it into something positive. For example, I‚Äôm a musician. When I‚Äôm feeling down I love playing my piano, it‚Äôs almost therapeutic sometimes. I know artists who paint and draw too.

"canberra","t5_2r584","Well, I think that‚Äôs the question. Does cutting a school run mean the school has to run their own bus? Or does it simply mean that those students are using a regular bus route instead?

For example, Radford College has specifically raised concerns about [one school route they have today that goes from the school to Woden Bus Station](https://www.transport.act.gov.au/getting-around/getting-to-school/school_services_by_school_name?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZmaWxlcy50cmFuc3BvcnQuYWN0Lmdvdi5hdSUyRnNjaG9vbHNfMjAxNzEwMDklMkZzY2hvb2xfcGRmcyUyRlJvdXRlNDYwLnBkZiZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D). Students travelling from Radford go Woden could already use a Blue Rapid Service today, and will be able to use a [Rapid 4 service in the new network](https://www.transport.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1262464/Route-Map-R4.pdf), which will run much more frequently than any school bus.

So why does the school need to provide their own bus at all? If we‚Äôre talking about efficiency, the best option would seem to be using the public routes that already serve the school - especially in this case where the school is on one of the busiest bus corridors in the city.

Incidentally, here‚Äôs the full details of all the different buses that [travel to Radford College in the new network](https://www.transport.act.gov.au/getting-around/new-network/schools/radford-college).

"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","TIny's burst damage and forced repositioning are the 2 most annoying things about him. His right side is the throwing side so always always always remember that for the most effective use of your w. I've gotten kills where I walked up to the enemy who got caught in a slightly poor position and tossed him into my tower and follow up with q, all while his creeps were outside tower range. Blink dagger, bottle and boots are all you really need on him since the only rune he can't abuse to the max is illusion, given the fact that he has no fucking agi gain. haste, invi and arcane allow you to maximise your combo, DD gives you massive damage, regen gives you the full heal you need once in a while.   


The way I like to play tiny is to target the back lines since these heroes tend to be the easiest kills. I'll position myself between the fight and the enemy who's an easy kill and just wait for them to initiate. If no one initiates, I'll jump in, get the kill and go for an objective if I have team nearby. If not, I would have forced a rotation that opened up a gank on another enemy. The other way is to toss enemy heroes who are low but have no escape skill back into your teammate, essentially just giving them the kill/exp for the kill. Furthermore, gold gained in fights are not just from 1 person getting the kill but whoever else was present when the particular enemy was killed. I like to throw low hp targets back to my team because it's a massive gold boost for the team as a whole, going up to 3k gold off a kill. It's minor things like these that helps you win games overall.",1543622670

""Antidepressants"" including SRIs, SNRIs, NRIs and NDRIs. Cocaine is an SNDRI. Serotonin‚ÄìNorepinephrine‚ÄìDopamine reuptake inhibitor.

The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.

For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.

Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.

GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label."" (if you wondering why it's 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn't include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide.

Enchanters, in their current form, have bland kits and add too much to the bot lane doing very little.

ADC balance is affected in such a way that they cannot be buffed overall, as Enchanters would make them too powerful. That extends to other lanes, to a lesser degree. See Ardent Censer patch and the almost 60% winrate Janna.

Supports should be 1/5 of the team in any game, not an ADC/champion stat stick. That would lead, not only to better balance and better itemization, but to make people more excited about playing Support.",1543622671

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","&gt;So in short by your arguments, virtually any ""fair"" tax cut can be argued as regressive since the bulk of the taxes are being paid by the rich anyway. Technically you could probably cut middle class (3rd or 4th quintile) taxes by 20-10% and the upper by 5% and someone would still call it regressive due to the difference in total dollars. 

Yes, that's a good summary

&gt; I see your point there, though that doesn't really address the notion why we should be cutting taxes at all, especially after hearing your dire assessment of the current debt situation. I don't know if I have the experience to get into a debate about supply-side economics so maybe we leave that one at that.

We aren't really cutting taxes much, we're dicking around with less than a percentage point of GDP in a way that will make little long term change one way or the other to the big financial picture.  This has nothing to do with supply side economics.   


&gt;The chart you shared... I'm assuming that includes social security and medicare and because those have separate funding mechanisms (which again is a whole other discussion) the chart doesn't really show an accurate picture of government spending. 

No, you don't and yes they do.  SS and medicare are part of government spending.  SS is mostly paid for with a dedicated tax, but that changes nothing.  Medicare doesn't even [come close](https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/7615-04-figure-29.png) to getting paid for with its tax.  but even if that weren't the case, the US government is one financial entity. you cannot consider the parts in isolation.  Any one program the US has is affordable, the problem is that all of them together are not.  

&gt;again would support raising taxes on anyone it took to make it happen. 

That's not an option.   There isn't enough money to pay for the current programs, much less massive expansions of them.

&gt;Moving back to an earlier discussion, while we historically have stuck to income as opposed to consumption taxes, that doesn't mean we can't find other ways of generating income that is progressive in nature. 

Again, US taxes are already the most progressive in the world.  Consumption taxes are vastly more regressive.


&gt;I mean, just look at estate taxes and the rollback on those since HW Bush, you can't tell me with a straight face that is somehow not regressive, and obviously just the wealthy protecting their assets.

It's not regressive, its just meaningless.  the estate tax raises a tiny amount of money, and did before the recent reforms.  it's symbolic, and always has been.   

&gt;What's your assessment of the situation in the 90's, when we were running surpluses and on track to get the debt handled? Was it the tag team of defense cuts and entitlement rollbacks that was the kicker? 

There were no entitlement rollbacks.  there was a small reduction in spending on welfare, but mostly it was flat defense spending combined with an enormous increase in tax revenue thanks to the dot com boom.   The fundamentals were still rotten, the day of reckoning was just further away.  ",1543622672

Kingkiller is a very intricate story, Rothfuss is a perfectionist, and he suffers from depression. Unless he says he isn't planning on finishing it, I'm sure he's working on it as he can. 

While writing my dissertation, I dealt with anxiety from a medicine I was on &amp; I could not work on it. I would go months and months without being able to even sit down and look at it and then I'd have days where writing went great but slow. So I totally respect and support him, regardless of how long it takes. Having experienced writer's block on a project that involved other people putting pressure on me regarding its timeline, I am sure he wants it to be finished even more than we want it to be finished.

I'd rather a third book in twenty years that is the book he wants it to be than one he pushes out due to pressure to publish and just get it done.

"PhantomForces","t5_378hb","I'd swap an angled for the vertical, since you're going to want to be aiming when using the Vector. Vertical just makes aimed fire worse, and the Vector wasn't designed to be good at hipfiring.

HP still works great on it. Its bumped up base of 42 damage still gives a 3-shot torso (42 x .8 = 33.6), and it allows a 2-shot head (42 x 1.4 = 58.8). The min damage penalty isn't *that* important, because the Vector's min range damage is already bad and its recoil/ROF allow you to get accurate fire out really quickly. Its an SMG, so the point isn't to go toe to toe with bigger guns at medium range anyways.
 
If suppressors are your thing, the Osprey is the best for it since it retains max damage. I just don't see the use of it because it isn't a loud gun in the first place and a compensator allows you to make horizontal recoil minimal.",1543622680

This leads to isolation and almost certainly to the loss of social and career opportunities.

You put on a helm and watch their back, it's such a waste of time. I just did that today, I was watching someone do a Demons Souls Faith run and the video was 45min and I didn't know how, well because more than 30 was spent making the face and then of course they play every cutscene, and finally the 8 minutes before reaching the Nexus. I hate when people play all the cutscenes too. If I streamed I'd skip them because 1.) I want you to enjoy watching me PLAY THE GAME and 2.) I don't want to spoil the story, you can watch me play but if I never talk to anyone or watch cutscenes it motivates you to play the game. My opinion though",1543622681

"OldSchoolCool","t5_2tycb","&gt;Did she only get so much attention because she always had her clothes off? 

Are you confusing Marilyn with someone else? Because while she often wore revealing clothes, Marilyn rarely was fully nude. She did one nude calendar shoot for rent money before she was famous, and did a nude scene for her last movie *The Misfits* (which ended up getting cut, because the studio was too scared to be the first major American movie with a nude scene).

What was different about Marilyn was she wasn't embarrassed about the nude calendar shoot, nor tried to deny it (which the studio begged her to do). She shrugged it off as no big deal. In the 50's, this could have been a career ending scandal. 

Marilyn became popular in part because was so pretty and had an ass like a Christmas ham, but also because she was good at playing the 'dumb blonde', actually was a decent actress, knew how to how to work the camera and the press, and appealed equally to men and women at the time. Sure, her sex appeal was why she became so huge, but sex appeal =/= always being nude.

People may be upset about it but if you tell them what they need to do to keep that animal correctly and they refuse then they don‚Äôt get it. My store has definitely banned people from buying anything alive and have reported them to other pet stores around the area for being horrible. 
My advice is check out the place you want to work and get a feel for it. And if they are doing something not great like not maintaining proper humidity try to teach your coworkers with passion and not by being a jerk, it helps.

Suicide is CHEATING YOURSELF OUT OF WHAT YOU DESERVE. Suicide is the ultimate expression of self-hatred. What you need is what most people lack - a physiological understanding of how and why we form emotions, moods, habits and personality traits. LIVING IN THE PAST WILL KILL YOU. LIVING IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE WILL SAVE YOU. We are who we think we are. If you think you are the subjective memory of yourself at your worst, then that is how you will think, producing emotions from hormones to reinforce that perceived version of yourself, which translates to higher and higher sustained levels of cortisol that literally destroy the body if the memory is relived enough.

We are designed with the ability to create ourselves through gene expression (Dr Joe Dispenza *How to Break the Habit of Being Yourself*). We are creators, made in the image of God. You can recreate yourself an infinite number of times, but not if you scrap yourself.

And I'm getting this solely with the expectation that they'll only use it as a Spotify machine in their kitchen, which is why it's coming with a subscription to that. Yet I still worry that it'll just sit there because they're so damn afraid of not understanding how to use technology that they never bother to learn. Just getting to Netflix on the Roku still confuses them, even though it's the first thing they have to select when they switch over to it. It's like there's a mental block that makes them unable to just look at the screen and read what they're seeing.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","So, 682's regeneration actually works heaps like Wolverine's does. Because of that, if you just inject someone with its blood, likely all that'd happen is you'd poison them. But that's fine, I assume you're a researcher with a few dozen D-class to throw at the issue.

So to achieve your result, what you'd want to do is get a blood sample of 682, then destroy the rest of its biomass as you inject it into the subject, leaving the sample the largest viable portion of 682's body. For a few reasons, this has never been done before, so it's a bit of a strange one. However, another experiment was done on splitting 682 exactly in half. It regenerated into two 682s, one of which eventually absorbed the other, after dealing great damage to the site they were in.

Which all brings me to the rather unfortunate fact that 682's main goal seems to be escaping whatever containment it's in (Currently site 19 I believe) and rampaging as long as it can. As such, I see this experiment going one of three basic routes. I'll start with boring first.

First, it could just poison the D-class, killing them painfully over a few hours, after which blood will leak from every orifice and reconstitute into a tiny, but *very* angry 682. Now, on to the more body-horror options.

Ever see the movie The Thing? 682's goal of escape would possibly cause its adaptation to a human body to be taking over said human body, one cell at a time. Once it gained enough control, it'd naturally try to use its shapeshifting abilities to escape, and likely be very successful if the experimenter was foolish enough to keep the subject in the D-class dorms, rather than 682's normal containment, outfitted for human habitation. Of course, once it had escaped it'd likely revert itself to its normal form, as it finds us repulsive at a basic level, which might be enough to even preclude this option, as even though it could do this, it might refuse, bringing me to my final thought-through possibility, also a movie tie-in.

682 might regenerate to a smaller form *within* its new human host, in a way that'd conceal it while it regained its strength. Once fully formed, it'd tear its way out of its impromptu womb, furthering its murder endgame by one kill, and thoroughly freaking out any personnel around to witness it. It'd likely have adapted in this scenario to be undetectable via X-ray or other modern techniques, allowing it to do so after the D-class had returned to the dorms, with researchers thinking maybe they'd finally killed that damn lizard. Of course, when the klaxons sounded and the cacophony of screams and rending steel reached their ears, they'd know what had happened pretty quickly.",1543622683

I‚Äôm saying that the narrative of ‚ÄòDems are doing individual voter fraud‚Äô predates and inspired this example of GOP political actors falsifying hundreds of absentee ballots. 

It seems to me like you are claiming that GOP has been committing one of the stupidest crimes imaginable, that necessitates the falsifying of hundreds, thousands of ballots to be effective **for years** and has someone evaded being caught all these years.

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","To be clear, I'm not at all saying JJ is a weak series - it's almost as good as DD, but if you rank them, I think DD is still the leader. 

Kilgrave as a villain just isn't enough to keep it interesting. Kristen and David give solid performances of that dynamic, but the singular focus on Kilgrave through the first season got dull. 

A better approach might have been to use Kilgrave as a Moriarty character - rather than putting him front and centre and having the two constantly interact. 

They could have had Jessica focus on being a private investigator for at least the first few episodes, and really nail down how her character and abilities make her interesting. Then do the slow reveal that Kilgrave is the man behind the men behind the crimes: the common thread. Then spend the last half of the first season doing Kilgrave-chasing stuff: it wouldn't have got as old as quickly that way. 

JJ is better than all the rest at engaging with controversial topics and providing solid commentary/reflection. The assault/rape themes are uncomfortable but engaging and pointed and poignant. It elevates the whole show beyond just a fun superhero fling. That said, when the show turns it on, it's pretty blunt about it - and when they turn it off - it's conspicuously absent. I realize I'm asking a lot here, to walk the tightrope, but ideally they could do more with the strong/adult themes while also doing more of ""show, don't tell"". 

Also just a personal nitpick, but while David does an excellent job with Kilgrave, it's ~impossible to escape him being Doctor Who: and I'm not even a Whovian. And while that sucks for David's career, it affects the show here when it just feels like Doctor Who is assaulting/killing/mind-raping people. 

So while they did a great job of defining the character of Jessica, and she's easily the most likable Marvel Netflix star - both in writing and Kirsten's performance - it's the multi-episode/season plot arcs that I had in mind when I said the writing was weak.  The scene writing is good.

By complexity, it could have benefited from some secondary antagonist - maybe an expendable villain that Kilgrave can kill to get Jessica's full attention for the final few episodes (demonstrating his obsessive behaviour).

Since that would bump a lot of the content in S1, it would let them compress it into the start of S2: which would serve to both improve the quality of the S1 B-stories (they'd have to cull the weaker scenes), and it would help accelerate S2 which started off a little too slow and disengaged from S1 (it felt like they tied a bow on S1 plots, unsure if they'd get an S2, then started on a fresh series in S2 - where better continuity would have dragged S1 B-stories into S2 as stitching).

Sure, I wasn't saying SF had maximized yet. I don't think anyone reasonably thinks we're even close to solving chess. I was just pointing out that the 25 losses are not actual evidence of non-optimal play.

&gt; What this suggests is that Stockfish 10 still has quite a large area to improve before it can close the loss gap between Leela.

Do you think SF still has a long time to go at the top or are the NNs going to win soon? On the one hand NNs get better just by throwing more training at them. On the other hand I imagine SF devs are getting new ideas on what to tweak based on the SF vs NN games.",1543622692

"anime","t5_2qh22","The tale of the tape for the four matchups today contains all you need to know. **Saitama vs Oshino Meme** and **Nishimiya Shouko vs Shouya Ishida** were predicted to be blowouts and blowouts they were. **Alphonse** and **Mio Akiyama** were predicted to pose some sort of a threat but not quite win and that is also exactly what happened. Let's have a look at each match in depth:

**Megumin (1) vs Alphonse (32)**

This pitched two of the strongest characters in the entire competition together as early as round 5. **Alphonse** has been extremely underseeded at 32nd for the whole tournament. His track record going into round 5 puts him amongst the top 10 out of *all characters*. Meanwhile **Megumin** hasn't shown any reason to not be the number 1 seed, posting stronger numbers than Alphonse in almost every round. No doubt about it, Alphonse winning would have been a huge upset; but he was expected to challenge Megumin, and that's exactly what he did. **Megumin** proved victorious in the end by a slender, but comfortable **216 votes**. This matchup gathered **3030 votes** making it the **2nd most voted matchup of the entire competition** (after Megumin vs Sakura Chiyo in round 3).

**Saber (17) vs Mio Akiyama (80)**

Perhaps the most surprising result of the round. Judging from past rounds it's clear Saber was expected to win this matchup, and fairly comfortably too, however this was not a comfrotable victory at all for the Fate character as she won out by a mere **38 votes**. Looking at the number of votes for this round compared to round 4 it's clear that a significant number of voters switched their allegiance from Saber to Mio, however this was all in vain in the end. 

**Saitama (8) vs Oshino Meme (25)**

**Saitama** has outperformed **Oshino** every single round so far, and this round was no exception. A relatively comfortable victory for the most powerful hero puts him into round 6 as the most backed character in bracket A.

**Nishimiya Shouko (9) vs Shouya Ishida (24)**

The Koe no Katachi royal rumble saw, as expected a one sided victory for **Nishimiya Shouko**. Whilst not having the largest fanbase out of all characters in the competition, Nishimiya Shouko is proving to be quite a threat in bracket A. She boasts the **most dominant victory** for round 5 of bracket A, though granted this matchup was the **least voted** of the round. This makes sense as both characters were from the same movie.

Just look at how they have no regard for aim when considering the strengths of heroes. They have Moira who is meant to be forced to use her autolock beam as a way to charge her healing, but this gives her HP regen and is extremely effective vs squishy DPS and even goes through Genji's deflect.

I try to go for healers because half the time they are so focused on healing that getting  attacked by a Murky isn't very troubling. In general people normally prioritize threats in team fights, so I can be effective by them ignoring me until its too late.

I usually hid until I find my target and rush in mounted, slime, and run away until my next slime is ready. You do this until they're health is a little lower, but they think that is all you have. Then you must go balls to the wall with auto attacks, slimes, and avoiding damage by side stepping, and timing those bubbles.

March I use in tight as possible spaces, usually almost in the middle of team fights faced in the direction where the enemy will flee. If my team is not doing well in a fight I use it to make sure my team can escape or turn the fight around.

For teamfights, after level 13 start looking to see if you are needed. After level 20 you should be at every team fight unless your team is doing well as four man then continue to lane.",1543622694

Since Hellsing is an official Government agency in Alucard's universe, there would reasonably be a way to get in contact with Integra, who would certainly be curious about her pet vampire's seeking out a specific individual for whatever reason.  She may outright provide information Harry would need to properly remove Alucard from existence, if she determined it was for the best for mankind.

Based on the actual bindings on Alucard's seals and sigils, it seems fair to say that Harry's magic circle based magic would be unaffected by the difference in universes, especially given that both universes mention circles and seals as dealing with levels of control, which is why Alucard has to basically go through a menu a la ""release restraint level x"".  

With all of this, Harry has reasonable expectations of the following information to act on, without reaching out to any of his more personal info sources:

    The vampire seeking him is renowned as being incredibly powerful, even despite his power being locked behind restrictions(a situation Harry is intimately familiar with)

    The vampire is reasonably caught up with modern society and inventions.

    The vampire is in fact the alternate reality version of a Vampire that was already killed in his universe, one whose capabilities were vast enough that the White Council of Wizards and White Court of Vampires went out of their way to make his weaknesses known enough that all vampiric progeny based on him went near extinct worldwide.

There are methods which can lock down Alucard, built into his bindings by the original Hellsing, such that he will be unable to move or act.


All of this information leads up to how Harry prepares for the encounter.  He looks into how to activate the bindings against Alucard's will, with the intent to trap him and transport him into a holding cell below Demonreach, which is more than capable of holding beings on par with Alucard's power level.  

Depending on how Harry first learns that Alucard is coming to him, he may be able to prepare the battlefield as well.  If he knows that Alucard is coming for him specifically, he will setup the fight in an area that is remote and away from potential collateral damage like people dying.  He will also setup distractions and traps which are effective against vampires(admittedly probably less effective toward Alucard than the other vampires in Dresdenverse), and may also sneak in a hidden magic circle to trap Alucard as a backup plan.

If Harry knows Alucard is trying to Suicide by Wizard, he may try to bring in 1 of the Swords of the Cross he is custodian to.  He currently possesses the Sword of Christ's Love and the Sword of Christ's Faith.  In his own words, ""weilded in true love/in the name of honor and faith, these swords allow one to combat their enemies on an even playing field"".  If an opponent has an incredible strength advantage, the Swords nullify it; they will likewise ensure that any speed differences will also be reduced to nearly identical levels.  The main issue with using these is that first line; they must be wielded in a worthy cause.  Harry would need to find a reason either of those restrictions could reasonably apply to this fight, so unless he could find someone who has a personal reason to fight Alucard and could meet those conditions, they're probably out. 

Soulfire is an interesting power, but honestly, apart from making his spells stronger, doesn't do much here.  Most of the aspects that it would apply to, such as breaking through/ignoring magical resistances, don't matter versus Alucard.  He isn't immune to magic, just tanky/fast enough to not care usually.  Dresden will still probably use it, because ""free"" power boosts are almost never declined, and the more damage he does will have an impact on Alucard by eating through his blood pool. 

How this all ends up playing out, probably, isn't what either party expects.

They'll square off, ready to fight, and then suddenly catch each other's eye, beginning a Soul Gaze.  Harry will see that Alucard never wanted to be a monster, and has spent multiple centuries destroying them in the name of the Hellsing Organization while searching for someone to end his existence. Alucard, on the other hand, will see Harry for what he is, a human bound and determined to preserve life because that is what Magic is intended for, and that he will go to any length to stop monsters from hurting others, a trait shared by his favorite rival Anderson.  Given the descriptions we've gotten about how people have reacted to seeing Harry's soul laid bare, it's entirely possible Alucard will see some of the actual events Harry has gone through to defeat monsters.

When this infinitely long singular moment finally ends, a few situations may occur:

Alucard may fight much the same as he did with Anderson, in which case Harry would respond all the prep work and potentially squeak out a win by trapping him. 

Alternatively, Alucard, who came here to try to die, may just surrender and allow Harry to execute him, and Harry will indeed try to end him out of pity and respect.  I believe he could, but given his blood pool's depth it may take a while, but Harry isn't above mercy killing and will see it done right.  He may even try calling in McCoy see if the Blackstaff can do it quickly and painlessly.

Yet another alternative, Alucard offers Harry a job with Hellsing.  Integra probably wouldn't mind, but Harry would almost certainly decline.

Lastly, they may honestly both walk away.  Harry originally came to this fight to try to prevent this monstrous vampire from harming people, but Alucard is technically a hero in his own right.  Almost all of the blood in his pool is from soldiers at war or villains he killed.  Alucard may walk away because Harry would have to go all out to have a chance at killing him, and after that moment, would be less willing than he was previously, thus denying Alucard perhaps the best chance he has in modern times.

Nobody who's powerful is shying away from using force when they want to. The thing with the West is that they're capable of using economy instead of just guns.

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","Signs (or signifiers) are things like sentences, thoughts, words, but also paintings, movies, etc. Anything that can have a meaning.

Signifieds are the meanings of the sentences, thoughts, words, paintings, movies.

Referents are what signs signify, i.e., their meaning. Referents are not concepts.

This gets a bit tricky because we can talk about signifieds, but that is not a problem so long as we don't confuse (in our theory) what is signifying (e.g., the act of talking about the signified) and what the act of talking signifies (whatever it is that we are talking about).

Moving on.

Signs, do not have a determinate meaning in and of themselves. However, their meaning (i.e., what they signify) is NOT determined by culture. It is determined by context. Each sign has a function within a given context, and it is its function within a context that determines what the sign means.

But I have to say: all of this is structuralism. This could be anthropology or history 60 years ago. Study a culture: determine what its very rituals are, what they mean, what their function is within the society, etc. Or think of playing a video game: what is the role of the characters within the video game, what is the role of the different pieces of equipment? All of that is straight up structuralist analysis.

Post-structuralism comes in many flavors. Derrida agrees that the meaning of a sign is determined by its context. However, he challenges the idea that the context (or structure...) of a sign can ever be completely specified. But if the meaning of a sign is determined by its context, and the context of a sign can never be completely specified, then the meaning of a sign can never be completely specified. And that is a very hard idea to get one's head around.

The way they always addressed it was that yeah, Luther had a lot of valid points as the Church at the time was really mired in corrupt officials and politics. Even at the time, there were things in his 95 Theses that the Church did not deny. However, Luther's original goal was not to split from the Church, but rather reform it. Only when that didn't emerge as a possibility did Luther move forward with creating his own group of followers. The 95 Theses were primarily focused on the practice of selling indulgences, which was later reformed by the Church in later years (and something happening ""quickly"" in the Church could mean it takes 200 years). The Catholic Church still believes that it's the one true Christian Church and that it hopes that Protestants will see that the division between Catholics and Protestants isn't as great as it appears.

It's really cool that you know what an algorithm and a program is, but there's a lot more to this discussion than that. Some of us know about both tech and social issues, so your attempt to talk down to everyone who corrects you just falls flat.

I'm not surprised you don't care because this is ""days"" ago. You obviously can't focus on a discussion, or be respectful enough in a discussion, to put any serious thought into or learn from it. Yet another phenomenon that's too common in tech.",1543622698

"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","Dual, and more, WANs is an abomination (bear with me).  IP ""out of the box"" is not really designed to work with it unless a routing protocol is in place to control which link does what.  For example, when you set up a PC or whatever, you specify a ""default gateway"" which is where traffic is sent if no other route matches.  It is unlikely that you set up routing tables but they still exist and the default gateway or gateway of last resort is the final effort to get to a destination.  In most cases the only router is the link to the internet so all routes simply become the default gateway.

Now, your router also has to have routes on it (obvs!)  It too has a default gateway which is where it sends traffic when there are no more specific routes.  The default gateway for your internet router is of course your ISP's systems.

In your case, you have not one but \*TWO\* ISPs (greedy).  A system can only have one default gateway but you seem to have two.  Here is where it gets a bit freaky.  Instead of simply sending traffic out to the one route, some sort of traffic management system is needed to work out what to do.  This is generally known as ""policy based routing"" and can be seriously complicated.  Now that complication is my idea of fun and I've worked with them for years but it may not be yours.  I have one link at home and six at work.  My customers have various combinations of links.

So, you have two links.  How does your router decide which one to use?  There are generally two methods to decide whether a link is worth using at all:  Firstly, is the link up; and secondly, does the link pass traffic.  So does the system think a link is up because the ISP is responding and the second is usually tested by pinging something like Google's public DNS servers which are considered reliable.

I neglected to mention the third method - sod it - assume it is always working and throw traffic down the link regardless.

I am not trying to blind you with science but hopefully to get you to appreciate that IP routing can be quite tricky if you go off piste and it does not have any intelligence, no matter what a snake oil salesman tells you.  That said, you should get better service out of two links than one link.

For starters don't flail around!  DHCP either works or it doesn't and it simply gives an address to something, if you have a link then DHCP or address allocation is working.  Bridging is also unlikely to help - that turns two separate physical networks into one.  This can be handy for some things but probably not here.  To be fair, you have obviously done some research and done your best and I respect that.

You are using a Cisco router which is a good sign.  I am not familiar with it - I'm a pfSense fan for this sort of thing but it will probably be a decent device. 

So this is what I would do to start with, given that there are a huge number of variables:  Disconnect one of the links completely and run on the other one for a few days.  Then I'd switch the live link and test again.  Each of your links is more than enough for a household on its own - within reason.  This gives an idea of speed requirements for streaming:  [https://www.comparethemarket.com/broadband/content/broadband-for-streaming/](https://www.comparethemarket.com/broadband/content/broadband-for-streaming/) 

The idea is to try and break down the problem into smaller bits until the snag is found.  Incidentally I find that Cisco gear is often shipped with old firmware and if it is not too traumatic, then patching that may be a good idea. ",1543622703

The only way I see that working is if there is some insane/great show that you can ONLY get on this new stream service.  Like people get HBO only for Game of Thrones.

We got Hulu for HandMaiden's Tale basically but then I found some more shows I liked and kept it.

We distract, seek reassurance, self medicate, you name it. When in reality the only thing you have to remember is-

Your recovery starts outside of your comfort zone.

So try your best to get out there, but do it one mile at a time. And when you reach your destination, park your car, and sit there for a while. Breathe. When you realize that you‚Äôre perfectly fine, turn around and go home. Congratulate yourself and treat yourself with kindness especially after you accomplish these milestones! 

And then do it again the next day but try a mile farther.

I combine that with a quote from a gay Republican in ‚ÄúWest Wing,‚Äù who said that being gay didn‚Äôt have to be what defined him. 
My friends point was that, yes she is transgender and that will also be a part of who she is, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be everything she is. This is such a motivating concept for me personally. I want to be known as a great performer, as an intellectual, as a musician, as a writer. I want to be known for the things I aspire to do, not by some box people need to check off so they can file me neatly into a social group of people.

How does this apply to you? Blending in doesn‚Äôt have to be about what you look like, or what your identity is. It come from how you wear yourself. Is it valid to be trans and not want to be? Fucking ABSOLUTELY. But it doesn‚Äôt have to define you.",1543622705

- We had great progress with [Caves of Zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/caves-of-zircon)!

  digging through cave walls and dispatching fungi. What's interesting is not visible here: we dumped the idea of
  a straight port of Trystan's tutorial, instead we created a very simple ECS system for this game which works nicely!

  alternative color palettes which we have tried. It is not final yet, but we're getting there.
- There are also some things we improved in Zircon like component alignment: [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/515978944948994048/component-positioning.png)
  shows all the permutations of aligning components within and around other components.
- @Milo implemented *ellipse drawing* (thx, Milo!)
- Layers now can be cleared
- Input handling was upgraded a bit, now you can listen to specific `KeyCombination`s and individual keys as well
- @Geldrin created pixel art icons for the website. [Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205245036084985857/518217633393541140/unknown.png) you can see the scribe and the herald.

After all, most people (at least in the West) have had real exposure to Christianity, so don't get the 'law in your heart' thing. Wouldn't it be the loving thing to try and save them? 

True, it would be in *that* Christian's best interests to spread the gospel. But would it be best for the *most* people? What if a Super Dictator came to rule the world, and he loved and followed Christ. But he just could not get the people he ruled to believe and do the same, despite sharing the word with them.

The Shea Moisture African Black Soap contains a blend of essential oils, along with regular oil (palm kernel). And the Neutrogena Grapefruit Moisturier contains fragrance. I always recommend people with acne-prone skin to look for products that are fragrance-free (including essential oils), oil-free, and marketed as noncomedogenic. The CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser and CeraVe Moisturizing Cream are two solid alternatives that have a reputation for being very well-tolerated.

Having the old cast redub their roles wiht more experience would be an interesting thing to see. And they could fix some of the errors they made on the first go. 

I'd rather have a complete re-dub of Utena though. It's one of the most important 90's shows (alongside YYH, Trigun, Bebop, Outlaw star, Eva, Berserk and etc.), but it's the hardest for regular watchers to get into since they either have to go subbed, or track down a dub that has aged pretty badly.

Theoretically, you should be able to remove the nib and feed from one unit and insert it in another, but the 076 unit will not fit (comfortably) width-wise because its shoulders barely clears the cap. The 060 (the shortest and smallest) is what the Liliput uses, so you'll have no problem using those nibs. I'm unsure about the 018.",1543622707

You can listen to any YouTube video and record your actions of shielding, swinging a sword, shooting a blaster, and shooting a bow and arrow. You  can then replay that and try to recreate what you recorded while fighting a boss battle. The game is far from perfect but I hope others can enjoy it in the state it's currently in. With the early access release I've included 5 beatmaps as tutorials for using the different weapons and 8 beatmaps as Demos of what's possible to create in the game. There's no difficulty levels since I have no idea what the different difficulties would be, and I also have no friends that play VR so I couldn't really test out different experience levels. Hopefully if you play it you enjoy it! And please let me know what you think, positive or negative! I want to know how to make the game the best I possibly can.",1543622709

At level 20, you should have a full complement of abilities.  Play into the 20's to get the best idea of how each class plays.

When I first played, that's what I did.  I played every single class.  Went through at least the tutorial and probably the first 2 areas on average to get a feel of how the different classes play.  I then focused on the few that I plan to play long term.  The game is free to play and doesn't cost any money and you shouldn't need any at low levels.",1543622710

Instead of coming home, overthinking, and researching self help on the Internet, I listened to a great podcast on the way home, did a quick yoga session, ate a (fairly) healthy meal, and took a nice bath while listening to an album that I haven‚Äôt listened to in years! All stuff that makes me so happy. 

I‚Äôm not perfect and I never will be and that‚Äôs ok. But I can try harder the next day, or rest the next day if I need to. My support system is amazing and continues to grow. And now I know that therapy is there if I really need it.

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","Te commonality of flood stories actually propels it‚Äôs believability in my opinion. If this thing happened then it makes sense that it‚Äôs mythology would spread and be handed down - the differences prove that it wasn‚Äôt a conspired story, but rather an event that was remembered differently by different cultures/filtered through the lens of their beliefs and values.

It is hard to argue that a global flood didn‚Äôt happen. It is even beginning to become commonly held within the secular circles. I also don‚Äôt have any problems with interpreting the bible as a mythology that gradually comes into focus until it reaches a point in history. Think about the creation account, and the flood... Tower of Babel... but then all of a sudden you get to Abram... suddenly the narrative begins not to speak about vague stories but about one family. In a manner of 12 chapters or so you go from the creation of the universe to a man and his family. What follows are kingdoms and peoples - it becomes historical narrative... but ancient people valued truth differently than we do. Today people tend to want truth in the form of proof and verifiable data. Ancient people saw truth as something higher - there is truth in the narratives of the Old Testament that go beyond a list of facts. For a good contrast read the books of kingdoms (or kings) and then chronicles. One is lively and full of ‚Äúcolour‚Äù, the other reads more like the annals of kings.

My point is that these are good things to wrestle with, but Christianity is something for the heart and mind - usually our mind follows our heart. 

PS, I also want to emphasize that saying I believe the bible contains mythological components doesn‚Äôt mean I believe it isn‚Äôt true",1543622713

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I need to re-listen to that episode, in Dubner I trust.  But really though, some things in politics are deliberately misstated, and others are overly simplistic, and I think this one does lean more toward a deliberate misstatement, but also part of it is that it's been simplified to be an easy talking point.    

I hope that certain issues like this don't fully override what I would say the overarching goal of the left is, especially that of the progressive left.  There are crooked Dems, liberals are by no means exempt from politicians being in bed with big money interests, but generally the direction they want to go is to serve the regular people.  If you look at the congressional voting records, I think this principle would be reflected there.  Personally I feel that they could do a lot more, but I would rather move forward at a glacial pace than backwards at any pace.  I am unapologetically left-wing, but I'm also trying to stay grounded as much as one can these days, and part of that should be to be critical of my own kind when it's called for, and I hope I can stay true to that principle.

Now you've started using the 'j' word: justification. I try to avoid that word because I don't know enough about it other than that it comes up every time Protestants and Catholics argue, and up until recently there were a few schools of throught: Justification through faith, justification through works, and justification through Grace (with a capital 'G'). I could be wrong, but I think the general agreement all around is that justification is through God's Grace.

I'm going to glaze over stuff I don't understand...and.. As for your last question, what's wrong with giving an answer when a question is raised? A movement started that expressed doubt about the canonicity of a few books and the Church clarified its position. A number of events over history led to the diocese of Rome exercising a lot of ecclesial authority, so maybe up to that point it was up to the individual diocese to make the decision. That, I don't know and I'm kind of disappointed that no one came by and provided you with a better, more informative reply in these past couple days than I have just now.",1543622715

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.

   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

Democrats prioritize personal freedom, Republicans prioritize economic freedom, and libertarians prioritize both.

* All three solo albums so far (Harry, Zayn, Niall) debuted at #1 in the US.

* When one of Louis's singles went top 40 last year, 1D broke the Beatles record for a band to have all current and former members achieve a US Top 40 solo hit. They did it in 18 months while the Beatles took 21 months.

* When Strip That Down debuted at #3 on the UK charts, One Direction became the second group in UK chart history where all members made the top 10, after The Beatles. 

* When Strip That Down reached #1 on US pop radio, One Direction became the only group to have three members achieve this, and the only group to have two members of the same group hold both the #1 and #2 spots (Niall had the other spot with Slow Hands).

* Strip That Down sold 5 million copies.

* Harry's debut acting role was in an Academy Award winning film.

* I Don't Wanna Live Forever was nominated for a Grammy and peaked at #2.

* Even though he hasn't ""broken"" the US yet, Louis had a #2 and #8 hit in the UK.",1543622716

I don‚Äôt use most of the apps TypeStatus Plus supports either. Meanwhile iMessage has stayed pretty much the same since iOS 7, and the only maintenance the TypeStatus iMessage code has gotten has been to add more features because it was so easy to and I know it‚Äôs unlikely to break more than once a year.

If I've read Williams' ""Scientific Realism Made Effective"" and the Wallace-Fraser debates, what else do you suggest on this?

Something I'd like to see is a discussion of the AQFT particle localization theorems (Reeh Schlieder, Malament) in the EFT context.  Wallace makes a general (not only EFT) argument for non-fundamental particles which I find satisfying, but I think there's also a way to see the particle tails as unproblematic when considering infinitely dressed versus bare particles.  Jonathan Bain mentions this in one paper but doesn't elaborate enough. I'd also like to see a discussion of what we should make of the AQFT unitarily inequivalent reps issues in EFTs.  I believe Fraser concedes her Haag's theorem argument doesn't apply after renormalization.

All the jetpack really got used for was the awkward platforming segments in vaults and breaking up the monotony of running outside the Nomad.

&gt;Say you kill him with a kick in round one, then you kill him with a sword move using the same sword from round 1, it may be that neither kill counts since round 1 wasn't a sword move and technically it wasn't their sword in round 2.

I think this might be it. I know the first two weapon kills happened as you described - back to back rounds, first one was a kick kill, second was a sword kill with the same weapon from the previous round.

I'm pretty sure I got a third weapon kill in a later rematch we had, but that may have been invalidated by the same kind of thing. My memory is a little fuzzy on this one, but I think I disarmed them in round 1, got a regular KO, then picked up the sword and used it for a weapon kill in round 2. Since the weapon was originally created in round 1, I guess it wasn't considered the opponent's weapon anymore when/after I picked it up?

For now I'm going to assume that it was these little technicalities that were causing the problem, and I'll keep trying to get the trophy with these in mind. Thanks for your help!",1543622722

The imba statstick dualwield approach will cut boss killing timers by a large chunk but I prefer the lazy-friendly near god-mode that max block shield gives (which can also be done with dual wielding a statstick but that requires more brainpower+effort and I'm content with a really strong invincible build for 0 effort over an invincible imba build for 2 efforts).

Bladeflurry will still be strong after the (supposed) nerf with sword and board so you don't have a timelimit to try that approach but if you want to experience insane damage/investment in the game, it's never been easier+cheaper to craft a decent statstick in the game than Delve league and Bladeflurry is insanely smooth to play with.",1543622721

If that many fans are honestly interested in a game decided by refs and not players, coordinators, and coaches for the sake of a quicker game so they can meet their bedtimes, we could save a lot of money by not putting talent on the field that gets overshadowed by poor quality games, or those ‚Äúfans‚Äù can go watch the NBA instead.

At a very crude level, slavery results from a market that does not have regulation - that is not a free market. Rules preventing slavery are regulations governing a market.

Talk to your husband, if you can. You say you don't want his attention anymore, but at the same time it confuses you. Your conflicted.

Decide what you want. Would you like to be married to him if the issues of sex went away? Is he sincere? How much do you value the marriage? Kids?

They could also put stuff like this on hulu, which they will now, after the Fox deal, own a pretty large chunk of. I hope Disney/Marvel still has plans for these incarnations of Daredevil, and the Punisher, and they should also resolve lingering plot threads from other Defenders on one platform or the other.Ôªø

As for these shows are Netflix's to cancel, I think the situation is similar to what happened to the Expanse at Syfy, the show was Alcon entertainment's IP but was financed by Syfy so it was Syfy's decision to cancel it sadly, but then Alcon shopped it around and it was picked up by Amazon. I think the situation is similar here all the IPs are still Marvel Entertainment's property but it was ultimately Netflix's decision to cancel because they financed and distributed it, but they didn't own it.

"CreationEvolution","t5_pqkg8","&gt;Asking for a friend, but Is the moon going to crash back into earth and form an even bigger planet than we have now? 

No, the moon is currently moving away from the Earth.

There is a problem in astrophysics called the N-body problem: in a naive two-body system, orbits are stable. However, two-body systems don't really exist, so we also need to take into account the effects of the gravity from other orbital bodies: in the context of the moon and Earth, we also have to consider the effects of the sun and the other planets. This makes orbits only pseudo-stable -- over long periods of time, they will deviate. This effect is seen in satellites, through the process of 'stationkeeping': they need to adjust themselves to compensate for this movement, as well as the infinitesimal amount of drag against the medium of space and the effects of photon pressure.

This is the process that is causing the moon to escape.

The N-body problem is also responsible for the [Lagrangian points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point), but that's another discussion about how there are pseudo-stable orbits capable of collecting material [see: trojans in the listed article].

&gt;Will we then join up with the sun and the rest of the solar system, and eventually every atom in the entire universe can become one planet? Because it‚Äôs all being pulled together by gravity?

Under some [cyclical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model), it is theorized that eventually gravity will become to the dominant force in the universe and reunite the singularity that preceded the Big Bang. However, we don't yet have the information required to make an informed guess about how the universe got started and there are other theories that are probably more likely.",1543622730

Nahhhhh. If that was the case we'd have seen a behind the scenes shot, at least ONE, of, at the least, of a French shield...and there have been none shown later in the filming of 5b. Plus, there won't be any events happening that Rollo would/could get involved in. We know, from BTS shots, script/audition tape leaks and so on, that just about all of the rest of the season is filmed in either England or Norway/Kattegat, and unless they've sneaked his warriors in on Bjorn's side during the next battle for Kattegat (and that will NOT happen), then we see no more of him this season.  Now, no one can be 100% sure of that.......a cameo of some sort isn't out of the question, but an actual battle with fighting?  That isn't going to happen. And Rollo should be dead by the time the season is reaching a close, or if by some miracle he's still alive, he'll be FAR too old to fight, since he's 66 years old when he comes back to Kattegat as it is (per Clive Standen).",1543622731

it is, however

&gt; in short, race has little to do with it.

is true, liking people who have similar interest to you and that you've gotten to know personally via local pubs, shops or sporting teams, isn't racist. You didn't need to mention they were Sihk, you like them because they drink with you and play cricket.

Assuming that you won't like muslims without taking the same time knowing them as individuals, is racist. You've made a generalisation and acted up on it to exclude that group of people and assume the worst of all of them.

If the muslim children at your sisters school truly went through that, that's a terrible situation. However it's one that deserves action and sympathy. I was a teacher, and spotting the warning signs for religously motivated abuse such as FGM and forced marriage (which is illegal under UK law, and that law would apply to any one born here even if the marriage is performed abroad, more details here https://www.gov.uk/stop-forced-marriage) because it's a known issue that is treated very seriously.

There's still a misunderstanding about how UK immigration works, 

* FoM from the EU seems like open doors because the powers we have under EU law to control it were never implement by our own goverment, such as returning EU people to their home countries if they can't afford to support themselves in the UK after 3 months (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/147/free-movement-of-persons, section B2a Right and Obligations, bullet points 2 and 3) that don't track EU nationals entering, so they don't have the data to exercise these checks.

* Immigration from outside the EU is based on having work or study lined up, the money to support yourself for your entire stay evidenced or after a set period of time that a family member in the UK can show they can financially support you in the UK. I know people who have moved to China, gotten married, had kids abroad, who can't have their family move to the UK without a lengthy process, have a wage above ¬£18600 + ¬£3800 as they have a child it's then another ¬£2400 for each subsequent child. The spouse also has to pay between ¬£200 to ¬£600 a year for access to the NHS. More info here:https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/proof-income

We don't have masses of poor low skilled immigration, we have nurses and doctors immigrating the UK, we have profressors and scientific researchers working here. All of that cross border co-operations will be in jeaopardy. The closest we get to the ""poor unskilled"" is refugees, people fleeing wars and atrocities far worse than anything we've dealth with in the UK for decades.",1543622731

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","&gt; For others saying 'shut off the water': The OP states that this is a bathtub, so the problem is most likely a broken cartridge on the hot water side of the faucet. The bathtub will not be able to have its water shut off by closing a sink shutoff (they do not share supply), and it's extremely unlikely that there is an easily accessible shutoff valve for it unless it is a standalone tub. There is a 99% chance that 'shutting off the water' will mean 'shut off water to the entire property', which is what a plumber will need to do to fix it.

Can confirm: I own a house with a leaky bathtub faucet (although luckily a slower one than OP), and I'm going to have to turn off the water at the *street* to fix it because my main shutoff valve is also FUBAR'd. (In addition to replacing the tub faucet and the main shutoff, I'll also be adding shutoff valves in the basement ceiling only for the tub because even if code doesn't require it, not having them is asinine. Also, in case anybody cares, FYI gate valves suck -- get ball valves instead.)

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Potentially a lot more interesting in that case, this is essentially assuming they remove a lot of the compute capability, and go for FP32 core scaling.

But because they didn't do this with Vega64, I'm not sure they'd do it now.

If you go backwards to the FuryX design, Vega64 has much worse FP32 cores per transistor and worse performance per transistor as well (in gaming).

And the FuryX had a lot of compute too, so could be stripped further, architecturally, if focused on gaming.

A 200mm^2 die on 7nm using the FuryX architecture as a base could in theory have at least 5500 cores, and obviously clock a lot higher than 1 GHz as well.

But, like I mentioned, we've never seen GCN go over 4096 cores, so who knows if this is possible?

If GCN can't go above 4096 cores, it can only realistically hit 1080 Ti performance at best on 7nm. 7nm won't allow it to go any higher than ~1850 MHz (judging by MI60's clocks and power consumption).

And even accounting for ~10% IPC increase from other additions like the fixed Vega features, you just can't expect more than ~30% better than Vega64 with no increase in FP32 cores.

And therefore, without being able to increase cores, Navi will be limited to mid-range performance (by 7nm standards) and die sizes. Because 30% more performance than Vega64 simply won't take up that much room on 7nm.",1543622734

As for fuel, what is left of the Russian economy is largely a one trick pony.  The price of oil is down and people are doing everything they can to reduce their usage so it will never come back to what it was.

"CreationEvolution","t5_pqkg8","**Lagrangian point**

In celestial mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are positions in an orbital configuration of two large bodies, wherein a small object, affected only by the gravitational forces from the two larger objects, will maintain its position relative to them. The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit at the same angular velocity (essentially, the speed of the orbit) and thus remain in the same relative position. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three are on the line through the two large bodies; the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies.

***

**Cyclic model**

A cyclic model (or oscillating model) is any of several cosmological models in which the universe follows infinite, or indefinite, self-sustaining cycles. For example, the oscillating universe theory briefly considered by Albert Einstein in 1930 theorized a universe following an eternal series of oscillations, each beginning with a big bang and ending with a big crunch; in the interim, the universe would expand for a period of time before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a bounce.

A mom messaged me saying her son was sick vomiting and she thought he had strep because that‚Äôs usually how he presented with it so he wouldn‚Äôt be coming in. One kid went home after throwing up that afternoon. I got a message at 6 pm while I was waiting for my to go Thai food order saying another kid was vomiting. 

I woke up at 11 PM and knew something wasn‚Äôt right. I went to the bathroom thinking my favorite Thai curry had pissed off my IBS. However, after a round of hot fire diarrhea, my tummy troubles were not quelled. I am severely emetophobic so I will do anything not to puke and I fought it as long as I could.

Once you find it, and know the type of the file, it can often be pretty easy.  The registry is simple, test files are not that hard depending on the structure. Anything like xml/json/yaml is also usually pretty easy.

That all said, I don't know what the format of the '3CX' configuration is, so I can't help you much for specifics.  Do you know where config is stored? Do you have an example configuration file?   Can you share a example?

In addition to the radiation and intense light is the wind caused by the expanding blast wave of air being pushed out by the explosion. Duck and cover gives a person a chance at surviving this wind. But wait, there's more! After the initial outward blast, is the ""reverse blast wave"" where the air comes rushing back into to fill the void. That's why they emphasize ""waiting until the danger is over"" before moving. 

I remember seeing films like this in grade school in the early 70's. We practiced duck and cover. At that time, we were sure that the bomb could go off at any moment.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","On a technical level it was an absolute pioneer though I don't think that's what you're talking about.  As far as playing it safe with the plot...I couldn't disagree more. 

I mean now it looks that way because it's influenced pop culture so much but for its time it was subverting expectations left and right.  The princess isn't a helpless damsel, the hero doesn't ""get the girl"", the hero doesn't kill the bad guy and instead helps him redeem himself.  That seems old hat now but it wasn't back then.  Hell, most movies even decades later were still problematic and/or predictable when it came to those tropes.  

That being said this isn't the sort of film that would benefit from being more controversial or whatever playing it less safe would have meant.  It wasn't trying to be an avant garde art film or make a political statement.  I can see that criticism for Iron Man (I found it completely lame they changed his origin story.  Being upset that the US government is using your weapons to kill innocent people is way different than finding out terrorists are stealing your weapons to kill innocent people. It was toothless and really made his character arc more confusing because he wasn't really that responsible.).

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","The Sony ecosystem is a strange one. You won‚Äôt find transparency, complete accuracy or balanced dynamics, instead everything is tuned for enjoyment which has befuddled audio reviewers. I think the Sony Z7 is the fantastic headphone to get started in this hobby. It takes modern music (Weeknd, 2Pac, Gorillaz etc) and makes it more enjoyable with articulate high end complemented with a bass boost. The comfort is rivaled only by it‚Äôs bigger brother. Where this headphone falls short is soundstage, mids, and a strange reverb due to the lack of ear-cup dampening. However when listening to jazz, or jazz vocalists or even electronic I felt the headphones weren‚Äôt doing the recordings justice. The Z7 reminds me of a high end car stereo, a wonderfully engaging sound but lacking presentation that one can call true hifi. 

The Z1R however elevates this experience, and sounds like a pair of high end speakers in a treated room. After all, they were tuned by Sony Battery Studios with Duntech Studio speakers as a reference. The combination of the magnesium dome and Japanese style paper dampening opens up the soundstage significantly, and can emulate a jazz cafe or midsized venue. Not on the scale of Carenegie Hall, but enough to allow one to easily place instruments in a room. The Sony house sound is relaxing, erring to a warm presentation but sounds strange when placed next to reference tuned headphones such as Sennheiser 6XX or HE560. This unique Sony house tuning has driven away a few audiophiles, but I quite enjoy it. This headphone is a love letter to jazz, and when paired with a glass of Glenfarlclas 21 gives the listener a refined experience one would find in a jazz cafe. The sheepskin leather, light but precise construction and the most comfortable ear pads I‚Äôve ever used is sheer luxury. This is no R10 replacement, but if you listen to enjoy and relax, this may be the headphone for you. 

The TAZH1ES represents the best use of in house Sony amplification and DAC technology. Using the same S-Master technology found in the WM1 Signature series, you get an absolutely clean sound and pitch black background. However Sony has also implemented a DA Hybrid Amplifier Circuit which gives a warmer analog characteristic to the sound. This amplifier is dead quiet with my sensitive SE846, even at 0dB (at highest gain). The construction is faultless, and lives up to the Sony ES standard. A drawback is a weaker amplification with balanced achieving only 1200 mW as the TAZH1ES was designed for dynamic driver headphones. However planar magnetic headphones are becoming more efficient and this amplifier is certainly well equipped for the future as it has a 4.4 mm connector, one of the few desktop amps on the market with a Pentaconn connection. 

Sony has stepped up their audio game notably in recent years, and has introduced capable products albeit at classic Sony prices. However consumer products such as the WH1000XM3 is proving to be a smash hit, and providing Bose stiff competition.  I am excited to see what Sony has in store for the future, as a famous leader once said ‚ÄúWe will watch your career with great interest‚Äù.

Nvidia releases 10 series destroying every AMD card oh VEGA OCTOBER!!! Going to be 4K 60fps!!!! October came VEGA delayed when it was finally released it was not even close to 1080ti which any logical person would've known given their low end cards recently released. Now we sitting with 20 series release every amd fanboy crying wait for NAVI!!! going to do 8K 60FPS even though AMD currently has 0 cards capable of 4K 60fps hell they don't even have a card capable of true max 4k 30fps. Mean while out of the top 15 cards AMD has like one or 2 cards. TOP 7+ all nvidia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now AMD just release RX590 which is really just a AMD R390 rebranded and slightly improved from June 2015. So if you bought R390 for 330$, then RX480 for 230$, then RX580 for 230$, then RX590 for 280$ you have a total of 1070 now if you would've took that 1070$ for nvidia you could've grabbed yourself a GTX980ti for 650$ in June 2015 and have about the same performance of the RX590 while saving money in the process. This what AMD does they rebrand cards and charge less. Nvidia brings out cards with 30-50% more performance instead of the laughable 5% amd does and 970 330$ then 1070 349$ and now that AMD has nothing to compete with the top of line from 10 series Nvidia releases 20 series and charges you the extra money that performance amounts too 2070 500$ and extra 150$ for 30-40% perf increase. Meanwhile AMD fanboys scream outrageous!!!! 1200$ for 1080p RTX!!! ROFL while totally ignoring the near 50% perf increase over the 1080ti and the fact that this is the only GPU capable of running games maxed out in 4K for a solid 60fps.

If you're an immigrant, you're not an international student.

Another important thing is to play people that are better than you. It sounds like you have a group of friends that are. Try and figure out what you are doing (or not doing) that is causing you to lose. Ask your friends what bad habits you have that they are exploiting? 

My brother used to beat me all of the time. When I finally asked him what I was doing wrong, he told my I jump from the ledge almost exclusively. As I played, I realized he was right.

Having lower than sRGB coverage means you won't see anything as intended because at a minimum stuff is meant for sRGB or rec709. There are other gamuts like Adobe RGB which is used for photo and printing, DCI-P3 which is digital cinema, and rec2020 which is the umbrella for HDR although no commercial display I know of currently does 100% rec2020.

Your phone probably does 100% because it's newer and designed to hit DCI-P3 or close to it. For example, my V30 does something like 109% DCI-P3 or 148% of sRGB.

however, last time i looked i saw he had posted some publicly introspective thing about how he was letting people down or whatever and he was disappointed in himself because of it and i just... laughed? like, buddy, your problem is way way way bigger than canceling plans on short notice. it is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY bigger. 

you're right that he'll probably never figure it out. but hey, he'll just live a shitty life like the shitty person he is, and i get to reap the benefits of never having to deal with him again and having zero desire to even give him the time of day. also, my boyfriend is loving and caring and wholesome and would probably beat him senseless before he could get anywhere near me, so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

- I don't see how for instance teaching Greek, Hebrew, church history or even systematic theology requires one to be a model of a pastor. *Maybe* you could make the case that specific classes dedicated to pastoral care or practical ministry should thus be restricted, but I'm not convinced of that either.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Imagine having neither wind nor solar. Demand for electricity is highly predictable, what you describe as ""shifting nature of the modern power grid"" is just the unpredictable nature of wind and solar, nothing else. So if you take these out you can set up your power generation infrastructure in a way that works best, money and cycle efficiency wise because you know what you need at which time. 

Now we add wind and solar to the mix. Where I could run my conventional power plants at point of best efficiency over extended periods of time before, I have now to run them at off design for shorter periods. Less efficiency means I need more fuel to generate the same amount of energy and running my power plant with less up-time means the non-fuel cost of operation per MW increases.

Does this mean conventional power generation became less efficient? Not really. It means that in order to enable a more environmentally friendly energy mix I actively put my conventional power generation at an disadvantage. Don't get me wrong here, I'm a big proponent of renewable and sustainable energy generation, but I'm also strongly advocating an honest discussion of the topic. Increasing your amount of renewable energy increases the cost of the conventional power generation, which is _essential_ to run a country at this point in time. 

On another note, DE is actually building a bunch of coal plants because we're phasing out nuclear. And the only reason we can sustain our significant amount of wind and solar capacity is that we have neighboring countries that can even out spikes in both directions (in times of high wind we actually pay them to take our electricity).",1543622751
"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","Even just reading your own account, your behaviour sounds like the cause of this, rather than your gender. 

First off, you're complaining about it here instead of scolding them to their face. That right there already says a lot about conflict avoidance. This is the first tell.

Secondly, you are trying to 'convince' somebody, for some unknown reason, that you need a part installed. Why on earth are you wasting weeks on convincing somebody? Either you have the authority to order them to install it, or you don't and you inform the person who does have the authority to order it. The fact that you give a fuck about whether they believe you is the second tell.

Thirdly, the fact that you would be more willing to waste your time doing it yourself rather than confront somebody and force them to do it also says a lot about how you will be perceived. If you *let* people walk over you, they will.

I'm not saying this because I hate women or any such nonsense. I'm saying this because I used to *be* like you. Then I grew up and realized that people disrespected me because I didn't respect myself.",1543622751

"DragaliaLost","t5_iizu7","In practice, it just means that you get a big chunk of the rewards from Expert. From an earlier post today:

20 Gold Medals per Joined Expert Run. 10 runs a day, for 200 Gold Medals a day. 200*12 = 2400

30 Gold Medals per Hosted Expert Run. Let's assume 60 a day here. 60*12= 720

100 Gold Medals per EX/Special Run. Assume 10%, may be higher. Based on the above numbers, you're running Expert 12 times a day, so get it about 1.2 times per day. 1.2 * 12 * 100 = 1440

2400+720+1440 = 4560 Gold medals.

"node","t5_2reca","try taking your socketio out from your react component. Have a socketio handler inside the root of your project (somewhere in your entry file), and then when it needs to change state of one of your react components you have several ways of doing it:

&amp;#x200B;

* a global object (not recommended because it's bad design) basically you can make a global object that stores references to your components that need communication with sockets. so in your App constructor you might have: [window.App](https://window.App) = this. which stores a reference to the class instance inside the window. Then in your socketio handler, once it receives a certain message you can do: window.App.setState({whatever...}), or even better: have a method inside App that is meant to handle the data from socketIO and then just do window.App.someMethod(data)
* a single object passed along to all of your components. This is what I do in all of my projects. inside the root of my application I make a closure and I call it brain. then I pass it to app like so: &lt;App brain={brain} /&gt; and within the App component's constructor I do something like this: this.brain = props.brain; this.brain.rememberMe('App', this); where rememberMe() just takes a name, and a reference to the component and stores it inside the closure. Then I have another method of brain which is called tell(), so your socket handler can do something like this: brain.tell('App').setState({whatever...})

Hope that helps, I'm not going to run or download your code because that is a lot of text. Try to make your question as minimal as possible when you ask, and you'll get more responses.",1543622752

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","Don't play three colors. Unless you have an insane amount of fixing, it's just not worth destabilizing your mana base for. In your pool specifically, your best cards push you towards black and white rather than green. Too bad you didn't realize this during the draft, since you probably could have picked up a few additional filler cards in black and white to end up with a decent deck.

With that said, this is what I would try to salvage this deck:

\- Rustwing Falcon

\- Ajani's Welcome

\- Ajani's Pridemate

\- Pegasus Courser

\- Inspired Charge

\- Knight of the Tusk

\- Start-Crowned Stagg

\- Angel of the Dawn

\+ Vampire Neonate

\+ Greenwood Sentinel

\+ Highland Game

\+ Elivish Rejuvinator

\+ Giant Spider

\+ Thornhide Wolfs

\+ Rox Oracle

\+ Colossal Dreadmaw

\- 3 Plains

\+ 2 Forests

\+ 1 Swamp

&amp;#x200B;

It is also possible to treat green as a splash color, though I think the resulting deck is worse overall:

\- Colossal Dreadmaw

\- Titanic Growth

\- Elvish Rejuvinator

\+ Rustwing Falcon

\+ Vampire Neonate

\+ Two-Headed Zombie

\- 2 Forests

\+ 2 Plains",1543622752

With that out of the way, I would strongly recommend waiting. Here‚Äôs why:

Zen 2 (AMD) is coming out next year, and will be a leap forward from Zen 1.
 Also, Nvidia is going to 7nm process, which should also be a leap forward tech-wise.

When both the CPU and GPU are set to make jumps forward, best advice is to wait.

That said, if you really want a new system now, best bang for your buck is an AMD 2700x system combined with an NVIDIA 10 series GPU.

An alternative option to buying a new PC right now would be to look into Shadow streaming service. Basically they let you rent a high end rig and stream it to your system, meaning you can effectively run SC well on a crappy system. You need good bandwidth though. Bored Gamer talks about it on his channel and has an offer code - check it out.

TLDR:
Wait if you can
If you can‚Äôt, best bang for your buck is AMD CPU and NVIDIA GPU

You have to put your self out there by approaching the ones you find attractive, that are also ‚Äúeye gazing‚Äù you. Start by complimenting them on something they are wearing or ask them something stupid like directions to a certain building. 

What works for me, after initially complimenting them or asking a question, give them your name and say ‚ÄúI hope to see you around you seem like a chill dude!‚Äù. Ever so often you will see them around, just smile and walk up and start a casual conversation. You will be turned down ever so often, but this is how I met my current partner of a year.

Controlling in a relationship seems fairly logical for an INTJ to do, since we're overly analytical and aim to make things perfect, or rather efficient.

Then once her turn rolls around again use skill 3 to extend the duration of the bleeds, do damage in proportion to the number of bleeds, and improve readiness. Bleed inflicts damage based off of your attack stat, and I don't have her fully equipped yet so it can only get better.

I don't have Haste, but glancing at his skills makes me think they could melt really well. It seems that Haste's skill 2, which heals team based off damage dealt would always get it's 50% bonus recovery when the target's bleeding.

I said assault second, weapon involved (the phone).  My Chief argued with me a bit, and finally agreed to let me apply for both charges and let the prosecutor accept one and reject the other.  We sent them in and the prosecutor accepted the assault second, and he charged her with armed criminal action on his own.  Chief was a bit miffed over the results.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","If you look closely at a computer screen, you will see that each pixel is actually made of [three components](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Pixel_geometry_01_Pengo.jpg) - a red, a green, and a blue. Each of these smaller lights can be activated to various extends, and between the three of them they can reproduce any color that the human eye can see.

The value ##FF8365 is actually three values - FF, 83, and 65. These three numbers describe, for an individual pixel, how much to activate the red, green, and blue lights respectively (if you've ever seen the abbreviation RGB, it stands for red-green-blue).

The reason they are alphanumeric is partly historical and partly to do with how computers process numbers. They are in base-16, instead of base-10. In the base-10 system, when you see a number (e.g. 25), that really means (2 * 10 + 5). When there are more digits, the left digits get higher powers of ten, so 284 = (2 * 10^2 + 8 * 10 + 4). Base-16 is similar, except that the place values stand for powers of 16 instead of powers of 10, so the number 25 would be (2 * 16 + 5). #25 (25 in base-16) is equal to 37 in base-10.

In base-10, each place value can have a digit between 0 and 9. In base-16, each place value can have a digit between 0 and 15. However, since we don't have single digits equal to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, we use letters instead - the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F.

So for example, #A8 = (10 * 16 + 8) = 168. And #FF, the largest two-digit base-16 number, is (15 * 16 + 15) = 255. So, each color code is really three numbers, each between 0 and 255, that tell you how much red, green, and blue there should be in a pixel, with 0 being none and 255 being the maximal amount.",1543622759

Mine are as follows: 

1. Work Clothes: I work in a business casual office but I am also client facing occasionally, so I have 5 blazers, 4 slacks, and jeans sometimes when I'm in the office. These go with my 10-15 dresses, dress shirts, and blouses. I also have 10 cardigans so I can wear more casual blouses sometimes. 

2. Going out: A lot of this is work clothes with jeans, or rather a lot of my going out clothes are doubling as work clothes when I wear a cardigan or blazer. 

3. Workout: Mostly sports bras, yoga pants, oversized t shirts, and tank tops. 

4. Outdoors: For activities like hiking, snow-shoeing, snowboarding, or other things. 

5. Casual: A few flannels and tshirts I don't wear out for specific events/happenings in my life. Just the clothes that are comfy and fit well that I would wear when there's a possibility I might leave the house today. 

6. Lounging at home/laundry day: Worse than laundry day, I wouldn't leave the house in these clothes. ",1543622760

By the way, you can also max out the ordinary backdoor Roth IRA for 2018 at $5,500 as well.  The two types of 'backdoor' Roths are totally independent of each other, and you can do both.

They will both be more tax efficient than a taxable account.  If you retire early you can withdraw the contributions (but not the growth) tax and penalty free at any time.  So you withdraw those to cover your living expenses before age 59.5, while the growth keeps on growing tax free.

Turretplating only adds to that now since youre stuck even longer in an losing lane while your opponent is getting extra gold for winning against you. 

Most games start even =&gt; jungle is OP in most games. No shit youre fucked in a losing game, youre making it seem like all other lanes are gonna go well in a losing game. Jungle has the means to influence every lane without losing much exp/gold for doing it.

I have 0.01 seconds to think if I'd fuck you or not before I swipe. Show the contour of your body. Tip (this is subjective, so feel free to disregard): Get a skirt or sundress from your summer clothing (it's ok, photo doesn't need to be winter or Christmas theme). Show bare legs, skirts are cute. Wear a form fitting top if it's not a sundress, with a nice bra underneath that flatters you, and show your curves. Essentially what I'm saying is, show your feminine side - that's the main thing.

Your second photo needs to be you participating in a group activity WITH OTHER HOT GIRLS. This is such a trick, but it's called ""cheerleader effect"". When men see a group of women, they will always score the women hotter than they are on their own. Just a fact. Show yourself at a party, doing some cool activity (rockclimbing, social event, etc).

Your third photo can be something else cool about you, lots of ways to do this. 

Don't put more photos.

Truth is, [17 percent of elite athletes don't even return to their sport](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/2/128) after that injury and it's because of setbacks like these. Following these significant injuries you have muscle loss, nerve loss, biomechanics issues, proprioception issues, corticospinal activation issues, and kinesiophobia. This all contributes to other parts of the body taking heavier loads and incurring more stress. Beyond his style of play, there is a reason that Derrick Rose's body began to fall apart.

Hoping for the best for Andre Roberson in what is surely a difficult bounce back. Hope he can stay positive and motivated.",1543622764

Action, Thriller [[USA:R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings), 2 h 12 min]  
Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson, Paul Gleason  
Director: John McTiernan

**IMDb rating:** [](#movieguide_stars)**&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;** **8.2**/10 (654,737 votes)

&gt; Tough New York cop John McClane finds himself in a tight situation when an office building in Los Angeles is taken over by terrorists. Apart from himself, everyone else in the building - including his wife - is held at gunpoint while their captors spell out their demands. The F.B.I. are called in to survey the situation, but John McClane has other plans for the terrorists...
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; On release, Die Hard drew ambivalent reviews from critics. British film critic Mark Kermode expressed admiration for the film, calling it an exciting setup of ""Cowboys and Indians in The Towering Inferno."" However, Roger Ebert gave it a less than flattering review, rating it a mere two stars and criticizing the stupidity of the deputy police chief character, claiming that ""all by himself he successfully undermines the last half of the movie.""

Most stuff that goes to trial are liability disputes. Like disputed lane changes, who ran the red light, etc.. That or people want a ridiculous sum and won't settle.

I've seen cases where the company offers 200k, the injured person refuses, and the jury gives  like $10k or even $0.

People like to act like auto insurance companies are greedy, and its simply not true. The value of a claim is subjective. Plus insurers expose their insureds if they are unfair which is a whole other can of worms.

Now health insurance companies, that's another story entirely. Fuck those bastards.",1543622765
"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Honestly, I don't think this is a big deal as long as you confront her and she isn't defensive about it. You said you guys have only been together for 4 months, so I would just ask her about it. 4 months is still so incredibly early, and I wouldn't be surprised if she just didn't add relationship information on Facebook until later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I don't post anything about a relationship on social media until after we've been together for 6 months and even then I try to keep it pretty sparse. Breaking up for the entire world to see is incredibly humiliating - I'd rather keep that kind of information to myself and my close friends/ family.

Although you can most likely notice that if you have a real cold hearted boss then you might not get a raise but I believe that most bosses are nice and would like to give raises but taxing them more would most likely kneecap them in doing just that, the problem is that we spend too much and need more money so instead of raising taxes at all, how about we lower or even cut spending for things, not just for things like planned parenthood, also things like the military.",1543622768

I want to know why this is always presented as if one of these technologies has to prevail over the other. It's going to take more than just 1,300 pound batteries (that are not cost effective to recycle in 2018) to get the world off of fossil fuels. That's a fact.  

Also interesting is the fact that the authors completely disregard [China's plans to dominate the hydrogen industry](http://www.ihfca.org.cn/file/FCV%20Tech%20Roadmap.pdf). I'd bet none of them have even heard about ""Made in China 2025"". China knows that it would be impossible for every driver in that country to drive a battery electric car.

[Imagine all these people plugging in when they get home.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p04hk7rn.jpg)  

Furthermore, much of the world's population live in apartments or condos and will never have  a place to plug in. Hydrogen allows everyone to drive electric and green. And if you drive a lot you're never going to buy a car that needs to stop for 30-45 minutes for more range. ",1543622768

All the cases of people's vapes exploding are due to user error, either having their batteries bare in their pocket, or not turning off their mech mod before throwing in their pocket and it gets stuck on. Throwing a bare nimh in your pocket won't catch fire but it can still burn you badly and set your clothes on fire or melt them.

They would have to make a voltage regulator to make sure the battery voltage doesn't drop too low, as that can cause the battery to not charge fully or at all. The mflb draws little current  compared to sub ohm nicotine vapes (7 amps on the mflb at a lower than base output 1.2v, compared to 20+ at like 4.3v on nicotine vapes), so the battery getting hot shouldn't be an issue. That's one reason I hate nimh. By the end of a trench they're almost too hot to touch. I've never had my 18650s get that anywhere near hot even when running them at 70 watts, if they did I would consider them defective and unsafe and recycle them.

If handled properly they are safe. Just don't put them in your pocket bare with metal. Keep them in a case when not in use, and you'll be fine. Every battery powered vaping device with removable batteries uses them.",1543622770

&gt;Thing is I can't put a number on how much having a cat helped me mentally and emotionally. 

Oh, I completely agree, 200%. Pet therapy is a thing in many hospitals, where they'll bring in dogs and cats for patents. It's the sweetest thing. I guess it's a mix of both potential emotional loss and money ha! 

&gt;I'm going to go see this new cat and place him on my face for ten minutes and if I don't sneeze I might just end up bringing him home üòÇ

Ooooh, I think I should do this next time I consider getting one.

It was never announced, no one knew, it just appeared in google store one day and was as awesome as ever. No one announces new Zuma, Bejeweled or Angry Birds. Why this?",1543622773

I realize that there's dodgy stuff throughout, but it isn't very apparent on first viewing because you expect the episode to subvert it - that those examples are included for the purpose of satire and criticism. And really, the whole episode still feels oddly satirical throughout, which makes me wonder what happened to cause the messaging to fall so flat as it certainly doesn't feel (to me) like McTighe was deliberately going for Amazon propaganda. I do think I want him to return in future seasons as well - he does seem to get the feel of a Doctor Who episode, hopefully he'll be able to redeem himself for what went wrong here.

Netflix knows exactly how many eyeballs are watching their shows, and they know precisely how much they cost. By all accounts viewership has been [consistently dropping](https://screenrant.com/marvel-netflix-shows-losing-viewers/), but making the Disney shows hasn‚Äôt gotten any cheaper. 

That‚Äôs a huge problem. If Daredevil season 3 only brought in half the viewers of DD s2, that means Netflix is getting half the ‚Äúreturn.‚Äù Ultimately Netflix isn‚Äôt out to make good shows, they‚Äôre out to make a profitable service. If Daredevil was still bringing in the viewers at an acceptable cost, it‚Äôd almost certainly have been renewed for a 4th series.",1543622773

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Not any longer, but I attended and worked at Utah Valley University. It‚Äôs been a year and a half since I was there so there‚Äôs a chance some things a little different, such as the costs or how many credits are offered. General ed courses were about $180/credit and aviation was about $250-260/credit. The cost goes up a little every year, just like typical tuition, so it might be a little closer to $300/credit. The university has a database online (I assume most do) so you can compare how your past credits could transfer in. I‚Äôm trying to remember how many credits instructors get, I‚Äôve been out of it for a while and I only worked with a few guys who were CFIs. But I want to say it was in the mid-20s. So depending on the generals, it could potentially be 40-50 best case scenario, at least a third of a 120 credit BS degree. 

It‚Äôs going to require some legwork but I would just call various universities with online aviation programs, Or fill out an info request and have them call you. Talk with them about your goal. Talk about costs (both tuition and various fees). Talk about your transfer credits (which could include university, college, high school dual enrollment, AP, or maybe even CLEP credit if that applies), how they will articulate or transfer in (or in other words, which classes specifically they can credit; schools can accept dozens and dozens of credits, but if you transfer in 30 credits and it consisted of 8 music classes and 2 science classes, you might only actually get one science and one music counted toward your actual degree because of the duplicate credit, if that makes sense). Ask specifically about the process of getting your certificates and rating credited. And if you expect to have any ratings down the road (CFII, ATP, etc) ask if you can transfer in additional credit down the road. 

The biggest concern for most people was cost, ease, and timeline. Some guys would come to us over another school since we were cheaper and had some easier requirements. Other guys would choose another school because they could offer more credits than we could, despite a little bit extra cost.

Idk why he decided to go back to pos1, maybe because of the skem issue and he lost a pos1 or the disaster of  CoL. But I really wished he goes back to 5 once again. It's also less risky to do some crazy shit as 5 compared to 1.

As for Fear, the most baffling for me is how EE managed to get Fear's approval (or him joining) with a team name of Plus Ultra. lol.

&gt; Halley lives with her six year old daughter Moonee in a budget motel along one of the commercial strips catering to the Disney World tourist clientele outside Orlando, Florida. Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.

In the kitchen I put scraps into sealed containers with a little of the bokashi grain,  frequently they're there for several days because I'm lazy af. The bokashi grain stops them from smelling bad. 

So, if your concerned about smell I can highly recommend just getting a bag of bokashi grain and using it in any old container you want. Not necessarily to use the whole system, just to make collecting scraps in the kitchen easy and not smelly. A bag should last a long  time

Edit: didnt explain why this would work! The scraps are in anaerobic conditions, but the bacteria mix in the bokashi encourages fermentation rather than anaerobic decay, so the smell is much milder and more like booze (my bins smell like white wine) than stanky decay. Stuff in the kitchen can smell a little if left for a time, but nothing like it would if just decaying as normal",1543622776

"Grimdawn","t5_2s6i9","Components go in the first tab of the shared stash.  They are usable by all characters that way and the game will take them out as needed for the blacksmith and devotion shrines.  Other tabs in the shared stash are used for gear I want to keep but which are not usable on the current character - usually this is all blue and purple and some MI items that have near-perfect affix combinations.  When this fills up they migrate into GDStash.  Every once in a while I will go through and remove duplicates and dynamite them.

Miscellaneous stuff goes in the first tab of the character stash - crafting materials, scrap, aether crystals, potions, quest items, etc.  Gear for the current character gets sorted in various ways in the other tabs of the character stash.

I set the item filter on Green at level 1.  Usually I have a full set of gear by level 13.  No reason to bother with Yellow since the skills are so OP in the early game.  Just throw a few points in your main skill and obliterate everything.

No

&gt; How can I view all my transactions from one company? Say I want to see all the Uber rides I've ever taken.

In the transactions tab, search for Uber.

&gt; Can I Set alerts for upcoming bills? I've linked my bills and can see when they're due. Can I get alert emails so I don't miss them?

I think those should be on by default - Mint is agressive with their emails. If not, check your account settings on desktop.

&gt; How far back does Mint go? It only shows the last 3 months, is that because I just started using it?

Yes, it imports back about 3 months - you can't get more unfortunately. But as you keep using it, you keep all the data, so you will have the data from 3 months before you started to the present.

&gt; Can I force Mint to ONLY use my budget categories? It seems Mint will do its best to guess what category I want to put transactions in; can I get it to only use the categories I've budgeted for?

In theory, as you recategorize things, it will learn. You can also check the box on the desktop Transaction view that tells it to always recategorize/rename transactions in the same way. In practice, it sometimes forgets.

&gt; Can I sort/track transactions according to the day I swiped my card instead of the day the transaction cleared?

No, all Mint knows is the date it pulls from your card website.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; On top of that.. xL didnt get initially accepted.. North and MOvistars both got in over them and SPY. Movistar &amp; North then withdrew themselves since they didnt like the terms offered by riot.

That's kind of what bothers me. XL was a third choice. If they were part of the teams originally accepted, I'd contend that they must've had a great application. Rogue has Imagine Dragons and Steve Aoki behind them. SK has a lot of history in LoL and eSports in general. For branding purposes I understand why they'd get selected. RFRESH getting selected makes a lot of sense, they exhume competence. But XL? There's honestly no indication as to why they got selected. They're a relatively new small esports organisation (of which they are one in a dozen) with mixed results at the third tier of LoL Esports in a relatively weaker ERL. Yes they've got investors, but they're far from the only esports company with money behind them and as we've seen in the past money does not automatically translate to competence.

Now it could be that they had a great plan of action that Riot was impressed by. But they've been active for two years now, and don't exactly have much to show for it. So where does that plan of action come in, because afaik they still have the same management and a roster like this isn't directly a show of good faith. What bothers me most is that they weren't originally accepted, but were only brought in after two other organisations declined. That doesn't exactly show that Riot was majorly impressed by their application, but rather that they were the contingency. And I know that this community doesn't like H2K, but I have a very hard time believing their application was better than H2K's who not only have a long history of competitive top results in Europe (safe for the last split) but also had a top European football club backing them. Instead we get an organisation with none of the history, none of the results, no significant fanbase to speak of, and no real indication as to why they'd be accepted. That's why I wish Riot would make their application process transparant. Because I don't want to hate XL, they seem genuine and I actually *want* to like them, but I'm less than impressed.",1543622779

I was suffering of insomnia, so the initial tiredness was a welcome thing, although it never left me tired during the day (I took it in the evenings), and even the help to sleep has gradually diminished over the months. I still sleep a bit better than I did before I started it, but it definitely lessens with time. 

No feeling hyped up for me, either, as is mentioned in another comment. My depression did lift quite a bit after a couple of weeks though, which is obviously great. Again, that effect has been gradually diminishing with time, too, but I'm nowhere near as low as I was before starting it. 

I've always had an issue with comfort eating and food cravings, and I'm a bit overweight, so the weight gain was my biggest concern about this medication. SSRIs just hadn't ever worked, and some of the other types of ADs I can't take because of my other health issues, so I agreed to give this one a go anyway. I did notice an increase in plain hunger in the first couple of months. I'd eat my normal meals, and still feel a real physical sense of being really hungry. Thankfully, like the other effects, that's more or less settled down by now, and I've managed to keep to the same weight. ",1543622780

They came along quickly after game start, I mean, some historical accuracy will suffer in a game such as this. Also, some posters came to these threads and said how they were descendents of those expelled from Spain, so I wouldn't say Spain was all that innocent. Although I agree that in a game without pops, such a mechanic is shallow.

&gt; Aveiro was far from being a major city at the time. Meanwhile other large Portuguese cities like Braga and Santarem are missing.

I need sources for this. What I am reading says that Averio was growing in 15th century while Braga suffered a sharp decline.

&gt;  But I think changing that for an actual unit would add much more flavor. Isn't it why Immersion packs were created for?

If every country gets special units, no one is special anymore. You could argue for Polish hussars, Portuguese marines, Swedish light artillery etc. Also, Spain and Portugal are getting special navy bonuses.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","All of this is just pieces of the argument without context so your replies are mostly nonsensical to the whole, please reply to all of it.

Your first excerpt is not from a spot where I‚Äôm arguing that our choices have to be random for free will I‚Äôm making the point that god, if he is omniscient, cannot create randomly because he always knows every detail of everything he will ever create for as long as it exist. Which is what supports the argument that god has already made all possible decisions for us because he could change them and doesn‚Äôt so he wills them to be that way.

For the second one is another excerpt taken out of context for the rest of the sentence. I didn‚Äôt say what he chooses doesn‚Äôt matter period, I‚Äôm saying that whatever his choices are they are still choices so there is intent behind them, this is supported because he can always change to different choices if the choice he made somehow dissatisfied him. In other words there can be nothing different than god‚Äôs will regardless of what god chooses.

As for your question there it depends on what you mean by ‚Äúchanges the nature of whatever he chooses.‚Äù If you mean compared to a god that isn‚Äôt omniscient? Probably. If you just mean in general well I‚Äôd say it doesn‚Äôt change it because he already had the knowledge but the knowledge was apart of the variables in his choice.

Free will is the ability to act without the constraint of necessity or fate. In the case of an omniscient creator he has already willed through his choices during creation all of the choices you will make. So in this case god‚Äôs will is fate and you can‚Äôt do anything other than what god has willed. 

Even small choices like the choice to drink Coke instead of Pepsi god knew before creation and willed which one you would drink to be because if we wanted it any other way he could change your choice an infinite number of ways like your tastebuds or availability of the drink. So god willed your choices into being and you can‚Äôt possibly defy the will of god even if it appears you could have drunk Pepsi.",1543622782

You said you do like coffee, but just not Starbucks coffee. But, you only know that you don‚Äôt like coffee from Starbucks when you‚Äôre drinking coffee you know came from Starbucks. So you‚Äôve got to control for the fact that you might have a cognitive predisposition against the company, and not actually their coffee.

I would hypothesize that, if given a series of tests, the first of which you‚Äôre given two coffees, and the second of which, two coffees, the third.....etc. one of which is from Starbucks, and the other from a coffee shop you enjoy.

And you‚Äôre not given any information about where any of the cofffees came from. 

That you would not be able to distinguish which coffees came from Starbucks, with a greater than random probability.

If you‚Äôre able to identify significantly more than 50% of the ‚Äúblind‚Äù coffees as having come from Starbucks or not, then I would accept your claim that you think Starbucks is not good.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","True if they are storing unencrypted personal data then encryption won't help, since they weren't using it properly.  For user data, asymmetric encryption should be used, in all cases where the system itself doesn't need to read through the contents of the data.  In some cases this isn't possible because the use case of the software means the system does need to read the data in cleartext. 

Companies shouldn't be implementing their own credit card storage and processing systems at all. There are trusted and robust 3rd party sites which should be used.  

For the other personal information, the system just needs to be using symmetric encryption and keeping their keys safe.  Failure to encrypt a production database that holds personal information is a form of negligence at this point. 

That being said, if an attacker gains access to your servers and has full superuser on the machines, it's game over for you.  All incoming connections can be compromised as the attacker can just start rebinding ports and slurping up keys and session information, which is enough to compromise even end-to-end encryption systems.  There's really nothing you can do if that happens, other than monitoring to find out as soon as possible, and then shutting down those machines.",1543622784

"eu4","t5_2uqat","The things Iberia needs are hard to do. The three biggest, are trade updates, colonization updates, and Iberian wedding/other event fixes.

Trade needs to be completely reworked. There is no reason why Canada couldn‚Äôt trade with Spain if Spain had ended up colonizing it. The trade routes in game are based on the ones that ended up taking place, but there‚Äôs no reason why those routes would shape up in any particular game. Also, one way trade makes no sense, and the way trade and trade value are calculated are completely borked. When collecting trade in every node makes more money than pushing the trade down stream something in your system is borked.

Colonization requires a complete overhaul. As it is all you do is press a button every now and then and then ignore it the rest of the time. It should require much more time and investment on behalf of the player, but it should also be more rewarding. The way the late game affects colonial nations makes no sense. They shouldn‚Äôt be basically hard coded to become rebellious. There were plenty of nations with far flung subjects right up until the end of WWI and WWII ffs. They should go rebellious if their parent nation mishandles the situation or ends up in damaging wars etc.

And finally, railroady events. The only one I accept is the polish-Lithuanian union, as it basically happened right after the game start date. But the Burgundian inheritance, the Iberian wedding, and the Dutch revolts all have to change. They are very bad design. Let the player have more agency, more challenge, more to do in the situation rather than just games ways to avoid the bad events entirely or to encourage the good ones to happen.

Also yeah Portugal‚Äôs ideas are a joke and the Castilian/Spanish ones arent much better. Also, why the hell did they lock Aragon out of getting Spanish ideas.

Then recanted and didn't let me go of coarse. Reason: The teacher would be locking up after the event and I'd be exposed to cold air.

I found the service on the ship to fall below Carnival in what I consider to be uniquely cruise-minded types of service. Things like a server in the MDR remembering that you like mint tea with dessert after the first day.

Our server didn't address us by name, or endeavor to cater to our preferences. That wasn't to say service wasn't bad, but I feel Carnival excels at offering personalized service. It's amazing what they're able to pull off, considering that their pay and rates are significantly lower than most lines.

That said, I'll definitely be giving Disney another go once my wife and I have children. I've heard too many good things from parents to discount the line permanently.

Once the erect length starts to show signs of growth (catch up to flaccid visible gains), the size difference (example of 2 inches between erect and flaccid) tends to remain the same...so say you went from 6 to 8 inches erect...your old 3 inch flaccid is now 5 inches.  Girth exercises tend to pump up the flaccid length while on PE routines.  Growers and showers still holds true only when PE has stopped, but during PE the flaccid can be almost as large as the erect for days following routines.  Thanks.

"oilpen","t5_3nhnf","I see. Makes sense. If I may, I did try something last night with my cart, perhaps it‚Äôs useful? I didn‚Äôt have a control to compare it to, but it at least felt like I was doing something.. This is basically applying my vaguely remembered 10th grade chemistry I took well over a decade ago, but bare with me. 

Situation: cart was giving me significant discomfort I hadn‚Äôt experienced with other ones. Suspected it was cut significantly with something. The cart was one with the metal mouthpiece and the rod going down the middle.

Objective: I know that ‚Äúdecent‚Äù oil looks like, so if there is an additive, maybe by wildly fluctuating the temperature I can at least get the cannabis product to separate itself from the additive.

Execution: 
1) I took the cart and stuck it under a lamp to slowly heat up. Not sure how long, but it was pretty Hot when I got it- like so hot that the contents viscosity was very minimal. It would go side to side really fast when I would flip it.

2) then, I cooled it down by simply wrapping it up in a damp washcloth. Not frozen or super cold, but something to assist in cooling.

3) I honestly just stared at it and tried to make some observations regarding:
-color
-if there was any significant / distinct separation between what I would guess is the cannabis product and an suspected additive. 
-if it looked like some parts became more viscous than the other over time.

Report:

And while I can‚Äôt make any definite conclusions (because I‚Äôm neither a chemist, a cannabis professional, had a control to compare it to, nor could do multiple tests), it felt suspect bc there was what *looked* like was at least two substances in the cart. One was a dark color like shatter, and the other was much, much less that color, I don‚Äôt wanna say clear, but like, totally different. I‚Äôm not touching this cart anymore. I didn‚Äôt take any pics or anything but if I have time I‚Äôll try to videotape it and show everyone",1543622788

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","You can speed up the rate at which you charge things but you run into a few risks when you try to charge things faster.

Risk 1) heat. Attempting to charge a battery at a higher current will cause you to provide more power (6 volts at 1 amp is 6 watts or 6 J/s... 6 volts at 2 amps is 12 watts or 12 j/s) and with more power will cause the battery to heat up more and more since the battery can only dissipate so much heat proportional to its surface area. If the battery gets too hot it explodes.


Risk 2) internal shorts. When you apply a higher than normal current to a battery you can actually damage the internal parts to a battery as everything has its own tolerance, above this tolerance things break down and when they break down in a battery the internal resistance will spike and cause the battery to heat up and bulge and explode, again.

Risk 3) overcharging. When it takes 1 hour to charge a battery to 100% (you can't actually charge most batteries to 100% as this is a built in protection they will say they are at 100% when they are actually at like 95%). If you charge a battery above 100% then it will convert most of the incoming energy into thermal energy instead of electrical potential energy causing, you know it, the battery to heat up and bulge and explode.

There are other risks associated with this, for instance rapid charging has seen to increase the number of dendrites produced and dendrites, if they get too long, will puncture and short out the battery causing it to discharge rapidly in such a way that almost all the energy gets converted from electrical potential to thermal and as a result... Kaboom.


So these are some of the reasons why we can't just *zap* a battery to full charge... Now let's look at something interesting, if we charged the battery in your phone (3500mAh at 3.7V) in 1 second then you would need to have it on a circuit that can handle 12600 amps (just note, my circuit breaker for my house trips at 15 amps for most outlets and 20 amps for my dryer and stove and fridge) and would end up consuming 46620 Watts of power... Thats enough to heat up 1 litre of water by 46 degrees Celsius (okay that's not as impressive but your battery cannot disperse that much heat that fast)


Edit: also pumping 12600 amps through a wire, well the wire in my USB cord is roughly 24 awg (the higher the awg the smaller the diameter) and can only handle around 3.5 amps before it actually, like, vaporizes itself. Like you would need really really thick cables to transmit that much current without just vaporizing then and there... And they would need to be actively cooled.


Edit: TL;DR it heats up and explodes. ",1543622788

Hell reading that list, having played maybe 20 hours now, I only recognized a few minor ones. Honestly a lot of the bugs were in older games far as I can tell. 


But to nitpick, the Gamebryo engine is ~7 years old. It has had small revisions but it is also an engine with a heavy modding community so changes is like garlic to vampires. The modding community would hate them for it. But it's nowhere near the oldest game engine at all, with some upwards of 10 years out and still being used to make games. Engines are complex and expensive as fuck to remake for each new title, so they often get reused in many ways over decades. 

Also a couple things like FoV are being addressed in a patch in the coming week (maybe the 11th patch, is 2 announced patches, 4th and 11th) so it's not like the game is from the olden days of gaming where release is all you get.  ",1543622788

"TeamSolomid","t5_2t8co","I dont see how that would be an issue in roster overhauls, like surely if this was the case we wouldn't have identity issues? If Mithy brings a mithy system to a new team, then wouldn't we be playing mithy style league? I think mistrust from bad results and the pressure was probably what killed us last year. We're too afraid to make a call because you don't want to be the one making the call that loses the game, or following the call that loses the game. Mid-season i remember in legends hearing them talk about them having a democratic system, where people would vote on plays during game. Mithy openly opposed this and is why im guessing he struggled to properly shotcall and why we had no identity throughout the year. My guess is that mithy would make a call, or call a map movement/roam whatever, but the team would be like ""nah i dont think we can/i dont think thats a good play"". Now imagine this happening constantly throughout every game and probably scrims, coupled with the teams inability to talk things out bluntly, probably just made mithy lose confidence in himself and everyone lose confidence with mithy. 

Now look this is just my opinion given all the information we have, i could be completely wrong but thats what i think happened last year and hopefully with new voices, but more importantly a new coaching staff, we can give ourselves a new identity. I really think we could've been really really good last year if we had more team cohesion, and mithy was given more confidence in his shotcalling, but the past is the past and we gotta look forward to spring.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Take total advantage of living at home right now and save everything you possibly can. It sounds like you probably already do that. Good for you for hitting 20% down. 

I'm not sure if it's different in your province, but look into getting property insurance, not just item insurance. E.g., for water damage. 

I think buying 2 beds and 2 baths will work in your favour down the road. Whenever you are ready to resell, young families who want a bigger condo (not necessarily in space, but in rooms) will probably be interested. Plus, you have room to grow into it yourself if your partner lives with you, or you have a kid. 

Condo living is much more affordable than house ownership, as long as it fits your lifestyle, but you need to pay attention to the management and pay attention to what's being maintained and what isn't. Stay frugal with your net income and avoid lifestyle creep because condo living can get soooooooo comfortable. Special assessments can catch you off guard. ",1543622790

"ShambhalaBuddhism","t5_30ui4","Honestly I don't know what to make of CTR as easily as I do Osel Mukpo. It seems clear to me that CTR's son was definitely not manifesting as people would like to believe he was. 

Chogyam Trungpa's writingsand lectures are brilliant. But I think also people have overestimated him as well. There was all of this talk that he could predict the future and some huge amount of faith was put into the successors he chose and the system he designed because of this. But his successors have (in my eyes) failed horribly in part because of their attempts to be like him and the systems he left behind (The kasung, Kusung, military, court, etc)  have also been very problematic. 

So although I do think that many of Trungpas teachings on Buddhism were quite powerful, I am upset with him for the patterns he left the next generations to sort out. It is a difficult one for me as I used to be quite enamored with CTR.  But I am seeing this continued idealization of him used as an excuse to maintain the status quo and keep things going as they have even in light of this new sexual abuse scandal. So I think it is important that we talk about him in a way that really emphasizes the ways in which Shambhalians have over idealized him and treated his words as if they were divine commands. 

What I am hearing from you and others is that you want to make sure that there is also space to acknowledge that many of his teachings are still valid. I am coming around to see that there is something to this as well. But I just hope it isn't used to justify following everything he said or did. 

I disagree with some of the teachings Trungpa gave on blind obedience to the guru. He did emphasize this at times and this is a teaching where he differs from many others in both the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages. (As well as other Tibetan lineages). 

I just hope that some ideas like those won't go unchallenged, as they have so far. ",1543622790

Yes, he graduated from Yale and Harvard, but he did so with no distinction.  Getting in to the schools would have been worth noting, but he was admitted because of family connections.  He earned an MBA from Harvard, which is an expensive country club membership card for a guy like him.

His life was a series of poorly run organizations he was given to run into the ground because of his family name.  He wasn't a mouth-breather.  He's not ""dumb"" in the sense that I think you would imagine people think he is, but he isn't and wasn't smart.  His image wasn't a ploy, it was genuine.

They‚Äôll spend the rest of their lives asking themselves if they could have done more, how could they have prevented it, they should have forced you into treatment (even if they rationally know that they couldn‚Äôt have forced you to do so). Your friends, the ones you think you don‚Äôt have or the ones who you think don‚Äôt really care will ask themselves, what if I had called him that day, or the day before. What if I hadn‚Äôt been so busy in my own rat race of a life and reached out? Why didn‚Äôt I call more? Why didn‚Äôt I put off these things that seem so unimportant now, and ask my friend to hang out?  There will always be an empty chair at the table to remind them of the you-sized hole in their life. The note that you left (or realistically won‚Äôt leave, because most times these are split second decisions that leave your loved one wondering for the rest of their lives) that absolves them of their guilt‚Äîit‚Äôs not your fault, I can‚Äôt live like this any more, you‚Äôre better off without me‚Äîwill never absolve them of their guilt. Because they‚Äôre not better off and they would sell their own souls to go back in time and stop you, to have you back. They will lay in bed at night sobbing until they can‚Äôt breathe, their nose and eyes and face raw from tears and snot and desperate attempts to wipe them away. They will feel like every cell in their body is being torn apart, muscles tearing from every heaving sob. 

You can‚Äôt rely on other people for your happiness or reason to live. You‚Äôve got to do the hard work of seeking help, and actually work towards repairing maladaptive coping strategies and sticking to medication regiments to help you. Only you can do that.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.

For example, I noticed that my new 12"" sub was perfection for action movies, but almost completely absent from songs, due to the super low crossover. Yet I don't like songs to have obnoxious noise-complaint levels of bass, which happens if I raise the 12"" crossover too high. After a few hours of tiny dial adjustments, I set the 12"" to target 40hz and below via the dial, while the 10"" crossover is set to 80hz via the receiver. There's very little overlap now, and I get smooth bass all the way down to the rumble frequencies.

And you're exactly right. To fix a problem you start at the start and keep doing little things until it's fixed. 

You can make choices like:

* commit to being in work for 08:00
* commit to going to the gym
* commit to going out with your friends at least once a month without blowing them off

These are just simple things you can do that will prove to you that you do indeed have some control over your life. Once you realise that *you* are in control, not the heroin, an entire world of possibilities that you were previously blind to open up.

1. The official ones that came with the expansions (Tarot size ones), which are more expensive but are worth it (they are a little odd to play because of their size but still fun).
2. Buy a fan made one from ebay or Etsy (I would recommend the sevast101 guy from ebay, he has a cool selection of expansions and they seem to be well made).
3. or print them yourself/send them to a print company. The original set is available online also with some fan-made ones of beta Gwent.

You can also buy Condotierre which was one of the games the Devs use for inspiration. It's cheaper, fun and a lot like Witcher 3 Gwent. It's basically a simpler one row Gwent for 3 people or more (it has Scorch, Decoy, and immunity in 2 Heroes).

Really my bad there. But definitely definitely source the preamble with those same refs you already have, and try to be as clear as possible with it because it helps out the reader who wants to check those sources out.

I'm gonna edit my original comment now as I keep going so you can check back as you like.

Edit: I also wanted to make it clear that I still think you shouldn't make claims in the preamble unless you've already proven them. So if it's something like you talking about Big Hit's statement and pulling a quote from it, then that's easy because all you have to do is put the source and then it's good. But if it's something like the Simon Wiesenthal Center paragraph where you say that they made factual and misinformed assertions, you can't only put the source for just their statement because you need to explicitly lay out exactly what they've said that was misinformed with *additional* sources that show what was the problem with what they said.

"IBO","t5_2s05l","I was in a similar position, moving from SL to HL at the beginning of year 2 (then to Further a few months later). Don't be overwhelmed, first of all. Try to go at your own comfortable pace. I printed out booklets of past-paper questions and worked through them over the summer; this helped a lot. No pressure (although I enjoyed working on them a lot). Have you thought about your option? This will be harder than the other HL topics. I can tell you, having done all the options, that the easiest in my opinion is stats and probability (this is probably what the majority of HL students agree on). However, the other options will be more useful (especially the calc one).

&amp;#x200B;

If you just moved, I would do the HL parts of what you have already covered in SL (e.g. if you covered SL probability, do the remaining HL probability or if you've done SL algebra, do the remaining HL algebra). Once you do this, you can look into the other topics. This is assuming you are teaching yourself. If you're in a class, however, I would recommend making some time to go over what you need to in order to catch up (I finished topics within weekends, so if you have the time and willpower, you should be able to do this).

&amp;#x200B;

Do your option last and devote more time to it. It might take a long time to completely understand it. The Sets option took me about a week to finish completely. Stats took about a weekend. Calc took a little over a week. Discrete took a month :/

In survival, I've had the same coterminous save data for three years. Part of how I keep things interesting is by using the blueprint system to ""warp"" ships between ""systems"" - by that I mean any ship equipped with a jump drive can be blueprinted, removed from the save world using Space Master commands, and a new save file can be used with different skyboxes, planets, mods, encounters, ect - and the ship pasted in there with the previous inventory. Survival mode is then resumed as normal.

This way I can experience different skyboxes and encounter mods while maintaining the same logical constant. I've sent an exploratory ship to the nearby Vanius Nebula, where space pirates are trafficking illicit goods and I have to shut them down. A frigate has gone to the Kenubris system, which consists of an earthlike planet, its two moons, and an alien world with stronger gravity.

"cowboys","t5_2re7g","Obviously you haven't watched the Cowboys for the past 8 years.  For the most part they always play really close games and as a result they have been an average .500 in that time frame. Their defense all year long has been one of the best in the league, however, as good as they have been at one point they were TWO games under .500.  At the half way point of this year they only had won 3 games.  The one thing that has changed since then is their offense is scoring more than what they were before Coop and the changes to the offensive line.

"muacjdiscussion","t5_342em","&gt;It reminds me of the quiet awareness that comes from being the only Indian in a school, and the pressure to act as a representative for all Indians.

I did a degree in the UK not too long ago and I was the only Mexican in my programme. I relate so much to this! The being 15 mins early just to make sure I was never late to class (even though traffic was rarely a problem in the city I lived in), researching more than was necessary for my papers because, as the only Mexican, I didn't want to come across as lazy or tardy, which are some of the many stereotypes that seem to come with my nationality. 

Back to your question, I do feel weird when I see people paint their faces like sugar skulls for Halloween. On the one hand, I'm so used to my culture being ignored that it almost feels like an acknowledgment that we exist. On the other...I don't think anyone does it knowing what they mean or what they're for...so, I can't speak for every Mexican on the planet, but to me it still feels like we're a caricature, because of that and because the rest of the year the general perception is that we're still ""criminals, rapists"", lazy and tardy.",1543622803

Half elf Bladesinger 18 ancients paladin 7

+cha on saves, and absorb elements

Bonkers AC

Magic resistance

Extra attack or booming blade, with smites

And you know 9th level spells. Cast foresight and do the whole dungeon yourself.

Yuan Ti Pureblood Open Palm Monk 18 Ancient Paladin 7

You got empty body, which is ridiculous. Invisible and resist all damage for 1 hour with no concentration 

Yuan ti and ancients paladin mean we got advantage on all saves and resist magic damage all the time

Speaking of saves we got +11 minimum because of aura + all proficiencies 

Quivering palm and stunning fist with an occasional stun will do everything else

Forest gnome (or yuan ti) open palm monk 18 gloom stalker ranger 5 rogue 2 is also extremely good

But if you like Steve/Bucky, you might very well like Finn/Poe if you watch the sequels. I *loved* comicsverse Steve/Bucky (and also Sam with either of them), due to my love for people who try to do the right thing and are also very damaged but incredibly loyal.

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","Why would you choose to remove the initial miss chance from your calculations? It's still required to hit three times in a row. You don't get 3d6 damage 70% of the time, that's just misleading. 

I wouldn't compare it to sneak attack since there's opportunity to get that on any given round, where as this requires at least 3 attacks to get, but realistically probably won't apply until you are more than 5 attacks in, or 3 rounds into attacking the same enemy.

Calling it +4.25 is really misleading because +X weapons refer to attack and damage. And that number is incredibly inflated due to you deciding not to factor in that first hit and assuming you always are hitting on a natural roll of a 5 or higher. If you are not attacking targets with an exceptionally low AC and need let's say an 8, that 0.7 you calculated with would need to be a 0.27.

The likely hood of you landing a crit on the specific attack that triggers the damage is such an edge case that I don't know its worth bringing up, but even then on the very rare chance that it does happen that extra 10.5 damage will make the player feel really great without being a big deal. 

Like really, assuming you land every single attack with this weapon and only ever kill an enemy on that third strike, even then there is a 1 in 60 chance that that aspect will come into play.

And yeah, there are a lot of extraneous things that someone could do to get the best out of this weapon, but if people are trying to make a build and alter their playstyleto take advantage of a potential extra 1d6 damage per turn, on a weapon that's got an average of a +2 bonus providing it always hits, that's hardly broken. 

In fact even with all that going for it, i.e. a character who only hits each target a number of times divisible by 3 and literally can't miss, you would have a +2 weapon that did an extra 1d6 damage with the occasional knock prone. I'd be underwhelmed by that artifact.

The only reason that these SSRIs are available (By far the most prescribed today) is because the drug companies behind them hid the increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicides and completed suicides that occurred in the clinical trials from the regulators to get them on the market. Prozac, Paxil etc.

For example the biggest difference between the SSRIS is the half lifes. Prozac being the longest and Paxil being the shortest.

Eli lilly and GSK hid the increased suicides that occurred in their clinical trials from the regulators.

GSK had evidence paroxetine increases the risk of suicide by older users by as much as 670 percent, yet failed to include that on the warning label."" (if you wondering why it's 670 percent its because they only looked at his age group. if you actaully look at all the suicides in the clinical trials there were I believe 22 and 0 in the placebo.) That doesn't include increase in unsuccessful suicide attempts and increase in wanting to commit suicide.

In trials where suicidal people are filtered out and not participating...

"holdmyfeedingtube","t5_3o2xn","**Positive anymore**

Positive anymore is the use of the adverb anymore in an affirmative context. While any more, or anymore, is typically a negative/interrogative polarity item used in negative, interrogative, or hypothetical contexts, speakers of some dialects of English use it in positive or affirmative contexts, with a meaning similar to nowadays or from now on.Positive anymore occurs in some varieties of North American English, especially in the Midland variety widely spoken in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri and in the varieties of the Mid-Atlantic states; its usage extends to Nevada, Utah and some other western U.S. states. It also occurs in parts of Ireland and Northern Ireland.Regarding prescriptive recommendations on usage, Garner's Modern English Usage echoes the typical prescription that it not be used in writing intended to meet approval with prescriptive readers, scoring it as ""misused"" and Stage 1 (Rejected) on Garner's Language-Change Index (similar to the Heller &amp; Macris index): ""In a linguistic study of Missourians, informants considered this dialectal usage 'well established, though controversial.' See Gilbert Youmans, 'Any More on Anymore,' 61 Am. Speech 61, 61 (1986).

&gt; Second, is there any way that I could get information from only a part of a message that is sent by another user on the server? For example, if someone included information in the same message as a command that summons the bot, could I get the bot to send back only the text after the message?

personally i dont think TLV in their current state are good for the game, one player is essentially removed from the game solely to triple soak so that the other 4 can steamroll the rest of the map. its rarely fun to actually play against them.

In my opinion every hero should have a team fight role and be balanced around thier teamfight potential, after that perhaps look at alternative forms of power to add to them like macro mobility, dueling power, lane sustain, waveclear and things like that, but no hero should be bad at team fighting as a sacrifice for another avenue of power.

He had a knack for missing layups in just the right way that it went straight into Dwights hands.  Knowing Alston, this wasn't completely be accident.

Combine that with the atrocious play of Nelson and how relatively close that series was, I think with Alston remaining as the primary guard the Magic pull out a series win.

Tho then that begs the question -- what would the NBA do when Hedo and Lewis get busted for PED?  Since the magic didn't win a ring those scandals were quickly swept under the rug. ",1543622812

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","Mine was from a blood test from my GI after getting out of the hospital with pancreatitis.  That is a bad story on its own.  

I was still recovering and on A LOT of painkillers, but my memory of it is something like this:

GI: ""...and your glucose is a bit high. Who is treating your diabetes?""

Me: ""I don't have diabetes.""

GI: ""You should really go to a doctor to get your diabetes treated.""

Nothing like getting kicked when you're down.  ",1543622814
