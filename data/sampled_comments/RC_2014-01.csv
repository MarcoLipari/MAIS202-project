"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I hadn't ever heard of them before joining this subreddit. They're not really a big thing in the US, but are apparently very common in many European countries.

A menstrual cup is a small silicone cup with a grip on the bottom (usually a small stick, though some companies offer ball and ring grips too) that you fold up and stick in your vagina; it pops open and catches your menstrual fluid. You empty and rinse it every 12 hours and then reinsert, and sterilize it in boiling water at the end of every cycle. Unlike a pad or a tampon, it can be reused for multiple cycles - some companies boast their cups will last 10 years.

[Diva Cup](http://divacup.com/) is probably the most popular / common brand, but I prefer [MeLuna](http://www.meluna.ca/) because they offer the great variety of sizes and grip styles.

Edit: Just realized in linking to the MeLuna site that the FDA has changed regulations regarding menstrual cups and they can't ship to the US until they get approved. Their FB page says that won't happen until next July at the earliest. Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.","1388534402"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Crates. Are they both ok with being in a crate? You are going to have to get used to doing some real management of space with those two. 

I have had friends who managed a household with multiple dogs with severe aggression. You basically have to have an armed camp mentality about the two dogs. Understand that if they currently are fighting and they don't live together, this won't improve when they have to share space. 

Designate one room as the Chow's room and the other for the Shar Pei. Keep a crate in each one. Rotate the dogs out for time with you guys: if you're watching TV, take one dog out, and hang out with him. After an hour, put that dog back in his room, and get the other dog. 

Don't be fooled for one minute that all of a sudden thru some magical nonsense or other that they will love each other. That's how people wind up in the ER with the plastic surgeon getting lots of stitches. 


Once you guys are living together, and you take them for walks on neutral ground, you can see if they still, no matter what, are aggressive towards each other. If they are, understand that that won't change, especially if you can not afford a trainer. If they seem to be more or less ok with each other, you can gradually increase time together in the house, but **not** when there is food around. 

The reason why I am so cautious is that dogs tend to learn from fights with their housemates. They learn to hate each other more, so you really don't' want it to get to that stage. 

The reason for the crate in a room is in case you have that clueless friend who wanders in and wants to let Fluffy out to chill with Muffy. A locked crate is usually a deterrent even to the most derpy of friends. ","1388534403"

It's not particularly exciting but taking a decent chunk off your mortgage can be quite beneficial for your long term happiness.

Receiving it was, however, quite exciting. We put out a small suitcase at the reception that my wife had decorated which we took with us when we departed. It was a day time wedding so we left at 4pm and had plenty of time and energy left to do the deed in the wedding dress before sitting around drinking champagne, eating cake and counting a suitcase full of money while giggling like school kids.

There were certainly plenty of people who complained about it feeling impersonal. I'm not sure how buying something from a store is more personal but anyway...

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Is it useful to think of human capital as a resource, I heard they are now fighting wars to win ""hearts and minds"". 

There are physical resources but also human resources, wars are fought for both. For example, it is very difficult for an external geographic polity to (exploit) gain profit from accessing an external territories physical resources without the complicity of the local population. So ""hearts and minds"" become a very valuable resource worth fighting for.

If we consider religious wars as primarily ideological, establishing a groups cultural supremacy over a region, could we extend the reasoning to political or capital motivations (what's the difference?). In all cases it seems the outcome biases the available resources an individual can extract from their local environment - individual's affiliated with the dominant cultural group in a region will find it easier to extract, both physical and social, resources from the local environment.

Religion, like political and economic ideology, may be a mechanism used, historically and currently, to coerce less powerful individuals of a polity to do the bidding of the elite - a way to generate and control the behaviour of large, geographically distributed, populations. An enduring form of polity management, if you will.

The problem is, he is having the ball played to his feet, with his back to goal, giving defenders time to close him down and force his hand (foot). Usually meaning he spoons it into the stands, or is tackled. If he made short runs, or got into space, it would be SO much easier for him. Plus missing clear cut chances, and very very rarely taking shots (Ki, Bardsley, Colback and AJ shoot more than he does), it feels he is a wasted position.

Get into space Jozy, make runs, get your balls back and start shooting. If you shoot 20 times a match, and score 2....YOU'VE SCORED TWO!!!","1388534405"

If my wife (who kept her name) purchased a ticket, she couldn't transfer it to me any more than I could transfer it to her.  If we had children, and they carried my name, she couldn't transfer it to them.  If they carried her name, I couldn't.  Seems completely even.  

This is a policy that is clearly designed to reduce fraud.  And there doesn't seem to be an easy way around it.  If you open it up so that the spouses need not share each other's name, but still want to ensure that only couples take advantage of the option, then you need to arrange for people to provide proof of marriage.  I don't have the first clue where my marriage certificate is, and even if I did, I don't like the idea of some random airline having a copy of it.  But, assuming you get past that issue, now we can start talking about how to deal with common-law folks.  After all, excluding them because of religion isn't fair either.  So what for them?  Perhaps submitting last years tax statements?  Selfies in front of the house?

&gt; 
&gt; Tello, who rejected the chance to join the Reds on a season-long loan in the summer of 2012, has found his opportunities limited under Gerardo Martino this term.

If you want to convince someone what they're saying is ignorant then calling them ignorant is a good way to make that person stick their fingers in their ears and pretend they can't hear you

The problem isn't that this person is ignorant (We all are at some point or another), the problem is that this person is ignorant AND
 arrogant. She believed the things she was told and simply repeated what she thought was fact. 

If we Ents want Marijuana to be positively accepted then we must understand a lot of people were lied to by authoritative figures. We must teach the ignorant, replace the lies with sourced evidence and experience, we must be gentle, we cannot go HAM at ignorance

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt; Yes I'm familiar with ""Eternal September"" and other elite buzzwords used to denigrate democratic management of content.

Dude, that's a biased, superficial, and simply fallacious understanding of the term. **First**, the social content is democratically produced both *before* and *after* any Eternal September effect. (Example: reddit policy did not substantially change before/after its own ES.) Thus ES cannot possibly mean what you think it to mean, to ""denigrate democratically-produced content""—the two are totally orthogonal concerns (they don't imply the other).

**Objectively**, Eternal September is just a social phenomenon. Any thoughtful person would realize there are both desirable and undesirable aspects to website/forum scaling. In particular, and you conveniently gloss over this point, it is important to understand that  *lowest-common-denominator*-produced content is not the same as *democratically*-produced content—that's the moral of the story of Eternal September. Does that make sense so far? So, while ES is sometimes used *by* some smart but elitist redditors, there is nevertheless an underlying reality for what's going on. The phenomenon is what matters for analysis.

**More generally**, content quality is always evaluated separate from the content system, not the other way around. In your sloppy reasoning you have conflated the two without  *justification*. 

**Even though you claim familiarity, you didn't raise nor acknowledge any of these 3 basic issues. I did. See the difference? I'm just saying, maybe you should think on this a little, before continuing to claim there's something wrong with what I've said and continue to say.**","1388534413"

Overall, this was a rebuilding year for my channel.  Pre-2013, my channel was mostly for Mario Paint videos and original music.  This was the first full year on YouTube where I did Let's Plays.  

There was never a goal of subscribers or views (as you can see, Mario Paint videos are still more popular then any of my LP videos).  I only had one goal for 2013, and that was to upload every day.  And I pretty much did that.

[Here is my upload schedule for 2013.](http://imgur.com/2Esj1JV.jpg)

Besides two days in February, I achieved what I had set out to do.  I celebrated 1 year of Let's Plays in October, and I'm about to start my 13th game in my main LP series.

Here's hoping all that rebuilding pays off in 2014.

Washington should've stepped down for the incompetent commander that he was.  He was actually almost replaced during the war, but lucked out in squelching his replacement's letters and getting others to turn against him.

Franklin had special interests in monetary printing and manipulated the Quakers.

What stood out to me the most, though, in *Conceived in Liberty* was how disgusting the governors were to the natives (poisoning chieftains at peace dinners, murdering peaceful tribes that were trading or, at times, saved colonists from starvation) and how the Puritans would torture to death many pacifist Quakers.","1388534417"

I mean opening three girls with less than 10 second break in between leaving the last girl and opening the next. So open girl #1, talk for however long(if it's the first girl of the night it'll typically be short unless I've picked a girl who is bored or horny because I'll be awkward), bounce off and start talking to the first girl I see which will be girl #2, etc.

&gt; I noticed I've had a better night when doing it right before and my anxiety was not so strong... or maybe just my willpower was stronger and negative-self talk was much quieter.

Based on the science and my own experience, it was probably all of those things. The practice really is phenominal.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Show me a minimum wage worker that will argue against a minimum wage increase because it would potentially be to the detriment of the company they work for. I'll bet that person doesn't exist.

TBH, that's probably because most of those people don't understand the consequences. A company that employs 1000 workers at minimum wage, won't employ 1000 at minimum wage + $1. If this company were to tell its employees that it's raising wages by $1, but also firing these specific 100 people in the process, you'd have 100 people who wouldn't want the wage increase. Likewise, if McDonalds and all of the other fast food joints told their employees who's getting laid off should a minimum wage increase be instated, guess who's not voting for that? Of course anybody wants a wage increase when they're under the assumption that they still keep their job.","1388534418"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; A bitcoin is worth a boombox or a goat or seven hundred dollars.

If only that were true! Everyone figures out what they want to make in dollars first and then back figures what that is in bitcoins. Over the one year period when bitcoin went from $10 to $1000, did merchants keep their BTC/goat prices the same? Because I'm guessing the USD/goat price stayed much flatter.

&gt; Bitcoin doesn't need fiat currency to exist.

It most certainly does. At least at this point in time and for the foreseeable future it does.

&gt; The euro can be priced in terms of dollars too, but that doesn't mean it's backed by dollars.

Because inside the eurozone they don't use dollars to buy and sell things, and for the most part they don't care what the current exchange rate is. Fluctuations between those currencies directly impact some areas like imports/exports/tourism, but those take a while to adjust and don't immediately impact the rest of the economy. With bitcoins everyone immediately adjusts their prices for everything to match dollars every second. Imagine the equivalent, a european supermarket where prices were really based in dollars and their prices in euros changed every second based on what the euro was currently trading at. Now imagine every single aspect of the entire eurozone being immediately tied to and converted back to the dollar, then yes, I'd say the euro was backed by the dollar.

As I said before, the only reason these stores exist is because they can currently get their bitcoins out into some fiat currency. So in that case, yes, bitcoins are backed by fiat currencies. If Euros couldn't be exchanged for dollars, people inside the eurozone wouldn't immediately stop using euros.

&gt;If Columbus lands on a new continent, is it legiti­mate for him to proclaim all the new continent his own, or even that sector “as far as his eye can see”? Clearly, this would not be the case in the free society that we are postulating. Columbus or Crusoe would have to use the land, to “cultivate” it in some way, before he could be asserted to own it. This “cultivation” does not have to involve tilling the soil, although that is one possible form of cultivation. If the natural resource is land, he may clear it for a house or a pasture, or care for some plots of timber, etc. If there is more land than can be used by a limited labor sup­ply, then the unused land must simply remain unowned until a first user arrives on the scene. Any attempt to claim a new re­source that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree that if we are to have a min wage, it should be tied to inflation or else like you said it would fall in real value every year.

However, I guess then the real point for discussion is how much minimum wage should be able to cover.

I think it should be able to cover just enough for shelther and food IF you are living smart. This means, no extras such as cable tv (admittingly some sort of internet should be part of the min), no data plan for your cell, basic clothes, 1 ply toilet paper, etc.

Of course depending on the city, we would probabbly need to adjust the minimum wage for that as well since the cost of living for each city can vastly vary.

The problem of increasing min wage so much that people can afford luxuries creates an allocation problem.

Lets use the extreme example of saying some how the left gets min wage such that someone can afford a small house, with a wife and 2 kids.

Well shit, if that is the case, there is going to be a rush for anyone to get the easiest jobs possible because for many, that is all they want in life.

Now the medium hard jobs that paid this much before the min wage increase will now see a shortage because all of the people who were working those jobs went to the easy jobs.

The issue here is that people tend to be rational in the sense, they look at effort and reward. Every rational person would want to get the most reward for the least effort. This is also why communism will never work.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I did/do have a fear of people knowing. Until earlier this year I did not speak of what had happened to me. It took me almost 12 years to speak of it. Now the people closest to me know but it was extremely hard to tell them. Once I told them and realized that they are still behind me and love me lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders. 
The guy that unexpectedly came into my life earlier this year flipped my world upside down. Until him I accepted that I was going to be single my whole life (I also had vaginismus to the point that I could not even use a tampon) and I was fine with that. Once my ex came in I got the courage to face my past and change my future. 
I have accepted what had happened in my past but I do worry how future SO's will take it. I dont think they will see me as dirty but as broken... does that make sense?? Although I have accepted what has happened I want it to be my past, I do not want it to influence any part of my life anymore. I fear that I will be looked at as broken, not strong, fragile, someone that a person has to tip toe around. Which to me is weird because I like being submissive in bed.... it doesn't make sense to me and that is another reason where I feel that they cannot be connected. I don't want to be viewed as fragile but I want a loss of control. 
My life changed so fast and dramatically this year I haven't really had time to process it all I guess. Now that the guy that changed everything for me and was with me every step of the way is not with me anymore I really don't know how or what to say to future boyfriends. Not long after we broke up I purposely went and had a one nightstand to prove to myself that I could. Im sorry I am rambling on.... not sure if any of this stuff makes any sense or if it is even relevant. I guess when I posted all of this I was hoping for agreement and validation that what happened to me is in my past and no longer has any affect on me. Not sure where I go from here. 
I am so sorry all that had happened to you... I cant even imagine. If you don't mind me asking how long ago was that? Do you think with more time it will have less of an impact on you?

There is no context or example given here. So yes, I do have to take it literally. You've never taken introduction to philosophy. 

Moreover, your archaic thinking is interesting to me. It's the 21st century and yet people like you still hold that mentality...

So let's take the following example:

Matt dates Katty. Katty dates Paul. Matt has friends, hobbies, etc.. and only ""invest himself"" 50% of his free time to Katty.

Katty does the same thing. For the remaning 50% of her free time, she decides to sacrifice piano class, and spend 20% of her time with Paul. Matt is the primary and Paul the secondary. Paul is fine with that arrangement. He's also dating Stephanie...

Got that? It's equal.

In my wildest dreams you could turn off the commentators like an alternate audio track and just listen to the sounds of the fans as they react to the game, and the stadium announcers would tell you everything that was necessary.  Rather than telling me that Peyton Manning is having a good game during a play let me listen to the fans and the sound of pads and helmets on my big screen with surround sound.  Announcers are a product of radio, let them stay on the radio.  Let me watch and listen to the game.","1388534434"

Meanwhile that asshole guy no one likes always gets a girl because he does not care about rejection and asks a lot of girls out.  My brother marveled that the asshole always had a girlfriend and could not figure out why until he noticed that asshole always flirting while he had other friends who were crushed one time by a girl and lost their confidence.

The earlier games were very slow paced and deep strategy games where civilization affected play style quite a bit, but didn't have a totally different play style, and that is how balance was so perfected.  3 was made in 2005, significantly before microtransactions were even a thing, but it just felt incomplete.  It looked pretty, sounded nice, and seemed to have solid mechanics, but it really fell apart as soon as you started playing it.  Block training made sense, but didn't work, part of the point of the early games was slow unit progression, it didn't want to just be another starcraft or total annihilation with huge armies and a bunch of explosions, it wanted to be something in which the conflict took place on a smaller scale and economy actually mattered quite a bit.  Much more defined civilizations seemed smart, but really just made it extremely difficult to balance, and difficult to balance often leads to poor balance, as shown in this game.  The city system looked to be a neat way to get more resources when the finite ones ran out, but ended up artificially gimping new players, and rewarding combat excessively.  The cannons were neat, but were kind of pointless, the only ones actually useful were mortars since they actually could fuck up buildings effectively.  Relying on different attack types for different purposes, instead of making everything based on resists and strengths seems to be smart but was bad too, ranged shouldn't have a viable way to defend itself at close combat, that is the whole point!","1388534435"

Twilight stared at him for a moment. ""Yes, a M.A.G.I.C machine. And it's supposed to make cash withdrawals easy for anypony. Since it works automagically, one just has to put their hoof on the screen, then follow the directions on the screen and select how many bits they want to deposit, withdraw or transfer.""

""And why did you make it?""

Like others have said, the first comment he makes is on the sum total of all the IVs.

Decent=0-90

Above Average=91-120

Relatively Superior=121-150

Outstanding=151-186

For the two you listed, you would notate them like this:

Honedge (1): x/x/x/x/31/31 (so, 2x31 IVs)

Honedge (2): x/31/x/x/31/31 (so, 3x31 IVs)

Now, what isn't known (at least, now that the Instacheck tool is dead), is how high all those Xs are.

The first one is ""better"", because those Xs are probably higher than the Xs of the second one. 

I'd probably keep breeding though. Neither of them have a low speed (which you want in a Honedge) or a 31 Defense.

""Sorry, man. I'm at work/with my Mom/sick.""

Two minutes later.....

""Woooo! Awesome night at the bar!""

I fall for it every time.



I've slowly discovered that these ""friends"" of mine are simply drains on myself. I have unfortunately surrounded myself with a few people who constantly turn me down by lying or ignoring me and it really doesn't feel good.

Things turned around for me once I met my roommate. He is the kind of guy who is genuinely truthful when you ask questions and he will generally give straightforward answers. He also sucks at lying.

Once I got to get to know my roommate, he introduced me to people he knew, and my circle of friends has increased. If I want to hang out with someone, odds are good that someone is willing to hang out too now.  Not to mention these new friends don't expect me to pay for beer anymore.

Sure, I've thought about suicide, but for other reasons, and I don't see how killing oneself is going to show someone how they are a bad person. Killing yourself to stick it to one person is not a good idea. There are much less harmful ways to stick it to someone and you still get to see the results of your handy work. I DO NOT ADVOCATE THE RUINING OF ANOTHER'S LIFE.

Really want to show them? Call them out when you absolutely know they are avoiding you/hanging out. Let them know how you feel. Tell them that you'd prefer a straightforward answer instead of that dodgy bullshit. I prefer to be told, ""Sorry, man. Out with Jim right now."" That way I can go back to Reddit.

Don't expect them to constantly be available though. Set up hangout dates. Remember, if they are actually busy, then let them be. Don't pester them, they will see you as clingy. That will make things worse.Let them know you are available to hang out. When they want to as well, they will let you know.

I suggest finding someone who is truthful with you. Build your future relationships off of your experiences with them.

If you have any question, or just want to chit chat, feel free to fire away.","1388534447"

But to what end? Ideologies can spread without violence, but when they're spread by war resources are always a primary objective. The South's war to demand state's rights were specifically about maintaining slaves; the North fought to maintain its territory and resources. Nazis had their Lebensraum. Every camp that has gone to war to spread their ideology/religion has done it to gain resources.

Even religious wars are also primarily about resources, both directly and indirectly. The crusades themselves were about claiming [holy] land in the name of Christendom. Religious wars are also about affecting the marketplace of ideas by force. If I kill or forcibly convert all Sunnis there are more Christians or more room for Christians to expand. You only have to look at all the medieval Gothic cathedrals to see that religion was a lucrative business for those getting tithes &amp; handing out indulgences.

&gt;not much about acquiring resources

Wars usually have an aggressor and a defender. In this instance the War on Terror is supposed to be a defensive war against extremists to maintain the status quo, or to defend interests/assets/resources already held. The expense of the war could still be a good price to pay depending on how much you value preventing terrorist attacks, and if you could reason the War on Terror actually stopped potential domestic attacks.","1388534452"

What I mean is, if the problem were simply ""our sex isn't completely satisfying, but we're working on it,"" then it would be shallow to break off an engagement for that reason alone.  The problem is actually, ""I'm unhappy about part of our life together, my significant-other knows I'm extremely unhappy, and yet he/she won't make any effort to improve things.""

It doesn't really matter that the thing you're unhappy about is sex.  What matters is that your significant-other is disinterested in working with you on the problem.  And that *is* potentially serious enough to warrant breaking off an engagement.","1388534453"

I agree with mostly everything you've said. The only thing that i would disagree with that although riot is greedy, they're not overly greedy. I would say they are slightly above the average greed of any business.

Their model of generating revenue (imba champs, IP gain rates, etc...) is highly effective. Does that make them greedy, yes...does that make them super greedy? Not really. Other games have done far more greedier things generate revenue (look at any cash shop MMORPG and even TF2).

Does this justify any of the issues at hand (imba champs, Ip gains, revenue tactics) NO. Does this make Riot a horrible company? NO as well. It's how they do business and us users are left to decide to stay or leave.

And to be honest...in the last few weeks I've been looking for another game to play. My buddies and I ended taking our laptops to each other's house to have a lan party for BroodWars...LOL","1388534455"

All you have to do to make more money is convince a business owner or manager that hiring you at $X an hour will benefit the business financially.  That's all there is to it.  But most people complaining about being stuck at minimum wage cannot make this argument.  Instead, they simply say ""tell me where to be and what to do for 8 hours a day and sign my paycheck for $X"".  Why?  ""Because I'm a human being and I feel I am entitled to that.""

The thing most people don't consider when arguing that minimum wage should be raised is that when you raise minimum wage, the cost of living goes up with it. Companies don't have endless money, and they will always put profit margins first. So, they will either cut the hours of their current employees in an attempt to provide the same service with less labor and/or raise their prices to compensate for their raised labor expenses. So, sure, if all the cashiers who were previously making $8/hr were suddenly making $15/hr, they'd be getting a higher dollar amount for their time spent but they will either lose hours or end up spending more when they need to buy something due to raised prices.","1388534456"

* Church Fathers and earlier heresies (i.e. Gnosticism, Marcionism, Arianism etc...). Also including arguments Church Fathers held for the true Christianity. And it'd be awesome if there was St. Nicholas laying the smack down on Arius. 

* Persecutions of Christians

* Constantine's conversion and legalization of Christianity

* Ecumenical Councils 

* Charlemagne (and some his ancestors such as Pepin the short)

* Justinian's Hagia Sophia and how he said something along the lines of ""Solomon I have surpassed you""

* Islam and Christian-Islamic Tension

* Great Schism of 1054

* Crusades

* Inquisition

* Great Western Schism (Anti-Popes and the true popes) and the Council of Constance

* The ""Renaissance popes"" that weren't known for being too great...

* Martin Luther (views on him would differ since Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants would disagree)

* King Henry VIII and the rise of the Church of England

* Council of Trent (if it was a Catholic Bible)

* Napoleon

* Nazism, Fascism, Communism and the Christian response

* Maybe some Gandhi

* Vatican Council I and II

* Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandal 

* Also some false teachers like Harold Camping

* Stuff about atheists over the years (Voltaire to the ""new"" atheists such as Hitchens, Harris, Dawkins) 

* Homosexuality and Abortion (Roe V. Wade)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but there's probably a lot more interesting historical events. ","1388534463"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","LOL, you have no idea what Islam is do you.    
You should take the time to learn about other cultures and religions before commenting on them.    
The same text that says jews and christians should not eat pork also is followed by muslims.    

Muhammad was an arab at a time when the arab pennisula was full of many tribes some who followed no religion, some were christians, some followed judaism, and some followed other religions.      
Muhammad was born into the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe.  
The Quraysh tribe was a group of people who were merchants.    
The Quaraysh's main god was Hubal. There were other pagan gods and the tribe had idols for Hbual and the other gods at Kaaba (AKA mecca).   Muhammad was a salesman/merchant his entire life.  
Muhammad once met a man who was a christian that told Muhammad that he was a profit according to the bible and that is what essentially started the idea of Islam.   Muhammad was raised with the knowledge of many different religions.     
Many years later at the age of 40, Muhammad then built off the old testament of the bible and said he was a prophet as described in the bible which was an idea first given to him by a christian.      
Thus why muslims do not eat pork is the same reasons that jews and christians cant eat pork, the old testament says pigs are unclean animals that spread disease.    
Although christians choose not to follow the old testament requirement of not eating pork just as any other religious person can do.     

...~~~===*  
The more you know.   

Islam was started around 650 AD, but as I have shown you it is built off of judaism/christianity so its religious history goes back way farther than 650AD and actually it goes back to the beginning when judaism was invented around 1000 BC.  ","1388534466"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The plot of the story involves Bond helping the FBI figure out who is behind a string of data thefts involving stealing government secrets from the U.S. and its allies. The attacks have nearly destroyed the infrastructure and nearly wiped out all bank's digital data, nearly collapsing the U.S. dollar instantly. The attacks are also affecting everyone else to a lesser degree, except China, which has reported no attacks of any kind.

A majority led by the U.S. and surprisingly, Russia, in the U.N. are not buying the Chinese counter-argument, as the Chinese consider themselves as innocent.

Most people in the U.S. and are convinced that the Chinese are behind it, based upon popular U.S. sensationalism, fear-mongering, and xenophobia, while a few believe otherwise. Obama is taking flack from this chaos, and his administration is pressuring him to to expand the NSA's capabilities to ""unlimited and unchecked,"" and U.S. military's presence near China to ""invasion-ready."" The U.S.' allies are trying to pin this blame on China with the help of Israel. A non-believer, a female IT security specialist for the U.S. Navy, is working alongside bond to help figure this out.

A trip to Israel leads Bond and this specialist to the suspected attack's source location to a villa here. They get involved with a high-ranking corrupt government official from the Israeli government there. He is found out to be apart of the attacks, and is also gaining much from pocketing U.S. foreign aid for himself and selling U.S. supplied arms and technology to well-known terrorist groups in the region. It is revealed that he also apart of a secret plot to destabilize the Saudi kingdom as well.

Bond kills him, but now has to outrun Israeli special forces.
Their efforts are made worse, as a tall-Jaws-like individual who has half of his body replaced with cybernetic parts, is piloting an attack helicopter, and is pursuing them. Boris, the disfigured-faced being is piloting an attack helicopter, and wants them dead! He is stopped when the pair leads him to his demise after being chased and lead to a crash during a canyon chase.  

From their efforts there, they gain a lead to the Chinese mainland to a laid-off, advanced in age, network security specialist who lives in an a small house outside the  outskirts of Beijing. He mentions to Bond about is monitoring of the attacks in real-time in his spare time. He shows them a map of the past and concurrent attacks, suspecting that were not from China, but all suspiciously originating from an unknown location in Russia.

Bond is informed by MI6 to meet with a contact in Moscow about the source of the actual attacks. Going to the location supplied, they wait in an abandoned warehouse, where they meet their contact, who reveals themselves as Edward Snowden. Snowden tells them that China is being framed, and that Russia is at fault. He also reveals information about Chinese banks being nearly cleaned out, and their military suffering similar cyber attacks experienced by the U.S.' military as well. He also reveals that part of his NSA leaks showed that the NSA was also involved in a recent cyber war against an outside ""entity"" described as ""equally capable as theirs."" Not only that, there are also many traitors inside the organization who are working against the U.S. for ""extremely generous"" amounts of money from this ""entity,"" with the list showing the current director receiving as much as a billion US dollars. 

Their meeting is ended by pursuing Russian special forces, with a burnt, angry Boris leading the group. Boris is seen blowing up the door, using a rocket fired from a ridiculously over-sized assault rifle, leading the assault. In the scramble, the Navy IT specialist is captured, Snowden is killed in action, but Bond manages to get away. He feels something weird in his coat pocket, and discovers a thumb drive that Snowden must have slipped to him unknowingly.

His search takes him to Putin's office in the Kremlin. He is caught during an infiltration attempt. Putin turns around in his chair, while sipping a cup of tea and smiles as bullet-resistant wall comes down and separates his desk and Bond. Boris comes out from a secret wall panel, and faces Bond as Putin's entertainment. Putin escapes during this time. Bond uses his wits to defeat Boris, and finds an escape route through Boris' secret panel.

Bond finds Putin's actual hideout later, a highly secure underground state-of-the-art server warehouse, thanks to an earlier information tip received from Snowden. Bond sneaks in successfully, but finds out that the Navy IT specialist is being forced at gun-point to hack the NSA for control of the U.S.' surveillance capabilities. Putin is also heard speaking of China as ""his personal flak scapegoat for the American's anger towards Russian interests"". He encourages a group of hackers before him as they toil away as something unknown. He also mentions something else about, ""Russia influencing the world with American charm, but with American capabilities at his disposal.""  

Bond neutralizes nearby security, including the guard holding the Naval IT specialist at gunpoint, and confronts Putin, with him revealing the plot, ""To control the eyes of the world, the minds of their bodies, and wealth of their currencies..""

In the news, China is facing internal mass panic and government protests, and another series of cyber attacks have happening worldwide...

Outside China's oceanic borders, ""warning"" skirmishes have increased between U.S. and Chinese air and naval forces. Reports of rumored casualties on both sides and the idea of the U.S. ""wiping China off the map"" under worldwide sensationalism, hits the news...  

Bond has to chase Putin throughout this facility, and into a server room with a monitor in a center. On the monitor is a map of the world, with paths tracing from the facility to every country all over the world. A bloody fist fight goes on between the two, but Bond defeats Putin. He manages to copy some information from a nearby computer, but Putin survives for a bit to activates the 30-minute self-destruct sequence.

Bond and the IT specialist escape the slowly exploding facility in a Russian MiG parked nearby and head towards the nearby U.S. naval group outside China. They are targeted and fired upon, but escape through ejection. Landing on a battleship, the U.S. Naval IT specialist shows her credentials, and reveals Bond's information to everyone. The plot is broadcast around the world for all to see.

In the end, life goes back to normal, and everyone maintains life as before.

The IT specialist and Bond are seen vacationing in Hawaii.","1388534470"

"skyrim","t5_2s837","1st. Titus Mede II was a great warrior and lead the assault to reclaim the Imperial City with Legions from Hammerfell, Skyrim and High Rock. He even personally captured Lord Naarifin  (the General of the Aldmer armies that invaded Cyrodiil) and he destroyed the whole Aldmeri army in the Imperial City.

2nd. There is a huge difference between accepting a treaty at the mere threat of war and accepting the treaty at the end of one of the most bloodiest war in Tamrielic history. If the Emperor didn't accept the treaty then the Empire would have been destroyed and the whole of Tamriel would have been under Thalmor rule, even Skyrim as one nation cannot stand against the whole Aldmeri Dominion.

3rd. Everyone can learn the Way of the Voice! After all the Dragonborn can be any race, be it Nord or High Elf. 

4th. Skyrim would be defeated by the Aldmeri in months if not weeks if Skyrim became a independent kingdom (not part of the Empire, not it's concern).

Edit: And Skyrim alone would be unable to restore the Empire to greatness as that would need a combined assault of all the former provinces, many of which are now under Dominion control.

2nd Edit: The redguards could only defeat the Thalmor in Hammerfell because the combined effort of all the Legions weakened the Dominion during the Battle of the Red Ring. ","1388534476"

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","&gt; Please tell me how the point above is innacurate. 

Since you asked.  It is inaccurate because it assumes that if a person has a 3D printer they would some how magically be prevented from

&gt;problem solving and getting your hands on machinery

and 

&gt;teach you more about machinery than just reading and learning about it from a book

Is just plain irrelevant because no one ever mentioned learning anything from a book until you did just then.

&gt;Lol... so you think training and choosing a more difficult path is complete and utter bullshit?

No, I think avoiding the use of a working tool to purposefully make learning about that same tool more difficult is utter bullshit.

&gt;I'm sorry, you could have gotten better at 3D printing and maybe even picked up a second machine for the same price,

It's been a week since I got my printer and now I have most of the 3D printed parts for a second 3D printer.  But you think that building a 3D printer from plans on the internet with no access to a working example would some how be faster and better?  Yes that is fantasy.

&gt;Because you keep pushing this false scenario, the idea that only an idiot would want to spend less money on a less consistent, more touchy machine. Why are you steamrolling this opinion? 

I'm not, your comprehension disability is getting in the way again.

&gt;Of course, not in your world. If you have the money, you absolutely need to buy a solidoodle first because the knowledge gained from building a printer is completely trivial.

So let me get this straight.  OP says he plans to buy a printer in the $500-$600 price range. He says, ""but I'd rather have a working one before attempting something like that."" (making a printer from scratch)

To which you say,

&gt;No point to this unless impatience is a virtue worth cultivating.

And you say **I'm** the one being a dick?  You're off your rocker.

You keep saying that what the OP wants and what I've suggested are some how inferior to your own suggestion.  Who is the one ""pushing this false scenario"" again?

&gt;You realize that I would buy a solidoodle if it was economically in my interests, and that I have absolutely no problem with owning one eventually?

So I think the picture is starting to clear up now.  You can't afford what the OP can afford so you are trying to limit his choice to the same ones you have.

&gt;What the fuck is wrong with you buddy?

That question is better asked of yourself.","1388534479"

Yamcha overcame his fear of women for her and worked as a baseball player for a living.  I thought his fear of death wasn't so much cowardice as him thinking about his future...Krillin couldn't match up post-Androids but he kept going out to fight where Yamcha stayed behind.  I'm not sure if Krillin was more brave or just stupid putting himself in line of death so willingly.

Most of the guys in DB tend to get caught up in doing ""stuff"" and leave their wives and girlfriends on the sidelines.  I think the Bulma x Yamcha relationship could have used a lot more work.....at the very least!","1388534484"

If the fetus is viable outside of the mother's womb then that's the point at which we determine that it is a separate life; unique and wholly independent from the mother. Until then it is a parasite on the mother. This is *NOT MEANT TO SOUND COLD* (emphasis to get it through thick heads). It is an accurate representation of placental birth. Indeed, the more children a woman has, the stronger her body's immune system becomes to it as her body attempts to reject the fetus. The placenta evolved as a barrier between the fetus and the mother's immune system, look it up.

But most importantly the consequences of legally defining a fetus as a person would be to *force* women to carry to term. Is this really what we want as a society? Do we want to subjugate women? Because it seems to me that we can do better than that.","1388534490"

Also, if you are at all concerned with ""income and wealth disparity,"" the focus should be on the spending side, not the collection side.  The US's tax structure is actually one of the more progressive ones in the world, but its spending is one of the least.

If the unlearned are preserved, then you do a disservice to people by informing them of your religion (and your god may as well have just preserved everyone without the trouble of a religion -- maybe your god is a bit slow on the uptake?). If they are not preserved, your deity is either incapable of saving them or prefers to let them burn.

A Manichaean view might have an evil deity with more power over the world at the moment and a good deity which will eventually triumph. If you perform certain actions, you dedicate yourself and commit your soul to the good deity, but by default your soul goes to the evil one. This doesn't fit with, for instance, Christianity, in which the devil is either a rebel fully within God's power to smite instantly (under the standard modern view) or an employee of God doing his assigned tasks (as outlined in Job).","1388534493"

For example, since I am unable to find much information at all of the so-called recycling and dismantling process, one possibility could be that in a few years time the amount of bulb waste is overwhelming the ability to process them so the storage will build which will, undoubtedly, result in accidental breakage. It is already estimated that between 17-34 percent of new bulbs transported from manufacturer to consumer result in mercury entering the environment.

These bulbs are being pushed upon the market without a regulated and mandated recycling process for preventing mercury from entering the environment in a safe and secure manner. Even if the process to remove mercury from the products is accomplished as advertised it is supposedly shipped to the U.S. and who knows what happens once there.

The best option, at least to me, is to use LEDs which have a longer life-span and an even larger net reduction of harm to the air, land and water environments.","1388534495"

1) Removal from Reliance on Physical Hardware &amp; portability.  
1a) Two benefits: one is that you no longer have issues if you restore to an ""identical"" machine  (with a random firmware at a different version than the origional). Two: you can restore to ANY* virtual host.  
2) Hardware/space/cooling savings: For example: You have inherited 20 undocumented EOL servers that use 1GHz CPU; 1.5GB memory on average - and perhaps a few hundred GB of disk. You can legitimately virtualize the EOL servers and put them on two 2U servers for under $10K instead of 20 new servers at $20-40K.  This saves space and money.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","My father wasn't around for most of my life, either. You yourself, especially if you're around mostly women, are going to hear a lot of:

""Oh, just treat her nice, and she'll eventually come around!""

or something along those lines. Not so. Being nice is what girls look for from their boyfriends, not males whom they're interested in. ""Nice"", especially to young guys like yourself, often makes us think of stuff like every door in their path, buying them movie tickets and dinners all the time, and so on. *Don't do this.* It makes you into a doormat. Imagine a girl did this for you. It'd be really easy to just view her as a 'backup' and a self-esteem booster after a bit, right? If your * male friend* did it, you'd start to consider it weird as shit. Same thing. 

Basically, just don't treat her like shit, and be *kind*. That means don't outright insult her (teasing is different, but tread lightly), talk over her, dismiss her, or ditch her if you make plans. Beyond that, your goal is to make her want you, and man, you're 13. Girls are probably swooning over Justin Bieber and those One-Direction kids. I'm not saying 'try hard' or anything, but be basically be confident in what you do.

Oh, and you've not mentioned it's an issue, but maybe pass it along to your friends who may be having an issue. If you're being bullied and male, it is *not* because the guys are 'jealous' or anything like that. Single mothers *love* telling that to their sons who are being bullied. Kids get picked on usually because they're easy targets, and often either: 

* Don't retaliate, or even say anything
* Spazz out

The best approach is to dish it back out. If it gets physical, well, try not to let it get too bad, but often that's the only way to end bullying that gets out of hand. ","1388534498"

Infant circumcision also carries risks of many surgical errors that could be avoided by performing the surgery on someone old enough to want his foreskin amputated. Much higher risk complications from cutting infants include include overtight cutting, total frenulum ablation, meatal stenosis, skin bridges, keloid scars, an asymmetrical, irregular cut, and nicks and gouges. It's not possible to use strong anesthetics for infants. Most people assume recovery is less painful for infants because they don't get erections. Infants do get erections. Babies start getting erections before they are born. The exposure from circumcision usually makes the inner parts of the penis age much more quickly.

You might want to consider slightly less popular games if you want to help other gamers out, or perhaps mix them in with the ones you really want to play. Or games that aren't popular on youtube at least.

I wouldn't do something like dominion as it is so easy to just go play it online, unless you are expert players of a game.  Same for most of the stuff on iOS/android as people can just go play it easily.   Games that can be played solo would probably be of interest to people as they can see what it would be like if they did have someone to play against, and I assume most of them have 1 player videos out there as they are easy to produce. I recall giving up trying to find 2 player videos for the LOTR LCG, it was just so many 1 player ones, or even just videos of people playing digitally.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I, personally, dislike his work. Before I became a professional photographer I thought it was cool. Over the years, I've learned to really dislike it because I feel like he's doing the same piece over and over (kind of like lady gaga: weird shit; rinse~~rise~~, repeat).

My point, however, is that any new photographer can practice the technical aspects of what makes him good. And you can swap his thousands of dollars of props and other shit with whatever you want and really take your time lighting *one* subject in a creative way. Push that lighting to the higher / brighter end of correct exposure and the layperson would not be able to tell the difference between you and him.

Another thing that he's good at is composition. We say, ""tell a story"". If he's done nothing else, he's done well at telling stories with his photographs. But this doesn't mean in a narrative sense, it means that there should be something in how the elements of the photo are arranged that pulls you in and causes you too want to look. Anyone can accomplish this with an iphone and arranging strips of paper (*as an example).

On my professional site, one of my photos in my portfolio is taken with an iPhone. I don't tell anyone that it was, it's just included like all the rest (that were taken with multi-thousand dollar cameras).

I don't mean to draw a direct comparison to him because you're right: he uses a budget on each shoot that would break most pros, but the fundamentals that any ""pro"" should practice always apply.","1388534504"

Components don't sell too well because the people building caps typically do so using their own component BPO and usually do it in place since components are larger than minerals. Many of them are used in carriers/dreads, so people don't typically buy them in jita to ship them to lowsec...

So even if you built full time using your bpo, you'd just saturate the market with them. The market for many of them IS saturated already, including the end product. That is especially true for freighters and orcas, since many people treat capital production as the ""end game"" of manufacturing and the market is simply overrun.

Carrier production is still pretty profitable if you can do the logistics required, but the components themselves sell badly and slowly.

Doubtful. If it is a high paying job you risk losing it to people who are just as qualified but will work for less. Attorneys used to be considered a safe profession and now look at them. Accounting will likely be the next to go but engineering is looking ripe for the pickings - so good luck whatever you do.

&gt; To your second, then you must not be hiring very often. I have seen it multiple times in the past few years alone. 

Nice group you travel in - and this is a professional line of work you're involved in?

&gt; Couple that with people who can't stop smoking weed long enough to pass a drug test and you have half of your long term unemployed.

I honestly don't think you have any idea what you're talking about. But you do parrot those Fox News talking points beautifully.

&gt;  Of course everything ends and then the market corrects and smooths out.

So, what you're saying is that the sky does fall but everything comes back to right? I would suggest that the ancient Greeks probably believed much like you to but history has proven time and time again, you are simply looking at too short a timeline. And the problem with that is you have no idea where on the timeline you are.

&gt; The move to a mechanized society also lifted more people out of poverty than anything else in history.

I don't think that claim can be made. Yes, it gets bandied around a lot but no one can seem to prove it. We have more people living in poverty now then existed back in the 1930s. Now, if you want to claim that this assertion  is based on percentages, I'm still not sure it can be quantified.

&gt; some were harmed, but the vast majority were better. it is impossible to argue against that.

I can argue that and do so quite convincingly.

At one point we had millions of people who were living a somewhat comfortable life and then had it torn out from under them. Are we as a whole better off then we were? One would have to ask by what set of metrics you make that claim. Are we happier then we were back then, less dependent, healthier? We have more material possessions, our technology has improved and our ability to keep people alive longer - but better off? I'm not seeing it.","1388534514"

I can't think of any occasion where I've written a test that requires exactly ten items were returned by a controller.

I have written tests where I ensure that at least one record is returned, if I know that such a record must exist.

i really expected the SA to take over where the mod left off, but what we have is the mod all over again in a better engine. there are, of course, GREAT additions to the SA that aren't in the mod. i'm grateful for these additions, but they could have been sidelined until the had the SA up to the point of the mod in regards to security and balancing before they put in these additions.

I drew a cult master, sacrificed my 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2 into his 2-5.  On my third draw from the cult master, I top decked a spellbreaker.  I used it to silence the leper gnome, and then killed it with my 6-6.  On his next turn, the mage used his hero skill to drop me to 1 life.  Then, I top decked a guardian of kings to heal myself, and I won 2 turns later.

After the game, looking back through my deck, the spellbreaker was the only card I had that could have saved me.  Drawing the Guardian of Kings on that turn would not have helped because I only had 6 mana available after the cult master.  I was also frozen (from a frost bolt), so drawing my truesilver champion for healing would not have worked either.

It seems an extremely illogical double standard.

To directly address your question - I think the jury should be allowed to consider all reliable evidence, and the weight they choose to give it should be up to them.  Keeping evidence from the jury because it might be inflammatory is a highly questionable practice.  Only evidence which is unreliable should be excluded - things like lie-detectors, jail-house snitches, eye-witness identification (of people they never saw before, or just glimpsed) etc.  If they can not be trusted with the all the reliable evidence available - then how can you trust them to decide with less than all the evidence?  If you feel they are so unreliable that their emotions will determine the verdict rather than their reason - then why would you think they would be more likely to reach the correct verdict when they have less than all the evidence?","1388534523"

I could choose to wear a crop top to work, and I could choose to get an ice cream cone tattoo on my face. I have the *choice* to do both, but neither are professional. It's  unconstitutional to take that choice away from me, but it is constitutional if an employer does not hire you based on the image that *you* represent.

I don't think that a hiring/promotion decision should only be made on one's ability to perform duties, it should also be made based on whether or not they ""fit"" within the company and whether or not they can represent the company in front of clients.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","What I think we struggle with most in the application process is that we are scared of limitation. We fear it in the sense that we want our options to be as widespread as possible. In actuality, this is rarely the case for anyone. Let's face it, there are so many things out there that truncate our choices: location, money, grades, etc. With that, it becomes clear which colleges are off limits and which are not. 

These are the things to consider before applying - not what you actually want to study. Apply where you can, not where you want. As harsh as that sounds, it's a reality that we need to face.

*Applying* to schools is not hard. *Deciding* on schools is where the difficulty lies. But it seems that your problem is solved already. 

Let me elaborate. The most we can do at this point is apply to the ""good"" schools that are somewhat relevant to what we want to do. College A is strong in this program, so I'll apply there. College B is good in this other major, so I'll apply there, too. But College C doesn't have any of my intended majors, so no thanks. 

And then you end up with a list of colleges, the amount of which of course differs for everyone. I think this is where you're stuck, with this list that you think is filtered, but really isn't. 

If it ended there, I could see why you would be so frustrated. But whether you realize it or not, you seem to have everything planned out! Full tuition out-of-state, HYP, or in-state. What is difficult about that? That criteria is perfectly refined, and it gives you a lot of direction. Apply to wherever you want, and when you find out about the colleges' decisions, then you make your selection. 

Therefore, as we apply, we wait. And when we get those few colleges that reply with an acceptance letter, that's when we decide. But by then, our list will be much shorter. Even if you got accepted to your entire list, there are obviously going to be those couple that stand out. And from there, the actual decision-making begins. ","1388534525"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Some people might get upset, but most people are fine with you having 0 tours if you listen and know what to do. Here's a basic run down of what to do with each class. (note when I say to buy damage resistance, I never buy fire resistance as I can normally avoid pyros by keeping my distance, and many levels don't have pyros).

Scout: madmilk + fan of war, get slowdown on madmilk, then max out resistances and move speed, then max out milk reload time. Jump height can also be useful for staying above enemies and staying alive. For shotgun, the soda popper is useful for the hype giving you like 5 extra jumps, just jumping around safe from damage while collecting money. Baby face blaster is useful early on for maxing out speed without spending points on movement speed, but avoiding jumping gets me killed a lot.

Soldier: Buff banner + black box (stock or beggars bazooka can work as well, I find black box the best for the new maps). Get 1 point in rocket specialist, then upgrade Damage and reload speed, get only 1 point in clip size at some point, then fire speed and ammo capacity. If you're running out of ammo a lot, get more ammo capacity. Upgrade buff banner at some point too. Once you've got all that you can upgrade damage resistance. While you don't have resistance, use cover a lot and be smart to stay alive. 

Pyro: I don't recommend it for the new maps, especially as a new player. It can be helpful for the new maps (good for tanks, giant bonk scouts), but chances are you'll be dieing way too much, especially as a new MvM player.

Demo: Only upgrade your sticky launcher (I prefer regular, you can use scottish resistance). Upgrade reload speed, then damage/fire speed/ammo capacity. Once those are maxed, you can upgrade clip size a bit if you want, but damage resistance will probably be more valuable. Make sure you take out medics, that's your job.

Heavy: This one kinda varies, I've seen heavies with different upgrade paths do just as good as me. Personally I get 1 projectile penetration and 2 ammo capacity, then max out all resistances except for fire, then kinda get whatever I feel like depending on the situation (fire speed, rage, or destroy projectiles). I've seen heavies upgrade fire speed to max first and do well (which can be helpful for the tanks in rottenburg). If you're confident in your medic, you may not need resistance as much.

Engineer: If there's experienced players ask where they want the dispenser. Typically you want to put it behind whatever your allies are using for cover, so they get health/ammo without having to run to it. Put your sentry where it's effective without getting destroyed instantly. Max out dispenser range first, very important to do that. Currently short circuit is very good for MvM, you don't even need to upgrade it, and it can take out any explosives heading toward you/your teammates. Get 1 point in building healthy, and a couple points in metal capacity/wrench speed. Always keep build canteens on you for rebuilding quickly. Work towards maxing out building health, wrench speed, and metal capacity. Once maxed, you can get either resistance to keep yourself alive, or sentry speed to do more damage, see what works best for your style. Make sure you lure sentry busters away from your teammates before they blow up.

Medic: Use uber saw and kritzkrieg. You want to get the shield ability right away, and max out shield upgrade/heal mastery/overheal expert. This will allow you to keep your teammates alive most effectively. Remember, don't sacrifice yourself to save a single person, sometimes you have to let people die so you can keep the rest of the team going. Focus on avoiding enemy fire while healing. Once you have those upgrades, personally I go with resistances to keep myself alive, then uber time, then uber charge rate. I find uber time more valuable, since if I charge up my uber with the ubersaw, then the uber charge rate doesn't matter. The kritzkrieg is also pointless if you die too quickly, which is why I focus on resistances before upgrading the uber things. 

Sniper: Wouldn't recommend this unless you're the sort of person that can at the very least, occasionally top score as a sniper in a regular tf2 pub. Hitman's heatmaker is the best to use (bazaar bargain can be good early on, but because of a nerf, the bazaar bargain's head ability doesn't do anything once you've maxed out the charge rate upgrade). Get at least 1 point in headshot, then get damage/reload/fire speed/ammo capacity. If there's giant scouts might as well get slow down on jarate to help out. A point in health on kill can be useful to keep yourself alive if a lot of stray bullets are hitting you.

Spy: This one I don't play too often, since not having a scout is a bit tricky, and having both a scout and a spy makes early rounds pretty tough when you have hordes of enemies (a spy can run in and kill a few enemies but then he's gotta hide, whereas soldiers, demos, heavys, engies, snipers offer consistent damage/distraction of enemies to help deal with a horde). Switching to spy with a refund credit for certain maps can be very useful though (like on manhatten on the last wave that has a ton of black box giant soldiers. With spy you want to get your knife damage up for killing giants, as well as movement speed to get around quicker, and use dead ringer to hide and disguise after a few kills. You want to upgrade your sapper for getting smaller enemies. Depending on the situation you might need resistance, but usually by being sneaky you can get stabs without resistances and still stay alive, it might take some patience for them to move into the right area. The kunai is useful for getting lots of health from kills (the only time enemies attack you directly is after you stab someone), so I prefer it. There really is a lot to say about spy I suppose, so I doubt I'd recommend it for a newer player, especially when you don't know what to expect in the upcoming waves.

As long as you keep this information in mind, and communicate with your team, you should be fine. And remember, these are my preferences as someone who does MvM a lot. There's a lot of strategy needed for them to work, but explaining all that would take forever. Just see what comes out in a wave, and think of what to do so you can hold the front without getting pushed back. Especially on Manhatten where enemies come from the top and bottom at the very front of the map, and you need to allocate your teammates to the correct spot based on their class.

Hopefully someone finds this helpful, the more people playing MvM who know what they're doing, the easier it'll be for me to actually enjoy playing with random people.","1388534527"

At the hospital, he was really quiet and worried about me, we get home and he puts me to bed, just staring at me. Then he starts kissing me and touching me, and while it's hard to describe, it was like he was putting the entirety of our relationship behind it. 

We didn't speak at all, just insanely deep, longing, meaningful making love.

I think ending a relationship because you are too lazy or uncaring to work towards a better sexual relationship is certainly shallow.  But if you are that lazy or uncaring then it probably means that you really aren't into the person to begin with so ending the relationship is probably a good idea regardless of the shallowness of it.

On the other hand, if you are really not sexually compatible and have completely different preferences, or if there is no motivation to improve and they don't seem to care, then no amount of work is going to change that and it's a valid reason IMO.","1388534535"

Why is my job worth less and less compared to a WalMart greeter?  If mindless, non-skilled pay keeps rising, why should anyone strive to become better?

We on the other hand, also have a right to ""name and shame"" and they should accept the game as it's played - especially when the epicenter of their bullshit rhetoric specifically names said rules.

Take ""Big Red"" for example...  Oh boy oh boy did they ever whine and cry that she was dox'd (as she rightfully she should have fucking been dox'd), but right out of the other side of their mouths say that people basically have no *Right To Anonymity* when it comes to waging the cultural war from their side.  To be expected, it's only unfair when they get held accountable by *more speech*.

We all know that Feminists are FLAMING HYPOCRITES, but we shouldn't be hypocrites too.  We shouldn't bemoan the fact that we've lost a shit ton of ground in the cultural narrative war.  No we shouldn't.

What we need to do need to is go on the offensive.  We, as sleeping lions, should wake the fuck up and use our organizational and financial strength to shout these cunts down.

A core TRP principle is being self-determining - so we should put our money and our voices where our mouths are.  Every single TRP subscriber should get a blog going.  We should write books and publish them online - free for downloading.  We should create sites that call out the bizarre immoral behavior of women individually.  We should call it something like falseaccusers.com (already owned but sitting blank - and no I'm not the owner nor do I know him - we can choose something similar).  We can create dox lists of women who act in a predatory way - from false rape accusers to false domestic violence accusers (especially when they benefit financially from levying the false accusation).  

We can setup non-profs that take contributions and conduct actual non-biased gender studies - not the fake ""gender studies"" that exist in academia.  We can use empirical evidence to disprove pervasive false narratives.  We can take full page newspaper ads out in major cities that cite facts.  We can talk about marriage rates, divorce rates and the number of children in America living estranged from their fathers.  We can cite female to male college enrollment statistics, and factual employment statistics that disprove the myth of female wage inequality.  We can cite the statistics of declining male grade school educational performance.  We can publicize the workings of the innocence project and the large number of men who have been falsely jailed.  We can show the proof that men and women are equally as likely to be sexually assaulted.  We can show that men are more often the victims of domestic violence than women are.  We can show all of the purposeful lies and all the disastrous results that encompass feminist narrative.

The only way to fight lies is with truth.  Truth is the most powerful weapon we have at our disposal.  We need to use it.                      ","1388534538"

This helps us make it clear what purpose an element serves.

This works best for us, because in our product users can change the HTML that renders the page. By not tying event handlers to classnames, there's reduced risk of users breaking functionality by accidentally removing a bound classname. It's much clearer when there's a specific attribute.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","No problem, dude. I thought this was a casual qq-post, but it actually had something in it and it sounded like you wanted to improve. 

I started out as a Silver III player but got knocked down to Silver V, because I didn't know anything about the game. I just rushed lvl 30 (AP Yi mid) and played ranked right after. I didn't know anything about items, champion abilities etc, so of course I had to learn that. All I relied on was my mechanics (played Dota before). But those things I learned in Silver V. At some point I might have been Bronze if it wasn't for the Tier/Division-system. But after I learned that I slowly started to climb. And through climbing I learned more and more about the game. Some Silver-players knew more about the game than me and I also met some smurfs that gave me tips now and then. So eventually I climbed through the ""Elo-Hell"" or whatever people call it.

Whenever I cried about bad allies etc. and Elo Hell my Diamond I friend always told me that the enemy team has a higher chance of getting bad players and AFK's (which is the advice I gave you in my previous post).

After playing the game for 280 days I finally made it to Diamond. When I look back at when I was Silver, I can't help but laugh at myself, because I really sucked back then. I was so sure I was so good, but I still made so many mistakes. My mechanical skills have been improved as in I make few mistakes, whereas in Silver I made tons of them:P Also in terms of decisionmaking I have improved a lot (probably the most). If you don't know what to do with your lead, you might just throw it away.

Both mechanical skill and desicionmaking come from playing. So play, play, play and eventually you will improve.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I have some experience in this arena. What you two need to do is sit down and really go over what both of your expectations are within a relationship. Like extensively, this isn't necessarily something you'll always have to do but I think when you come out of being long time friends to lovers, it is necessary because it usually ends up one person wants a relationship, the other person wants to be boyfriend/girlfriend but everything else essentially stays the same.

I was friends with a girl for 3 years and we both had mutual attraction and a great friendship but it just wasn't ever the right time for a relationship between the two of us. When that time did come we both had different ideas of what we wanted but didn't really communicate that to each other and it led to a lot of hurt feelings on both sides. I wanted a real deal relationship, she wanted the friendship but with the added benefit of sex, which isn't really the same as a full fledged relationship. I treat my friends differently than I do a girlfriend. If my friend is going out, I'm not going to ask when they'll be back and for them to call me when they get in. I do those kind of things for a girlfriend but to her it seemed more like I was trying to be controlling when I wasn't before as just friends. ","1388534543"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt; -VT-Galaxy - Vehicle transport, no weapons, 2 pilots ( one to fly, one to deploy vehicle), costs more than regular Galaxy, faster speed.

imo there is no need for a 2nd pilot to deploy vehicles, just make it a drop F key ability that gives the vehicle safe fall for 10s. with certs the pilot could increase the safe fall from 10s to 20s ( max ) which increases the altitude the VT-Gal can drop its payload. 

id 100% specialize in a loadstar if i could deep strike a pro tanker team behind enemy lines, then come back n get them out of there when their job is done. 

Or ( just thought of this ) what if i could pick up a harvester and drop them on an enemy RU patch have them steal the RU then pick them up n gtfo. could be some sort of bonus exp / RU reward for operating behind enemy lines. 

to add to your list:

Skyhook system - drop a beacon, has a hologram of how many in the squad want a ride, gal / littlebird sees the beacon, flies through the beam and beams up the squad. ( works outside of being in the squad / platoon so that its a faction wide support tool, i as the gal pilot do not need to be in the squad / platoon to pick them up and transport them. 

13th seat for gal - would allow the pilot to stay in his / her gal and transport full squads around the map in a dedicated logi role.

You are basically on house arrest. You have to be at the beck and call of the department everyday in case they want you to come in and answer questions. When you are questioned they  sit you in a room with the chief and several other high ranking police officers. You are read Garrity. Garrity is basically the opposite of Miranda rights. Under Garrity you are required to answer all questions truthfully. If you refuse to answer a question or get caught in a lie you will be fired. However anything you say under Garrity cannot be used against you in the criminal trial because it would violate your 5th amendment right against self incrimination. Nothing found in the administrative investigation can be used against you in criminal court, however anything found during the criminal trial can be used against you in the administrative investigation. So the criminal investigation is usually done first, then the administrative afterwards. Because the administrative is usually done after the criminal, that's why it often takes time for the firing to happen, because the firing won't happen until after the Administrative. Once the two investigations are complete, then the punishment is handed down if the charges are sustained. The media doesn't always follow up on the case, so all people read in papers is ""officer got in trouble, is on paid leave."" The administrative ""paid leave"" is just the beginning. The punishment can range from nothing, to firing, to being indicted by a grand jury and spending the next 30 years in prison.","1388534547"

Yes, they could. Look at what MLK accomplished with peaceful marches. Our society is currently set up in such a way so that everyone has to work feverishly at under paid jobs with little time off to pay off ludicrous amounts of college loans, credit cards, car payments etc, so that they never have the time to be proactive about our situation. So yes, we all need to try and give that whole indentured servitude a big middle finger and take some days off to make others aware that they're not in this struggle alone. ","1388534548"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","When people engage in a financial transaction, like a sale, they agree to a price. The ""fair market"" price is the point at which both parties will engage in a transaction voluntarily. Changing the terms of the sale will move the price up or down.

Despite the complicated nature of employment, it's really just a financial transaction between two parties of money for labor. Thus in order to reach the ""fair market"" price for labor you must reach the point where both parties would voluntarily agree to the transaction at the price.

If tattoos negatively influence the perceived value of the labor, that should be reflected in the price, in this case, the wage. There should be *some* price at which the party could agree, but if this is a dealbreaker, there is likely a competing employer who would jump at the opportunity to get a deal on labor. Over time, exposure to the market phenomenon of truly free prices will penalize those who discriminate against people on matters which have no bearing on the bottom line.

More tolerant employers will consistently get better access to talent by being open minded and discrimination would prove in time to be costly.

Nonetheless, when you create laws which twist the arms of members engaging in a transaction, you necessarily eliminate a fair market price. The only way to have a fair market price is by the two parties agreeing to it. Therefore, *someone* has to get screwed by the deal. That means by creating a law you are systematically introducing unfair terms.","1388534548"

I was never a kid who partied or drank in high school, but from day 1 at Florida State I was introduced to an entire new world.  I don't know if you are into the drinking scene now or not, but the great thing about FSU is that pretty much everyone parties and has a great time at this school. You don't need to be in Greek life to party and have a great time. I will say that it certainly helps to join something like a club or greek life at such a huge school, just find something your interested in and you can instantly make a huge amount of friends. 
Not to mention our athletics are pretty great. Obviously an amazing football team, a pretty solid basketball team, a great women's soccer team and a good baseball team makes for very fun times to go and support winning teams.

Stop there. There is one group. The other group came in illegally, and from a different fucking continent. 

Its like saying if US occupied Iraq, let Chinese in, then left, and then said ""ok lol why cant you guize share the land"". 

&gt; It's not their land ""only"", as there are 20.7 % of Arabs in Israel. Their immigration is for their people only, though, it seems.

Why is it 20%, and not 80% as it was before? Where are those other ones? In refugee camps or dead. How come? 

&gt; It seems they wouldn't even be able to immigrate as laws in Israel require person to be Jewish or Jewish ancestry, which seems offensive and discriminating.

Yes! It is discriminatory and racist! loool. At least you admit it. 

Also, they arent immigrants, they are _natives_. 

&gt; What is the number of refugees wanting to immigrate to current Israel?

They dont want to immigrate. They want to _return_ you fool. 

&gt; Because of the European Jewish immigration that happened 1946 and after.

Very good! So you admit that they moved there to colonize it. 

&gt; Are only brown people allowed to live in the Middle East?

When white people moved to South Africa and said ""for white people only"" was that ok? What about when Europeans move to middle east and say this is for Jews only, that is ok?

&gt; Israel was given 

GIVEN! Ahahahha! The UN should give me your house, would you accept it? ahahah! ahahhah! 

&gt; They probably won't budge on their immigration status for a while, shit happens, but that's the way it is. Blowing up Israeli citizens doesn't help the situation either.

Argument from authority! loool. If they sit on occupied land, how can they complain they are getting blown up? Maybe they are stupid.

After their world relied too heavily on its own superheroes to defend it, the future Earth scientists realize that all people should be willing and need to work together to save themselves.

To accomplish this, they set out to rewrite the past.  Make the world's people see superheroes as a dangerous distraction, and the people will become superheroes themselves.  So, they need to create a super team of average (not idealized) people.

It's planned to be a closed arc.  Everyone dies, maybe.  I write the Woman (Decay) as the main voice. She's a people pleaser, so her voice connects with the audience (as she connects with people.  She sacrifices the most, so we emphasize with her.  Phantom Limb is the Mage/oddball.  The American Man is our ""metaphor engine."". He drives the story forward.

With regar to genre, it's very much an action-adventure.  Meta cape comics, but without the detached irony.  While there is a ""man vs. world"" theme, it's more focused on fighting one's nature and the future.  Similar conflict in both.  Rejecting one's predestined role.","1388534561"

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","1. Don't skip the metronome, as a bass player timing is the most important part of your job. A metronome will help you develop your internal time and if you ever go into a studio to record you will be playing to a click track which is basically a metronome. 
2. Focus on the timing of your playing. You can play some really cool stuff with just two notes if you get creative with the timing (hell you can make something cool with just one note too.). 
3. Try to play with other people, the bass is normally used to compliment other instruments, in rock bands the bass' main job is usually to connect the rhythm section with the melody.
4. Don't over play. There are badasses out there that can play really complex basslines and still sound good, but in general less is more.
5. ""The one"" is a game changing concept. Once you get it, you'll be another step further. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHE6hZU72A4 Also it applies to most genres, not just funk.
6. Try to play by ear, but don't stress it if you feel like using tabs or sheet music. You want to make sure you're having fun and sometimes that means figuring out fun songs to play fast so you don't get bored.
7. Just start paying attention to the bass lines in your favorite songs, you'll be surprised how many bass riffs are the most memorable part of songs and how simple many of them are.
8. Learn to play with your fingers, pick, slap and tap.
9. When playing with a drummer a good place to start is to lock in on the kick.
10. Like every other instrument practice practice practice.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I agree the progression system was a bad idea but in every other aspect this game is as anti-casual as it gets.

Progression or not it takes time to develop the skills to master it. There's quite a bit of depth to the combat.

I know most RO1 vets complain, I haven't played the old one but I've had a blast playing RO2 and the RS expansion. I also play the truly clunkier Arma series and this hits a sweetspot between accessible and realistic that keeps my coming back to it.

Anyway, here's my bold and baseless prediction:

Any ship with the ability for multiple crew will become very tough to beat when all those crew slots are filled with real players.  At least I hope it works that way.  If not, why would anyone be willing to crew a ship when NPCs do it as well or better?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am convinced that people will find plenty of reasons to have lives other than the promise of obtaining superior material wealth than their peers. In fact, I'd go so far as to propose that our (I'm a citizen of the US) cultural, 'moral' focus on productive work as the goal and purpose of every human life is a big part of the reason we're having issues with poverty and increasing income disparity.

I think businesses would likely be founded by people who are passionate about a trade and want to see their success benefit as many people as possible, so like you said, for the sake of the employees.

I also think that, as we start to phase out individual material wealth in favor of public access to resources, the public sector will get more efficient. As it works now, the public sector is basically a bunch of private entities working under the guise of government. Someone somewhere in every organization is trying to look out for themself. If we make sure that you get what you get no matter how cut throat you're capable of being, nobody will bother being cut throat and the actions and choices made in the public sector won't be influenced or motivated by the private sector.

Essentially, we need to strip individuals of the ability to better their lives without also raising the standing of every other citizen equally so that we succeed or fail as one entity, a family of individuals. I think a big part of the change will be the breaking down of subcultures, in-groups, nations, religions, families, and all other brands of exclusive cliques. We need to look at eachother and see only Beings. Every single Person I see is indistinguishable from, interchangeable with, and equivalent to Me.","1388534573"

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","It is a tenet of the Catholic Church that gay sex, as with many other non-procreative sexual acts, is a sin.  Pope Francis hasn't changed that tenet or teaching he is just expressing it in a more tactful way.  Other than believing that Jesus is the son of God that died for your sins, and a distinction between mortal and venial sins, I don't know if the Catholic Church has main and tertiary tenets.  Almost all sexually immoral acts are mortal sins or at least that is what I was taught.

My point is that you can express that you believe that gay sex is a sin without doing it in an offensive way.  Pope Francis says couches his statements about gay being a sin with a ""but who am I to judge"".  Robertson and many in the American Christian Right put gay sex on a continuum with bestiality and pedophilia, in essence enhancing the hurtfulness and derogatoriness of the statement.  The same people never put adultery, or premarital sex, on the same continuum of sin as bestiality, despite being mortal sins punishable by death in the Bible.  ","1388534580"

"miamidolphins","t5_2s20n","I would like to start this post by apologizing for how mind-bogglingly idiotic this article is.

&gt; Sherman was tasked with calling passing plays with an offensive line that allowed a NFL-worst and franchise-record 58 sacks. When he called deep passes Tannehill couldn’t accurately deliver the ball to Wallace.

Until the two idiots responsible for that terrible OL left halfway through the season. Oh yeah, it would've helped if Wallace's gloves weren't coated in bacon grease (and, for what it's worth, Steelers fans reminded us of this during last offseason).

&gt; As for the claim Sherman abandoned the run too quickly recall early in the season when Sherman said it’s actually Philbin who wanted to pass more often. Sherman said he prefers to maintain a balance, keep banging away with the run. But then he smiled and said he could be convinced to do things the way Philbin, his boss, desired.

&gt;Philbin chose to abandon the run, not Sherman.

&gt;Why? Consider the running backs. Lamar Miller (709 yards rushing, 4.0 yards per carry) and Daniel Thomas (406 yards, 3.7 ypc) couldn’t gain yards on their own. They needed a clean hole, and that wasn’t the case very often.

""Why?"" I'm gonna go with the idiot in charge of the offense (YOU HAVE ONE JOB SHERMAN) failed to handle the positions which *would* give Thomas or Miller holes with any degree of adequacy. And, again, hey! Once the proverbial poison was sucked out of the snakebite that was our OL, our offense delivered -- *until we stopped calling sensible rushing plays.*

&gt; I could understand Sherman being fired for one reason -- he’s not creative. It took him 12 games last year to figure out running back Reggie Bush is an effective weapon as a slot receiver.

&gt;But to blame Sherman for the offense’s problems this season is wrong. The problem is the players, not the coach.

Chris Perkins you are a fucking idiot. Someone give me a job writing about the Fins in the Sun-Sentinel, I don't even live in FL anymore and I don't have a degree but I 100% guarantee you I'd do a better job than this goddamn moron.

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","It would be really hard to see how the meta-crisis could not count, unless the show ignored it.

Under the rules that were established in New Who, regeneration is a discharge of energy, and it has two phases: 1) healing, 2) changing form. What 10 did was go through phase 1, and then *discard* the remaining energy into the hand, avoiding phase 2. Keyword there is *discard*. He didn't reabsorb it; it was spent, as it would be in any other regeneration. So within the rules set by the show itself, it'd be very hard to look at this event and say it didn't count.

So the Eleventh Doctor was at least the twelfth incarnation, unless the show ignored itself. And if Moffat intended to do the whole ""forgotten regeneration"" thing in the 50th and surprise the audience, he had no choice but to make Eleven the thirteenth incarnation without telling us about it.

In the end it was a matter of putting things on a scale; would you prefer to see a whole incarnation of the Doctor dealing with the fact that it is the last, or would you prefer to be surprised by the reveal of a secret regeneration? We could not have both. The people who run things (ok, ok, Moffat) chose the latter.

And remembering how floored I was by the reveal of John Hurt at the end of *Name*, I dare to say they made the right choice, in my humble opinion.","1388534584"

&gt;*PC doesn't have Kinect, Mario, Monster Hunter (at least outside eastern Asia), new Halo, Killzone, Zelda, etc.*

[Except that PC has the largest exclusive library of any gaming system.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/105oDn_pPAm5mwphk9zwSO_oexcVBkMI1_5XQbg74_8M/edit) Plus, consoles are missing RTS, MMOs, MOBAs games - entire genres. Also, when did Kinect become an exclusive game?


&gt;*Also, single PC multiplayer isn't really a thing, so ignore playing with friends or family unless they have a PC and that game as well.*

And it *is* a thing on PS4 or Xbone? Kinect - sure, but I haven't seen anyone playing anything on that other than Just Dance.


&gt;*Did I mention ease of use? Consoles have a straightforward ""press this to do something, no other prior knowledge of machines needed"" thing going on.*

Anyone who can operate Windows can operate a gaming PC. I didn't realize console gamers were that tech-illiterate. Press the power button on your case, then click on Steam, then click on a game in Steam. tuhard.


&gt;*If you don't know the key placement on a keyboard by heart*

You can use your choice of any console controller.


&gt;*if you don't want to have to search through programs to find the game you're looking for*

Steam solves that. But to be fair, EA and Ubisoft are assholes for having their games exclusive to their platform. Then again, that inconvenience is only for a few games.


&gt;*And then you can play em from your couch comfortably, which is a huge plus. Ever tried sitting on the couch with a keyboard and mouse? Kinda sucks.*

You can plug your PC into your TV and use a controller. Very hard stuff to figure out, eh?

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","I remember back in 1998 a fellow I worked with told people that a website was only a good idea for bigger companies. Today almost every business could benefit from a web presence or an online store. You could even argue that it's a necessity today. The internet didn't get less important over time... it grew in importance at a staggering rate.

I guess what I'm seeing in the profession today is that mobile is not going away. In fact, many recent articles I have read suggest that mobile is overtaking desktop usage. This seems about right to me just based on my own experience. I use a desktop computer because I write software for a living, but I use a phone or table for almost everything else. My entire family almost exclusively uses phones or tablets. In fact, I feel like I would be 'lost' without my smart phone.

My feeling is that not 'thinking mobile' is a mistake. It will soon be the most in-demand kind of programming. I was told by a recruiter friend of mine a few weeks ago about the outrageous salaries available to people who can do BOTH mobile and server-side development... the person who can do both the mobile front end and server-based back end can almost write their own paychecks today. I think you COULD avoid mobile development for the rest of your career if you want to... or you could embrace it and make a lot of money doing it.

Also, my own personal experience with people who are 'mobile only' developers (generally newer developers who have never done anything other than mobile) are TERRIBLE programmers. They lack a certain experience that is VERY relevant on mobile devices. Good programming is good programming regardless of the platform. I personally think the best mobile programmers will be those who did not start with mobile.

While his laning phase is great his usefulness falls off pretty fast because of his short range and niche ult (as well as only one small niche cc ability). He is more susceptible to cc than most toplaners and is very squishy. While he is very strong 1v1 you can't count on him in team fights. I would say he isn't quite a strong pick right now but definitely not weak and I don't see a reason to pick him over other current meta toplaners. ","1388534588"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think that if we start talking about China and similar countries, we have to start looking at the situations in those countries as well. Their labor practices, specifically. By China's standards a member of the American middle class is practically bourgeoisie and the wealth divide in China is even greater than that of the U.S.

Perhaps we are in a transitional state, but I still don't think it's accurate to say it's no longer relevant. It will no longer be relevant when we have Star Trek replicators (or nearly equivalent and available 3D printers), or when far more companies are employee owned and not owned by the investment class.

For most people, for a number of reasons, the selling of labor is still the primarily available means of subsistence. Part of it is the means of production, but part of it is regulatory capture, resource ownership, political power, etc.","1388534589"

For the doubters that drive all seasons in winter . . . think about it this way.  I don't care what you drive, how much power, AWD, FWD, RWD, how much it weighs, if it's a shitbox, or a luxury car, or SUV.  The only thin on your car that touches the ground, and that has any ability to allow you to go, brake, turn, etc, is through your tires.

Again for the doubters, this is where you want to cheap out?  This is what you can't afford?  But you'll get stupid car accessories like cell phone holders that distract you from driving, intakes, exhausts, rims, tinted windows, or shoes/clothes you don't need, and $50 cell phone plans.

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","so even though strapless bras are actually super easy once you get the right size (the Freya Deco is super popular/I'm wearing it right now and love it!), that doesn't help you right now!

how off-the-shoulder is it? I don't think tucking the straps of the shoulder less side would be TOO noticeable if you get creative with bobby pins - maybe bobby-pin the straps down into the cup and fold the straps inside of it in a way that hides the straps so you don't see a bulge. maybe also try taping (preferably fashion tape, but I think you could use duct tape in an emergency) in addition to that if you think it might help.

I also suggest asking /r/aBraThatFits because the posters there are more knowledgeable about bras in general so they may be able to advise you how to modify your bra in an emergency because they'd know more about how bras are structured (so they'd know which parts to modify, but really, I think you're over thinking it).","1388534592"

"hockeyjerseys","t5_2tvot","It's very hard, if not next to impossible to make a crest look new after it has started to bubble or wrinkle, especially on a 20 year old jersey like that.

First thing is, always wear undershirts underneath jerseys. Not to sound gross, but your goal is to be able to hang your jersey and air dry it after wearing it without having to wash it every time. The more you wash a jersey, the quicker it wears out.

Obviously, there will be times it has to be washed. Wash it exclusively in cold water, on the gentlest cycle. Wash it inside out. Make sure you take it out of the machine right after being washed so that the crest not being folded in weird angles for long periods of time.

Never put a jersey in the dryer. Jerseys do not absorb lots of water, so this is not necessary. The heat will lead to the crest bubbling. Air dry the jersey on a hanger.

Especially if you bought that jersey second hand, you probably want to wash it because you never know where it's been (maybe that's just my paranoia). A good wash and hang dry should get out the fabric wrinkles.

A lot of jerseys from the 90's with intricate crests are hard to find without wear. The Ducks and the original 2D Senators are examples of this. (I'm referring to authentic jerseys with full sized crests, not replicas with the some times smaller versions). So if your crest is wrinkled and/or bubbling, it's probably going to be something you'll have to just live with on a rare jersey.

You can try ironing the crest on the lowest heat possible. First do it with the jersey inside out. Always place a t-shirt between the iron and the jersey, NEVER iron directly on top of the jersey. Use lots of steam. After doing inside out you can also try over top the crest. Never leave the iron on for long periods of time. Less is more. With ironing if you put it on for too long with too much heat, there is always a risk of causing more bubbling. Ironing will mostly get wrinkling out, bubbling is usually there to stay.

As far as tackling stains. Oxyclean is really good, just follow the instructions. I've also spot treated some really nasty white jerseys with bleach before and had them looking brand new afterwards, but you have to be EXTREMELY careful to only use very little, rinse it off with cold water, and make sure it doesn't get on any of the non-white areas of the jersey. If you're no absolutely confident in your ability to do this, I would avoid bleach entirely.

If your jerseys fabric is still wrinkled after a wash and a hang dry, you can iron it like a regular shirt. But again, use caution, lowest heat possible, and never iron directly on top of the jersey.

Awesome Ducks jersey.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Not neccessarily psychopathic but definitely avoidant. Of course, second-hand experiences over the internet are absolutely no way to really say anything with any kind of finality or even probability.

My notion was that a visit might present an opportunity for closure. I completely agree that the trust between them is gone and for that reason alone the relationship over. On the other hand, achieving closure very much depends on the mental state and personality of the OP so it is of course also perfectly possible that things would happen more as you describe. In any case it is a bad idea to go at all if he has serious doubts or anxiety about it. 

I'm sorry you had to experience the things that you did. It is terrible especially for a young person to experience a breach of trust like that. You must have had to grow up before your time. You write that people are constantly letting you down. Could it be that you are wary of people and are on the look-out for signs of betrayal, and nope out at the first inkling? It might be that you are being too careful or setting too high standards. Be careful not to let your mistrust become a self-fulfilling prophesy when meeting new people. On the whole, generally, people are nice and kind. Sure people are selfish and unthinking at times, that kinda comes with the territory. But most people are also capable of great friendship, trust and love. You gotta take the good of people with their bad. If the good outweighs the bad, and if the bad does not cross certain well-defined lines, then you can let these people get close. In the end everyone wants pretty much the same things.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;It's not really relevant, you didn't buy and sell slaves, I didn't buy and sell slaves, people did that hundreds of years ago

This is true, of course. No one alive today is in any way responsible for the Atlantic slave trade or the actions of their ancestors. However, the reason black slavery is still relevant is not only the social implications it's had on American society (and I mean ""American"" as in ""the Americas""), with respect to racial attitudes and discrimination, but also the direct economic effects that exist today. 

Take the United States for example. For centuries, slave labor was a major contributing factor in powering the economy of the country and its colonial predecessors, enriching an entire owning class. When slavery was abolished, the owning class retained ownership of the land made profitable by the slaves and the generations of profits produced by the slaves, while the erstwhile slaves were left nothing but their persons. They had to turn around and sell their labor for a cut-rate wage, often to their old owners. It's as if the slaves had been pushing the owners for generations, building up centuries of acceleration, and then, from a standstill, had to start running to catch up with them. But, in reality, the only way to make any progress was to continue to push them, just under different terms. And, in 1865, they found themselves destitute in a society that had started centuries before by people who had come to claim small plots of their own land. Even non-slave-owners who had some form of property had a big advantage over the freed slaves.

Of course, there were many poor and dispossessed white workers at the time, who were often treated just as badly as the former slaves by bosses and owners. The history of these oppressed workers also echoes to the modern day, with the white poor outnumbering the black poor, though the *rate* for the latter is higher. But it is still important to note that, while social mobility is a daunting and often unrealistic prospect for the poor of any race, it is somewhat easier for the white poor. The economic descendants of the past owning class, the modern capitalist owning class, are still largely white, and still biased towards their own ""in-groups,"" which has been documented in studies showing intense hiring discrimination based on race. The effects of slavery even hurt white workers economically; at the time, slavery lowered wages, and later, the racial attitudes built up by the white owners during the slave period were used to keep white and black workers divided, helping the owners break unions and keep down wages for all workers.

So you see why black slavery in the Americas is still an important thing to understand, I hope, and why efforts to make people ignore it or think it's not really relevant anymore are harmful. In an economic system in which wealth is heritable and property ownership is the main engine for economic profit, an entire group of people starting out at a massive disadvantage can never be expected to just correct over time. The playing field was never leveled, as property ownership has continued to be passed on in uninterrupted lines within the capitalist system, and so a black worker born today is still economically disadvantaged with respect to a white worker of similar economic standing, though of course both are in shit positions in comparison to the owners, and have much more in common with each other than with owners of their own respective races. White people in general don't need to answer for black slavery, but rich owners of productive property are tied up in systems of repression that date back to the institutions of slavery.","1388534600"

Nor does Gilbride adjust well to the players he has. This year, he had a bad offensive line, but instead of asking for more 3 step drops and/or intermediate routes, Gilbride still called for long passes off of 5 to 7 step drops.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I think his Crit Passive makes him a bit too snowbally early game. Im not saying remove/destroy/nerf into oblivion, but i do think it needs to scale with level. Maybe he gains 10% bonus crit per level, so he hits his full peek at level 10. It would keep him more in line with all other champs early, without being a direct nerf in the early-mid/late game. It just seems like if he gets a lead its impossible to catch back up, and if he's behind, just by random luck of the draw (on crits) he can still snowball out of control.

He also does almost everything well. He's got a constant source of poke, an amazing escape, a huge amount of highly reliable CC and his damage output is pretty insane (nevermind the free sustain from his shield which gives him great trading potential). While i feel everything but his passive is just fine for a Melee Carry/assassin/Bruiser, i think his passive is just a bit too strong being a flat 2x from level 1.","1388534606"

&gt; Yes, and there are hundreds of millions of people living a quality of life that was unthinkable only a few centuries ago thanks to capitalism, too.

Oh... see I thought states got some of the credit for that, with their increased adherence to human right and the UN and peacekeeprs and socialized medicine and the welfare state keeping people from starving and elections that provide representation that keeps governments from becoming corrupt...etc.

&gt;Poverty and starvation has killed many, many more people than sweatshops have.

Really? That's your argument for unbridled capitalism ""Sweatshops are better than poverty and starvation"". You know what's killed even fewer people than sweatshops? Human rights and a welfare state that ensures people eat and have a place to live. Some might consider that better than spending your life in a sweatshop. 

Where would you rather work, a sweatshop in Malaysia or a clothing factory in Norway? I'm actually asking you. If your answer is Norway, then maybe there are some advantages to being in a western democracy with protections for workers and a welfare state.  

&gt;There is still a near-universal demand for products and services with robust safety standards and excellent customer service, and there are plenty of companies that provide that today. 

No there isn't. Do you know how many people buy things made in sweatshops? What you mean to say is ""There is still a near-universal demand for products and services with robust safety standards unless the people don't know about the safety standards being violated or they decide they want the product so much they decide they don't care about them (cf. iPhones)."" Again, your ability to oversimplify boggles the mind. 

Also, there is still a near-universal demand for representation and services with robust safety standards and excellent customer service, and there are plenty of **countries** that provide that today. 

&gt;Similarly, there are plenty of companies that have shitty safety standards and shitty customer service, and those companies are not generally doing very well financially. 

Some of them aren't. Some of them are. 

How many people do you know of in America, where I'm assuming you live, know what oil companies are doing in Nigeria? They don't. So there is no dent in reputation, there is no boycott, there is no loss of profit. Your arguments seem to hinge on the completely false idea that people have perfect access to what companies do all the time, every day, everywhere. 

&gt;Right, and who wants to buy a product that has killed other people? 

I sure don't. Can you tell me exactly which ones those are? No? You mean the company didn't tell you it did something unsafe that might have killed someone? 

&gt;Does the absence of state prevent private regulatory agencies from forming? 

No, but it does provide a playing ripe for them to be bribed. You know that already exists right? Companies paying for fake ""certification"" from shell companies they form to provide certifications. Here's one example of something similar http://venturevillage.eu/safe-harbour-false-claims-europe That took me 10 seconds to look up. 
Funny thing, companies lie to make themselves look better in order to deceive their clients/customers. 

&gt;Governments rarely give a shit about their reputation, because they don't need to convince people to give them money. 

Yes, they do. Not money, but stuff. The world is pretty flat. Governments trade resources with each other and corporations and cooperate on any number of levels. If I have a shitty reputation no one will trade or cooperate with me. Read your game theory and international relations. 

&gt;Unlike companies, the can just take money from you.

No, they really can't. I mean the state can to a certain extent. But any government running the state knows that there is only certain things they can do, so much money they can take, while in power or else risk either a revolt or being voted out. 

Moreover, they can only take money from you if you have money. This means they have to have companies in their borders that will hire people. Whether or not these companies move here or there *is a function, in part, of the reputation of the country*. If you blow a lot of people up for no reason or spy on companies in your borders, then companies will leave and go someplace else, then your people will have fewer jobs and then you'll have less money. Consequences from reputation. Just like companies. Just like companies it is imperfect. Countries get away with things the same way companies get away with things. But this also means countries need to compete for better reputations in order to increase their tax base. This isn't voodoo economics, I'm not just making this up. This is all pretty straightforward international relations/economics stuff.  

&gt;Businesses are slaves to the demands of the consumer, while individuals and businesses are slaves to the demands of the state. 

So all of democracy is a lie? Seriously. I want you to tell me if you think every election since the beginning of democracy was a complete fabrication. Because if so I can go now because I'm talking to a crazy person and if not then it's pretty obvious who is in control of the state. 

&gt;It's also hard to assume that competitors won't try to point out the fact that their competitor's products are harming people more than theirs.

Oh, I'm sure they will. And then this company will lie and say the other company is doing the poisoning...etc. until no one knows what to think. Since no one knows what to think, they'll just shop wherever and nothing about their actions will regulate the market. 

&gt;Holy shit, and you assume that governments are these perfect institutions that magically prevent people from harming themselves with evil capitalist products.

Not perfect at all. Sometimes they do horrible things. I think, on the whole (not your incredibly biased analysis) they've done more good things than bad and are, generally, headed in the direction of more human welfare and rights. I also think roughly the same thing about companies. You, on the other hand have a completely skewed version of states in your head and an idealized, oversimplified picture of how markets work.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Educate yourself on how it works and how to use it. Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to your own body.

 I was on the pill for five years and did not get pregnant. We were having sex at least once a week without condoms and I have no reason to suspect either of us are infertile. We used condoms or didn't have sex on a couple of occasions where there were doubts.

Make sure you know of any and all things that could compromise your pill. Certain antibiotics, sickness and diarrhoea, things like that. Some pills require very good timing for taking them, but not all. There are different formulations, so they can vary. If you are in doubt use condoms. 

People spout rules about the pill based on old information or rules that apply only to certain pills and I think that causes a lot of unnecessary fear and aggro amongst people who are inclined toward being cautious anyway. So learn what is appropriate for the one you are on.

Lastly: learn how it works. I'll briefly outline it but you should go read up on it somewhere for the sake of accuracy.

 When taken properly the pill does several things that reduce your chances of conception. It stops most/all ovulation (depending on your particular pill), it reduces your womb lining and it thickens your cervical mucus. So if you miss one pill you *probably* won't ovulate and even if you did, it's harder for sperm to get through *and* there is less womb lining for it to implant in. But it's all about risk factors. If you consistently compromise the efficacy of your pill by missing or you miss it at certain times of the month, the risk of pregnancy could be greater. I'm not promoting complaceny here, just knowing the facts.

There are always tales of people who got pregnant when on the pill. I'm hesitant to call them liars or halfwits but I think a LOT of people screw up or sabotage on purpose, and of course it's easy to just say 'oh it didn't work, whoops!'. Same goes for people whose condom ""broke"".. some of them screwed up, some were unlucky, some didn't even use one.

"running","t5_2qlit","Your body loses water when exercising. This is a fact. Lose too much and you are in for a shitty race, or much worse.  Please do not spread the idea that hydration during long runs is an option. The need for proper hydration is well-evidenced. An example:

*""... you lose water through sweating when you exercise.  A good rule of thumb is that you lose around half a litre for each hour that you exercise – and it can be substantially more than this if it is a hot day.

Some evidence shows that modest levels of dehydration lead to significant falls in athletic performance.[i] Your blood is about 82% water.  As you sweat more, your volume of blood is reduced, and your cardiovascular system works less efficiently at getting oxygen to your muscles.  A loss of water equal to 2% of your body weight (a litre and a half for a 75kg person) could reduce your aerobic capacity by up to 20%.[ii] Bigger sweat losses than this can lead to dangerous dehydration.""*

Nevermind that Putin's Caucusus policy, especially the second Chechen War, led to an *increase* in terrorist acts that only subsided when the honey-pot of Iraq was born and terrorists went there instead. 

http://www.putin-itogi.ru/doklad/#5

The Chechens did provoke the war, that is true. Putin's response is his own, however. And the response included the use of surveillance and other covert tactics that people scream about if the USA uses them. I guess the USA should wait for trains and trolleys and buses to explode? Or the USA should wait for 300 schoolchildren to be massacred? Or the USA should wait for a botched reaction to a theater hostage crisis?

Says the person who thinks that the Russian army can put everyone in the Caucusus under house arrest, search their homes for weapons, and then deport anyone found with weapons to Siberia...and that this won't result in killing of innocents and a *subsidence* of terrorist activity?!?

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I think at the end of the day, Warners doesn't want to make comic book movies.  They know how much money they make, but want to play the mature and realistic angle that worked so well in The Dark Knight.  They gave the classic style a try with Green Lantern and that failed in a way similar to some of the failed early Marvel movies from Sony/Fox (Daredevil, Ghost Rider).  Now, they're going back to dark and gritty.

Here's the problem, most of the DC characters are not built to be dark and gritty.  The characters are fantastical, and the comics have excelled because of that fact, not in spite of it.

Kevin Feige is the head of Marvel, and he really knows how to bring out what makes comics work.  The company has a clear direction, and I fully believe they know what they are doing.  I don't believe there is anyone in charge at Warners, and it feels like they are incredibly short sighted. ","1388534629"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I haven't had this dream in years, but on several occasions when I was young - usually about once every 6 months to a yearuntil I was 10 or 11 - it would come back around.

So, it starts off in my maternal grandparents old house. Their front door entryway was backed by the staircase leading the second story, and two halls lead off to either side, one to the living room and one to my grandmothers work room and the then around to the kitchen. There was a bathroom in the latter hall. My sister and I are making toy ghosts out of kleenex, string and ping pong balls, which is something we used to do there (so we could dangle the ghosts down from the second story landing like they were floating). That's when someone - I believe it was my father - comes in and says that my grandfather (not the one whose house we're in, either, but my paternal grandfather) wants to see me upstairs. It's at this point in the dream that I realize my entire family is in the house and I start to get nervous about what he could want. 

I start going upstairs and I have to go up about six flights and I'm not even close to the top floor (the house, in reality, was only two stories). When I finally get to the right door I knock and hear my grandfather tell me to come in. I step into a huge room - a room bigger than the house would have been - which is totally white and featureless. My entire family - including my sister and father who I left downstairs - are in the room in a big crowd. I walk towards them and the cluster parts down the middle, revealing my paternal grandfather who'd asked for me. He is bolted to the wall by his wrists and ankles, face towards the wall. His head swivels around like an owl and he asks me a question that I've never remembered - I just get scared then, but not scared enough to wake up. All I really remember is squirming around and not wanting to answer him - no recollection of what I might have said or what the question was. 

What I consistently remembered next was going downstairs, into the hall leading to the kitchen, and entering the bathroom there. I never liked that bathroom - it was all black and white tile with gold fixtures and it always scared me for some reason. Yet that's where I go to hide from my family, who terrify me at this point because of what happened upstairs. There is a spider - a giant spider - in the bathroom. I sit and idly talk with the spider for a while (I've never remembered what we talked about, but always got the feeling the spider was trying to cheer me up somehow). 

On leaving the bathroom, I go into the kitchen/breakfast room area. There is a sliding glass door leading to the backyard, and across the breakfast area from that door is a desk. In my dream the desk has glass cabinet doors over the shelves above the writing surface (which it didn't have in reality). My maternal grandfather is sitting at the desk writing a letter. I look over his shoulder at the glass cabinet doors and see a reflection of the backyard through the sliding glass door. My sister (five years older) is standing in the yard, smiling like a villain. I turn around and the yard is empty. I turn back and her evil doppelganger reflection is still smiling at me. I'm getting scared again, but my grandfather turns around sealing an envelope before I can do anything or say anything and tells me that he needs me to go and put his letter in the mailbox and that it's very important. I agree, because that means I get to leave the house.

I walk out of the house, across the front yard, and I go to the mailbox. I open the mailbox and I reach in to see if anything is in there... Now, this is the part that I swear is most vivid and has puzzled me more than anything else in this incredibly weird ass dream. Inside the mailbox is what my juvenile mind thought a porcupine looked like (essentially a hedgehog), only instead of quills this thing has popsicle sticks coming out of its back. I touch it and jerk my hand away, for some reason thinking the popsicle sticks will still hurt me as badly as I then thought quills would hurt me. My in-dream reaction, every time, was to assume my sister had done this - planted the animal there - because she is suddenly evil and wants me dead (I get along with my sister and, for the most part, always have). I distinctly remember considering that my maternal grandfather might've been in on the whole thing, but would always end up realizing that he probably had no idea what was going on.

And that's it. I would wake up at that point, never really scared but certainly uncomfortable. I don't think I ever once managed to put my grandfathers letter into the mailbox, either. 

Anyway... I hardly ever get to talk about that and I've long since given up on trying to figure out where it might've come from or why I had it so many times. I'm more than open to interpretations, of course, but really I just wanted to revisit it :) Thanks for reading. ","1388534630"

A good book series helps as well, but its hard to get into a book sometimes when you're coming off of stuff and feeling restless. I'm a recovering everything-but-crack addict and while I've been off the hard stuff for a couple of years none of it feels real. I think the only reason I've managed to stay off that shit for this long is because I just socially isolated from those type of people, but if the decision to use that stuff actually came up I'm not entirely sure how I would react. I've used marijuana as kind of a coping mechanism and to offset the desire to use other things, but even that is becoming a little bit of an issue. I don't have a lot of coping skills and I'm having trouble living life on life's terms, but things are getting better. I mean I'm a complete 180 from a few years ago, but still everything feels so fragile sometimes, like it could go back to the way it was in a moment. Basically I'm still an addict.

I've made him out to be a bad king because it's an arrogant glory-hound who doesn't know the first thing about how to actually run a country. Look at his qualities:

Jon Connington has observed that Aegon isn't a very good warrior. He freezes up in battle, so he doesn't have very good nerves. He is easily manipulated, so he isn't very smart. He mocks the Pisswater Prince and forces Tyrion to pick up after his cyvasse game after his temper tantrum, so he's not very compassionate.

His freeze-up against the Stone Men and the cyvasse game tells me everything I need to know about him. He believes he's the perfect prince, and when things don't go his way, he's terrified, angry, and scared. That makes a poor king.","1388534631"

I'm a low maintenance tenant, but those were all neccessities for me.

Certain areas have property crime, so pick carefully. I looked at houses for sale and certain areas had all the ACs stripped of copper or stolen entirely. Not a common occurrence in the area, but just be picky.

Tenants up there use craigslist and padmapper too. There's an inland empire craigslist you can use. Plus, just put a for rent sign out front.

So that's the tenant's side. I can't speak to vacancy rates or anything like that, so you might wait for someone with actual properties in the area.","1388534634"

When your empire collapses about the only thing left you can cling to is religion. Or maybe soccer teams, but they're basically the same thing now.

Let's face it. Egypt is not going to become the superpower it once was. Jordan will never be in a position to become a G20 country. Left to fend for themselves, and often bicker amongst themselves, these fragments of an empire are not in a great place.

Likewise, if you had Alabama and Georgia trying to go it alone, cut off from the resources the American empire provides, they'd be in really, really bad shape. They'd no more be able to make a nuclear bomb than their own brand of automobile. Anyone in Atlanta who wanted a decent job would just bail, go to another country that paid better. What you're left with is those that can't flee.

I'm upset with Thomas and the team these past 2 years because they play with no passion and fire, and like it or not those things are a reflection of our leadership (which fair or not is on the Senior 3 year starting QB and coaching staff). Also I disagree that this team was that much better than last years team, the defensive stats were better but they won 1 more game (and IMO that Marshall game prob should have been a loss so there ya go) and last years team played a better ACC schedule.

The topic of the discussion is ""There is no such thing as Palestinians"". You are supposed to write arguments on why you believe that statement is ""bad history"" or not. Your first comment looked like an extremely simplistic argument for why you thought ""There is no such thing as Palestinians"". That is why you received a ton of downvotes.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","fine. whatever. regardless, as has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, whether or not a government is present does not change the main aspects of capitalism which anarchists object to, namely the profit motive. it is the profit motive, which is a part of capitalism *by definition* (as you say), which inevitably leads to some people or groups having institutional power over others. this is an authoritarian relationship, and it is an inevitable result of capitalism, whether it is in its ""true form"" or if it is just the capitalism that actually exists in the world.

additionally, i just want to point out that the relationship between the state and capital has historically been one in which the state uses its monopoly on force to protect those acquiring profit and their property. if the state were to disappear, but the profit motive and capitalist system were to remain, then wouldn't those who have been accumulating profit just find other methods of protecting what they believe to be theirs, for example a private security force? and wouldn't those other methods just fill the historical role of the state, and, in essence, become a state themselves?","1388534640"

seriously, stop calling it a game if you can't distinguish between it's actual purpose and that of a fully finished game.  It's an alpha.

It's the first testing version of the software.  Normally this version is completely inaccessible to the public and is worked on only internally by whichever developer the project belongs to.  It 100% is going to by buggy, glitchy, and most likely won't even work in the specific features it is intended to test.  This alpha in particular is supposed to focus on the new inventory system and enterable buildings is my understanding... hence the 3 types of guns and 2 zombies per town.

Alpha was only released so that the public could participate in the testing, and rocket has said that it's currently not even at the point where the public can really even aid in that respect.


Let's put it this way, let's say Pokemon was released in an alpha version.  You might be able to battle trainers and wild pokemon, but you would have no way to catch more pokemon and no way to learn new moves.  So you might say ""so i'm losing interest and starting to wonder: what is the point?""  The point is you're testing an alpha build.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;You realise the bible references dragons as existing?

Sorry, I did not know that. I am not a Christian and have never been one, so I know very little about the Bible. If you can tell me about the features that Biblical dragons possess, I would be happy to discuss that.

As for giant sea serpents, I don't know what that means. A serpent is a snake, right? We know that sea snakes exist already (although they are not giant). It's very possible that there are giant ones in existence, considering how little of the ocean's life we're familiar with. Remember when we used to think that giant squids were old sailor's myths, and then it turned out they're real? So I remain agnostic on the subject of giant sea serpents.

Talking snakes are impossible (based on snake anatomy). Multi-headed beasts exist (two-headed kittens, cows, etc., are born all the time). As for giants, you'll have to tell me *how* giant you mean.

DI is a good idea.  There's essentially no way to abide by the Single Responsibility Principle without it, because a class has to both perform its primary actions while locating and instantiating its dependencies.  A class designed with DI in mind is unobjectionable in every way:  it accepts everything it needs to live in its constructor.  So far so good.  The alternative, in which everything is riddled with singletons, is too grim to contemplate.

But there's a problem here.  If class A depends on class B, then in order to construct an instance of A you need an instance of B.  This hasn't solved anything, it has just moved the problem to the caller.  And of course, class B might have its own dependencies...

Enter the DI container.  A container can let you build a class without baking in knowledge of how to resolve all of those dependencies.  There's a single point of registration, so these details aren't repeated throughout the code base.  Every usage of class A doesn't involve a lot of irrelevant details about B, C, etc.

Like anything, this can be misused, and there's a bad history of cargo-cult programming with DI containers.  XML configuration was always a terrible idea, but you can choose libraries which provide fluent, conventional, or reflection-based registration.  Most DI containers have too many features, which leads to drift within an organization.  Something like SimpleInjector is fast and small, and has one right way to do everything.

Ideally, the DI container is never used directly in your code.  If you just have a static Unity container that you're resolving everything from, you're doing it wrong, as that's just a service locator.  The container itself should mostly disappear, outside of a few root factories.

There are two ways to avoid DI.  Non-GC environments have to track ownership in ways that make RAII far more sensible, since no one can be truly oblivious about resource ownership.  Functional languages often force extreme locality (i.e. a function sees no references beyond its arguments) and have more powerful module systems, and thus can achieve the goals of DI without requiring library support.

I'd suggest reading through the SimpleInjector documentation, as it makes an eloquent case for the value of minimalistic DI in promoting SOLID principles.  As does this [architectural discussion](http://www.cuttingedge.it/blogs/steven/pivot/entry.php?id=91).","1388534645"

I find it funny that I was talking the same ~one year ago and it barely moved aside from further and further increasing the grind. Grind itself doesn't matter to me as I've grined out everything already but there is no incentive on Gaijin's side to improve FRB or FM engine... sure they're doing it but resembles snail race. It's the first thing that should be completed before adding any plane into the game.

&gt;For now just stock up on devalued lions and play for fun of flying not the fun of progress.  
  
That one I agree with. Everyone should stock on Lions and then laugh every time Gaijin will make effort to reduce income even more. (no offence but I don't consider current lion earnings high... best that I achieved after outstanding match was slightly less than 300k lions... which is fairly low considering to 500k I would receive for the same match pre-1.2x)","1388534645"

I was parked with the engine running and my parking lights were on. An SUV full of college kids was pulling out of the parking lot and paused when they approached my car. I assumed because they thought I was going to go, so I waved them on. Nothing happened so I waved them on again. Then the driver got out and menacingly approached my car, so I locked my doors. He starts *screaming* at me and pounding on the windows, and pulling at the latch. I have no idea why he was so mad. His friends were hanging out their doors shouting at him to come back to the car, which he finally did. 

My friend came back to the car none the wiser. ""You have no idea what just happened, dude..""","1388534654"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I watched a documentary on men who paid this old cowboy matchmaker to take them to Mexico to find a wife. The guys seemed like goobers, but it was hard to disagree with them when they said (essentially), ""American women want too much, and are emotionally unavailable."" The Mexican women said they like American men because (according to them) American men love their women and treat them as equals, while Mexican men take their women for granted and treat them as servants. One dude met a beautiful young woman, brought her back to the US, they got married, had a kid and everything ... he's a trucker that lives in a mobile home, and she looked happy as clam. 

(Additionally, a guy I used to work with met a Ukrainian woman online, brought her over, eventually married her, had a kid, and they're quite happily married a decade now.)

Being a goober myself, I'm not exactly criticizing these guys, and if what the Mexican women say is true, why am I out there for years on end getting shot down left and right?","1388534655"

Puppies have a license to be assholes, till they're about 6 or 7 months old. Adult dogs who don't seriously hate puppies, cut them slack. 

At about 6 or 7 months (aka puberty), a puppy who pushes boundaries too hard for the other dog, may find himself being snapped at, and it's meant as a serious, ""STOP IT"". 

Given the sexes and ages of your dogs, I'm going to predict that Boogie will one day have enough, but that by then Zoe won't have to listen to him. You may have to step in to give Boogie a break from the annoying puppy. 

But right now it is play. It's just that puppies are a pain in the ass at times, especially if their house mate is not that strong at holding the puppy to boundaries. ","1388534655"

Typically, battles are often shorter in time scale, and tactics are typically employed. e.g. I'd attack the base from the front, you attack from the left flank. While they are distracted by our fighting, Charlie, you go kill the kids.

Contrast this to warfare where you have multiple stages of battles, often times with multiple engagement in battle with different units. This often requires strategy and long term planning. E.g. charlie, you take this hill tomorrow, and bob, you take their outpost B. We shall then attack their supply line of water, and when they are all running low on water, we attack the main base.

Both phones are fantastic. That being said there are some differences. Battery life, bigger screen, and a better camera go to the G2. Responsiveness definitely wins out on the N5 though. I've never felt such a zippy phone. The G2 is quick, don't get me wrong, but there is a clear difference in everything from scrolling to using the keyboard. Since the hardware is so similar between the phones, it's possible with rooting and romming that you could have the same experience. 

The nexus has a more premium feel whereas the G2 is a smudge factory. 

I wouldn't trade unlimited data for the differences. We have to keep in mind the nexus is quite a few updates away from the G2, so a lot of the speed comparisons could disappear in an update.","1388534665"

You have one that plays everything because the game is generally built for it first, it has the biggest fan bas so it gets the most attention. Then you get the port to OSX, and it might run well but it might not. For example path of exile is a free game, it runs well on windows. There is a port for Mac OS but only certain hardware iterations can run it.

It's just such a walled garden, I mean you can run bootcamp and all but you lose a good amount of processing power just running a virtual OS, on top of whatever hardware you might have.","1388534665"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","&gt; I think part of the reason Wrath of the Berserker was popular was the impact it had on the overall pace of combat. You're hitting faster, you're moving faster, and you're not getting interrupted by crowd control effects as often - so for people who can comfortably handle that higher level of stimulation, it's a peak time. Losing WotB meant being doomed to a relatively dull combat experience. It was overpowered, of course, so I'm not saying we needed to keep it around - just wanted to highlight that lost gameplay experience as an example of the overall effect I'm talking about here.

One thing I think you're overlooking is the fact there's a lot of ""cooldown time reduction"" modifiers coming in, so unless there's a cap on that property, people can specialize in those to re-gain their 100% Wrath of the Berserker uptime, as well as re-creating the CM Wizard (since Critical Mass got the axe).","1388534666"

What conservative would ever back this? 

Conservative ideology (in its purely academic form) and the Republican party are becoming very separate and distinct things. I worry that voters treat politics like sports teams. No one is liberal, libertarian, conservative, etc. You're either Team Republican or Team Democrat.

I mean, I'm not sadist and obviously (hopefully), most people who watch combat footage aren't, but when we fail to grasp that these are actual people in actual life in these videos and trivialize combat... I dunno, it's kind of messed up. It kind of defeats a purpose of these videos, and that is to detrivialize conflict and help people see what's actually going on, not just how the war movies portray it.

War should not have an audience hollering in entertained adulation. 

I'm here because this stuff is bewildering, hard to watch, and important to be aware of. I don't want to lose touch with the harsh parts of reality in the comfort of my own peace. I also watch it somewhat in an attempt to prepare myself for a potentially violent future. What if war comes to America? It's happened before. Maybe we're overdue. What if I go to war? Student loans are a bitch, and it may end up the case where that's my best option.

It's disgusting that some people are here for entertainment and think this is a performance. Most aren't, I wouldn't be willing to make such a negative generalization, but to the ones who are... feel free to get bent.","1388534671"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;I'm honestly considering bring this up with her mother. She's in the medical field and we have a very good rapport already.

Whatever you do, please don't do this. I assume your gf would feel intensely betrayed to know that you told her mother private relationship details like this. Especially since it's a problem with your gf's behaviour. If my fiancé went to my mother about a problem he had with our relationship, I think it would be a dealbreaker.

 I'm sorry I'm not much more help, but the thought of this happening filled my stomach with cold awful feeling for your gf. I might be projecting, but your gf's insecurities and life experiences sound similar to mine. She might just be the kind of person who doesn't approve of separate vacations for couples. And that's okay if both people feel that way, but probably not compatible for your situation.

I feel like she's maybe worried you are sick of her, or off flirting with other girls. Maybe a combination of both. The imagination can be a terrible thing, and I've read enough stories on here to know that sometimes when a guy ""goes away with his friends"" for 5 days without his gf, one if the friends is sometimes a girl he ends up banging. That said, she should trust you, you guys really need to sit down and talk it out, and ask her more questions about why she's upset.

Edit: upon re-reading, she may also feel hurt that she couldn't go. You mention she has no group of friends who would invite her to something like this, and even if they did, she'd likely have to work. Maybe plan a getaway soon that would include her? You're out having fun and making memories, I'm sure she wants to make memories with you. ","1388534674"

"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","Central midfield and forward, still remains to be our two weakest positions. I believe, it is stopping us from becoming unstoppable machine. For central midfield, i will go for Matic. Because, he is young and he is a former blue. I won't mind, if we ever get Witsel instead. We have been weak in that department for the past few seasons. You can clearly see that this season. We are in desperate need of a player that can link up well with the attacking third. Someone that can play alongside Ramires or even Van Ginkel in the future. For striker, i will go with Lewandowski. Diego Costa is my preferred choice, but i don't think we can afford him this window. I don't need to explain why we need a striker on our team. Our current strikers have miserably failed. A team like Chelsea doesn't have time and patience to wait for them to come good. We need a striker that can score 20 goals in the league or anything close to that. Look at the EPL top goal scorers this season and try to find the names of our strikers on that list.

Unless you are unhappy with the relationship, or she does something that you personally disagree with, there is no reason to break up with your girlfriend. He is still getting emotional fulfillment out of the relationship.

Moving in with your girlfriend and taking care of her is normal. The most normal thing you can do. Yes, it is hard to work a full time job and still cook/clean/give emotional support etc, but nobody said life was going to be easy.

I also think the way the left approaches the matter is more of a moral victory in changing the definition of marriage to include same sex unions. I see it more as a jab at the religious of the country. They want to be able the rub the religious' noses in it, in an ""in your face"" sort of way.","1388534679"

If your library uses Adobe Digital Editions, it can be a PITA. Mine gets buggy pretty regularly and freezes when transferring files. It'll lock up when transferring one book, and I'll have to end the process to do the next one. But, the convenience is worth it. Most days anyway lol

But, the Overdrive system is really nice. It'll auto-return books when the license expires, so no late fees. You can download the app onto your smartphone, tablet or computer.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","There will be no right answer to this in terms of technique, every person is different, what one person likes someone else will hate and vice versa. Some girls like you to  gentle lick their nipples, others want you to chew on them, I've had a girlfriend say she didn't feel anything in her nipples at all so I was kinda wasting my time there. If you get off on getting her off you'll work it out pretty quick. 

Some things to try. When intimate, be aware of your thoughts - notice and discard all thoughts of ""am I doing it right? does she like this?"", simply pay attention to how it feels to you and his/ her reaction - 99% of the reactions I'm talking about are non verbal, does your partner's body tense or relax (could be whole body, just one part, even their eyes relaxing), does their breathing pattern change (little sigh, faster breaths, deeper, etc.), do they lean into what your doing, tense up a little, pull away? etc. etc. All non verbal and they likely won't even realize they're doing it.

As for you, enjoy the process and the journey (foreplay) and forget about the destination (orgasm). Foreplay I think this is a terrible word, makes it sounds like an aperitif, for me it's the main course. Start paying attention to all the different ways it feels to touch your partner, and noticing their reactions. Personally I get off (psychologically) on getting my partner off e.g. legs wrapped around my head exploring and devouring her pussy as she cums over and over. 

There are few things more awesome than being able to be able to get someone relaxed and comfortable enough so you can reduce a person to a quivering wreck until they beg you to stop. Not sure what that says about me though, perhaps I""m a control freak :)

Hope some of this is useful.

Changed the processor to a 4th gen i5 and got a compatible motherboard. Changed memory to a little faster. Got rid of the SSD. Changed HDD to 1tb. You probably won't need more than that. Changed the 770 to a 760. You could eventually upgrade that using EVGAs step up program. Changed case to a Source 210. PSU is now a Semi modular 600w. Monitor is slightly bigger, and less expensive.","1388534686"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I never really believed to begin with, but the thing that makes it hard for me to believe in religion is that there are/have been so many different religions and all of them claims to be the right one, yet there are constantly new religions popping up and old religions fading out.

Last I checked (which was back in high school when I had religion classes) there have been recorded over 4,000 different religions, some which are still around, some which have died out long ago, and some which was made just recently.

And then when you take a good look at all these religions, you'll see that it is all just the same shit, with only minor differences. At it's core, religion is about 3 things: Comfort and Control.
And then you can think about how many wars have been fought on the base of this stuff, these religion which are pretty much all just the same stuff anyway.

I sort of remember lying in a booth, puking all over my arms and then my friend throwing me into a cab and then into my bed and that's it.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","OK, you realize you posted an Onion link in /r/conspiracy, right?  Many of the people here take things SUPER SERIOUSLY and take anything that looks like it's mocking the thread as a threat.  Look how many upvotes people questioning you got, and then when you respond to that comment, you get a massive downvote(remember that your name appears bolded and in color because you are the OP, so people easily know it was you).  I understand you think it was a brigade, but as I have pointed out time and time again, there is more of a downvotey reaction from /r/conspiracy users vs. /r/conspiratard users.  Look at the comments you point out.  Why are there ~60 more downvotes for your comment than there are upvotes for another which you claim is ""one of us""?  Why would we just downvote you and not support ""our own""?  

I hate to say it, but some users here take anything that goes against what they consider ""normal"" as an attack and respond.  During the Dorner thing, people here were calling foul on the fact that two wallets of Dorner's were found.  I posted a pict here of my two wallets.  I do carry two wallets.  One for cash, on a chain in my back pocket, and one for my DL/credit cards that I keep in my front pocket.  It was downvoted en masse here because no one could believe that a real person would have two wallets, both with some sort of ID in them, as it would destroy their narrative of what they think happened.

They're not, though. The copper one is a creamy pearl, the others all have actual flecks and give an insane foil finish. The product is widely known for that. The gold and silver especially are beautiful actual metal finishes, not just a mica sheen. 

The second palette from Mehron in the review is a different product and I am not recommending it. ","1388534691"

A group on twitter called DERP claimed it was them. Later a popular League of Legends streamer on Twitch.tv called PhantomL0rd was streaming. The group decided to turn offline whatever game PhantomL0rd was trying to play including Dota 2, Quake Live, Club Penguin, Battle.net, EA.com (the EA was just random). So PhantomL0rd established a connection with them and had a conversation with them. In the meanwhile someone hacked into 
PhantomL0rd Twitch account and also released all his information online. Later in the evening, the police came to PhantomL0rd house because someone called for a ""hostage situation"" (since his information got leaked) and his stream turned down.

I highly doubt they are ""hackers"" but rather someone who managed to get a list of accounts on another website and ran them through league assuming they kept the same login information (I am guilty of this also, and TotalBiscuit had his twitch compromised this way as well).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was the biological mother. However, the parents never made it a secret or anything like that. It was an open adoption, and they've been talking to him about it since he was a baby. Same with his sister that was adopted a couple of years later. 

So, both kids are probably like /u/laurenisahokie. They've just always known that they were adopted, and it was never a big deal. I do know that I had to be the one to break it to the little girl that I wasn't her biological mother. For some reason when she was about 6-7, she decided that I had to be her ""real"" mom because I was fun. Ha! ;)

However, I quickly set her straight that her ""real"" mom was the woman who was always there for her, loving her, helping her learn new things, kissing boo boos and sharing hugs and laughs every day. :)","1388534702"

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I've read the book, met the author, and even know one of the people profiled in the book. Inspirational read, nice guy, true stories.  Fine so far.

However, my personal experience is that ideas are worth very, very little: 1%.  Execution is 99%. I know quite a few entrepreneurs.  Most of them are always looking for the Next Big Thing and get nowhere over and over and over again.

I also know some very successful entrepreneurs.  They saw a need and jumped right in to fill it regardless of the fact that there was NOTHING new or revolutionary about it.  Lots of renovating and then renting out properties -- with all the grungy maintenance and management that goes with it.  A middleman business connecting Medicare/Medicaid patients with speech therapists (the local company took their market for granted, so he crushed them by outworking them).  Nothing fancy.  No ""one great idea"". Unglamorous needs met by hard work because they saw a chance to make money.

And realistically, even if you *do* get a great idea, you'll likely fail unless you already have business skills.  Better to get in the game wherever you can find a place to compete and learn the ropes than sitting on the sidelines until you find the perfect idea.  Go try to make some money!","1388534703"

That, or the conservative 'welfare-champions', who *totally* have enough time and money each day to afford all the necessities of life, food, transportation, healthcare, and go to school, while working 18 hours a day, studying 15 hours a day, while working out another 5 hours each day (because they're obviously ripped) and only sleeping 2-3 hours each day.

* morality? (seems to lead back to the original question)

I'm not asking for a *reason* per se. I recognize that doesn't work.

Rather, I'm asking for some kind of support for being rational (apart from rationality). But I don't know if it is possible to have any support apart from rationality.

We wanted to make a coin that is silver to Bitcoin's gold.  Various alternative currencies have come and gone.  Some brought innovation, but they all had problems.

&gt; - i0coin - Basically ixcoin without the premine. Not much support was given to this coin after it was released. - Dead (~5 gh/s)
&gt; - SolidCoin - Innovative quick transaction times. Appears to have been run aground by CoinHunter, its creator, due to insecure changes and immature forum presence. - Dead, shutdown by CoinHunter
&gt; - GeistGeld - Lolcust premined 7.7 million coins.  15 second block time is probably a bit extreme. - Alive, but limping (~15 gh/s)
&gt; - Tenebrix - Lolcust premined 7.7 million coins.  CPU proof of work using scrypt is very innovative.  Price doing fairly well on btc-e.com. - Alive (~0.003 gh/s)

I never stated that your obligation to others was greater than your obligation to yourself. Making yourself a burden to others by impoverishing yourself is counterproductive. Your argument is invalid.

Choosing to collectively judge others so unworthy because of poor decisions as to impoverish them makes them burdens to society. Until we reverse that judgement, and allow them to become productive members of society, we suffer that burden. We cut off our nose to spite our face. The ""failure of personal responsibility"" excuse is merely a way to exact vengance for percieved failures on the part of those society chooses see as ""undesireable"".

And thats *demonstrable mental illness* not merely the result of having a religous belief. The person who did these things could easily say that *anything* told them to do it.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Not sure if you'll see this, but as a former LoL player there is one thing I am very interested in knowing:

So, when I started playing shortly after beta, there were less than 50 champs in the game, but there was a 10 free champion rotation.

Now with almost 120 champs in the game, there's still the same amount of champs in free rotation. Why hasn't the free rotation scaled up over time? Especially since all champions now are released at the maximum IP price, it makes the grind to be able to play champs much harder.

I again reiterate that I am a *former* LoL player. I moved over to Dota 2 because, well all the actual game content is entirely free. No need to grind for heroes. No Rune system either, which became tiresome. Even though my LoL account has over half of the champs unlocked, with about 1500 games played, 50 bucks spent on RP etc.

 It's the same as wanting to do a public performance of a movie, I do believe. It doesn't matter if you charge admission or not, you still need the license to do it legally if it is a public performance. 

I know more about film and television (which is audio &amp; visual) copyright than I do music, but I'm assuming they share some of the same rules.

Personally, I don't feel that it's necessary to police how much information people are comfortable sharing. It's not like somebody's going to hack the relationship database and do a face search. If you're posting your face, anybody who sees it and knows you is going to know it's you, they don't need additional details. If you're worried about people finding out the identities of people they don't know, advice like ""don't post something you've posted to MUA to Facebook"" and ""choose a username that won't lead to your real name if somebody googles it"" is much more constructive.

An intrusion into the home constitutes a search, and plain view doctrine only applies to seizure.

With my jailbreak, I'm able to edit one of the dynamic wallpapers so that a custom one is in place of a colored one in such a way like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/nF8BQjq.jpg) The reason why it's *dynamic* is because of these little icons that float around and have an effect if you jiggle/tilt your device. 

Other than that, if you like where you're at and don't really want to update to iOS 7, don't update. A funny thing that happened in the jailbreak community a day or so ago was another untethered jailbreak being released for people who haven't jailbroken their iOS 6 and wanted to stay on iOS 6. The team that released the iOS 7 jailbreak weren't too happy about it since the exploit used for this *""worthless""* iOS 6 jailbreak sounded as if it was a very crucial one. I guess in the mind of the team that released it, they felt they were helping those possibly in your situation where if Apple brings out 7.1 and you haven't updated to iOS 7.0.4, you'll still be able to jailbreak on iOS 6.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Note that foreign transactions are a big part of why this would be a good idea. Google ""double irish tax"" to see some ways US companies exploit Irish 0% taxes to avoid paying any US taxes. A 0% tax rate is valuable in two ways: 

1) Any publicly traded company has a duty to maximize shareholder value. This is generally considered to include legally minimizing tax liabilities. Large corporations use expensive tax lawyers to effectively side step most of the corporate tax code anyway. If you can pay 5% to a law firm to avoid paying 35%, that's just good business. Since in a global economy companies are exceedingly good at avoiding taxes anyway, it's almost not worth the trouble.

2) We tax things we dislike. Corporate profits can be used for all sorts of good things, particularly investment and hiring. If I have a corporate profit of $3 million, why tax me 35% if I want to use all $3 million to hire new workers? Instead we should tax people when they take profits out of the company and put it in their pocket. This does nothing to grow the company and just enriches an individual, so its a more efficient thing to tax. Note that for this to make sense, the US would absolutely have to raise the comically low capital gains tax rate. Cutting corporate taxes to 0% while leaving capital gains low is just a huge effective tax cut for rich folks and would be a bad idea.","1388534725"

So without even knowing it I have created a subconscious habit of only briefly looking into someone's eyes when they are addressing me. I also am an introvert and have social anxiety, so all of it added together makes me feel SUPER uncomfortable when someone wants to force eye contact.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I really don't have an ethical problem with any bivalves (they all have pretty much the same nervous system), just the methods to harvest them. Oysters (mussels, too!) are almost always farmed, and the rest are usually hand-picked. It's so easy to find farmed oysters. Most scallops are wild-caught, which brings in the seafloor/bycatch issues. Clams are about 50/50 wild/farmed. In addition, overfishing of bivalves has caused environmental issues in areas. If you can be assured that they were farmed then I don't see a problem with it. You can be pretty much guaranteed that oysters were farmed. The others you might have a harder time with. I live near the ocean so it would be easy for me to source from the farmer's market, but if you're landlocked it can be a problem. If you're near an ocean you may even be able to collect your own!

Keep trying, keep working on finding what turns you on. Get yourself a simple vibrator and some lube.

This is just about learning to feel. Its very important to remember that sexual reaction is part physical and very much part mental. Really concentrate on what you're feeling. Fantasize that its someone elses fingers, tongue, breasts, whatever. Imagine as you touch your clit, that a tongue is flicking your vagina.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","if a housecleaner comes with references (i.e. someone else recommended her/him) then it's better to hire them freelance. they get paid more and you cut the middleman. 

i've never tipped independent workers, but if they've worked for me for the majority of the year i'll give them a bonus as a xmas gift. 

as for chores, it's kind of up to you. i'm of the opinion that they're being hired to clean, not pick up after you and your children (this will become important when the baby's older, not so much now). i try not to leave clothes or objects on the floor or where they don't belong when the cleaning person shows up -- it's a courtesy i extend to them, and it is also insurance against things being misplaced or put away in the wrong place further down the line. it also teaches children the good habit of cleaning up after themselves (by putting their toys away) and being considerate (by doing so to make somebody else's job easier).  

when i had a person she would come by once every two weeks and would: scrub/bleach the bathrooms, clean the kitchen, remove spoiled items from the pantry/fridge, wash/put away any dirty dishes (i try not to leave 2 weeks worth of dishes stacked for her, that feels mean), dust all the bedrooms, put away (folded) laundry, make the beds/change the sheets, and sweep/vacuum/mop the floors, clean the windows and mirrors and screens, take out the trash and recycling. 

some things that i had her do (much less frequently, and usually only by request): flip the mattress, move the heavier furniture and dust underneath/behind it, clean out the oven, clean the cabinets/drawers/closets, CLEAN the fridge -- more spring cleaning type stuff. occasionally if i'm cooking something i'll have her help me chop things or etc. 

in my house we made the agreement that she wouldn't have to do laundry. i did this because it saves her a lot of time and because that way i can be sure that it's being done the way i like it. if you're going to have her do laundry, then it's very important that you discuss your preferences with her, and maybe write them down somewhere for reference so she doesn't accidentally shrink your favourite jeans. 

also since there's a child involved you should discuss what, if any, her duties are in concern to the child. it's very easy for a parent to turn the cleaner into a babysitter or the nanny into a cleaner, and it can often make the people who work for you uncomfortable. talk with her and come up with specific boundaries about what she's willing to do (and what you will require of her). 

i like to be there when they're around, especially at the beginning, in case they have questions. that said, i try to stay out of their way so i don't come across as overbearing. the best thing do to is clean the apartment yourself a week or so before she shows up so you KNOW how you prefer things (these dishes can go in the dishwasher, these have to be hand washed; all the mail goes here; etc). write all that down and then give her a walkthrough of what your preferences are (the list is for YOU, not her). i find that sometimes they'll have a different way of doing things, at which point it's best to defer to them if you don't really know what you're doing or don't really care either way.  

feedback is important: nobody's a mind reader. if something is done to your liking, tell her so; if there's an area that needs improvement, point it out. and let her know that the door is always open to discuss possible changes, improvements, or problems. if she's working in a household where she accidentally breaks a glass and is terrified to tell the client, that is a relationship that needs some work.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Once the minimum wage went up $2, it hurt the business pretty badly. A couple months later hours were cut across the board

This is the problem with most people who support a substantial increase in minimum wage.  Economics is more complicated than ""there is an ideal minimum wage of X.""  While I'm sure there is an ideal minimum wage in every given market, *how you get to that minimum wage* is at least as important as *what that optimal minimum wage is*.  A *sudden, unexpected* increase in minimum wage is bad.  If we had some kind of long-term, predictable increase in minimum wage (i.e. a $0.25 increase each year for a certain number of years plus a cost of living adjustment based on **local** prices), that'd be fucking great.  The problem is that the only major camps are ""raise minimum wage by at least $X/hour right now"" and ""either don't raise it or absolish minimum wage entirely.""","1388534738"

4 damage is just too much. Most likely, you'll only have 1 minion that survives and it'll do so with low health, allowing the Mage to finish it off the very next turn.

I'm not discounting what the intent of the creator was when creating the show, only that I think the theory the picture stated is perfectly reasonable and that I can understand why.

I've had asthma for decades and highly recommend them. They may be loud to some people esp on full blast, don't care, can breathe so much better - plus it's fine to keep them on the lowest setting IME, and I've lived in two places consistently making those 'Top 10 worst places to live in America' rankings.

Have tried out some super fancy expensive HEPA filters, but always came back to the Honeywell. They only work for a certain amount of square footage, which is why we have several, all the same type. I have one that's over 15 years, still works fine.

If you look at the scenes where Annie is apologizing to the corpses, she's not talking to Marco's corpse because the corpse she's talking to is laid out on the ground differently as opposed to how Marco was lined up against a wall. 

There's no way Marco is alive because he's missing a good chunk of his body. Including his face. 

Annie having lost both eyes took a full minute to regenerate one eye, in titan form no less. If Marco was a shifter, he'd have fled where he ""died"" at once no one was around otherwise he'd have to be playing dead for so long that he'd bleed out before it was safe to start healing himself. 

I find it pretty unlikely.

Take your time with the animals, they need to accept you before you can try to work with them. The biggest way to annoy staff is by trying to force relationships on the animals there. 

There's a reason things are done the way they are. Ask why something is done a certain way before trying to change or improve it.

Don't be afraid to get dirty. Things can get gross, and you should brush that off.

Don't touch any animals without explicit permission. I've been instructed to fire people on the spot for this.

If you don't know, ask.

Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with. If you're concerned about your safety, speak up. Being safety conscious is better than just doing what you're told, and the keepers will understand.

Make connections! This is one of the most important. If you work hard and impress people, those people will have someone to go to when they know of an opening and will help you out.

I went to Bentonville, AR (Wal-Mart Land) for about a month for work and saw some of the house/apartment prices out there. Ridiculously low. I thought to myself ""Could I do this?"" (that is, get a decent job in a podunk town just for the purpose of saving a ton of money) Still something I think about a lot.

The entertainment stuff (live music, festivals, cool bars) is stuff that is easy to say I'll live without. The one thing I have noticed about living in small-town/suburban America is that there are NO single women, which is pretty critical.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I can understand the need to help, but like antiproton says he's ""down the rabbit hole"". I wish I could reach in and grab these guys and pull them out with you, but I can't, and you can't either. They have to do it themselves. The harder you knock on the closet door, the further down the rabbit hole they go. 

If he's gay then the religion is probably a massive influence yeah. I didn't grow up in a religious country so I'm not very experienced with it (although we did have ""ex gay therapy"" and one church down my street practiced it recently, I was furious) but there is a huge pressure to get married and have kids even without religion. 

Our entire culture revolves around it, especially religion (they want all the babies) and the media, family entertainment and expectations, just everything is centered around that 1950s nuclear family american dream image. Conservative Islamic/Asian/Indian cultures as well as Christian communities are more intensive with this system. 

Gay people don't ""fit"" into this strict system that's been manufactured over centuries, which is why governments took the easier options of trying to make it go away, sweep it under the rug, and tolerate it before making efforts to understand or accommodate it. Gay people broke all the rules in the book. The ones who break the rules technically live a life of civil disobedience.

 In the UK the ""rules"" are more accommodating now, 75% acceptance and an increasing awareness and new understanding. When you see role models being celebrated on TV, learn about it on the internet, you when you have the option to get married and raise kids if you wish, when the system is accommodating of your needs, when your friends/family/community are understanding and friendly and you aren't raised in a hostile or degrading environment, you can work up the courage to poke your head out the rabbit hole; the reasons to remain in the closet fade away and the hostile shadowy specters that loom outside go elsewhere. 

It's not against the ""rules"" anymore, so they can be free to be themselves. Smooth sailing, no hurdles, no stress. 

So many gay people have to follow the rules because the family/cultural pressure to get married and have kids is too strong in their case or coming out would ""shame"" their family, many simply got swept along and trapped in a lie (the longer you leave it, the harder it is to come out, so they never do) or some just want an ""easier"" life because being gay has all those ""hurdles"" that are disappearing at an increasingly rapid rate in the western world. Some are just trapped in the gears of the system and don't know how to get out.   

He has to do it himself, I'm afraid. If he's gay he might appreciate the outreach from someone, but it's up to him to take your hand. If he's been religiously minded since he was a kid then it'll take more than a message to pull him out I think. It would take lots of independent research of homosexuality and a positive environment with lots of alternative narratives as well as undoing or rectifying the religiously induced homophobia before he can work up the courage to poke his head out the rabbit hole, we can only hope he does whatever is best for him and makes him happy.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I think people are giving you way too hard a time about how tough the transition will be. I have two friends (a gold and a silver) who did the switch after playing for I think 3 years and here is what I have to say:

Get used to denying (a-click a low health allied creep to kill it and ""deny"" the last hit) you don't need to be great at it or even do it often early on but have it in your head because it really steps up your lane game

Supports aren't just babysitters in Dota like they are in league, they are most of your team's early aggression potential and often either have great spell damage for early kills or are team-fight oriented. 

A fed carry in dota is way stronger than a fed carry in League. The hardest carries in the game (Anti-mage, Medusa, Phantom Lancer) can nearly 1v5 late into a good game. Getting 6-slotted also takes *a lot* longer in Dota, while I do it often in league I almost never do in Dota. 

Personally I feel like the biggest difference is that in League towers generally get pushed down by a pair of heros in a single wave if you abandon your lane, towers are much sturdier than that in Dota so don't be so afraid to pop into another lane for a gank or something, as it will take a few waves to take your tower (unless they are just great pushing heros) and you have fortify (yellow button, lower right-hand corner, makes towers invincible for a bit). On the same coin, don't just try to pop in and snatch towers up, you will need a bit of time to siege them down and your opponents can TP in. 

On that note, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, carry TP scrolls, imagine if in league at any point you could use that teleporting summoner spell for just a few last-hits worth of gold. As a rule of thumb don't leave your fountain without 2 TP scrolls in your inventory (because generally you will TP somewhere out of fountain and then want one on you for using later for defense or whatever).

You know how in League you can tell just by looking at an opponent whether you could 1v1 them or not and at all times you have a good idea of who would win a teamfight if you guys clashed? You are going to by going without that sense in Dota for a while, so you will miss engagements you could have won or go into ones you have no chance in. You will start to develop your game-sense in Dota though after a while and that is really when you will feel like you are playing well again and you can start to work on details.

This is all based on me learning League as a Dota player and observing me friends do the opposite, hope it helps!","1388534746"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I fully agree with you. Mind numbing work isn't fun, and everyone should aspire to go far above and beyond a job like that into a meaningful career. I moved into the IT field from where I used to be and I wouldn't go back even for a raise.

I guess my point was that it's the absolute minimum, because it's (largely) unskilled labor. Give it a few years and that job could be replaced with a Roomba.

This of course doesn't apply to everyone or every company, but I personally feel that my ""minimum"" lifestyle is achievable at the minimum wage. We can't let people starve, but they don't really *need* to be able to afford large apartments to themselves and bigscreen TVs when they can live comfortably with others (also likely in similar financial situations at low level jobs) while buying a TV at Goodwill for a buck (was dropping things off there yesterday, 30+"" CRTs are only $1). Even a working car can be found on craigslist for under $1000 if you're careful. It won't be pretty, but it's enough to get by.

This is just my relatively unpopular and rarely voiced opinion, but a minimum is pretty much only there to get you by. I will say that some of my feelings on this come from me being pretty handy -- I would buy things that needed work for cheap and use them for as long as possible. I understand that many aren't comfortable buying used or less-nice things because they can't fix them if anything happens. I still try to remain as objective as possible but no one can experience minimum-wage living from every angle so I'm likely not considering all possibilities, such as a low paying job while supporting a family.

Edit: Hey, thanks for the gold! Was not expecting that. I'll be sure to pay it forward in the future!","1388534751"

"law","t5_2qh9k","I am not a lawyer yet and would recommend that you seek the advice of someone who practices law in this area. Aside from that do not take what I say as what the law says or what you should do. I believe first you need to find out if your father had an estate and who the testator is of the estate. In that case it is the testators job to settle any outstanding balances your father had by using money and property from the estate to pay off those outstanding bills. If there is not estate you need to have one set up through a lawyer where a testator is appointed who is responsible for such things. Unless your money/property is somehow tied up with any of your father's assets, creditors cannot come after your stuff, and can only come after the amount for which your father's assets are worth. That is all I know to the best of my knowledge. But again, I am not a lawyer and encourage you to seek the advise of an actual attorney before doing anything.","1388534758"

I am not a doctor, not suggesting your gallbladder needs removed, and not even suggesting your pain was the result of gallstones as this can't be determined without an ultrasound confirming gallstones are present in the gallbladder.

The difference in your capitalism and our system on this specific point is that Anarcho-Communism does not exclude individuals from the means of production, unless their interference reduces the freedom of others. How is this different than capitalism? Well, capitalism supports a different system of property rights (who rightfully owns what.) In capitalism, property is whatever has been agreed on by an authority that an individual owns. Note that this authority can be the state, a community, or simply by the word of the individual, backed up by force. In anarcho-communism, property is determined by 'usage.' That is, one rightly owns only what ones uses to survive/actualize. We contend that this method of property helps stop the accumulation of property where it is not useful.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; On top of that, the summed results of the NDP and Liberals would only matter if the two parties were merging. Both have denied it and I don't see it happening.

But you really simply can't assume that you'd be able to ""sum"" the results from the two parties. There's a large difference in the policies between the Liberals and the NDP, and the ideologies of those who make up those parties. 

The differences between the former Reform party and the former PCs were fairly minimal. Mainly because the bulk of the impetus for the creation of the Reform party was personality and circumstance driven. Western Canada disliked the way that the Mulroney government didn't seem to mind fucking them over to try and buy votes in Quebec and Ontario in the same manner that the Liberals used to. 

The split was more akin to a divorce; the merger more akin to a reconciliation. 

The NDPs and the Liberals, on the other hand, they've never been ""together"". Thus we can't assume that their former voters would blindly follow suite. 

[Liberal party internal polling suggested that a merger would cost the Liberals about 40% of their votes to the Conservatives, and about 30% of the NDP would either stay home or find someone else to vote for \(probably to the great benefit of the Greens\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/10tok5/my_name_is_brian_g_rice_and_i_am_the_president_of/c6gp2ju?context=3) 

The ultimate effect of such a merger would likely be to guarantee the Conservatives a great deal of electoral success in the long term. ","1388534761"

It's a load a bullshit, the only thing that statistic proves is how much more irrationally violent men are compared with women (result of societal expectations, patriarchy namely). Women try suicide just as often, but because they're less violent it's just seen as a suicidal gesture.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","This is a fascinating perspective and I think Kasparov nails it. Regardless of how good a video game may be, it's popularity will lose mass appeal when newer video games are released. Starcraft is a prime example of this. If anyone has played the original game, it took a few years but it was eventually beautifully balanced by blizzard and went on to see years of wide-spread success, most notably in korea. In korea it was actually televised in huge events with large tournaments, sponsored teams, etc. 

So what happens when Starcraft 2 is released? A large chunk of the community immediately migrated to the game and suddenly people who hadn't played Starcraft in years because they follow the latest video game trend were all on the Starcraft 2 boat. This didn't immediately put the nail in the coffin for the already established professional Starcraft leagues in Korea, but it is now less than 5 years later all the major professional leagues for the original Starcraft are closed except one which is dramatically smaller.

What is the real kicker in this? Ultimately, it didn't matter how balanced the original Starcraft was, or how high the professionals had taken the level of gameplay for it. What really mattered was that the game was old and everyone was more interested in playing the newest and latest game. Ironically, the original Starcraft, which was arguably balanced perfectly, is replaced by a game which many people consider to not be as balanced at the moment and has years (and a new expansion coming out) before it reaches its end state.

And what has happened to many of the Starcraft professionals? Some have managed to make the transition to Starcraft 2, but many have retired or are simply playing other games. This basically means that regardless of one's skill in an older version of a video game, there are / will be fundamental differences when a new version of a video game is released. The eSports community and video game community is basically saying adapt and learn a completely new game, or get out. In a community which constantly forces its players to reinvent themselves on completely new playing fields one could argue that it is essentially cannibalizing a lot of its talent with each game upgrade or switch.

Additionally, there is something to be said for knowing a game. Sports are simple and once you know the rules you are set and can watch the game wherever you would like. The same could be said for established games like chess and go. Once you know the fundamentals of the game you could follow along and generally get what is happening. Clearly, the same thing could be argued for video games but this immediately becomes a problem when the latest and greatest eSports games keep switching. As time goes on it is likely many people will not be willing to devote time to learning a new game, or simply won't have enough time. Suddenly, switching to the latest video game released excludes these people, at least for a time, because they have to learn the game, if they even care to learn it in the first place.

When you start excluding actual fans of competitive eSports based on this principle, how are casual fans who do not follow eSports as much meant to latch onto competitive gaming? Even if a casual fan does become interested in a game, will they still have a passion to learn a new game in 3-5 years when their games isn't the mainstream favourite anymore and professional tournaments for their that game aren't being held anymore. This is certainly hard to say... Of course, an argument could be made that every lost adult fan is replaced by younger individuals who are much more interested in video games in general, but the fact of the matter is eSports is / has more hurdles and complications that current sports / traditional board games.

Although I am sure eSports has many things going for it, the industry appears to be on shaky ground at best. It will be interesting to see how things continue to play out!","1388534763"

"rational","t5_2rdak","As a big lover of D&amp;D, I really enjoyed this ... however, I have a couple quibbles (which might be answered in the linked forum threads, I'll have to read those later).

I don't really understand why anyone would ever make a second city after the first one had been founded. Permanent teleportation circles are *incredibly expensive* (they need an 18th level wizard, 1,000gp, and much more importantly, 4,500xp). You wouldn't make one unless you were linking together two points *and* could make a profit doing so. However, the only way to make a profit is if there are goods to trade, and given the fact that agriculture is essentially eliminated (albeit with a fairly large initial capital investment) along with the creation of most mundane goods ... what goods are there to trade? Pretty much only those associated with material components for spells, or those that can't be created through magical means.

I sort of fail to see why you would ever have two linked megacities, especially since it requires the creation of not just one but *two* permanent teleportation circles, *and* a spell like dimensional lock can be used by either party at either end to block the route completely until force is applied (which costs more money than it seems like you'd be able to make, with again some return on investment problems). So with that said, it seems much more likely to me that there would just be a single megacity, rather than dozens or hundreds of linked cities. Perhaps there would be guarded teleportation circles acting as outposts/feeders for the megacity, but they'd be entirely linked, and they'd need a ridiculous ROI in order to be worth it.

Tippyverse also has a couple of things that I think are somewhat questionable but maybe defensible - it seems to assume that XP is rather cheap, what with lots of high level wizards walking around and blowing XP on all sorts of items and spells. It also makes heavy use of ""traps that aren't traps"", which requires a fairly \*ahem\* elaborate reading of the rules as written.

Then again, it's a fairly optimized and coherent setting based on an inherently incoherent ruleset whose economics were laid out by a group of people who seem to only have the vaguest understanding of how economics actually works.

Edit: [This thread](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=247468&amp;page=1) is my favorite so far, which contains some good debate:

&gt; 1. Tippyverse rules are not universally accepted
2. Given the rules, Tippyverse assumptions are not universally accepted
3. Given the rules and assumptions, Tippyverse outcomes are not universally accepted.

Edit 2: Having read through most of the threads, I would suggest not reading most of the threads. It seems to descend into the typical char op arguing about RAW v. RAI v. what a reasonable GM would actually let you get away with for pages and pages. If you go by RAW, the first person to chain-gate Solars gets an infinite number of wishes and wins forever, which is certainly rational and optimal, but not actually very interesting. Hell, by RAW you can have infinite wealth at level 7. The Tippyverse, at its best, seems to me like it works by removing most of the completely broken stuff, and you can see that in the threads where there are things that work by RAW but completely break the Tippyverse; people don't like them, and will make shitty justifications for why it's not so. Tippyverse is better if it's just a formal list of magics available and the consequences of them, instead of just saying that it's the rules taken to their logical conclusions, because that results in derailing conversations about the somewhat incoherent rules of D&amp;D when seen without a dungeon master there to mediate. It's an interesting setting as an exploration of how different reality-breaking spells interact with each other, given people thinking intelligently and a boatload of assumptions about how XP accumulation and D&amp;D economy work.","1388534764"

He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to the American People were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.

Lee was a Marine for three years. When he was young he watched the war videos and he said to dad ""I want to be in the war daddy.""

Dad said ""No! You will BE KILL BY FREEMASONS""

There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in Houston Texas he knew there were Freemasons.

""This is Merletti"" the radio crackered. ""You must fight the Freemasons!""

So Lee gotted his Model 91 rifle and got in a window.

""HE GOING TO EXPOSE US"" said the Freemasons.

""I will discredit him"" said the Cybermason and he fired the coverup missiles. Lee shotted at him and tried to blew him up in the papers. But then the censor fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.

""No! I must kill the Freemasons"" he shouted

The radio said ""No, Lee. You are the Freemasons""

And then Lee was a government assassin.

"BMW","t5_2qn3a","Forza 4 honestly looks just about as good, and by just about I mean to say, you are not going to tell the difference. The real difference comes in while driving the car. The image shown is in the garage, so the systems resources are all being used towards making a car and a very small environment look really really good! But to really see the difference run a race with 10 other vehicles on the entire Nurburgring Nordschlief track, and take a picture. The game now has to drive 10 vehicles while simultaneously tracking precise vehicle measurements like tire pressure and things like the camber while the car is traveling through corners, and account for the aerodynamics of each car while they drafting others, and a multitude of other process's for all the cars, and also we still haven't accounted for the 12.somthing miles of track it has to generate. Take a picture in race and you will certainly see a difference. 

Forza is the most realistic racing simulator on the market while still being able to turn on enough vehicle assists for total noobs to start playing. Cars are speced to their real world counterpart, tracks are supposedly identacle to their real world counterparts. It feels real, even traveling through a corner at 45mph feels real, you feel the car slip as you over accelerate coming out of a corner or mistime a shift. You feel the car loosen its grip when you travel over hills at top speeds, even in the straight always you feel the speed, and control you have of the car.

For the GPU: Assuming the market stays the same as it has been in the last few years, we can guess consoles will dictate demands for upcoming titles.

There's a difference between addiction and withdrawal. Most stimulants and sedatives are addictive, and most antidepressants are not, though as you noted withdrawal is still a problem. When my wife suddenly decided she was done with her meds and didn't need to get a refill (which she'd been seriously considering for a while anyway), she went through the ""brain zaps"" and was a bit depressed for a while, but she wasn't craving her medication the way people do when taken off amphetamines or benzodiazepines. She also had bad experiences with some other drugs, but given the long-term benefit, the short term troubles while finding the right antidepressant were worthwhile. The problems she had on antipsychotics weren't particularly informative, other than to prove to her psychiatrist that she wasn't psychotic. That's a case where being assertive with your psychiatrist is very important.","1388534771"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't disagree with the idea that these jobs are not taxing on mental ability but I think that it is a problematic belief.  Most people working at McDonalds or really any minimum wage job are not doing it because it was their goal in life or even close to the peak of their abilities. 


To be honest its more of a wider reaching problem than that minimum wage is too low, all of our wage scale is a bit unhealthy, CEO pay is almost uncompetitively high, the added burden of under paid workers is an unnecessary stress on our social welfare programs, raises taxes for employers and workers while not improving living conditions, Average income has either stagnated or dropped in many fields and areas for almost three decades, and a magnitude of other less direct problems like the devaluation of a college and HS degree.


Do I know if raising the minimum wage is the correct answer? No and yes, no I do not think that it is a complete solution, yes I do think that its past due anyway, and should be updated more regularly to reflect changes in cost of living and purchasing power parity.","1388534772"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll start with one of mine, because sadly there are a few. 
A girl I was friends with was getting rid of some posters so I ended up with a huge poster of Katy Perry. She thought it'd be funny to hang it above my bed so she'd be watching me sleep (funnier to 14-year-old us) 
Fast forward 2 years. I'm dating a girl and she comes over for the first time. We lay in my bed, and she notices a half-naked Katy Perry hovering above us. She gets *jealous* and demands i take it down. After explaining that its been there for years and I barely notice it, she stands up on the bed and tears it right in half. She smiles at me, and I am dumbfounded. 
I told her the next day I couldn't go out with someone who was going to be jealous of a poster.

TL;DR: Girl got jealous of Katy Perry poster i had, tore it in half, and I broke up with her shortly after.

Also not saying to_wit doesn't know a lot about the sport, but I wouldn't consider someone just knowing a lot about tyson and ali as someone who knows loads about the sport.  Those two boxers are probably the most analyzed boxers in the history of the sport.  There are so many neglected figures in the sport among casual boxing fans such as sweet pea, robinson, leonard, roy jones, holmes, Teófilo Stevenson, chavez, pac, mayweather, rigo, list goes on.

I might put mayweather, rigondeaux, or prime tyson as #1 p4p of all time.  Most people's arguments against this would be ""who did these people fight?""   And my response is still always, p4p is about skill, not who they beat.  Ring generalship, power, speed, accuracy, defense, hitting without getting hit etc.  Also, boxing has changed, like sweat pea was probably the best defensive boxer of his time, but mayweather has incorporated everything he did and now does it better.

&gt; I compiled just a few things that should be changed in regards to broadcaster mode to add to the viewers experience, and add to the depth and diversity of casting on call of duty ghosts.

&gt;Let me know your thoughts!!

&gt;1) On the left hand side of the gamer tag on the main scoreboard, it shows the rank of the player. You can't rank up In system link leaving it pointless. Potentially change the rank of the GT to their current killstreak... By doing this, we can always spectate the player who is heating up, as apposed to guessing.

&gt;2) When a GT is highlighted on the scoreboard, (not selected, just hovered over) the correspondent arrow on the minimap should highlight to show the players whereabouts on the map. This means we can refer to players without actually going into first person view of them. Also reduces randomly cycling through to find that arrow at the top of the map who is about to make a sneaky play in blitz. Less changing players makes it easier for viewers to follow.

&gt;3) The kill feed needs to be added somewhere permanently within broadcaster. My suggestion, the bottom left. The icon indicating the static cameras aren't necessary. People love staring at the kill feed. Allows them to follow the action in there own way.

&gt;4) When a player has been chosen to spectate, it needs to be clearer who is selected. White arrow is not clear enough. It at times fades into the minimap. Make the arrow bigger and be creative with colors. As along as the arrow stands out more that is all that matters.

&gt;5) Upon selecting a player the current highlight of the team icon is not clear enough (just the bottom half) It needs to highlight the full icon and even further dull the other team icon out to emphasise the team being currently watched. It may sound small, but to many viewers this extra clarity is needed.

&gt;6) Remove the cycle option. Eg hit RT twice to get to scoreboard. This is unnecessary and Should just be hit it once and it appears. Casters will not use the other option. (How it is when you normally play) Scoreboard will be permanently up throughout casting.

&gt;7) Broadcaster must show +100 for kill, and the same for assist ect (makes it clearer for the audience and also the casters) This is pretty essential as it is the only way to confirm wether it was a kill or an assist. 

&gt;8) Broadcaster mode needs to have the indicator of how much of the flag is capped, bomb plant ect. For example when playing, you see the progression bar appear when capturing/ neutralising/ planting/ defusing an objective. By seeing this you create those clutch moments which are essential to COD eSports and it's growth in terms of viewership.

&gt;9) The colors of the teams on the minimap should not change dependant on who is viewed. Eg just because I change team, the arrows shouldn't go red to indicate enemy players. The colors need to be static and assigned to a team, not just the enemy team. Eg red for col, blue for tK regardless of what team I am currently spectating.

&gt;10) Right now, the bottom right of broadcaster is dead space. Add the gun name, attachments, perks, score streaks there. Essential things to add depth to casting and again the viewership experience.

&gt;11) When a player dies the red indicator needs to be immediate. I think it may be the killcam that is forcing it to not work properly. Right now there is a substantial delay.

&gt;12) The last thing that needs some work is the location of the static cameras. I assumed these have been located via data received from hotspots. These hotspots will be where the action is in a 6v6 match. This differs greatly in a 4v4. Routes will develop as the meta game evolves. For now I would recommend on SnD 2 on bombsites and 2 on the major choke points of the bomb sites. For Dom, every obj point. For blitz, both flags and 2 major choke points. What would be really cool would be if he casters could assign them themselves during the match countdown. Not sure how possible that is though.

&gt;As I said at Columbus, the majority of the changes are minor with only a few big ones needed.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","&gt;If you do this, the dog will escalate and that growl will turn into a bite. 

Haha, you like to save the bullet I disagree with for last. That theory is practically a religious belief in the positive training community. However, there is no research supporting it or any evidence that it has ever actually happened. In [this article,](http://www.seespotrunkennel.com/blog/punishing-out-warning-signals-reality-or-myth/) the author, Ruth Crisler, asks some prominent positive training authors to explain.

&gt;Relatively few of the examples they raised in defense of the theory included both a before and after component. Those that did mainly showed only a loose correlation between the punishment and biting, and hardly any were clearly distinguishable from cases involving more straightforward escalation from growl to bite.
&gt;As for a scientific basis, no one pointed to any beyond suggesting the claim had been extrapolated from scientific principles, probably by Ian Dunbar. I dug a bit further and found more references to Dunbar, so I contacted him.

Dunbar answers that ... well, in certain circumstances, it *could* result in the dog biting without any warning. 

The author concludes:

&gt;The claim that punishing a dog for growling may cause him to bite without warning is made so frequently, and with such authority, that it should hold up to a little scrutiny, in my opinion. Yet a casual inspection reveals little foundation and lots of loose ends.

&gt;At minimum, it’s an exaggeration of how typical this phenomenon is, and an overstatement of our understanding of how aggression works. At worst, it’s a questionable idea whose main attraction is its utility as a scare tactic.

[Punishing Out Warning Signals: Reality or Myth?](http://www.seespotrunkennel.com/blog/punishing-out-warning-signals-reality-or-myth/)

Meanwhile, there are all the other dog trainers in the world who do not believe this theory. I consider Seeing Eye as representative of the mainstream. Anyway, no one has a better record of success. They recommend the opposite:

&gt;Always correct for each “woof”, bark, low growl, etc. otherwise the behavior has the potential to escalate.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Son, I shall tell you the tale of Batman Toes.

The girl I dated immediately before my wife: she was pretty damned cool. Attractive, smart, had various exciting ambitions. Seemed like this could have been a good one.

Our first night after smashing our junk together, all seemed right with the world. She lay in bed next to me sleeping, I lay staring at the ceiling with satisfaction. 

Then, as I look to the foot of the bed, I notice something that I can only best describe as Batman sneaking up under the covers. If this is hard for you to imagine, think of a bed sheet draped over his headgear.

I'm slightly frightened, but mostly curious in what way she must be contorted to produce such an effect. I shrug it off and fall asleep.

The next morning, she gets up early and makes breakfast. I was quite delicious. Then, I notice a very strange clicking type noise. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. I finally notice it's following her as she walks around the kitchen in her bare feet.

Then, then I see.

I see what has brought itself into my house.

As I examine what God has given her to stand on for the rest of her life, I notice that not all the little piggies seem to be agreeing with each other.

Big toe? hmm... seems fine.

Next? check.

Middle toe? Couldn't be more normal.

4th wheel? Coming up roses.

Pinkie-..... wha.... what is ... what *IS* that?!

Her pinkie toes, both feet, were LONGER than her big toes. Think of RoboCop 2's feet... things getting out like they evolved to warn her of things in her path.

I began to imagine a future of fucked-up-toe'd little children running around the house, tapping their way through worn out socks...

*NOT ON MY WATCH, MOTHER FUCKER*


Never called her back.

This story also falls under the most douchebaggity thing I've ever done. If I could contact her (can't even remember her name), I'd call and apologize for my actions. 

Batman Toes girl, *if you're out there*, I truly apologize. Pinkie swear.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","[3111.03 Presumption of paternity.](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3111.03) says that a man is presumed the father of any child born during his marriage, or within 300 days after the termination of his marriage. 
    
If a presumed father can't afford an attorney or enforce his right to demand proof of paternity in the form of a paternity test, that can lead to him being assessed a child support obligation, which will be enforced by the state if the mother requests or if she obtains welfare assistance of any kind.    
    
Judges in Ohio don't necessarily stick to the state codes when determining a man's child support obligation, sometimes basing it (as was done in my husband's case) on what the judge wants the man to earn instead of what he actually does. The state also makes payment through the state mandatory. It's my understanding that Ohio isn't the only state that does this combination of things. 

Once the state is confiscating half (or more) of a man's income, it becomes nearly impossible for him to fight the order, even by demanding a paternity test. He won't have enough left to live on, much less fuel a legal battle. ","1388534788"

"miamidolphins","t5_2s20n","I'm saying its obvious to me that Ireland is not a good GM, because any GM can make flashy offseason acquisitions, so that's not indicative of Ireland's or any GM's talent. A GM's merit can be found in the draft and Ireland has been very mediocre in that regard. 

I have never been a believer in the saying ""you are what your record says you are,"" because football games have the most arbitrary outcomes in all of sports. Bad teams make the playoffs, and even go pretty far in the playoffs. Even make a super bowl maybe! (see: 2007 Giants. If the Super Bowl was a best-of series, New England wins) 

Because you have one game sample sizes in the playoffs and relatively small number of games in the regular season, and with that system anything can happen, thus you kinda have to use the eye test or set a higher standard for what a good team is record-wise (say anything 12-4 and above). If a couple more things bounced our way in all these close games we played, we could easily be 10-6, but that doesn't make this team good. It makes us more lucky. Because it shows that we don't have the talent to blow bad teams out or play consistently. ","1388534789"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","So in 1782, Daikokuya Kodayu sets sail from Suzuka headed for Tokyo. A giant squall comes along and blows him *way* off coarse. After spending 7 months at sea, he and his crew land on an Aleutian Island called Amchitka (interestingly, this island would later be used as a nuclear weapons test site). There, Daikokuya met a bunch of Russian fur trappers who he befriended. The Russians were waiting for a ship to come and take them home and offered Daikokuya a ride back to Russia. When the ship finally showed up, it hit some rocks off the coast of the island and sank, stranding the Japanese sailors and Russian fur trappers for even longer. Eventually, they ended up building a boat/raft out of drift wood and managed to sail to Kamchatka.

Once they arrived, the Japanese crew was informed that they could not be transported back to Japan without leave from Tsarina Catherine I... who was on the other side of Russia in St. Petersburg. Erik Laxmann, a Swedish-born Russian officer, offered to transport them back to St. Petersburg and request audience with the Empress. By this time it was around 1789, so the Japanese sailors had been away from home for about 7 years.

They eventually get over to St. Petersburg, and it takes them forever to get an audience with Catherine. During that time, Laxmann comes down with Typhoid fever, delaying things even further. It wouldn't be until 1791 -- 9 years after the crew set sail -- that Catherine gave them leave to return home. However, there was one condition. Japan, at the time was closed off to foreign trade, so Catherine wanted to secure a trade agreement in exchange for the return of the sailors.

It was agreed that Laxmann's son, Lt. Adam Laxmann, would lead the voyage to return the Japanese crew to their home.

So they sail all the way back around the globe to Japan and wind up in Hokkaido, where they're told that the shogunate requires that all treating must be conducted in Nagasaki. So, off they went. (I'm leaving some details out here, but this is getting longer than I expected.)

Upon arrival, Laxmann tries to treat with the shogunate, but they're very resistant. After a long negotiation, Laxmann walks away with a piece of paper that says Russia is allowed to bring *one* ship, *once* a year to trade with Japan.

So, in 1792, the Japanese survivors finally get to go home after 10 years. Laxmann returns to Russia with his small trade agreement.

Years later, in 1805, Russia tries to make good on the trade agreement and shows up with some goods. Unfortunately for the Russians, the shogunate informed them that the treaty was no longer valid and that Japan was closed to foreign trade.

In response to this, Russian ships bombarded a few coastal villages on the way back to Russia. The cold reception was a surprise to the Tsarist government and soured relations between the two empires for years to come.

The Russians got more aggressive in the region, and this eventually led to blows over the Kuril Islands. These problems would persist throughout the 19th century, and eventually lead to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904.

Granted, there were several other contributing factors, but I like to think of Daikokuya Kodayu as being the man who knocked over the first domino.","1388534792"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","He is a good 3pt shooter and will only continue to get better, but your reasoning is based purely on stats. Lebron has been taking probably the best shots you can in a game and this has led to his phenomenal percentages. He shoots mainly wide open 3 point shots and if he is contested, defenders usually give him a lot of space because he's so good at getting to the rim. So he's a good 3pt shooter for sure but you can't just say he's better than Kobe at 3pt shooting because of his percentages. Kobe has a tendency to take ill-advised shots and that lowers his percentages. But he is a really good 3pt shooter still. Lebron's jumpshot has gotten much better over the years, but I think the increase in efficiency is because he takes the best possible shots he can. His jumpshot is still not as reliable as Kobe's.","1388534794"

"batman","t5_2qqt8","Personally,  agree completely. OP did ask for stuff similar to marvel's essentials; that's why I linked the Chronicles. However, I agree. Start with Year One, and follow what's called the ""Modern Age"" of Batman. Most, if not all, stories recommended take place after Year One from a continuity standpoint. 

New 52 is also an excellent place to jump on from the very beginning, as there are only twenty-odd issues in each title currently. 

Though the Golden Age stories collected in the Batman Chronicles should be appreciated and recognized for what they contributed to the character (hell, they started it!) there are much more interesting, fulfilling stories to be read. ","1388534804"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; You're welcome to call it a misuse, though I would disagree with you. There are (probably) as many different variations of capitalism as there are socialism ; 

Well, that's the point. We're not about to say that state-socialism is not ""real"" socialism. Merely that that's not the aspect of socialism that we're proposing. We will readily state that the centrally planned markets through state intervention, while totally socialism, is antithetical to our proposed beliefs. 

That's the inconsistency with most anti-state pro-capitalists. As I stated earlier, there's a very clear cognitive dissonance over the issue when you specify both ""crony capitalism"" and ""free market capitalism"" as being separate. Clearly they're both capitalism, it's just that one of them you oppose. The latter is not ""true capitalism"" any more or less than the other. It's merely that the latter is your preferred version of capitalism. 

Using ""capitalism"" interchangeably with ""free markets"" dilutes the value and importance of each. 

------

&gt;You're also welcome to take issue with some people's attitudes. I have no issue with that, though I do think it may end up as a red herring and detract from the more important issue of values/principles. While arguing with someone's attitude may be helpful in promoting a healthier tone to an argument, it doesn't really address any real issues.

Again, I don't use it as a reason to poke holes in the philosophy. Which is why I'm very careful to explain that it has nothing to do with the actual philosophy. It's just one of those irritating things about *most* AnCaps, especially the voluntarist breed.

It just makes me want to roll my eyes and make a jacking off gesture in one hand while pretending to suck a dick with my other hand. 

It's something that I've only heard one say in person once and they instantly shut up once I pointed out that inconsistency. Granted, I was a complete dick about it, but I was pretty pissed at the hypocrisy. 

-----

&gt; It's a bit wordy, but short enough not to need its own book, and I think it does a pretty good job of arguing not simply why private property rights exist, but also how they exist in opposition to the state.

Well, as I mentioned the redistribution of land by Henry VIII. That's where we get our entire concept of Private Property Rights as well as all the factors unique to PPR. Hoppe himself had noted that without that redistribution, we would still be acting on a communal sense of ownership. Even in the New World, it was the capitalists (formerly mercantilists, former feudalists) that attempted to re-establish PPR in America and that was the basis for nearly every conflict with the native populations all throughout the East coast.

The vast majority of people wanted to establish the former ""muddy"" ownership systems through tilling and land use, which was strongly favored with the native populations. But it was the powerful land owners and backers of the expeditions that messed things up. The result was the slaughter of the native populations from Georgia to Nova Scotia. 

------

&gt; With logical inconsistency, you'll have to be more specific. I hope I haven't been inconsistent in our discussion, but if I have please point it out. If you're speaking more generally, then I can't really do anything about it, and you have my condolences.

That's a long list and it's nothing that you said. It's after many discussions with RightLibs in the past. Unfortunately, it's New Year's Eve... I'm a bartender. That means I have to work soon. It's going to be busy.

Stay safe. If you go out, please don't drive yourself. And always tip your bartender.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I doubt my post will get any visibility 7 hours after the fact, but I like contributing to economic discussion too much to forgo it.

I saw already a couple of major points to the opposition:  simple S&amp;D economics, and what exactly is a ""living wage?""  One i'd like to add is:  the unintended consequences to political policy, and why a minimum wage may contain those consequences.

Unintended consequences are, self-evident by name, bad things that happen that we didn't see coming.  Raising the minimum wage (more than slightly) to, say, 15$/hr, would have unintended consequences.  It would result in higher unemployment (businesses forgoing the hiring of more workers, perhaps even laying off people because they want to maintain profits, or literally can't afford a marginal worker) and a readjustment in the types of jobs demanded.  So, say I went to uni to be an IT guy, and figure maybe starting, I get 14-16$/hr.  I don't want to diminish the work of, say, a Walmart worker, or someone who works at a restaurant, but I would say the IT job takes a degree of knowledge, and ability that the average man doesn't quite have, as opposed to the mentioned jobs.  When you set the lowest possible wage to at or around the same wage of the IT worker, he is more likely to take up the easier job, in his own self interest.  This applies to all sectors:  you've effectively put a monetary incentive on the easier jobs.  It probably wouldn't be a massacre ""everyone goes for the easier jobs,"" but it's an effect i'm sure you'd see. ","1388534810"

Musical

Cab Calloway, Ida James, Jeni Le Gon, William Campbell    
Director: Josh Binney; Writer: Hal Seeger

**IMDb user rating:** &amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734; 5.7/10 (122 votes)
&gt; Bandleader Cab Calloway is tiring of his sexy girlfriend Minnie, who in turn is jealous of Cab's manager Nettie. When Nettie gets Cab a job at the Brass Hat Club, Minnie retaliates for his imagined infidelity by setting gangster Boss Mason, owner of a rival club, against him. Will she regret her action before it's too late? (This plot resolves halfway through the film; the rest is a series of 'soundies' featuring the Calloway band's inimitable jive). All-black cast.

In some cases, hallucinations, seizures, kidney failure, hyperthermia, and coma can occur.

"SCP","t5_2r4ni","&gt; SPC 

I think I've identified your first problem.

Anyway...

Explore the tag guide on the site and find ones that would be suitable for you (there is no doubt a humanoid tag, which will probably be characters your players can meet, and maybe a beast or animal tag for monsters).

Read the GOI page.  This isn't a criticism directed at you at all, because you are presenting a blank page for us to doodle on, but I hate it when content creators roll up and say, 'What SCPs should I have in my game/story/film/amateur pornography?' because there is so much more to the Foundationverse than the SCPs.  The SCPs, to me, are the background to the narrative.  

I've never played a Pen and Paper RPG before, but I imagine you could set it as some agents trying to track down an SCP in the wild.  You could have it so that they have to interview locals, and then maybe they encounter a GOI (GOC or HI if you fancy an argument, or CoBG or CI if you fancy a fight) and then encounter the SCP itself so they have to somehow capture it without killing/destroying it.","1388534818"

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","Interesting, I'd also like to hear some insight as to why you switched as I recently just made the opposite jump from Live to Logic...and honestly couldn't be happier.  

Logic is deep, very very deep.  I'm still scraping the surface.  Initially, it seems to comes off as pretentious, but I've realized that it really makes things so much easier and quicker for me.  I know 95% of Live like the back of my hand, memorized and used all the keyboard shortcuts, etc...even made a bunch of my own using third party software...but at the end of the day issues with CPU management, PDC, and a horrendous arrangement workflow (from my own perspective) drew me away from it.  I only rewire it now when I need it.

Logic definitely seemed slower in the beginning, but I've realized that once you develop a workflow, memorize the shortcuts, and make your own...it easily blows by other DAWs, such as Live, in speed and efficiency.  The automation and piano roll/hyper editor functionality in Logic were a huge breath of fresh air for me and I can't even imagine functioning without screensets anymore.

Either way, best of luck and thank you very much for contributing these!  Can't wait to try them out.","1388534822"

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Ala Michael Ruhlman's Recipe

Red Wine–Braised Short Ribs:  
Canola oil  
All-purpose/plain flour  
8 beef short ribs  
2 large onions, cut into large dice  
Kosher salt  
4 carrots, cut into bite-size pieces  
2 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch/2.5-centimeter pieces  
2 tablespoons tomato paste/puree  
3 cups/720 milliliters Zinfandel or other fruit-heavy red wine  
1 garlic head, halved horizontally  
One 1-inch/2.5-centimeter piece of fresh ginger  
2 bay leaves  
1/3 cup/75 milliliters honey  
1 teaspoon peppercorns, cracked beneath a sauté pan  
1 tablespoon butter  
1 pound/455 grams mushrooms, seared  


Gremolata:  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  
1 tablespoon minced garlic  
1 tablespoon grated or minced lemon zest


In a Dutch oven or other heavy ovenproof pot, add enough oil to reach 1/4 inch/6 millimeters up the sides and heat over high heat. Put some flour on a plate. Dredge the short ribs in the flour, shaking off the excess. When the oil is hot, add the ribs and brown on all sides. You may need to do this in batches; you don’t want to crowd the pan, or the ribs won’t brown. Remove the ribs to a plate lined with paper towels/absorbent paper. (This can be done a day before cooking the ribs; cover them and refrigerate until you’re ready to proceed).


Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C/gas 1/2.


Wipe the pot clean and sauté half of the onions in a film of oil over medium heat until softened. (Refrigerate the remaining onions until needed.) Add a four-finger pinch of salt and stir. Add half of the carrots (refrigerate the remaining carrots until needed) and the celery and cook for about 4 minutes longer. The longer you cook the vegetables, the deeper the flavor of the sauce will be. For intensely deep flavor, cook until the carrots and onions are browned. Add the tomato paste/puree and cook to heat it.
Nestle the ribs in the pot. Add the wine (it should come three-fourths of the way up the ribs), garlic, ginger, and bay leaves. Season with a three-finger pinch of salt and add the honey and peppercorns. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a parchment round or a lid set ajar, and slide into the oven  Cook the ribs for 4 hours.


Remove the pot from the oven and allow the ribs to cool, covered. When the ribs are cool enough to handle, put them on a plate, cover with plastic wrap/cling film, and refrigerate.  Strain the cooking liquid into a tall vessel (a 4-cup/96-milliliter glass measuring cup is best), cover, and refrigerate. When the liquid is chilled, remove the congealed fat and discard.
Melt the butter in your braising pot. Add the reserved onions and carrots and sauté until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the ribs to the pot and add the seared mushrooms. Add the reserved cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook over medium-high heat until the carrots are tender and the ribs are heated through, about 15 minutes.


Make the Gremolata: In a small bowl, stir the parsley, garlic, and lemon zest until evenly distributed. Serve the short ribs with the carrots, onions, mushrooms, and sauce. Garnish with the gremolata.","1388534829"

Use Vaseline to remove excess makeup 
Moisturize

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think the reason it's not cheaper for many people is based on the following reasons:

1) Not planning adequately

2) Wasted food

3) Not having a fully stocked kitchen

So, if you have to buy every ingredient for every dish every time you want to cook, it gets expensive. I cook for myself and my partner, and we *also* spend about $125 on groceries a week. But I plan out meals carefully and if one dish requires something like half a head of cabbage, I will find another dish to cook that week to use the rest of the cabbage. A lot of people just cook randomly and throw out 1/3 of what they cook, plus tons of unused ingredients, and shit ends up being pretty expensive.","1388534838"

"news","t5_2qh3l","Well... He should (after a trial where he is found guilty). Before you instantly downvote my 'incorrect' opinion at least understand why I think this.

Unless you actually think that he read [all 1,700,000 classified-or-higher documents](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowden-still-holding-keys-to-the-kingdom/2013/12/18/b91d29a2-6761-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html) he stole and gave away, and decided that each and every one of them represented a threat to the American people's civil liberties, **he is guilty of espionage on a massive scale**.

Of course, any presumed 'whistleblower protection' is easily refuted by the foreign intelligence gathering 'revelations'. How could you possibly argue that he didn't knowingly sabotage completely legal and completely legitimate surveillance of foreign countries, which is the NSA's primary mandate?

I assume I'll get at least one non-American saying they don't deserve to get surveilled. For convenience, I'll assume you are German (but this works for anybody really). Do you know why the US bothers to spy on you and your country? Try the [Hamburg Al Qaeda cell that eventually provided the pilots on 9/11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_cell). Think the US shouldn't be bugging Merkel's phone? Where was your outrage when the [German BND was spying on and tapping the phones of every single Afghan Minister of Parliament](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bnd-affairs-broadens-german-spies-put-afghan-ministry-under-surveillance-a-549894.html)? I thought so.

Maybe you're Russian now: [how did you feel when the Illegals Program came to light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program)? That program where a network of 10 spies were actively working their way into classified information, posing as ordinary Americans and even planning to bring their kids into the mix?

Let's say you are Brazilian now. Apparently we shouldn't be surveilling them, even though [Brazil has had exactly zero laws against cyber crime until this past February](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/15/brazil_cybercrime_shocker/), making it de facto legal and unchallenged by authorities. Even now the law is spuriously enforced. Fun fact: [did you know that Brazilian hackers have broken into US military satellites?](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2009/04/fleetcom?currentPage=all) Is this really not warranting of surveillance, when our defense infrastructure is routinely pounded from all corners of the globe on a daily basis?

The US is the world's largest economy, one the most technologically and scientifically advanced countries on the planet, the country with the largest military by numerous orders of magnitude **and you don't think any one is spying back on the United States?**

I genuinely don't like Snowden (I actually have many more reasons but I'll leave them out out of brevity's sake). I think he is a criminal as plain as day. I don't expect this opinion to be popular and it will probably get buried. All the same, I don't care because reddit circlejerks aside, this forum is hardly a mirror of society's perceptions at large.

I can only hope that Justice will rule the day and he will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and the key to his cell is thrown away.","1388534847"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked in high school at a grocery store with a lot of high schoolers who are still working there--""lifers"". Even when I worked there I knew they would be there, or somewhere comparable, for the rest of their lives. I didn't know anything about most people's backgrounds, except a couple friends there, but the lifers were obvious. They were the people who didn't show up for work, and when they did, showed up late. They were the ones who avoided doing any work, smoked weed on their breaks, and smarted off to our boss. Those same mentalities are why they didn't do well in high school, never went to college, and are stuck at a grocery store for the rest of their lives.

Not everyone working these jobs is lazy. But it doesn't take a 150 IQ to get a B average in high school, which is enough to get into any state school, and with in-state tuition and working part-time during the year and full-time during the summer for minimum wage, you can get out of college with very little debt in a degree you can get a job in. It's definitely easier if your parents have money, but almost anyone can do it, if they have a strong work ethic and don't just blow off high school.","1388534850"

It's true that there are probably a small percentage of people who purchase the equipment and from there decide to fully and completely dedicate themselves to getting results. They may find it to be way more work than advertised, but they manage to make it happen through a lot of dedication and desire to go above-and-beyond. Of course, these are the stories that are going to be sold to you.
  
For the larger majority of people, they will do one of two things: They may try it for a while, see some results, but find that it is very challenging and not as quick and easy as they were led to believe. They'll shrug their shoulders and figure it was worth a shot.

How many people have created works similar to Stephen King's (or just about any other big, popular author)? There are plenty of movies that come out that are similar in theme and ideal, but are not direct copies or close enough copies that they need to pay for the rights to use them.

If the Beastie Boys eventually fade into oblivion and are completely forgotten about, so be it. Is that not their right? Perhaps they would rather remain long forgotten then to have their work revived in the future because it was used in a car commercial. Shouldn't they be allowed to do so?

- I use a Haku team, can a Neptune fit in there? Never saw someone  saying to use him because I think poison on a spike team is a bit useless, but his W/D evo got a good type for a Haku team.

Now on JP I was using a Luci team and I was dumb an I rolled in this godfest without knowing what was in.

Got this with 5 rolls:

-Belial can team up with Sonia?( never saw a Sonia team so I get no Idea what to use)

- That Snake, his active is good for grinding( good because I need to get a lot of team cost)And his evo is F/D, with a incredible 2k attack, but no devil type, have some use for me besides grinding?

But when you live in Canada you gotta pay attention to what's going on in America. Though, there's Quebec. Because of Quebec we must allow Catholics to have their own school system. We didn't want them joining the Americans and the trade off was we had to protect the French Catholic way of life, so that's how English Canada got in bed with the French.

Also used to live in China. Religion was persecuted for a couple decades there, the only restriction now is that proselytizing is illegal and your religious head cannot be a foreign leader. So it's a law designed to pretty much cripple catholic missionaries who people view as likely spies. Also in most major religions in China coercion and arguing is looked down upon so people in China just plain don't proselytize. 

One interesting thing I find is non-North Americans seem confused when I tell them it's rude to ask someone their religion or where they're from. ","1388534863"

The USA could have saved the people inside, but instead of bombing the fucking perimeter chose to leave it burn.  I know the dude. He would not have wanted a crowd of people to burn in hell fire to save his own ass which is the only chance he would have had.  I agree with that decision.  Instead he died chocking on the fumes of the embassy burning around him.

So do you agree with human shields? If I hold a fuck ton of people hostage what is your response?  Am I immune to action because i have a child in my house or my wife is sleeping?  Should we risk life and limb when a simple rocket does the job?  

These assholes choose to keep their family's in their cars, homes, places of planning.  For a reason.  In the hope that we will not attack.   If you choose to plan terrorist attacks via your house.  Then that is your problem.

"Diablo3witchdoctors","t5_2vbd9","get rid of the inna's, or just get ones with 180+ vit, since you have a skorn you dont need as much EHP with the added LS

also, i would try and get attack speed on one piece of gear, the 1.31 breakpoint is the best for a skorn WD

another big thing for you is going to be crafting, crafting bracers is a HUGE dps and possible EHP upgrade for you, adding all the extra int is going to help a lot, especially since you only have 90 on your current ones

another big dps increase is your skorn, the one you have only has 1k damage, which isnt very good i would try and get 1300 and drop like 20 or so crit damage which will be about 17k more damage if i didnt fuck up simulating it 

the EHP you want to obtain to do mp10 with a skorn would be around 420-450k, i do mp10 with 1h/mojo on [my WD](http://d3up.com/b/1023605/scrubcore) with 446k EHP and the only thing i really have problems with is reflect which shouldnt be too much of a problem with skorn but you could aim for 500k+ if you want it to be a lot easier

to get to that EHP level i would get some all resist on your amulet, gloves or boots to reach 700+ all res, you also should switch the red gem in your helm to a amethyst, its almost always better to use one in your helm as a WD since EHP is SOOO important. your armour is also very low, i would recommend getting 250+ armour on your chest and getting some on your bracers, or getting rare pants but you may want to keep the inna's if you really like the movement speed or want to hit the 1.31 breakpoint, i would aim for at least 3500 armour minimum 

i would also switch out the mana spiders on your build especially with a skorn CoB isnt mana intensive enough to warrant using them at all, so switching them for a damage buff like BBV is probably the best, killing elite packs is going to be a lot faster, and when you pull huge packs you just drop that shit and everything melts, also once you get enough armour to not need frightening aspect you can drop it for another damage buff like mass confusion/paranoia or hex/jinx or you could use bears, but bears are pretty annoying to use with a skorn IMO","1388534866"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;What it seems like they are saying, however, is that because they made some big mistakes they shouldn't be afforded an option or a path to get out of it and better themselves.

Seriously, who the hell is saying that?

&gt;being forced into a shitty minimum wage job and deciding wether to feed their children or have heat this week.

If you work minimum wage and you have a child then you're eligible for food benefits. Plus, there's food banks, volunteer programs, and church food drives. Schools provide subsidized or free lunches to poor children. If you ~~have a job~~ live in America then you're not starving. 

&gt;My major issue with the ""paying consequences"" theory is that you are now saying that their children should have to pay for their parents mistakes as well, which is in no way fair or even excusable.

Absolutely not. Like you said, one major reason that people get into this mess in the first place is because of their childhood. Children should have all of their basic needs provided for; shelter, clothing, education, food, etc. And for the most part we already provide that. 

But we weren't talking about the children, we were talking about the parents. The parents should have opportunities to better themselves and they still do. But if they decided to have kids before they got **any** valuable job skills then they shouldn't be surprised if they're poor after they have kids. ","1388534869"

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I found the interview you linked quite alarming.

&gt;**Todd:** The Hi-Rez EULA actually makes our anti-cheating policy very clear. The EULA asks users to confirm they do not use cheats or unauthorized programs at ANY time. The EULA also says that Hi-Rez may monitor for these programs.

Why should HiRez take any interest in what a Smite player does when he does *not* play Smite? And why should HiRez reserve the right to monitor for programs when Smite isn't running?

&gt;**Todd:** We are very confident that banned players have been appropriately banned. They are trying to connect to Hi-Rez servers while having recognized blacklisted programs and cheats.

As was pointed out in the thread by /u/marclewal, the game/launcher connects to the server before you even log in. If bans are handed out based on this, the bans are everything else than appropriate.

&gt;**Todd:** We have banned many folks. Never once has one admitted, “I’m guilty”.

This is simply not correct. There have been threads here on the Smite reddit where users admit their own mistakes and warn others not to make the same mistakes.

Could be anything from motor oil, cooking grease, detergent, you name it, if it has a strong distinct smell that could potentially throw off a canine they try it. 

Good practice of course is to cut layer by layer slowly with a straight razor and / or scalpal so as to not conatminate the product, but they WILL sell it either way as they are still paying for it.

I know it has happened to me before (cut too deep and the shit leaked through, I believe it was power steering or something like that, it was a thick red liquid). But as the shit is so compressed it only really affected the very top layer and after scraping it off it wasn't so bad. ","1388534876"

You have framed your  question as an attempt to vmdicate a wrongly convicted man, but that is his job. Not yours. Your post reads like  revenge against her rather than exoneration of him.

Also. power armor does have sensory enhancement systems(autosenses), which complement the enhanced senses a Space Marine already possesses.  Also, don't forget the Black Carapace. A Space Marine is directly linked to his armor; it may as well be a second skin. He's not encumbered by his armor in any way. 

Melee weapons can be extremely effective against opponents focused on ranged weaponry, who generally don't like getting into close quarters. They aren't prepared for it, something the Terrans should know well from fighting the Zerg. A soldier just needs to get close enough to engage in melee, and most marines who specialize in melee weaponry have a way to get into close quarters combat without getting shot too much, like a jump pack.
Course, most Marines don't carry specialized melee weapons, but they're still prepared for melee combat.","1388534882"

"gaybroscirclejerk","t5_2v4ei","Edit: offjerk

Sub called SRS. Acronym for shit reddit says. It's one of the worst sub reddits out there. Started to take down dangerous subs. Stuff with child porn etc. And they succeeded. So, good on them for that. But they've since just become nothing but trolls obsessed or addicted to literary feminist criticism. They can't and won't take a joke, rely on sarcasm, and are known doxxers. They link to any comment they find even remotely offensive and bicker endlessly. The ass hat who must not be named behaves a lot like them, only he's a little less intelligent.

A few SRSrs are very well read, and when you approach a subject openly which they aren't already trolling, they'll be far more open minded and well spoken than they are otherwise. They'll concede points and offer relevant counterpoints. This guy though... He's an undergrad gender studies addict, who doesn't read or comprehend what's said to him, but attempts to sling back intellectually. It's actually embarrassing to watch. And he's pretty hostile on top of it. It's only a matter of time before he fucks up and doxx's somebody (it's come close before) or gets banned for linking his blog all over the place.

It's best just not to engage him. I don't think he's trolling, I just think he's oblivious. If people listen to his stream of shit, it's their problem. /r/gaybros is changing, and if it becomes one giant argument about effeminate v masculine men, it'll just become a warring circle jerk, where the smart guys abandon it and make a new sub.

If you wanna see a lazy company that treats their product as a cash cow, puts zero work on it and does nothing about the game's problems, look at Valve. I've come to a point in life where I'm too busy to play videogames and I'm not really interested in coming back to LoL (or DOTA), but I've taken back all I said about Riot at the time, every time I checked back on the game and played a while. It really is a serious company doing a reasonable job in keeping their game alive and LoL has only improved in the years since Beta while most game development giants only ruined their franchises.

In Valve's case, a franchise that had potential to be the best game worldwide, ever by a MILE. Riot put actual elbow grease on their idea, and they deserve their success because of that. At this point I wish Riot had taken the rights for DOTA and developed that game as a side project. It would have been so good and I probably would have never abandoned the game I loved.

I feel dubious about this because returning to kerbin is pretty expensive in delta v terms I'm not sure it would be lowest delta v per science to return everything to kerbin every single time. Even a single extra  launch consumes 7,000+ by itself. Which is enough to go to/from a MPL in orbit countless times. 7000 would be enough to complete most the tree with a carefully placed MPL and reuseable probes.

To do so is to trifle it.  Or selling it.  Or buying it.   There are a lot of ways to trifle it.  Or to trifle oneself.  Or from my quote:  ""(thinking) practices of long duration, chanting six times a day,  or wide learning is the Dharma"" all these (I skipped the sitting part just here),  all these are trifling.   About the only thing left to do is just notice what is going on and not fall for signs and wonders, not want to be a teacher,  not want fame,  not try to appear to be more than what you are, etc.

But thanks for the posting.   Not trifling at all.  The crazy looking blue eyed bearded guy,  ok by me.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","i am a housecleaner. i would suggest starting with one or two rooms of your house first, then rotating the other rooms. have her deep clean your most used bathroom and kitchen, and just vaccuum/ dust the other rooms. this keeps her from being overwhelmed. 
the first time she comes, give her a tour of the house and where to find everything. keep all your kitchen supplies in the kitchen, and all bathrooms supplies in the bathroom for ease of finding them. while she cleans say the kitchen, you can tidy up the baby stuff or laundry so she  wont have to. 
mostly, just tell her exactly what you want done. if she charges $25/hour, im betting shes not expecting a tip every time, and you dont have to tip if you dont want. maybe an extra $5 or 10 every few cleans, or if she goes above and beyond her normal cleaning. hope this helps! ","1388534905"

The underlying purpose of all business/economy is to earn money; to maximize profit and minimize costs.  Wages are set at whatever point provides the most value per dollar.

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","I am about to graduate with a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering and starting to apply for jobs.

Unfortunately, to my experience so far, the more you focus on the fundamentals of your own major, the less attractive your resume will seem to those of other fields. In fact even within your field, if you have focused on a very specific subfield, there is a chance you will not seem as much of a priority as others (on the other hand that will strongly increase your chance of getting a job in that subfield). For example, as a Mechanical Engineer, if your curriculum centered on thermodynamics, and you have 1 or 2 internships in the HVAC industry, you will have a very strong chance of getting a job in that industry. However your chances of getting an electrical circuit design job will be minimal. Remember, engineering is a huge field

To increase your chances, I strongly recommend taking a inter-disciplinary combination when selecting your academia if you want to ""spread your range"". For example take Control Systems Engineering classes with both Mechanical and Electrical perspectives, do a minor in one or the other. Otherwise choose your industry very carefully","1388534909"

[Diacetylmorphine versus Methadone for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810635#t=articleResults)

The heroin group had a higher chance of staying within an addition program and enganged in fewer illegal activities and illegal drug use.  The downside, though, was a higher risk of adverse events associated with heroin (especially overdoses).  With these kinds of results, I think they would have to demonstrate a difference in other outcomes like infections (HIV, HCV, endocarditis) for it to really catch on.","1388534919"

Publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch became a U.S. citizen in September 1985, during a 15-minute ceremony with about 200 other immigrants in New York. 

Murdoch took the oath out of necessity. He wanted to become a force in U.S. broadcasting, and U.S. law and the Federal Communications Commission does not permit foreigners to hold major stakes in U.S. networks. 

Asked why he became an American citizen, Murdoch’s response was typically gruff: “Because I wanted to.”

Her clinic is entirely independent and she does her own billing and everything. (But yes, she takes insurance / is a preferred-provider for providence and other plans, but she also has low-income/non-insured options.)  

So far I really like her - especially because she's very responsive over email. I emailed her via her web form the first time I contacted her and she emailed me back fairly quickly. She phoned me to chat before our first appointment, (I really hate making phone calls, but don't mind receiving them once in a while.) Other than that, we've emailed to schedule appointments, and after appointments, she always sends me an email outlining things that we discussed.

edit: she also keeps decent hours for working people. I believe she'll make appointments as late as 6pm some days. And she gives out prizes for biking to appointments. So far, I've gotten some handmade soap, and some local chocolates.

Multiple GSTLs and TLs have specified that they want the items to be rung up individually as certain items look very similar, but have very different pricing.  E.g. Canned veggies, Creamed corn may be $0.69 a can, but peas are $1.19 a can - so the store would be losing $0.50 a can if you just assume all are Creamed corn vs other products.  This also makes it harder to keep track of store inventory as you would have scanned in X cans of creamed corn vs Y cans that you actually sold.  Leading to incorrect inventory of both products.

That's why I've been told not to use the quantity option and go with scanning each item.","1388534922"

* 60% Legg Mason S&amp;P 500 Fund (ER 0.66%)

* 30% Alliance Bern Intl Value Fund (ER 1.45%)

Since you have a fairly poor selection of funds to choose from, I'd highly recommend opening an IRA and getting your international exposure there.  An international stock fund such as Vanguard's Total International Index has an expense ratio approximately 1/7th that of your only international stock fund. 

Contrary to what certain uninformed users might think, making a conscious effort to reduce expenses is the second most important thing when investing for the long term (second only to selecting your asset allocation).  Here's [a nice interactive page](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost) showing the effect of expenses on your investments over time.  The single best indicator of superior long-term performance is a low expense ratio.  It's unfortunate that there's so much misinformation floating around out there to the contrary.","1388534922"

Overall spending isn't important in terms of why those countries have a different distribution of the tax burden, I don't understand where you are trying to go with that.

Near 100% of those countries healthcare is via the government (~100&gt;45-50) and if you want to talk about healthcare policy that's a separate issue. All of those other nations use either single payer or socialized medicine which is more efficient would you prefer we do that?

The nations that don't have minimum wages have collective bargaining agreements that have to be followed within industry sectors, aka they use forced unionization rather than minimum wage laws. I'm willing to bet you don't like that.

The only way your suggestion could possibly work is if authors and publishers decided they were OK with selling their material for less.  Good luck getting them to decide that. 

The other alternative I guess would be to recruit new authors and start a new line of books.  Good luck finding an institution that would even consider that for a second.  The books themselves are good, generally, and written by the true authorities on the variety of subjects.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","If all of that's so obvious, how come you're be first person to say any of that?

See, that's what's funny about the whole thing: people keep insisting that there are these ultra obvious points I'm missing, but when called on to actually articulate the points, they're all saying different things! That happened on the testable prediction issue, on what "" shitty currency means"", on whether it's plausible or even coherent to argue that ""Bitcoin will deflate so much it's worthless!"", and so on. 

So instead of trying to maintain this facade of irrefutability, maybe you could spend *half* as much time articulating these supposedly obvious points. You might even learn something about possible gaps in the standard case, like /u/besttrousers did when I pointed out that his standard for a good currency [implies that an ideal one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1twd42/krugman_bitcoin_is_evil/cecnw1c?context=3) would have sustainable hyperinflation. 

(If he didn't have the intellectual courage to answer my questions, he could have just continued indefinitely, insisting that ""it's all settled, it's all obvious, you just need to read a book"", much as you do.)

And if you try hard enough, one day you'll be able to put the case against deflation into your own words! Won't that be fun! For once, a conversation -- sorry, lecture -- not going in a circle!

Btw, what's an observable implication for Bitcoin of a claim like ""deflation is bad"" -- just for old times' sake?","1388534927"

When [their] sense of entitlement is aggrieved, they don’t just get mad, they get even.” At its root, the men’s rights movement is driven by the same logic of abuse.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The classic case study is apprenticeships. In IT it's almost impossible to land a professional job without qualifications. It's hard in itself to land an IT job with all the required qualifications and some experience. 

If you have absolutely no qualifications or experience, are so young that you can't function properly as a professional and can't make it unto university the industry couldn't give a shit about you. It's not paying you $100k a year to fuck about and learn IT on the job. However if you're willing to be paid significantly less, study while you work and improve your skills while you work the industry is inclined to employ you. We hire apprentices at $30k - $45k depending on age and they are stuck at that wage for 4 years. It's not enough to live on in this city, but the alternative is they never enter IT and work on a part time basis at the local supermarket. It ends up working out great for the organisation as the presence of low paid workers enables more experienced personnel to be freed up from mundane tasks. If not for the lower pay though, the organisation would rather hire a 30 year old with a degree and 5+ years experience. They'd never hire an uneducated 18 year old.","1388534933"

I've seen women who up to months and years after giving birth still feel the need to talk about it. I'm just like, GET OVER IT ALREADY! I don't feel the need to hear how you crapped out your kid for the 100th time.

And many tend to have a bajillion kids. Usually the more christian ones. They don't believe that birth is dangerous because Jesus will make it safe. And they have no understanding of evolution (or just don't believe it) The hippy ones are just NATURE!

They also treat birth like a spiritual experience and they have weird art work of it and post pictures of themselves naked while giving birth or breastfeeding. Sometimes it is of them standing naked holding their naked child. I wonder if they are naive to the creepier parts of the internet.","1388534934"

I understand his reasoning, but if we all fell into that idea, jailbreaking and theming never would have started in the first place in essence. I mean isn't the big draw to jailbreaking that we, in someway or another disagreed with the visual or technical opinions of the apple overlords? Concepts started and eventually people turned it into a reality. I think it's aspiring and productive to do concepts, and I lose a little respect that Saurik said that we don't need them, despite his criticism being apt. He should have just left it at the criticism so OP, who handled it like a champ but a little weak for rebutle, could have improved his idea. 

It's all in my option of course, but the reddit jailbreaking community should have started collaborating ideas instead of just only praising. Praising is good of course too, along with criticism. ","1388534935"

&gt; Muhammad once met a man who was a christian that told Muhammad that he was a profit according to the bible and that is what essential started the idea of Islam. Muhammad was raised with the knowledge of many different religions.

If you're going to prance around like you know islam, you could at least not bullshit the muslim side of things. You're acting like some enlightened piece of shit that knows better than everyone. You're not. Nothing you said is particularly special, and I could probably google an almost word for word thing and find it on /r/atheism. You could do yourself a favor and not spout other people's shit, and try thinking for yourself.

Easy google: 

&gt;“Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah.”

&gt;[Al-Qur'an 5:3]

If you're going to give me the whole ""islam is just muhamad adding to christianity, feel free to explain to me why the koran mentions how conception works hundreds of years before scientists did.

The only humiliation I can recall was the ""pledge grenade,"" which was just a ping pong ball a brother would throw at a party and the pledges would have to rush and jump on it. I thought it was funny too. To be honest, I had more fun as a pledge than I did as a brother. Too many guys in my chapter didn't learn the right lessons when they were pledging and figured that anything resembling work or responsibility that makes a chapter run should be delegated to pledges. It was like pulling teeth to get brothers to do simple things like show up to committee meetings, most were in it just to drink and party, which was disappointing. I withdrew after two semesters but apparently they are doing alot better now after they started dropping guys who let their grades slide during the pledge process.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Keep in mind when he took over the building process we had several players at the end of their lifecycles as players. That culminated in the 2009 season, followed by the 2010 disaster. 2011 was essentially the point where we started over. We have the talent to be competitive with the right coach. Coaching decisions cost us, what 5 games, in the waning moments of games this year when we had leads.

&gt; 4 or 5 glaring holes in our roster is not what I would call phenomenal.

Of course its not, but look where we were three years ago. We had huge glaring holes at safety, LT, both guards, corner, depth on both lines, qb and wr. A couple of players didn't develop the way they should have (Brinkley, Cook) or disappeared for various reasons (A. Allen, Ballard) and it sets things back a bit. In the process of getting those pieces in place players like Williams, Greenway, and Allen have come to the end of their career arcs here, and will subsequently need to be replaced. That's the nature of the business. People are skewed by the 2009 and 2012 seasons to where we were as a team. 

The problem with building teams the way we use to (buying free agents left and right rather than developing our own players) is that when you try and do things the right way, you're screwed because everyone is at the tail end of their prime. By the time you get a few pieces in place, you have glaring holes elsewhere. Had we drafted better in the early 00's we'd be letting those players go and filling those voids, rather than bandaging things with late round picks now. 

**TLDR** give it another year, and you'll see at least a 500 record consistently.","1388534948"

I've taken 1 first class flight in my life.  My dad traveled for a living, and was super platinum-gold-meteor status with an airline.  The two of us were about to head back to the west coast from Florida.  He gets a call the night before saying he's been bumped up for free.  I'm 18.  Part of me thinks he's an ass for leaving me back there for a 6+hr flight to our connection- the other part of me is *somewhat* understanding that he's 6', 200lbs.
We have a long mechanical delay, and half the plane leaves to try and catch another flight out.  So now he's all alone in 1st class, and I'm in coach with a dozen people or so.  My dad at this point asks the flight attendants very nicely if there is any way I could accompany him up in first class.  They said no problem.  Very nice of them.

Probably not. I imagine that the bard's fans outnumber those of Twilight (probably by an order of magnitude or more) but they're less vocal and enthusiastic since there hasn't been any new material in a long time. I think you should give Shakespeare a shot; it's not something that people can only enjoy at a purely academic level. Try going to a play. It's a lot of fun.","1388534953"

It would shock you how many wives out there are, honest to goodness, ungrateful, disrespectful bitches. Where dad works hard all day supporting the family, then spends all night getting bitched out by his ungrateful wife while he cooks a dinner she complains about, gets lambasted about not having enough time to get to folding the laundry last night while he's washing the dishes and how unfair it is that she had to do it because he's such a loser who doesn't care about her or the family, and gets chewed out hourly about how all of her friends' husbands make more money than he does while working fewer hours, so they're home all the time taking care of their kids so their wives don't have to, and how hard she has it because she married such a chump.

Poor Dad becomes a battered shell of a man who maybe used to stick up for himself, but today just says whatever he needs to end the conversation and get to bed so he can do it all over tomorrow, because there's no way to win, no end to her unhappiness, and because if he pisses her off too much, she'll divorce him. So he says ""yes dear"" and goes through the motions. After a few years of marriage, he's become the loser his wife always said he was.

My picture above is a bit of an exaggerated, sit-com version of reality, but that story is *generally* true for an enormous number of marriages. Sexless marriages, of course. At least for the husband.","1388534954"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","What is with these remittance fees alone? 

http://www.economist.com/node/12537629

Just for starters, it doesn't matter what happens to the price of bitcoin if you go local fiat -&gt; bitcoin (send) bitcoin -&gt; back to remote fiat.   You're in and out in a few minutes. The price of bitcoin might go up or down 1% in that timeframe. In the meantime, you're not waiting days on a transfer that may or may not happen and could cost you 9% (depends on the countries). And that's just as a way to transmit value!

If you want to hold bitcoins like a commodity, like gold, yeah the price is soooooo volatile. But as the exchanges and the traders in bitcoin get better it has a chance of smoothing out. The stronger hands and those more experienced with forex will probably do a lot better at speculating on bitcoin value.

For sellers, lower costs than credit cards and no need to deal in cash, and for buyers easier more pseudonymous purchases. Challenges remain regarding wallet security on all kinds of platforms. And challenges getting to and from the older fiat system to bitcoin. But Coinbase, Bitpay, they help in USA, other countries will have their own ways forward.

If people want to, they can use the blockchain for far out ideas like colored coins, anonymous messages and all kinds of things still to be imagined. (These uses wouldn't necessarily increase the commodity value of bitcoins)

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_metabolism. It is not the chemical itself that is always toxic, but what it turns into as the body breaks it down.

Methanol metabolizes to Formic acid that damages the optic nerves causing its well known effect of blindness.


Isopropyl alcohol metabolizes to Acetone, that is toxic to the central nervous system.

Butanol metabolizes to carbon dioxide so it is less toxic, pretty safe compared to other short chain alcohols.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Another factor that comes into a more advanced analysis, and addresses OP's point directly is the question of how hard an employee will be to replace.

If you have adegree in some relatively nuanced field and/or a good deal of experience in that field, it will be very hard to find another employee who brings to the company what you can. The company will pay you accordingly, it might take them months to find or train an adequate replacement so they give you a good deal of money and benefits so you don't feel an impetus to leave.

If you work for Walmart, there is effectively no challenge in finding someone who can do your job as well as you do. That is the reason why minimum wage jobs are designed to be as mindless and menial as possible. The idea isn't for you to be thinking and managing, it is for you to show up and do the same rote routine over and over so that they can ask any random person off the street to do it when you quit. They can employee just about anyone they want so they don't really care if you leave.

Mostly, these programs are unpopular not because of how many people are on them, or how much money is spent on them, but because the people who oppose them think that the recipients are nothing but a bunch of lazy bums. Are there people who match that description? Certainly. And there are people who abuse the system, without question.

If you can get a male line you can look at Y-STR testing to get some some easier ways to rule out other male lineages. (Id say use FTDNA for that)

Autosomal testing then is the other option then. 

http://www.isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_testing_comparison_chart

I personally am hesitant to recommend 23andme right now as they have just changed chips they use from v3 to v4, and I do not believe that gedmatch (or ftdna with there autosomal transfer) currently accept the new chip for transfer into their databases.

My other criticism for using 23andme for genealogy on its own, is so many people don't respond to messages there as they don't care about genealogy, only the old health data.

As FTDNA stores your dna sample for 25 years, you can always upgrade testing there later down the track.

Myself, i have autosomal tests that i took at 23andme on the v3 chip transferred into ftdna's database and gedmatch.

I also have a y-str test in process at ftdna.

Overall, if you can get the raw data you can use other services that tend to overcome the shortcomings of the parent system.","1388534977"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I think you may have misunderstood what a celebrity case means. Celebrity just means it's a high profile case, and not necessarily involving a celebrity. The distinction I was making was that celebrity cases will always have the choice for Due Process. Your two examples actually coincide with the point I was making about the celebrity cases. The point to take from my initial statements was that the rich and privileged will always get the Due Process system, and this causes bias within our system. 

I don't feel like doing the research right now, but as to my statement about the court capacity look at the number of correctional facilities that have been built in the last 20-30 years and look at the growth in law enforcement and alike agencies. Now look at the number of district courts and federal courts. I guarantee you will see a trend where two of the three have grown yet one of the three has not grown. Strides have been made to date to help this, one being allocating more discretion towards the Prosecutors, technology as you have mentioned, the growth of alternative courts (more recently), and intermediate sentencing. 

If you're not aware of the mandatory minimum laws I suggest you sweep a quick google search. The Rockefeller drug laws of 1973 and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 both carried mere possession mandatory minimums, and while Rockefeller drug laws were done away with something in the mid 2000's the Anti-Drug Abuse Act statues were only mitigated to lessen a sentencing disparity. 

As or the recent changes to the California Three Strike laws that doesn't make up for the decades of people serving life sentencing for non-violent crimes such as drugs. I'm typing this on the go so I don't have much data in front of me, but for the sake of argument I'm pointing this out. I'll be able to add more significance to my posting after the New Years.  

As for your last paragraph I suggest watching the Frontline documentary snitch. Prosecutorial discretion allows for faster processing of cases but it takes away the discretion from the judge and jury. This is a dangerous thing as the interest of the state relies on the Prosecution. That's not fair and impartial. Prosecutors, especially at a federal level, care about their prosecution rate and therefore go after the low hanging fruit. I believe during the Bush Administration the prosecution rate for a prosecutor had to be 98.5% or something crazy just to retain their job. So they prosecute anyone on a whim of evidence even if it's circumstantial. 

This goes back to my initial statements about due process and the crime control model. If someone tacks on a conspiracy charge to a well-off person that can fight back it's going to fail, but if it's tacked onto a person from low socioeconomic brackets they will have to rely on inadequate provided counsel who are already overworked and underpaid. They will be less likely to be ROR'd and can't make bail so they will have to spend the time before their trial in jail. This means they can't provide an adequate defense for themselves and are more likely to be convicted than someone who is ROR'd. Innocent people plead guilty all the time, and there is plenty of literature written on this subject. For someone who has to rely on going to work everyday to be locked up because they can't make bail and they have a family to feed or a life to live they will do anything they can to get out especially if all that is being waived in front of them is probation. 

This is just information off of the top of my head, I'd like to continue this conversation though. I'll have more data after the tonight as I'm heading to a party. If you want, I wrote an Undergraduate paper on Mandatory Minimums if you'd like to read it. Shoot me a Private Message or something with an email and I'll send it over. It touches base on a bunch of these topics we're talking about. I can also suggest a few good books on the subject that are worth their read. ","1388534979"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","The problem withintroducing your own rules, especially if you don't know the base system, is often a bad idea as the rules you introduce often have a loophole you didn't forsee or are horribly inbalanced when brought out of the context you introduced them for. 

Thus, I advice you to try and only use the DnD rules and stick to them until you feel you know the system well enough to safely introduce your own rules (I've been playing DnD3.5 for over two years and still refrain from doing it as it can horribly mess with things). Sure, it's quite a bit to take in but as long as you know the basics and know roughly where to find things, then looking things up during the session is perfectly ok! I assume your players are also new to DnD so they will also be kind of slow at first as they will have to remind themselves of things like this, concerning their characters, as well. 

In this case the first couple of sessions will be slow with a lot of looking through books but as long as you can get past that part I'm sure you will have a blast with DnD! Just make sure to be patient and let people take the time they need and hope they are as patient with you. Good luck!","1388534984"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Libreoffice is *perfectly fine* for home users. There is nothing a home user would ever need that Libreoffice cannot do. And same goes for business. I work with many small businesses that have deployed Libre/Openoffice to great succeess. Libreoffice is, for the most part, a 1-to-1 replacement for MS Office. Does it have something that is specific to Microsoft's implementation? Probably not. But can it do rich word processing? Yes. Complex spreadsheets? Yes. Beautiful presentations? Yes. 

Talking about driver issues are a hold over from a long ago time. That discussion isn't even relevant anymore. On pretty much all the main-line distros, drivers are not something you even need to think about. I have a Samsung Ultrabook that was made for Windows 8. It has the Windows 8 certification logo on it. Every single piece of hardware, hardware function keys, etc. worked *out of the box* with no additional configuration under every Linux distro I've thrown at it, and even a few BSDs. 

Home users don't need Photoshop. Period. If they *do* need it, it's because they use it as a profession, and sometimes conduct their business at home. And if so, then Linux is not for them. Gimp does every single thing a home user needs: resize, crop, adjustments, etc. 

If a home user has an application that is critical to their lives that only runs on Windows, then they should stay with Windows. That is true for anyone. But if there is an alternative that meets their needs that is cross-platform (and in most cases, there is), then it's just a matter of learning a new piece of software. But the key is educating the user as to what an operating system is, what software is, and what it means for the two to be compatible. 

Also, Steam is on Linux now, with AAA games (Half Life 2, L4D2, Metro: Last Light, 0AD), and they are doubling down on Linux compatibility. Valve sees Linux as the future of gaming. It's only going to get better. But right now, it's where most average users would be perfectly happy. If you're a hardcore gamer with a 3x$500 GPU SLI and a sweet water-cooled rig that can run Crysis 2 at 100 FPS, then you should probably wait a few months. But the day you can switch to Linux is not far off. That, however, is not the average user. I can run Half Life 2 on both my laptop and desktop (both running Arch Linux), smooth as butter.

The key to really good cosplay is a character with a very distinct outfit or at least a fairly distinct outfit with distinct props. Which is exactly why SPN is kind of hard to cosplay, the Cas one at least was on the right track with the pjs and coat combo but most of the characters on the show do what they can to blend in so there is no exceptionally prominent aspects of what they wear or have other than a few very specific times in the show. Maybe to make it stand out a bit more you do a purgatory Dean, dirty, blood covered and holding his makeshift battle axe deal.

If you are married, you both have made a pretty concrete decision to spend the foreseeable future together, so yes I do think it is more concrete.

That said, I don't disagree that a shorter or equally long relationship outside of marriage can be just as strong or important.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I don't comment often, in fact I think I've only commented a couple times on anything. However I felt it necessary to reach out and say something. I too have bi-polar with Clinical depression and ADD... and it sucks. I get help from the VA with my meds (currently on Citalopram (Celexa), Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and Methylphenadate (Ritalin)) and the meds make all the difference. It WILL TAKE TIME for you to find a med schedule that works for you. But I would strongly recommend going back to the VA and see about getting help (you may also qualify for disability through the VA as your mental issues were exacerbated by your service - and I only say that as that's what I did). What turned the corner for me was a book. Now most people who talk about reading this book from having to do so for some college class, but I just picked it up and read it and got a lot out of it that very few professors highlight. The book was Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. Now before someone pidgin-holed me as an objectivist I want to say WHAT I got from that book. It is based on a single premise... Contradictions DO NOT EXIST. If you are faced with a contradiction, check your premises as one of them is wrong. When I looked at the contradictions in my life I found that I could not be both mentally stable as well as not instilling fear in my children from talking with me, that I couldn't be both mentally stable and have the sort of work performance I was having.. But when I nixed the assumption that I was mentally stable, things made much more sense. PLEASE, examine your life and if you find contradictions, resolve them... as HardKnockRiffe has said, do SOMETHING... doing nothing, while is still making a choice, is not usually the best choice to make.","1388534997"

"Africa","t5_2qh1p","&gt;alot of those reforms you're talking about were first created by asians actually.

And then lost.  The massive growth of Asian countries in the past half-century is largely the result of their adopting Western-style reforms in education, government and large investments in infrastructure.  Japan, Korea and Taiwan are the most obvious examples, but the same in happening to a lesser degree in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.

&gt; just imagine if all the billions of dollars had been given to japan to develop it would of been even more technological.

Japan received billions of dollars in aid after WWII, as did most of Europe.  One interesting argument for why Japan and Germany boomed after the war was because the US essentially bought them all the newest, most advanced capital in the world because what they had was destroyed.  Which gave those countries a huge leg up because they had the best machines/financial infrastructure/education investments in the world.  Korea and Taiwan essentially did the same thing from the 1970s onward.

&gt;why hasn't afirca had stable infrastructure and government?

A huge part of it is geography.  Africa is really just supremely unlucky in this regard.  30% of its countries are landlocked, and being landlocked is basically the most surefire way to guarantee that you stay poor.  A country like Chad or Niger simply is never going to be a destination for investment because they're thousands of miles away from a port they could export from, and all those ports are in other countries.  Africa also has a hugely dispersed population (slightly more than a billion spread over an areas bigger than the US, China, India and Western Europe combined).  That kind of geographic/demographic situation just makes development insanely difficult.

Most important is good governance.  Corrupt politicians that embezzle aid money (which during much of the Cold War had little to do with development and everything to do with gaining loyalty of the country to either superpower) make investment nearly impossible.  No one would ever invest in a country that can just steal your money.  A couple years back, a Canadian company in Congo had all its investments (hundreds of millions of dollars) seized by a court on charges of corruption, then promptly handed over to that company's chief competitor, which had lost the bid for the contract, but not the bid for the judge.  No one would ever invest in that place again.

If Africa wants success, it needs to understand that good governance, the rule of law, relative security and relative lack of corruption are more important than anything.  People will readily invest in Africa if they can feel secure that their investments will be secure.  That's what the Asian economies did.  Singapore was a super poor dictatorship, but they promised Western investors that their money could be safely invested in Singapore.  Singapore thus because the financial capital of Southeast Asia because investors felt safe.  

Fortunately, much of Africa has realized this, and Africa's economy is booming accordingly.  It's average growth rate over the past decade is just as good if not better than India's.  Africa has problems, and plenty of them.  But I'm pretty optimistic.","1388535000"

"weightlifting","t5_2rlwc","It's cool, I've mangled control systems analogies before. I sometimes tell my trainees that the purpose of training is to teach the CNS new options. It will attempt to solve any movement problem you give it; the trick is to teach it the solution you want it to pick under pressure.

Different athletes react differently to different cues, but some cues work better than others. Some athletes can observe a movement and recreate it, others can't. But I find that most will react to cue based on feeling the weight. It requires them to perform no mental simulation *during* the movement.

This is important because it takes appreciable time to go around a human control loop. It takes hundreds of milliseconds for impulses to move up and down the body and to be processed by the brain. That's why so much of the sport is about drills, drills, drills. The deeper you ingrain the pattern, the less time it takes for the CNS to recognise the demand, select the pattern and recruit the muscles.

First you must learn the way. Then you must forget the way.

Stuff like this is why I say weightlifting is a perfect pas de deux of physics and physiology.","1388535003"

"gay","t5_2qhef","Well to say that I have a desire does not really mean it was God given. I certainly believe God created sex and the desire for it, but I don't think thats what he intended the object of that desire to be.

Today i was going 85mph on the interstate and there was a truck following literally about 4 feet off my bumper and swerving from side to side. I had the VERY strong desire to slam on my brakes and make him pay for the damage. This is a natural reaction, but one I must choose not to follow through with. 

This may be a very elementary example, but it is the same with a situation involving sex. I have had many opportunities to have sex with a girlfriend, and I have wanted it VERY badly, but I had to choose to abstain from that for a greater purpose (unlike the choice I made with my former boyfriend).

Living a life as a Christian does involve fighting natural desires on a daily basis with the goal of a greater good, and something more rewarding. God never said we should be able to do whatever we want so we can be ""happy."" Our lives are *supposed* to be about glorifying him, not simply living an easy happy life.
The good part is that following this philosophy does actually produce large long term rewards. And we believe whole heartedly that it will also provide us ETERNAL rewards.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","I think I last played BF3 2 weeks ago. Here's the current state of the online-

It's still going fairly strong, with about 10-15 inhabited servers in my region during the day. (I live in Australia) 

They're mostly base game servers, with a few of them supporting the DLC. There are plenty of players though, with lots of full 64 man servers. So there's quite a few people playing, but if you get premium and tried to do some of the DLC assignments you may have trouble finding the right servers. 

I'd say it's a definite buy- I've only owned the game since the Humble Origin Bundle (yes I'm one of those people) but in that time I've sunk 100+ hours in to the game and reached Colonel 8 rank. The gameplay is amazing, there are some amazing moments to be had, great teamwork scenarios and epic battles. The game feels polished- it's been out for 2 years and was originally buggy and messy (from what I've heard) but DICE has managed to iron out the bugs over its lifetime. There's plenty of variety and it will keep you entertained for hours on end. I recently got BF4 and have already sunk 30 hours in to it, and I'm already enjoying it just as much. 

So yes, you should buy! ","1388535008"

"AncientGreek","t5_2qwux","Actually I used words like ""think"" and ""doubt"" and there was no intention to be rigid. Your comment reminded me of this bit I now quote from the Catholic Encyclopaedia:
""The majority, however, took as models several authors, a custom which gave rise to a peculiar mosaic style, quite characteristic of the Byzantines. This was not always due to mere caprice, but often resulted from a real community of feeling, effectually preventing, however, any development of an individual style. For the continuity of historical style it would surely have been desirable for an historian of such great influence on posterity as Procopius to have chosen as his model Polybius rather than Thucydides. That such was not the case, however, is not the fault of the Byzantines but of the ""Atticists"" who had checked the natural course of the development."" 

So yes you could say the first point is a bit too broad. If the source is right, a Byzantine translator would probably use a mosaic of styles with  Thucydides as the major input. But then factor in the the naval-gazing Byzantine sensibility, which a few scholars began to shake off for a very brief time before the Turks arrived, and it becomes clear that any translation of Tacitus was highly unlikely, and a reliable good one virtually impossible. But who are we to argue such high falutin stuff? I'll happily leave the verdict to the professional scholars.","1388535012"

I don't think fast food should be a liveable wage, you should not strive to flip burgers and push buttons. Leave the baristas and fast food to people who are working towards higher goals.

The bigger issue is there isn't as much room for those with higher goals because robotics has eliminated alot of detailed manufacturing (cars) or illegals have taken positions at a lower wage without the need for unions (construction).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; To avert climate change means making a sacrifice in the short term to avoid a very bad outcome in the future. In all likelihood climate will be far past the tipping point before the threat is imminent enough to motivate people.

I'd just like to clear up a popular misconception here. Climate change has already happened. It will continue to happen more. There's no magic fix to go back to the way the world was (pre-industrial). 

What we *can* do is try to ameliorate future climate change, to make it less-bad. It's still going to suck, mostly for people in developing countries where regulation will be untenable (due to the demands of wealthier countries). If there is a tipping point (most climate scientists agree that there is a transition to a different stable-state ahead), we may already have [so much momentum](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903) that we WILL reach it (momentum that [started during the industrial revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Evidence_CO2.jpg)). 

tl;dr: **We're probably stuck with both the present and future damage that is ALREADY going to take place (due to present and past climate damage). But we should be doing all we can not to make the problem any WORSE than it already IS.**

You probably knew this already, and it's probably what you meant with your comment. I'm not saying you got anything wrong. I just wrote this to clarify the situation for other people in this thread. ","1388535013"

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt;These type of third wavers simply put have Penis envy. They presume that if there is a male dominant occupation that it is because the occupation etc. hate women. Hardly true, but hey.

Gotta love them tho, male dominated careers are just that male dominated because men love those jobs. It's not because of female hatred. Many places welcome women with open arms, one example is the tech industry where it's extremely welcoming for women and so is the gaming industry where women in my opinion should start moving towards.

&gt;What does cause ""hatred of women"" in certain professions is when these professional victims cry their way into these jobs and then don't pull their own weight.

Same thing can be said for quotas, quotas where women are giving a silver platter position actually harms companies and there's evidence to provide it. Forcing a company to hire a woman as a board member may weaken it if she has not a fucking clue what she's doing.

&gt;I have been through firefighter training (in Germany) and the weight of the kit alone can make you groan, add to that a smoke filled room, a breathing mask that requires some effort to inhale (not to mention the heat of the fire), limited visibility due to smoke and an 80kg Dummy you need to ""rescue"" and I have no problem believing that most women can't do it.

If you want to cringe here some vids from manwomanmyth:

Women in firefighting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERwzqvs7vvU

Female soldiers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSb-ok65KGI

and female police: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQUYME_bYuI

When it comes to women in sports mind you, they play fewer rounds but make double the amount of money (3 sets for women vs 5 sets for men) They are making their way into UFC as well where a event focused more on the lesser women's fights than the major male fights.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","Jcoles albums was pretty bland and forgettable. Since FNL he has been downhill. Born sinner was just not that great imo, Cole World was much better. The best song on Cole world next to Let Nas Down was an interlude.. so that sums up that album.

I haven't listened to pusha T's album yet

Em's album is just.. idk kind falls into the same category as cole to me. It just seems so forgettable.

I dont listen to Yeezus for the lyrics, I listen to it for the production-- The samples and the way sounds are compiled together and then instantly dissolved to nothing and completely switched around is what I enjoy about it. The production pulls you around by the seat of your pants the whole way through.

Theres also something admirable about bringing such a unfamiliar style to a mainstream stage aswell.  Its a risk to bring such an experimental style to his album and it paid off well for him because whether or not you love kanye, you are talking about the album. Everyone and their dog knows about yeezus because of how polarizing it is.  

I wasnt a fan of Acid Rap, but I think if chance had released acid rap as an album rather than a mixtape he would have benefit much more, due to what I said above.. its taking a risk to release such an experimental style in the form of an album, especially a debut album.  Thats why I think chance will have a hard time wowing his audience with his debut, unless he switches up his style again into something new than it will just always be considered worse than acid rap.  That last part about chance/acid rap was kinda offtopic but w/e","1388535024"

Don't take a dozen of shots and act like it's not your fault. Especially if you are an adult. When do most kids get really drunk the first time?! 14? 15-16? By 20 they should know how their body reacts to alcohol and that alcohol is a serious drug. There are so many stupid people who do shit like that. Drinking a dozen shots plus a fifth of vodka and landing in ER. Seriously? That's what we pay taxes for? Because some idiot couldn't contain themselves? Like the idiots who snort a line of coke and go down the shitter.  I'm all for legalizing stuff but I really think that people should pay for their own stupid decisions. A buddy of mine was rushed to the hospital after drinking a ton of alcohol. The week after he got out? Catched him drinking ten shots at the bar again. That dude was vomiting blood.

They could do a couple of double spend and rollback attempts, and what they will accomplish is, 1) destroy themselves in a couple of hours, 2) adoption of already existing technologies for better allocation of mining power.

For instance, powerful miners should be checking what they are working on (e.g. using getblocktemplate). It removes the threat altogether and doesn't affect profitability (e.g. like p2pool). The attack you are describing would result in everyone adopting such solutions.

&gt; How is this different than banks colluding on LIBOR rates?

I don't understand how the LIBOR analogy works in your mind. How are mining pools similar to banks? It's more like interbank networks deciding to screw up people's transfers. There will be minor damage, some loss of trust, and that's about it.

&gt; if you haven't been paying attention, millions of bitcoins have simply ""vanished"" due to hacking

Stolen money is not analogous to counterfeiting. I will not argue that theft is not a problem, or irreversible pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin doesn't make it more advantageous, but your argument is out of place.

Risks involved with Bitcoin based investments are different than more conventional vehicles. If someone is not aware of the risks involved, they should be made aware, like any investment out there. Such warnings about Bitcoin are abundant.

There are also some protections Bitcoin makes possible that you can't get with anything else. Check out how NEOBEE deals with deposits, and compare it with the current system in the context of Cyprus. Vague generalizations fail to do justice for either side of the debate.

&gt; I guess you weren't paying attention as to how many millions of Bitcoins were mined by the first early adopters.

As long as it is given, how does this relate to the original problem? Some people are richer than the others already. Surely, rich people have more influence on the economy, but the incentives you are comparing are not similar at all.

&gt; Don't kid yourself, right now Bitcoin is a speculative tool for the vast majority ... ""to the moon"" etc ...

You are probably right. Yet, what part of this speculation is a bet on the currency's future utility, and how much of it is pure pump and dump? It's hard to tell. As long as pump and dump is not able to kill it, I see it as an unfortunate obstacle. Time will tell I suppose.

&gt; If the creators of any bitcoin website go out of business &lt;snip&gt; there is NO COMEBACK WHATSOEVER.

Depends on what website you are talking about. Surely blockchain.info going out of business would not affect many people. Probably not true for Coinbase.

&gt; If &lt;snip&gt; indeed the blockchain itself is compromised, there is NO COMEBACK WHATSOEVER.

This is also a given.

&gt; Clearly the idiot who wrote this piece either is deluding themselves that Bitcoin is anything other than a vehicle for speculation, or doesn't understand Pyramid Schemes.

There we go... I think you are reading too much Reddit. Give it a break and involve yourself with some of the tens of different projects that is going on in this area. There are hundreds of people involved in the development of this technology and infrastructure. It's not only speculators, not by a long, long shot.

&gt; I expect to be downvoted by the ""zealots""

You might get downvoted, but that's to be expected when you are so eager to jump to conclusions. Also, I don't downvote criticisms, but this is Reddit. Just take comment scores with a grain of salt.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be ""fair"", I believe everyone deserves a wage that they could live on as a middle class citizen. On the flip side though, you can't just increase people's wages because they ""deserve it"". I think much of what /u/Scott-H-Young said is a good simplification of the reason this wouldn't work.

There's more to consider too. I've often pondered that if the richest half of people out there had half the money, the rest of us would essentially have double. To a certain degree, I think this is true and needs to happen. The rich need to make a little less, the rest of us a little more but there's a limit to this. Imagine now that the richest person only makes 5x what you do and money is more spread out. Would you be able to buy everything you wanted and live in your favorite neighborhood? Probably not. If wages started to level out too much then prices of goods would also rise (imagine now you have to pay more for all the labor that goes into making something). Competition would suffocate and your options in the world would dwindle and I think naturally wages and market prices would eventually diverge again.

I do think, however, that there is a balance that could be achieved where the ""poor"" still live decent lives, and the rich can enjoy the extravagant lives they crave and sometimes deserve. Still, I think the rich need to be significantly richer than the poor, perhaps something like up to 50x or more so that there's a healthy consumer economy and adequate competition; both in the work field for people to want to move up and for entrepreneurs to want to create new products and services.","1388535035"

I was standing next to Alex and focusing entirely on the crowd when bunch of small kids walked and I knew this was the best shot at big reactions.

The problem is what makes labor 'socially necessary?' Its because people want the end result of the labor. You ultimately know a worker is providing value because someone wants what they are making.

So there is no inherent value to labor. There are things that people want and are willing to trade for. Labor is just one of those things that can be traded for, there is no reason to treat it differently than any other good. 

Profit is not derived from labor any more than it is derived from capital, it is derived from diverting resources (labor and capital) towards the production of something that people want. If people want this thing so much that they are willing to trade the seller more than what it costed the manufacturer to produce the item, and more than the manufacturer could have made producing other items then there is profit.

But this story is pretty confusing to me. You DID say she invited you to come out with her friends, and you said no because you had to take care of a dog. If you were planning on going out with her anyways, why did you turn that invitation down? Why couldn't all of you guys go out together like you had arranged earlier?

I see you said elsewhere that her sister already decided she wouldn't be coming out anymore, but why is that? Did your girlfriend not only change plans, but tell her sister she couldn't come?

If you're really mad at her for good reason (which honestly I can't figure out exactly what happened so I can't say how bad it is), then just forget her and party with your brother. Then have a serious talk with your gf later about either being more conscientious and responsible, or just break up if you want to.","1388535041"

&gt; When Ruth Martin is discharged from her teaching position because her sister is married to a notorious criminal (who is basically running the city), she accepts a job at a girls correctional facility. Her intent is to try and prepare the inmates for a better life once they are released. Ruth runs up against the supervisor (who is controlled by her brother-in-law) who is only interested in skimming money off the budget and his gang of matrons who only want to keep the girls in line doing laundry.

Both of these show destruction on both a chaotic and a very concentrated level, and I will be interested in seeing how he uses the attacks in the future. I fear that Red Hawk might be a dangerous technique to him because it lights his arms on fire. Red Hawk Gatling, if it exists, will be a very brutal attack.

It is also worth noting that Luffy is pretty much immune to most poisons after his journey into Impel Down. This is a major asset to him and protects him from the likes of Crocodile's hidden hook and Ceasar's poison gas. Zoan types that also rely on venom will have a hard time with our rubber man.","1388535048"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","That's a popular view for someone looking to get out of a relationship.. it justifies their need to find someone new for a variety of reasons, not merely the one listed. 

Sex is something that becomes vastly less important the older you get. If you base your long term decision on good sex relationships, you will fail. I've seen it happen time and time again.

In reality people overlook the other persons flaws if they like the sex,  but over time fucking the same person forever grows boring and all you have left is your mental compatibility. It's kind of important when you're young, and almost entirely meaningless as you get old.

From a younger persons perspective of course it will seem far more important than it will wind up being in the long run. Based on your post and you overly willingless to share, I suspect you are on the younger side of the spectrum. 

If you want relationship advice people. Don't take it from someone in their 20s or early 30s. A 4 year relationship sounds like forever when you 20, but it's nothing. 

People will convince themselves of many reasons why they are incompatible as rational to move on. They will use their friends to support their decisions. They will selectively remember flaws and selectively forget the positives. This is how long term relationships tend to work. 

If you have good sex young, that's great, but it will have very little to do with the long term stability of your relationship. What matters there is having similar interests and forming lasting memories and bonds because in the end almost nobody really wants to stay with the same person forever. 

After 20 years your concept of love will be so much more jaded than it was from that starry eyed first meeting. Deep down we all know this. The first couple years are always the best and we all grow tired of each others flaws over time. People will make all kinds of reasoning for why a relationship gets stale, bad sex, the person is selfish, they don't have a good enough job and more often than not it's an exaggeration of reality for the sake of support your own ego and avoiding any guilt associated with the loss of passion over time.

In all reality though there is nothing than can be done to stop the loss of passion because over the years the mystery and excitement of something new will always be lost.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; No, I asked for your proof that God is a made up story

I provided the links to show my thinking, did you read them? I don't need to prove that unicorns are invented, and leprechauns, and gods. You don't believe in Shiva, can you positively prove Shiva doesn't exist? But every Muslim asserts that in the Shahada. Negatives can't be proven and it's a rational approach to reject unproven assertions until they're proven. Again, burden of proof is with you. You claim the existence of a special being, I reject that claim until I'm convinced. It's your responsibility to convince me. .... Think of it this way, you claim (based on your faith) something extraordinary, I've heard many such claims, why would I have to disprove every improbable claim? Isn't it the responsibility of the person who claims to have seen a UFO to prove he's seen one? Or a mermaid, or a living dinosaur, or god. Each of these claims is very improbable, some more, some less, and I expect to be convinced. It's not the same as saying ""I have the latest iPhone at home"". That's believable, the only variable is ownership of it. With God or leprechauns it's a different story, what are they, where are they from, what's the deal, and a million questions, each needing an explanation that's not available. An iPad I can examine, a leprechaun I can't, nor can I examine God, just a book that claims divine authorship. But that's not provable (see my links). I asked a bunch of people about God's reason for making humans, I still have no answer, and I can't ask God. I have a challenge to a god-like being, but will it be answered? If not, is it because God doesn't want to or because he doesn't exist? Do you see how many things are in that one simple assertion? ..... think of this. Who made God? Nobody. How do you know? God told me. How do you know? God said it's him. How do you know it's really God? I believe. ....... So belief or knowledge? .... And that summarizes most of my conversations with religious people so far. And it doesn't strike me as credible. Am I wrong to reject such huge claims based on such weak evidence? I think so. Can you give be better evidence? If there is any I wish you did.

&gt; As for our senses, and other such things

I understand what you're saying, and temporarily I'll concede the point of evolutionary explanation for the recognition and seeking of purpose. But just because we don't have an explanation, yet, doesn't prove that some other explanation is true. I didn't devote any real amount of time to researching the matter of the evolution of this capacity, my bad (bad Martin), so I can't speak with any certainty so I'll shut up. But I'd like to make a few points, first, just because I don't have the answer (based on evolution) doesn't mean there isn't one. Just because I don't have the answer doesn't mean your assertion of being created by a God is more plausible. And it doesn't decrease your burden of evidence. All that means for me at the moment is that I'll need to go back and learn, which I will, as soon as I sober up after drinking a toast for the new year with my friend. I'll study it, I'll try to figure out how that makes sense, and I expect I'll get an answer sooner or later. But that's completely independent of your obligations to prove the very tenuous connection between this special capacity and the existence of a creator with an intention, a book and rules some of which don't make sense to me. I hope you understand what I mean. Did you hear the phrase ""god of the gaps"" ?

About evolution and stuff, I'll need to take some time when I'm more in possession of my mental focus to come up with a coherent reply. One of the points that I obliquely alluded to and would like to explain in some detail (but not now) is that the same kind of feeling you get from rotten food you also experience (fMRI) from moral situations. ... I'm glad you accept evolution as an explanation to life, which makes me wonder how you reconcile the belief in creation for a purpose with it. Obviously you didn't draw any distinctions between man (homo sapiens) and animals, which is at odds with the way people usually believe in creation (Christians are more vocal these days, but I've heard the same from Muslims). So I wonder how you reconcile it. And I did mean sexual infidelity. Since I don't subscribe to the premise of God. I would also like to hear your perspective on the multitudes of religions.

&gt; As to how the Qur'an convinced me...it is the perfect book. The teachings within it surpass any religious or philosophical book I have ever approached, and I have read my fair share. Furthermore, once you learn Arabic and read it, the eloquence and beauty of it comes out even more. It is absolutely amazing.

Well, doesn't sound like a logical process to me. Was there a point at which something logically convinced you? Something you can explain, like a logical argument, objective one (not based on the awe, or personal feelings about stuff). I'd like to learn.

And I'd like to hear more on what convinced you. Please expand. But don't be surprised or offended if I pick nits.

Thank you for the reply, I'll read it again later. I wish you a happy new year.","1388535052"

Living alone, working to pay the bills and eat leaves little left over for school bills or books, yes you can sometimes get aid and loans to help you out but your still looking at 20k ish in debt. Im working full time and am dieing to go back to school for a degree, but that 20k or so has me stuck. In canada u have 6 months to start paying back the loan when done school. 6 months seems like a long time, but when you think how hard it is now to eat now it makes it hard to take that leap of faith, knowing that within 6 months of finishing school and working full time, am i going to still have it in me to keep working, interview for better jobs and have my finances fliped over in time to start making payments on my loan in time? If i dont then there goes my credit. Sorry dont mean to jump on your post, but it just sounded to simple.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;What you've just said is that nobody can ever be institutionalised if they're religious. 

Im sayin nobody *should* be institutionalized for having a religious belief. We *all* believe things that are, on some level, untrue or based in faulty perception - it isnt until someone takes demonstrable action that they should be institutionalized. 

If we start locking people up for their beliefs, then it raises some other questions:

1. Who determines which beliefs are ""sane""?

2. Where does it stop? Do we then start locking people up for their political beliefs?

3. By locking people up for being religous, do we encourage rational thinking, or do we encourage people to just *get better* at hiding their thoughts?

&gt;If you intended that, then either you've presented an incomplete 
statement, or you've failed to explain why the religious get special treatment.

Satisfied? Admittedly, i could have gone into detail. I didnt think i had to in a world where people have suggested that atheists are mentally ill or should be locked up for not believing in god.

&gt;If you didn't mean that, you need to take more care with your words. ""Not for any reason whatsoever"" means just that, and is an extremely strong statement to make.

Not for any reason whatsoever should we imprison someone for what they think.","1388535056"

"psychotherapy","t5_2sodo","Best of luck to you in your search and recovery from depression!

As a fellow master's student (graduate in May), I can see how being someone 'behind the curtain' might make it seem difficult to get help.

Just remember that what we do isn't a litany of techniques based solely on theory. We are also guides and support others through our presence. Each individual in this world has a myopic, narrowed view; there is always something out there in the periphery that isn't immediately visible to us. Having a companion in the journey, equally skilled and equally imperfect, is beneficial because it rights us and reminds us of what's definite and what's simply assumed as certainty. Sometimes it takes a second pair of eyes to really survey the landscape and explore.

Also, as an aside, I invite you to live the depression. Just take a moment to be completely depressed without judgments or conclusions. Depression is like grief in that sometimes it bubbles up to the surface and simply has to be experienced, body and mind. You can bear it. Give depression some patience and compassion. And, when you become intimate with the depression and see it for what it is, that nagging part of the mind might get bored with it and move on to other toys, other possible expressions and emotive states. The active mind is always inflating and deflating, but you can clarify your position as the observer of all of this and therefore unbind yourself. You're okay just as you are in this moment; but don't take my word for it, inquire for yourself.

Of course, if you begin feeling suicidal etc, be open to any assistance. Get help! But, especially given your profession, moments of pain and suffering are windows of opportunity. It's like how, when giving someone directions to somewhere in town, it helps to have once been a little lost yourself.","1388535056"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a friend in college who had long, gross hair. He fell asleep on our couch one day, and we thought it would be funny to do that thing where you singe the tip of a few of someone's hairs and make it smell really bad. So, my roommate took a tiny amount of this guys hairs and pulled it out, and held a lighter up to it for just the briefest second to get that little ""singe"" going.

The problem is, apparently this guy used MASSIVE amounts of hair spray, so his hair caught on fire. We quickly put it out by hitting him with a couch pillow, which is what woke him up (his hair hadn't been on fire long enough to hurt him fortunately, but also means he didn't wake up).

So basically, instead of singeing the tips of a few of his hairs, we burned half is hair off in a weird, non-symmetrical patch. Also, he was initially just pissed that we hit him with the pillow while he was napping, and didn't seem to understand why we were freaking out. So despite our efforts to inform him and apologize, he didn't see his hair until going to the bathroom.

...the story doesn't end here.

We had airsoft guns in our house, and he was super pissed, so he grabbed one and shot it at me a bunch of times. I turned my back, but my roommate, who was already facing away, instinctively turned around to see what the commotion was, and got shot in the eye.

So myself and my friend who's hair we half burned off got to take my roommate to the ER. Fortunately, he didn't lose his vision, and my friend didn't have any burns, and I came out looking like the worst offender simply because I was the only one not hurt. 

That said, we all instantly grew up quite a bit after that.

This would take a ton of work to reverse, and it probably won't be worth it.  On the other hand, the thought of being with another person is probably so foreign to you that it would take just as much work to get into another healthy relationship.  You need to take the reigns in this situation and tell her what your needs are.  When she bucks or scoffs you need to stand strong and not back down from your requirements until she is willing to do some serious negotiations.  

I've seen this shit happen before, and if you remain in the same pattern with this girl it won't change.  It's time to flex your muscles a bit in the relationship and tell her that you have needs, too.

Let's use an example. As a Catholic I believe that at mass the bread and wine are transformed into the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. Of course it doesn't look or taste any different. But I *know* the Church teaches that the substance of the bread and wine change, not their physical properties, and that Jesus said it was his Body and Blood. 

So here are the facts. I know them and there are a lot of people who have died for believing this. There have numerous miracles revolving around this phenomenon. There must be some truth to it.

Well, you see moving your body is really good for you, 3-4 times a week at best with 1 hour or 2 of activity depending on intensity. 

Usually people say that's boring, but mind you what if you listened to a book while doing that? I am minding my audience here and think that redditors like reading books. Listening to audiobooks while commuting and doing physical activity is rewarding for your brain and fun too. 

I listened to many Terry Pratchett books and it was FUN to go to the gym. I was like, yeah finally getting to the gym to listen to what happens to Sam  Vimes next.

You seem to think the job should pay a livable wage based on how difficult it is (even though lots of worthless activities are difficult, and lots of valuable ones are easy) but then you want to determine how difficult their job is indirectly by whether or not the person doing the job is educated?

To be blunt, your idea isn't that much worse than lots of other ideas people have based on how things ""should"" be. It's a strong argument for letting the market decide things so that, at the least, we know jobs are generally paying no more or less than they're worth. Any resulting shortfall in individual wages is probably best treated as a separate problem solved by gov't welfare, a guaranteed basic income, private charities, or other options.","1388535071"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Its not going to be something like a Sci-fi movie, where sudden disaster kills millions. No, see, what many don't understand is that climate change is a change in probabilities. Imagine you had a set of cards to play Blackjack with, except all the suites were removed and all face cards are replaced with 10's(since they have the same value). You play with it and nothing changes, the probability is the same. Now add another '10' card, not much changes, you can still play normally. Now add another, and another etc. Suddenly every hand you get is 2 10's, but so is the dealers, the only way you win is by getting an Ace, but the chances of that is now *very* low. The game has completely changed, and just like with climate change, you can't tell if was an added 10 or an original one that doomed you.

So maybe that Cat 5 hurricane that hit the Philippines would have happened if the industrial revolution had never occurred, maybe not. Maybe it'd been weaker, possibly it could've been stronger. But storm aren't the big worry, the big one is lack of snow covered mountains, which millions depend on to give them water as they melt in the summer, without those, entire cities will dry up.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","Oh, come on. I'm mocking the culturist retards around here and in a response they downvote (censor) me, just like a religious extremist wants to.

I guess mockery isn't as welcome if it's directed at them. How interesting.

I'm clearly showing their hypocrisy and shallow-mindedness. That's an interesting point in and of itself.

Anyways. The text without said point:

Allow me to add to the general discussion.

It's not because you can make fun of something that you should.

Sure, you're allowed to make fun of dead children, 9/11, rape, the holocaust, the N-word, fallen soldiers, child-abuse, very important politicians (like JFK, Churchill, Lumumba, Mandela, Ataturk, De Gaulle, Ghandi, Mao, ...), having sex with dead people, dead celebrities, the founding fathers, slavery, pedophilia, people with a horrible serious illness, but you're bound to offend people doing so.

It's pretty much irrelevant whether or not those sensitivities (or actual taboos) are constructive, or right, or not archaic. Maybe the holocaust should be at the pinnacle of every comedian's show but the fact remains that some people ARE offended by jokes about the subject, whether or not that's rational.

Why do something that you know will offend people. Plenty of funny things to do and say that are less likely to offend a lot less people.
A right is still there, even if you see that there is no point in exercising it. Indeed, many people choose not to make fun of the above subjects.

If I know something I do will upset someone (Muslim or otherwise) and I gain nothing from doing so, then I don't see why I would do it. Unless my aim is to upset that someone.

Okay, thought experiment and look at it from an extreme POV. Let's just say that things like cultural identity, philosophy and theology are completely and utterly useless and downright pointless.
In other words, theists are wrong, without a doubt.
However, they hold those beliefs nonetheless and sometimes making fun of those ideas, which people often hold quite dear, will make them sad. So what it the correct course of action then?

It's irrational for an animal to be afraid of me baring my teeth to it. Of course I won't hurt it. But it'll still be afraid and distressed. So I won't bare my teeth if possible. Is that an infringement of my rights? No. I still have the right. I just choose not to make someone's day worse.

I honestly think that this focus on who should be allowed to be ""offended"" by what is a little paternalistic. I think that, within reason, people should be allowed to be wrong. Hell, that's a right protected in a democratic society.

Of course there are some extremist people who react badly to certain rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion and seek to take those rights away. Christ, (pun intended) even some Christians react badly to the mockery of their religion. Albeit, it would seem, often in a different way than Muslims. Let's not deny that. Tho to be precise, I'd wager there are certain societal factors that make people more extreme that are less present in ""Christian"" societies. Remember, correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.

Besides, I do think it's a little short-sighted to be offended by any censorship seemingly inspired by religion when it’s quite obvious that, to be frank, Muslim extremists are amateurs. We live in a society where information and opinions are constantly shaped, deformed, censored, observed on mind-boggling scales by corporations and governments. And in those instances people ARE killed, DO disappear, ARE jailed, on the most extreme end and on the less extreme, but yet still quite horrific, end our entire perception of reality is a tool of the powerful... And the entities doing these crimes are indeed often ""democratic"" and ""enlightened"". Religious extremists managed to galvanize much of reddit behind draw-Muhammad-day. Collective action which the aforementioned crimes have triggered in a surely lesser extent.

It pays to see the various instances of violent censorship in proportion and direct just anger accordingly.

Apologies for that tangent.

So all in all I agree absolutely agree in a massive degree that people should not be denied any of their rights. Be it the right to freedom of speech or the right to be wrong.

I'm just arguing for a sensible, constructive use of any right. Constructive self-restraint. I mean, it's a right for you to have a gun. But should you?

When exercising a right makes those who would take that right away from me stronger, and when there's no good reason for me to exercise said right, save to make innocent bystanders sad, then perhaps I should look at the cost-benefit.

The cost-benefit for our society and for extremists, as honestly, I don't think that firing with a shotgun at a mosquito will be necessarily bad for the mosquito. Maybe that mosquito will just be happy I've angered the cow I accidentally hit.

If you're an organization fighting for the remembrance of fallen soldiers then a comedian making fun of that subject is bound to bring in more than a few sympathy-members.
I speak from personal experience in the field of volunteering in a grass-roots organization. Never had as many sympathy as when being attacked in an ""unfair"" way.
Kinda crazy to compare the field of grass-roots humanitarian work to religious extremism. But I bet there's an overlapping, as both draw strength from public opinion.

Not that I'm saying that mockery is what causes extremism. But it's not exactly going to decrease it in a comical fashion akin to an extremist going 'Haha! That Palin guy is pretty funny. Now thanks to his mockery I realize my entire belief-system is flawed.'

Reality doesn't work like that, I'm afraid.

To clarify. I don't care about hurting the god-damn mosquito. I just don't want to see an otherwise friendly cow hurt. Because I don't want to hurt anyone AND because I don't want to strengthen the mosquito.

Isn’t it an advantage that acting more virtuous, more democratic and friendlier is exactly what harms religious extremism the most?

Allowing ourselves to be terrorized, providing disproportional attention to those who crave it and abuse it, acting less civilized, less democratic, is EXACTLY what extremists want. They'd like nothing more than discriminatory behavior making it easier for them to pray on those they have in their sights.

Of course the socio-economic issues that usually cause extremist behavior are still mostly present, no matter what our comedians do. But being terrorized, acting less civilized, less democratic, is EXACTLY what extremists want. They'd like nothing more than discriminatory behavior making it easier for them to pray on those they have in their sights.

Muslim extremists really don’t want to stop the mockery. Hell, no. It helps them, galvanizes them. But even extremists have heard of reverse psychology. Which seems to be working…

In my humble opinion it should be obvious that there have been more than a few destructive and very counter-productive reactions to 9/11.

By overreacting and drastically altering the way a certain percentage of the population is regarded and treated both by the government and by the general public, systematically supporting Israel, invading countries for no constructive reason whatsoever, having secret and overt prisons where people are treated in a horrific way, erecting a massive surveillance-apparatus have proven to be much worse than whatever the extremists could ever throw at us.

Those are very large examples, sadly enough much outside of our power. But we do have a say as to how we treat people.

All I'm saying is, if it doesn't cost you anything whatsoever to make the world a nicer, more considerate place, then why not do it?

A right isn't an obligation. So therefore I think we should choose not to make people sad, if at all possible.

And if that hurts religious extremism then that’s just an extra motivation to be nice.","1388535087"

They all look too different, there is no sight of sand-grain texture, the texture looks more like hand-hammering and flaked scale, the outside edge is well polished, and I can see what looks like stress lines at the bends.  Also, casting iron on a small scale is just a big pain; when people do it, they usually try to stick to things that are really worth the effort.  The tongue can't be cast because it needs to be bend around the back bar, and cast iron doesn't do that.  The only thing I can't see in the photo is an obvious forge-weld seam.

You might be interested to know that from a historical angle, you'd be hard-pressed to find a blacksmith making a product like this.  At least not among British &amp; Colonial American smiths.  For one thing, buckles were generally cast brass which was then polished all over to a shine.  For another, a competent blacksmith would take the time to file all of the visible surfaces smooth.

"technology","t5_2qh16","it would be more sensible for the CDNs, I think, to avoid geolocating the user based on the location of the resolver. What if the resolver address is just a load balancer serving multiple distant areas -and resolvers-, which are caching records internally? 


it would be more sensible for the CDNs in question to do load balancing trough bgp anycast and let the protocol do the work, in a probably even more accurate and universal way.

But major cdns are already doing this. Out of curiosity, which ones (besides akamai) use the method you described? 

edit: just tried a traceroute on an akamai cdn using google public dns, it resolved to a nearby host, just two hops away from my carrier network (which accounts for 5 hops). By the way, for fairness, the international backbone is also owned by said carrier, but counts only for two hops (of the 5 ones).

2nd edit: tried with a resolver provided by my carrier. Now the akamai cdn is a host part of/owned by my carrier's backbone division. you are surely right about it.","1388535095"

"pokemonconspiracies","t5_2tpgv","There are quite a few theories(one in the form of a creepypasta if I recall correctly).

The one that I know is that there used to be a boy, his Clefairy, and his Hitmontop. The boy had a butler that hated the Pokemon because the child wanted the Pokemon to have the Chateau when he died or something like that(it's been a while since I read it, cut me some slack). So, the butler ends up murdering the Clefairy and Hitmontop. Their ghosts take the form of Gengar for the Clefairy and Rotom for the Hitmontop and they protect the boy because (I think) the butler then tries to murder the boy.

There's also something involving poison in one of the theories/creepypastas because of an antidote and Gardenia being afraid and I just remembered what it was. Gardenia had a sister that was suffering from an illness/poison and she tried to get the antidote to her but wasn't fast enough so the girl died. Not sure how that ties in but that does explain why Sinnoh's grass-type gym leader is afraid of the place.","1388535096"

It allowed Eriksen to play the Modric role for is we have missed, orchestrating play and playing the ball forward, something none of our other CMs can do. 

Playing this lop sided  4-3-3 is perfect for us atm as it gives us defensive strength in midfield, eriksen's creativity to be free and drift wherever picking the ball up, while at the same time allowing us to play two strikers, who make time and space for each other, some thing Soldado has lacked and needed.

Even an inkling of that not-making-progress-in-life feeling, and bring on the water works (granted, yes I'm in school so I am making progress... but it doesn't always feel like that). 

One time, my boyfriend and I went out for pizza. We split a pitcher of beer so I was a teeeeensy bit tipsy, and terrrribly hormonal but trying not to think about it. It was obvious that I was done drinking, but I was *pretending* to pour the last sip of beer into my glass, while my boyfriend gave me that ""don't you dare"" look. Welp, I tipped the pitcher just a tiny bit too far and actually poured the beer. Immediately I went into that ""Crap! Sorry! I didn't seriously mean to do that!"" mode and tried to slide the glass over to him... accidentally tipping the glass and pouring the beverage all over the table. I immediately burst into tears and we had to leave the restaurant.

They're spending their customer's money, not theirs. Another reason? Doctors and nurses are too easily sued, so they need high insurance themselves. 

And the only reason that universal healthcare countries have lower costs is because they have price controls. The government determines what the rate is for lab tests or the surgeon. Like the government setting the price for gas or milk regardless of any economic data. 

Did you know people that pay cash for services can negotiate prices? They pay lower healthcare costs without insurance? Obviously in your case this is an emergency but if the market were allowed to lower the prices over the last few decades, you would be paying less (because obviously they can't charge you more for it being an emergency).

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I am from Montana.  I didn't exactly have to relocate.  I stayed in a man camp that was 30-60 minutes away from the rig during the 14 days a month that I worked.  Then I would go back home to Montana for 14 days off.  The man camp lodging is provided by the company for free.  The camp I stayed in was catered, too, so I didn't have to buy my own food.  Rent is really high and if it weren't for the man camp it wouldn't have made sense to work out there.  Gas was a little more expensive, same with chewing tobacco, so I would stock up on that kind of thing before I left Montana.  I didn't buy much food and can't remember any prices for you.

Yeah, the bars and stuff are overrun with rough folks from all over the country, but we worked 12+ hours a day, commuted for about an hour and a half a day so there wasn't much time left to do anything other than eat, shower, do laundry and sleep.  If we weren't too wore out sometimes we would drive up onto a little hill where there was cell service and have a few beers.  Had to be kind of sneaky about the drinking, alcohol wasn't allowed at the camp.  But I only heard stories about people getting in fights, getting stabbed, etc.  Didn't see women very often.

I expected the job environment to be really tough physically with no mercy for you when you are out of breath, tired, sore, cold, hot, etc.  They did have a hydration program in place to make sure everybody drank enough fluids, though.

I was inspired to go after the job because I had dropped out of school for the third time and was back at my parents house.  I needed to prove to myself that I could get on my feet.

Those things can and do exist in a capitalist economy. But in a socialist economy I would not be allowed to own a factory and employ people. I'm not seeing what your preference for coops and credit unions has to do with that.

As well, market socialism requires theft. Worker coops and credit unions simply cannot create and finance the types of operations that take advantage of modern manufacturing. That isn't to say they don't have value, but they simply could not create the MASSIVE amount of wealth we have today in modern nations.

In order to implement market socialism, you need some kind of violent means to prevent people from voluntarily entering into business relationships that you arbitrarily define as being immoral.","1388535116"

More mild summers/winters are a plus (though it changes the beach experience a bit). Compared to Philly Portland has less crime but a more visible homeless population. It is not nearly as dense but still walkable and neighborhoods have more trees and houses have bigger yards. No sales tax and less tax on alcohol which helps keep expenses down. Restaurants have been hit or miss. Portland is full of entrepreneurs so even folks that shouldn't own bars and restaurants sometimes do so you often have to seek out the best of the bunch. I found a job rather quickly but it pays much less than my job in Philly. Rent is essentially the same. Proximity to outdoorsy stuff is a major plus.

On the brighter side, I'm glad you realize your mother's behavior for what it is, and that you aren't letting her gaslight you with claims that ""she told you about it days ago"". When I was your age I always gave my parents the benefit of the doubt. I'd think ""well maybe I *did* forget"", and would then blame myself for the problems. Good for you for sticking to your guns.

I know how to make a rainbow horus team. I was asking if anyone ever tried to make a horus Burst team.
 
looking at my box... i was think of using: Horus/athena/beelzebub/izanagi/heraIS/Horus


The idea behind this is to set up the board for: Horus (+)red/ athena (+)light,green/ beezlebub (+)water, dark orbs/ izanagi 2x att for gods for a burst attack. 16x + (+orbs) + 2x god attack  = ???x burst attack.


only problem is that beelzbub wont get the 2x att for gods, so im asking if others have tried other teams or subs for this to work.

im not looking for a horus descended team, im looking for fun team to run just like athena god 9x team/ heraur 9x devil team/ rose valk 9x healer team and etc...

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I want to follow up with this topic. So with that whole ""thing"" involving the contracts of players and not being able to stream other games while advertising League. You guys never had the intention to harm other games? It just felt nasty in a way because those things just don't happen by accident. You might have changed your mind on the issue but it seemed to me more along the lines of riot getting caught with your hand in the cookie jar.

I personally think League should take the big brother approach and be trying to grow every scene because if you make everyone strong when Riot comes out with a newer game then by having just more people involved in competitive gaming paves the way for greater things. NFL type numbers someday and huge leagues like LCS, WCS, and others to flourish.

I guess I didn't really have many questions but I wanted to say just don't try to muscle other games out and take everything for yourselves because it's going to blow up in your faces. No game lasts forever its just a fact. I love League I enjoy playing hundreds of games and  thousands of hours but I also realize the Value other games bring into competitive gaming.

Even if you think you were acting in self defense getting out of your car with a weapon all the court would see is you attacked someone with a weapon so they shot you with their gun and you died.  

Now the guy being drunk (if the cops can prove it before he sobers up) may not mean anything because the guy being drunk does not make you get out of your car and advance toward him with a weapon.  
Even drunk people can act in self defense.  

Either way, you should not be getting out of your car with a weapon unless you know the other guy does not have a gun.    

It does not even make sense to why you even got out of your car as that was the safest place to be.  I dont even know why you pulled over in an empty parking lot, a public place with people like a gas station would have been the smart choice or you could have just kept driving, but driving slow until you see a cop.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","okay good point. 

There are many reasons, i'll just give this one example.

I am sellfish. I already make around 3x minimum wage. I know that if min wage is increased, i'll actually be worse off. The reason being, if min wage is increased, we will probably see an increase in cost, which leads to increase in price, which means I effectively receive less money.

This is under the assumption which i would believe to be true, that i would not see a proportional raise in my wage. In fact, if everyone got a proportional increase in their wage while minimum wage increawed, nothing would actually get done.

Prices would rise proportional to the original increase in minimum wage thus leavin gthe effective buying power of the min wage worker the same.

I as a rational human, want more things for myself, and i know an increase in min wage means less things for me, so I am against a min wage increase. It also just happens, that economically speaking, I know min wages are bad for society.","1388535130"

You need a reality check. Open relationships work when there is a *ton* of trust and communication and are hard with relationships where both partners live together. What do you feel will happen when she has a 2nd girlfriend (if she doesn't already have someone specific in mind) and the months drag on. Will she be texting you when she's with the other person? Will she spend entire weekends ignoring your texts?

You are young and so is she. Open relationships like this are usually a preliminary ""I want to break up but I'd feel bad saying that""

If you feel that I'm wrong, go look around this subreddit and /r/relationships for updates on long distance open relationships and figure out the chances of this working out in your favor.","1388535130"

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","It depends on what you're looking for. In general, I prefer to look to the drugstore first, and turn to the expensive stuff if I can't find something that'll work. 

For example, I'm very pale, with strongly yellow undertones and a tendency to flush. I cannot find a drug store foundation that actually works for me. I've occasionally found one in the right color, but never also the right texture. So I use Indie powder foundations, and look to pro or high end for liquid or cream ones.

Another example is matte eyeshadows. NYX has a few good ones, but theBalm is unrivaled in quality, and Inglot has an fantastic selection. For shimmery ones though, I love Wet n Wild (I still have some high end, but more because it feels luxurious and I love the added variety). 

But my holy grail primer, concealers and mascaras are drug store, and I've found amazing eyeliners.","1388535131"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","My city in Canada has a large Somali population, and in my experience they are very diverse in terms of religious traditions.  I know a lot of Somali-Canadians -- including hijabi females -- who have ""dated"" non-Muslims, though I don't know how intimate they got.  I also know that it is common in some East African traditions for ""dating"" to be an open secret: kids choose their preferred spouses from among their peer group, essentially ""date"" them for a while, and then ""surprise"" their parents by asking to marry that nice neighbour boy/girl whom the whole family has known and loved for years.  I don't know if Somalis have that tradition though.

I would suggest asking your friend hypothetically what her family's rules would be for dating, and what she thinks about life, love, marriage, her future, etc.  You might then be able to her out if she is okay with that concept.  But you should know that many Muslims (including most Somalis) don't follow the ""friends, dating, sex, relationship, move-in, marriage, kids"" sequence that is recommended in secular North American culture.  From our perspective, Muslims shun the opposite sex for years, then get married rather casually/suddenly and fall in love (or have easily-preventable marital problems) some time after.  Cultural differences are funny!

Either way, you sound like a respectable guy who has nothing but respect for your very respectable lady friend.  I wouldn't give up hope like some on this board would advise -- most Arabs and South Asians know *nothing* about Somalis -- but you should continue to respect your friend's wishes and those of her family without pitting them against one another.

TL;DR:  Ask her how it works in her family and what she thinks about that, and then keep within those rules.

**EDIT:** I should add as a caveat that Somalis in Canada are *perhaps* more accepting of this idea than Somalis in other places.  It really depends on a number of factors that would be specific to her family.  Tread carefully, but again, I wouldn't rule it out completely just yet.  Hopefully there are some Somali Westerners on the board who can offer some particular insight.","1388535131"

2. It is possible to know much of the composition of asteroid, and iirc they use some form of mass spectrometry to determine what it is made of.

3. Permanent mining facilities would not have to be built on the asteroid. At first they would capture the asteroid and bring it back to either the moon or possibly in LEO to mine. They could also send autonomous or remote mining equipment to the asteroid and mine it. Then they could shuttle the product back and forth to the wanted location, and the fuel used could be derived from the water on the asteroid in-situ. 

4. Deep Space Industries is planning to start their Firefly missions in 2015. This is where they take a modified cubesat and send it to an asteroid to be inspected for possible mining operations. They do not have a timeline for actual mining operations to start, but it shouldn't take more than ten years to be feasible.

5. Given the increase in the abilities of 3d printers, I would assume that it shouldn't be too challenging to create a space station using automated processes. However, I don't quite know how they will purify the metals gathered on a large scale without a large infrastructure.","1388535135"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Underpaid and unskilled? I've driven over 300,000 miles in the past three years. At one point, it was food service: A tractor and 48 foot trailer in to an open, packed fast food restaurant parking lot countless times. Previous to that and also recently, over 60 combined feet of truck and trailer in to steel mills, loading docks, construction sites, ports, and anywhere else where people need shit picked up or delivered. I spend 11 hours a day, 7 days a week keeping 80,000 pounds of shit between two white lines, 12 feet apart. In addition, I'm solely responsible for securing, strapping, chaining and tarping whatever I haul, no matter how big or awkwardly shaped it is, to ensure it doesn't fall off my truck when I hit a bump and turn your girlfriend in to a greasy red pancake in the ditch. And I'm not even very experienced.
  

  I have accomplished all of this without killing your mom, your best friend or (god forbid) you. Not a single product has been damaged on my truck. I haven't so much as rubbed against a stop sign, destroyed a curb or torn up someone's grass. If you think that requires no skill, you know nothing of the world beyond your mom's basement.
  
  I see you every day. I laugh at you when you sweep out on my right hand side to pass me only to find that I'm passing someone else because you can't see more than 4 feet I'm front of your face. I laugh when you rear end someone because you're following too close. When you cut me off and hit a patch of ice and roll over side down in a ditch and I'm the only one who saw it happen, you'd better be glad I'm not a total monster and I'll call 911. Some guys wouldn't.

And you know what? I do it all, still get home to see my girlfriend whenever she isn't working, and make more money than you do. I chose to do this rather than sit in traffic twice a day, five days a week and spend all weekend stressed out about Monday. That life sucked and didn't pay nearly enough. But hey, I'm sure it's good enough for you. Enjoy it!","1388535138"

No family history as far as I've been made aware.

The boredom is what eats at me at my job, but when you're one of the lucky few chosen to be the first people on Mars I imagine you won't have much time for boredom.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I don't want to pre-judge, but your wording and tone makes you sound really high maintenance. Examples:

* Calling them ""vermin.""
* Bothered by swearing; calling it ""vulgar"" like you get the vapors at blue language
* Calling a guy a ""slut."" I still don't understand how men can be ""sluts"" and really hate that we use that word for sexually active women in the first place. We really don't need to extend the shaming.
* Calling having a good time ""gay debauchery."" Your boyfriend clearly wants to go party. Maybe your attitude is making him look for a release. I would if you were this critical all the time.
* Person 4 actually does sound like an ass, but the fact that you ""tried forbidding"" your boyfriend from seeing him is out of line. You don't ""forbid"" grown men from doing anything they want to do. There's a big lack of respect of boundaries there if you're trying to create rules for his life.
* ""sweetest little thing"", ""cute as a button""; blech. He's not a toy dog you keep in a purse.

Most definite is still a book by A. F. Petrushevsky's ""Generalissimo Prince Suvorov"", printed in 1884:

[(adopted to modern russian language, online) А. Петрушевский ""Генералиссимус князь Суворов""](http://www.adjudant.ru/suvorov/pt00.htm)

Petrushevsky was a Lt. General of Russian army, who turned to military history. He was well acquainted with russian military tradition, tactics and strategy.

In general, [Collection of sources about Suvorov](http://www.adjudant.ru/suvorov/suvorov00.htm) on the web site of the russian project ""Adjutant"" is a good starting point

I totally understand your point about maps. Another problem: many maps are too small and without topography. I usually end up using online topo maps as a background and then painting troops movement over time - it really helps.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Same here.  There's a great reason people love sleeping under blankets, and it has more to do with pressure than warmth:

&gt;""In psychiatric care, weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious, upset, and possibly on the verge of losing control,"" says Karen Moore, OTR/L, an occupational therapist in Franconia, N.H. These special blankets are filled with weighted pellets, which are sewn into compartments to keep them evenly distributed. Weighted blankets are also sometimes marketed for general use as an aid to sleep and relaxation.
&gt;
&gt;""These blankets work by providing input to the deep pressure touch receptors throughout the body,"" Moore says. ""Deep pressure touch helps the body relax. Like a firm hug, weighted blankets help us feel secure, grounded, and safe."" Moore says this is the reason **many people like to sleep under a comforter even in summer**.  [Emphasis mine]

Source: [Choosing a Blanket to Help You Sleep](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/minding-the-body/201112/choosing-blanket-help-you-sleep)

I'm in my thirties and I still find a blanket to be one of life's simple, glorious pleasures, no matter the season.  Never had the pleasure of a weighted blanket, but I have a number made of cotton.  They're over six pounds (2.5+ kg) at queen size.  A flimsy, poly-whatever stuffed comforter or a thin cotton sheet just won't cut it; and a wool blanket is crafted for much colder climes than where I live.

If this rings a bell, the ""amazing"" effect of a hot shower / hot tub may be due in large part to its anti-anxiety effects described by a number of redditors in this thread.

She made rude remarks about me and my family, and complained about her parents not buying her a decent car.

That is when I realized she was a bitch. When we left the restaurant on our fourth date, she asked me to come back to her house. She was trying to seduce me. I had fucking plans, and she knew it, yet she told me to blow off my friends party and come with her. The conversation was this:

""Come on, come with me.""

""No thanks, I have plans. I can't.""

*Pout.* ""You're funny, I always get what I want, always, now hurry up and come with me.""

If you're a fan of crazy colors make sure that the person knows how to use said colors to compliment your skintone (not all blues, purples, reds are going to look gorgeous on you), no one wants to look like Frankenstein's monster or a guest star on Jersey Shore. Also, if someone is telling you should do something that is long lasting (dying eyebrows, shaving/trimming them, dying or cutting hair, etc) realize that it's not going to go away after 24 hours. That person saying, ""Oh you'll look great if you do____"" is aiming that look for a specific event and you'll have to go with that look for at least several days.

Just because wage goes up doesn't mean the amount of work that needs to be done goes down. Could you try working with fewer employees to maintain your profit ratio? Sure, but it'll likely lower your profits because of reduced production. Either way, the guy at the top ends up taking a hit to his profits.

Melting occurs when the majority of the kinetic energy of the molecules becomes greater than the energy that hold the bonds rigid. The result is that the bonds still exhibit attraction but the molecules are free to move with respect to one another.

So it's far from perfect.

At the same time I think it's a great opportunity to educate a broader range of people who may not otherwise have thought of less hierarchy as even something that's possible, let alone desirable. This at least creates a breach in the way people see normal way of doing business.

If i have a Karthus on my team, who will take exhaust in most cases, i take ignite.
If i have a toplaner/midlaner on my team, who takes a combination of flash/ghost/teleport , i take ignite.

I allways try to balance it. Imo it is the best, when the SoloLaners have ignite, the jungler obv. smite, the adc barrier and the support exhaust.
When a Sololaner doesnt use ignite, i pick it, if the adc doesnt have it.

So most of the games i want to have 2 or max 3 ignites","1388535172"

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","&gt;give me one instance where the Regime acted on behalf of Iran in a way that conflicts with true arab interest. 

The regime doesn't act in the ""true arab interest"".  It acts in its own interests.  It has grown intensely reliant on Iran over the course of this war, wholly dependent on them for financial support ($tens of billions), training of its various militias, weapons and over 10k foreign fighters.  Syria is Iran's gateway to the Arab world, and Iran is protecting that gateway.  Assad's massively desperate position has forced him into a much closer relationship with Tehran, whom he now is completely reliant upon.  If it wasn't for Iran's support, Assad would have fallen two years ago.

"falcons","t5_2ql17","Those are some valid points. 

Considering I would prefer that 3 out of the first 4 picks be commited to those areas (o and d line) plus a FA activity that is strictly focused in those areas. These new additions plus the players we already have under contract (ie goodman, massaquai, holmes, and etc); By then we shouldve added enough depth to focus our attention elsewhere. There is only so many roster spots. Everyone is talking about O and D line. Obviously these will be the main priorities in FA and the top half of the draft. But once we get the necessary additions we should also seek to fix other weak areas that no one mentions but are need to get through a typical nfl regular season (such as Special teams returner &amp; backup qb).

Everyone you mentioned (Renfree, Davis and especially Doege) are no where near capable of backing up Matt Ryan right now. All of them are raw and have years until fully developed. If Matt goes down, expect another crap and lost season. I completely agree with you, its not an efficient use of draft picks but when an organization is full of busts at the starting and secondary levels then these are the cards we must deal with.  

Flynn was drafted by the packers in '08 and developed by them and left when his rookie deal was up. When his deal was up, he was coveted and thats whats important. A coveted backup is a tradable asset. It would be nice to have some of those on the falcons roster once in a while. ","1388535184"

You have the wrong definition of labor and confusing it with ""hard work""

""Hard work"" is that brick-and-mortar and other hard physical labor.

Labor is the exploitation of labor that in third world countries is called slavery and in first world countries is called wage labor or a job. 

There will always be a need for ""hard work"" as like you said, that's the only way stuff will get done. The difference comes down to how who does what jobs get allocated. Now this is where there is a little schism but I think most people agree that those jobs get shifted between people that actually want to do that work and every body else takes turns filling in the holes of what's necessary (with bias shown towards the young and able).

This helps avoid the problem with capitalism today of the poor forced to do these jobs for their livelihoods and the USA and rest of the world can actually live up to the phrase ""that all men are created equal""","1388535188"

Abel is an Okizeme based rushdown character. This means that you're going to do everything in your power to score hard knockdowns, whether that be from falling sky, or tornado throw, or sweep. Abels offense is high octane, but because of this, you need to know WHY it's high octane. To beat players with knowledge, you need to beat them with more knowledge. One thing I didn't see while quickly browsing through comments is how to create frame advantage. One of the most important tools in abel's armory is his step kick, but because this is a 7f startup move, you can't just simply throw it out. You'll lose to shoto low forward and many other normals. Practice your mixup variations, learn tick tornado throw setups, practice your anti airs (remember, abel has cr. hp, cl. st hp, far st. mp, and cr. mk for just PURELY NORMAL anti airs.) The hardest part about playing abel is playing defense.

Like Antiochli said, Shoryuken.com's forums are pretty rich for abel players (At least starting out) read the New to Abel thread, and read his basic combo thread as well. That should be a great start for you.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","My dog isn't very imposing, but I like to let him run around the neighborhood because I don't have a yard(and proper socialization is probably the only way to guarantee that he wont be hostile toward people or other dogs. I find that if I put a little green bike light on his harness, it eases anyone's concern about him, because it give the impression that someone somewhere pays attention to what he is doing, even if I am not actually watching him. Dressing him up in little reindeer antlers and stupid things like that also makes people less afraid of him. I think that most of the time fear of dogs are a projection of internal fears, rather than an accurate assessment of the situation.

That isn't to say that some dogs can be aggressive. For instance, the ""caution"" leash would be good for anyone who is trying to rehabilitate a rescue dog or something like that and doesn't want stupid people like me to walk up to their dog to say hello.","1388535198"

(The rates for royalties are set by the Guild contract with the studios). I didn't expect that at all, and it was always great to see the green envelope that the checks came in waiting in my mailbox.

Except the part your own people sold you off to find their own shit, then put the blame entirely on white people. By the way slavery been around forever and compared to Roman slavery European slavery was a fucking joke. Then the NAACP ask reparations from descendants of owners. By the way another fucking joke. And then never acknowledge their own internal issues and peddle it off as racist.
So let's try again, everyone who has any sense remembers. Also remember Blacks enslaving Moses and his people to build the pyramids, something they never recognize. And they did this for thousands of years.
So yes, I have a firm grasp on what I'm saying.
Nothing I've said this pointed was racist, this was aim at a group which still thinks it's 1950 and thinks itself a warrior of the people.

No, you need to do what will be best for you. That is going to mean taking into serious consideration how much potential this relationship has, and what is going to be best in the long run.

It's ok if you two remain friends, but from the way things look about it, you two are going to drift apart one way or another.

It ensures that, even if the people

the nation can stay relatively stable, though also relatively stuck.

However, you haven't addressed the main question. Why would an authoritarian ruler care about the will of the people? How would he or she determine said will?

The reason most modern monarchs are popular, is that they are ceremonial (people like ceremony and ritual) but powerless (so never get their hands too dirty in politics). Note for example that Michelle Obama, the US first lady has consistently had a high approval rating, just like the Moroccan and English monarchies, for the same reason: she is a ceremonial, ritualistic ruler, who has no real power.

I learned that there was a single doctor for the whole emergency that night. The doctor didn't even diagnose my issue properly, I was sent home without treatment or follow-up! I ended up in a different emergency for the same issue last September. The doctor was more helpful, she gave me a prescription to try(which helped), and I had a follow-up appointment at their clinic. (Still, my digestive issue is unresolved because the whole healthcare system in Quebec is totally broken.)

Is there a pain clinic in your area that you could go to instead of the emergency? Even now, I barely ate these last few days, I've probably lost the last weight I could loose, and I'm still trying my best to avoid going to the emergency. Emergency sucks.

It now requires more than light weight and high power.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I thought this game was an incredible disappointment. 

First off, I love the Nerd. James is one of the inspirations for my own show. I've been watching him since like the 6th episode, and I loved the idea of a retro NES hard platformer, but it doesn't do it right. For a game that claims to be all about ""If you die, it's your own fault"", it sure does pull the ""HA HA You died because we tricked you!"" card an awful lot. If you compare it to other super-lethal platformers like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy, there's a very VERY big difference.

*Respawning after death isn't instantaneous.*

This seems like a minor nitpick, but it really does ruin the entire game for me because there is absolutely no reason for it.  

In the other games, Your character explodes and you press the button to respawn. It takes 1/10th of a second and you are able to get into a rhythm of trial and error. AVGNA forces you to wait for the randomly generated quote to appear, press one of the buttons (I'm still not sure whether it's shoot or jump, even after beating the game.) and then the entire game locks up for about 5 seconds before it respawns you. 5 seconds may not seem like much, but it's still 50 times longer than the other games. And it happens every time. It feels like the game is unfinished, like it's working REALLY hard to process the idea that it needs to reset everything and it feels like it's just lagging; like when an MMO stops responding, and then you instantly find yourself in another place with no time to react.

The game even locks up when leaving the button configuration menu. It just freezes and you're stuck wondering whether you actually pressed the confirm button until suddenly it lurches forward. This is unforgivable.

Just because you're making fun of annoying video game design choices by placing those annoying video game designs in your game doesn't change the fact that you have annoying video game designs in your game. Parody isn't a free pass on making a bad game.

So, to answer your questions: no, not really. It did not successfully parody bad games without being a bad game. It parodied bad games as a detriment to itself. And I did not find it all that particularly fun to play.","1388535230"

I can't remember if the whole entire video is like this, it may be one scene of it. But anyway, IIRC it's in a small area, I'd say about the size of the room in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT68FS3YbQ4), but longer (room for a crowd?) like playing for a small party underground. No backdrop or anything behind them, only the drummer behind the singer and the end of the room.

I'd compare it again to that video in that you're watching the band play - just without all the flooding and the gimmick is that they're switching between a bunch of camera angles (to the beat?) while they play.

Also when I say switching between camera angles I don't mean like in that video where the cameras themselves are moving - it's a bunch of stable cameras that individually don't move, the only ""movement"" of cameras is actually just switching between them.

From some of the Orthodox podcasts I have listened to, there is a thought of two forms of ""depression"". 

The first, is what you are dealing with which is clinical depression. We do what we must to deal with it. Perhaps, a more active life can alleviate it, but many people do need resort to medication. There is no sin here. You have a physical aliment and must do what is necessary to take care of your body. The second, which is the one that tends to be more talked about from a Christian perspective is *acedia* (listlessness). It is a spiritual malady and a sin that we must beware of falling into.

I leave it to you to listen (or read the transcript) of the above podcast since Dr. Rossi can probably do a better job of explaining it than I.

Unfortunately, we are in a period where many of us seem to be hesitant in excepting that mental illnesses are real illnesses. Just remember that you are not alone. From what I recall, there are a number of subscribers in here who have to deal with different mental illnesses.","1388535238"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; So an institution which exists to do violence is a public good

It's a public good because it's non-rivalrous and non-excludable. Riot police and streeting lighting are also public goods.

&gt;but public healthcare is an abomination?

It is both rivalrous and excludable; I never said it was an abomination. Saying it's for society when it's both of these things is just using weasel words.

&gt;There is no such thing as 'objective' good. Good is a subjective quality. Most people agree that human happiness is a good, and that society should be structured so as to maximise it. 

They disagree on how to measure this happiness though, as well as the appropriate methods for achieving it. 

&gt;I'm writing it off as childish because it is childish

What makes it childish?

&gt;This push to legitimize Ayn Rand is a cancer festering in the American Right, peddled by irrational fixations on the individual (much like a child, who is only capable of thinking about its own needs). 

You do realize that Ayn Rand is not the arbiter of libertarianism and even contemporary liberalism is about the individual, right?","1388535239"

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","I talked with the other party's claims adjuster.  They said the other party thinks a third-party hit and runner initiated the whole crash by hitting the corner of the other party, causing them to spun out in front of me.

Whether this is substantiated by the CHP collision report, I'll have to wait and see.  And of course the likelihood of tracking down this phantom runner and holding them liable is just a can of worms.

The other party has full collision/comprehensive, so I'm guessing that if the runner isn't found, he'll be covered under his own insurance, but will I have my vehicle covered under his liability?

And I assume that if a third party is found to be at blame and they are found, they will be liable for both our vehicles (assuming they have enough coverage/assets).

Would love to have someone chime in on this, it's making me rather nervous about the situation.

Anyways that lasted until I was 22 years old. It was my boyfriend that I was in love with but he ended up dumping me for his ex, then using me for a few years cause I was young and stupid. 

Then I met a guy who was just a Friend with Benefits and it opened a whole new world for me. I didn't have to be in love to have sex! So I experimented over the years and finally have settled down with my boyfriend of 7 years. The sex is amazing and we get along perfectly in that area and many other areas.

Frankly, the Lakers would have never made it the Finals w/o Pau.

Also, think about other possibilities to why your aren't getting a girlfriend. Do you look miserable wherever you go? Are you negative and cynical all the time? Do you have bad hygiene? Other than that, I have no advice other than to just keep trying. Also those sites are BS. They will just make you more miserable and drive people away from you.","1388535247"

| If they are equal, I know that either (e) or (f) are ""bad"", and the solution should be clear.

hmm, how is it clear? for the third weigh, you can do one of three things: 

1. weigh only one of e or f against a known good ball. this would omit the possibility that the other ball not weighed is the odd one out

2. weigh both e and f on one side against two good balls. this would make it impossible to differentiate whether e or f is the odd one out. 

3. weigh e against f. no matter which way the scale goes, you can't know whether one is heavy or the other is light (and vice versa)

| (a, c)&lt;(b, e) this can only happen if (c) is, light.  

i think the way you set it up, this could also mean that (b) is heavy.

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","I'm assuming you are starting from nothing. First up, learn to draw what you see realistically. If you don't have that base you're not going to be able to transfer. Also, you'll want to simultaneously start learning about graphic design. I'll explain more about that at the end. In that, you'll also want to learn human and possibly animal anatomy. The biggest thing that breaks a drawing, even a cartoon drawing, is bad anatomy. By this point, you should be decent enough to start doing character designs. With this you'll need to be able to break your anatomy down by shape and play with the proportions of all the features. You should aim for a good nude silhouette by the end of this process. Then you'll want to start learning costuming and accessorizing. You want the costume to be interesting but as simple as possible. It's probably the hardest part of drawing. Remember in the beginning how I mentioned you want to learn graphic design? Well here is where you start wrapping it up. You want your character to be represented with good groupings of shapes, also a variety of shapes, be consistent across the turn around, the composition of the character to look good, and their personality to instantly be recognizable from their gesture to their overall look to their color choices. You won't get there if you don't practice every day. Also, it'll take you a lot longer to get there without guided instruction.","1388535256"

"incremental_games","t5_2yia0","You definitely need something beyond genies. The game stalls so hard once you have ~30 upgraded genies because the cost of buying more genies is so high, but you're only making ~100k oranges per second, and you can juice ~2mil+ per cycle. So you're basically waiting on production.

You can try to sell your lower level genies so you can rebuy cheaper genies and get them to +5 or better but this takes ages! And it's not worth bothering with lower producers because a +4 genie gives heaps more oranges than anything else. 

/edit

You could make it so that upgrades count towards clicking the big orange button. So instead of getting 1 orange per genie per big orange click, I'd get like 200+. As it stands now there's no point in me clicking it since I passively gain so much more by just waiting.","1388535259"

Something people should keep in mind before they try to swat bees and wasps away is that when honey bees and some other bees sting you, the end of their body gets detached along with the stinger, so they die. Even the Hymenoptera that don't die when they sting you are still expending energy to create venom. They aren't ""out to sting you"" if they don't have to. Stinging is a defensive move, so if you act violently toward them, then they'll do the same. 

Generally they are just exploring, looking for food or water sources and might be attracted to you because of your perfume or something. Also, Hymenoptera are an incredible order of insect full of beneficial parasitic and pollinating species, so they might kill something else you don't like. ","1388535262"

update: just got back from the specialty store, they do not carry Hi-tek or Merrick dry food. I guess it's back to Annamaet, at $70/30lbs, *sigh*.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","A few different things.

First, most AP carries want to do either burst or artillery. Neither strategy really benefits from spellvamp very much. Burst needs damage more and doesn't stick around long enough to spellvamp. Artillery mages don't want to itemize around getting caught either, since they can't really kite.

So that leaves shorter range consistent dps mages. People like Karthus, Cassiopeia, Vladimir, Ryze, and Swain. However, even that configuration just allows them to use spellvamp - it doesn't mean it's always the best for them. Swain, for example, doesn't benefit as much from spellvamp because he has natural healing that works better with Spirit Visage, tankiness, or something like a Zhonya's.

Along these lines, the spellvamp items are pretty awful. The only two choices right now are WotA and Gunblade.

Gunblade is a hybrid item with an active, so it only works on champions who can take advantage of everything the item gives. WotA, while very cheap, has mana regeneration and cooldown reduction on top of AP and spellvamp. That's four different stats, so you really want to use them all well or really abuse most of them to make use of the item.

Finally, AOE spells have reduced spellvamping. This makes a lot of mages benefit significantly less from spellvamp. An ADC can lifesteal constantly at around 20% with a bloodthirster, getting 20% of a creep wave as health, kiting with 20% lifesteal, and getting full benefit. Mages have to hit 3 targets to get that same 20% spellvamp, and generally only get around 6.66% of a creep wave as health.

On a final note, spellvamp is also weaker early on in the game because it applies only to spells. Early on mana is a limiting factor and you can't spam spells, so spellvamp is naturally contained even further. Lifesteal, on the other hand, applies to every single autoattack and is generally picked on champions who almost entirely use autoattacks in early laning. This makes early lifesteal much more efficient than early spellvamp.

____

TL;DR: You need to be a short ranged consistent DPS mage who can take full advantage of the crazy stats in WotA/Gunblade who also doesn't benefit more from straight AP, straight tankiness, or Zhonya's.","1388535265"

The price is fair.

From what I can do with reading between the lines it sounds like you heard some valvetrain noise (metallic rhythmic tapping) coming from the top of the motor.  Given the circumstances (cold outside temperature and possibly cold engine temperature) a little noise upon startup and a few minutes afterwards is common.  If you're concerned with it see if the dealership will allow you to take it to the nearest Toyota dealership or local shop you trust to have it looked over; if the car is mechanically sound I can't see why they'd object having a third party confirm it.  Being from the northern part of the country rust on some metallic components is to be expected, any rust on visible painted body panels or excessive rust on the underside of the car would be cause for concern.

&gt;It's a privately funded mission, not governmental which would be way more costly.

I'm pretty sure it'll still cost a lot of money regardless. Government, Private, NGO, Guy next door, doesn't matter. Going to space is expensive and trying to go farther than anyone else has ever gone is going to cost even more than that. If anyone gives you a firm price they are just blowing smoke, the best we can do is estimate. ISS cost $100 billion and it took six/seven countries to make it happen and pay for it. It's big enough for six people and lasts twenty to thirty years. Granted we don't need something that big on Mars but it better be close otherwise you're eating each other's elbows.

&gt;Cabin fever? Oh please

I'm not sure why you think this can be dismissed. Astronauts/Cosmonauts go through rigorous training in groups, not only to measure their performance but to test their ability to function as a group. If that functionality isn't there early on then groups are moved around before training becomes in depth. 

You're not talking about being together for six months either but the rest of your lives. You damn well better be like a family because you WILL fight and will have to resolve issues as they come up.

They are picking out of a pool of 1058 potential recruits, you better find the 4 that match up perfectly or all hell will break loose either in the spacecraft or on the surface.

&gt;Okay technology it is... Can someone say why exactly the technology isn't ready? I only saw vague explanations or merely quotes from other pessimists why it's impossible.

We can launch, right now, a three person capsule to Mars. No problem, we have rockets big enough to do it or have some coming down the pipe in the next few years.

The problem is they'll be dead in a few weeks. Why? Well we as humans need certain things to stay alive, water, oxygen and nutrition. These take up weight and you can only bring so much with you, for Apollo they maxed out at two weeks worth (give or take a few days) and that was using the biggest, most powerful rocket ever built. 

**We'll start with water!** So they are doing a good job on the ISS of water reclamation (re-using water on board). They have their system up to 93% efficiency by sucking all the water out of the air possible, re-using urine, etc.. Meaning 93% of all the water it takes in comes back out as clean potable water. This is okay but still requires the ISS to get shipments of water on visiting vehicles approximately every 90 days or so. We need 100% efficiency to make sure that under any circumstances (shipment doesn't make it, run out of funding...etc.) the explorers will still have water. That last 7% is going to get tougher and tougher, it's taken them almost ten years to get to 93%. Good [video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjH3k5gODI#t=71).

Why not just make water on Mars? Well that's the plan, unfortunately none of the rovers we've sent have ever attempted this. Not a single person has ever done this in the type of environment that is the Mars surface. We are not going to send anyone there with a machine that has never been tested on the actual planet and without knowing exactly HOW to get the water on Mars into potable format. This will probably be solved in 5 to 10 years, both on the ISS and possibly by sending the first prototypes of such a system to Mars.

**Next up is nutrition** which is just as difficult as water, if not more. We have two options for continuous food sources, live animals and plants. First off live animals are out of the question, they are heavy, messy and probably would not enjoy zero gravity. So plants are clearly the way to go here. 

We haven't really grown much in space, there have been experiments on the ISS to grow plants but so far nothing bearing much edible nutrition. Scientists are making progress in this area but the work is slow (takes time to grow things) and the work space is limited. 

Keeping in mind that we have to do this once we get to Mars we face another difficulty. Plants need certain elements to grow, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus to name a few. You can't really just throw fertilizer into the capsule because of the weight so we have to find a way around this. Either creating our own from the soil on Mars or finding plants that require very little while still containing large quantities in terms of nutrition.

Again this needs to be designed, prototyped, built and tested before anyone steps foot on Mars. No one is going anywhere if they are going to die a few weeks after getting off their spacecraft. 

**Finally oxygen**, this is fairly essential. No ifs ands or buts about it. So first for the ride over (7 months) you need to be able to find a way to bring that much oxygen with you. That's a tall order, even in it's compressed super cooled liquid form you are talking about a LOT of space and weight. Also while inside a closed system you need to find a way to scrub the carbon dioxide, luckily this is fairly well done on the ISS and has been for many years since the early manned missions. 

When you get to Mars there is a problem, most of the atmosphere IS carbon dioxide. There is some oxygen but it's not super abundant. You either need to find a way to separate the Oxygen from the CO2 or get it out of the atmosphere (which contains very little).

This is another item that hasn't been prototype, built or tested. I have seen designs online for different systems but nothing very serious yet. 

**This is just covering** the very BASIC necessities you need for life to survive on Mars. Not including radiation, travel time, landing, shelter, mobility on the surface, emergencies, the list goes on for awhile. 

This is why no one is taking Mars One seriously. You have some of the greatest minds in the world working on problems like this (NASA, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed and Martin, ULA, Universities, Colleges) and they have yet to work out all the problems. In comes Mars One making bold predictions and setting time lines without any real, on the drawing board plans or specifications? Their only source of funding is a TV show that is supposed to rival the Olympics in size? I can not blame a single person for being skeptical.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of the dogs in my family is... interesting. Molly, our six year-old Boston terrier, has always been an insecure dog. She just always seems to be in a constant ""upset"" state. She's either all over you, losing her absolute shit, or in her crate sucking on her ""pillow"" (more of a rag now) looking pathetic. If you stick your finger anywhere near your mouth, she flips- whining, crying, high pitched barking, the whole deal. There was a good solid week while I was still in high school (and thus living at home) during which light-switches freaked her out. She also knows the word ""squirrel""- she's almost knocked over quite a few lamps that way. I love her to death, but I'm not convinced that she's living in the same perceived reality.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","If the whole rear wheel won't turn (can't roll the bike), that means there's something wrong with the main wheel bearings. Probably some water got inside the bearings and froze them solid.  
If this is the case, It's best to do a hub overhaul (if it's a loose-bearing-style hub.) Most shops charge $20-30 to do this. They will disassemble, clean, repack and readjust the bearing. You can also do it yourself with a few special tools.  
With fresh grease inside it should keep water out. It's a good idea to overhaul hubs once a year or two for bikes used regularly or in wet climates. Good luck!","1388535289"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I don't want the testing for two reasons. First, I wouldn't terminate the pregnancy if the baby has down syndrome or some other sort of mental handicap (only in the case of something that would not allow the baby to survive, which they will look for at the anatomy scan), so for me I don't really see the point in finding out, especially because no test is 100% accurate. My feeling is that I'll find out soon enough! Also there is really no reason to assume that there will be a problem, I am not in the advanced maternal age category or anything, so I think chances are good that everything is okay.
It also has to do with my attitude towards pregnancy, which is that I really don't like being treated like I have a disease. I can see how some people might feel worried that something is wrong, and for them these tests would be really valuable to put their minds at ease, but for me the tests feel stressful and unnecessary. I think that the switch to the midwife will be really good because I think a midwife will have the same attitude as I do towards pregnancy and childbirth, whereas an OB is a doctor trained to find problems and deal with them. I can definitely see how for some women, that would be really reassuring, but it clashes with my attitude and feelings so it causes more stress than necessary!

Again, not everyone is that lucky. Some people take out loans, work hard, study hard, go into a field that they think will allow them to pay back those loans, then the economy crashes and the job they had been studying for dries up, and then the end up in debt for the rest of their lives. You have no idea how much luck has played in your rise to success. I'm not doubting that you worked hard, that you still work hard, I'm not doubting that you put in insane hours, but so have millions of other people who were not as lucky as you.

"thatHappened","t5_2vmb7","No, passive voice is when the target of the verb is the subject, and usually includes 'by' somewhere to denote the agent, like 'the girl hit the ball' vs 'the ball was hit by the girl'. Passive voice often contains 'by' to denote the agent (i.e., the subject in the active form) and in English is typically constructed using a form of 'to be', but it doesn't have to be 'was' ('The ball will be hit by the girl' is still passive, for example) and 'to be' doesn't indicate passive ('The ball was blue' isn't passive). As a general rule, active voice puts the thing that did the action first, passive puts the target first.

Writing this in passive voice would be something like 'Giving her a Johnny Cash CD was then proceeded to by him'.

"SammyClassicSonicFan","t5_2yavw","The annoying thing about Sammy's mom is that we really can't do anything about her censoring. Even though it doesn't make sense to eradicate all negative feedback, she is still most likely going to do it. 

Here are things that she's done for her ""special snowflake"" that don't really make sense:

1. Threatened to call the cops because of internet trolling. Unless someone actually went to their house and harassed them (which any fool could easily do, either online or not) the ""trolls"" have done nothing illegal. 

2. Deleting the wiki. It was a wiki designed to say negative stuff about Sammy. That's what she and Sammy don't seem to have grasped. If they don't like it, fine. Don't go there.

3. Doesn't understand why there are people on the internet that troll her son. It's not like he makes it very difficult. With all of his quirks, illogic and the way he takes criticism and people trolling him, he is pretty much wearing a shirt that says ""Hey internet! Troll me please!""

4. Not do the proper thing and just monitor Sammy's internet usage. Seriously. He has attempted to get back to his YouTube channel TWICE after his parents initially took him down. This pretty much means that he doesn't really care what his parents say regarding his Youtube. Instead of eradicating all negative feedback aimed at Sammy, which is pretty much impossible, she should just do the right thing and explain to him why she doesn't want him on there and enforce it.  You know what I just realized? Sammy probably doesn't get punished by his parents very often because he has autism. Maybe they don't want him to feel bad or something. That would explain why they allow him to trash his stuff and keep going online... ","1388535296"

He picked up the slack, even though he told me how angry and a little jealous he was of me because him and his wife can't have a baby :( I felt bad.

I sent an email to my boss who said theres nothing they can do for me but come back that day to file some stuff.

If this is a residential circuit, it's possible the router they provided has a configuration option limiting the number of NAT (network address translation) connections per port.  Have you ever tried forwarding any other services?  I've never dealt with Uverse or their equipment, but have you contacted their support to see if they could offer any advice or explain why this happens?  (Unfortunately, residential ISP help desks are too frequently staffed by script monkeys who can't think critically when asked a technical question that deviates from their level 1 bozo books, so YMMV.)

None of the SOs in my play group play competitive magic. So, we tend to bribe them in to going to ""awesome locations"" that happen to have a GP or something.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt; On the gameplay front, let's go back to vigors for a second. I have one question - why are the vigors there? Plasmids in Bioshock (and, I assume, Bioshock 2, although I haven't played it) made sense because they were integrated with the story. We saw first-hand the powers that ADAM offered, and the effect that widespread plasmid use had on the citizens of Rapture. We saw Andrew Ryan compromise his own principles when Fontaine Futuristics began flooding the streets of Rapture with readily available plasmids. But the vigors don't serve that same purpose in Columbia. So the only reason they're available in Columbia is that Bioshock Infinite is a *shock game and therefore there need to be psi powers plasmids vigors.


Well, there is the gameplay reason for it and the story reason for it. Gameplaywise, yes, this is a Shock game and its become so iconic that certain things are expected from a Shock game. Storywise, weren't vigors created because of tears allowing them to look into other worlds (in this case, Rapture). Isn't this part of the whole *Infinite* part of the plot?

"apple","t5_2qh1f","If this were a consumer desktop, then, that would make sense. It's not a standard consumer desktop, though, it's a ""workstation"", and Apple's interpretation of that is an entirely novel concept this time around. 

Reason being, we haven't seen this before. Every consumer computer before this, with the exception of certain outliers in the 80s and 90s, has had the standard ""Motherboard I/O"" backbone. All your components would be plugged directly into or soldered onto the motherboard, making it the main point of failure.

This doesn't, which is actually pretty revolutionary. It means part replacement is actually modularized between function, rather than between components. 

In a traditional desktop, if your I/O panel goes, you replace the motherboard. If your connector goes, you replace the motherboard. If your logic chips go, you replace the motherboard. Essentially, any part that fails on the motherboard leads to a full motherboard replacement. 

On the Mac Pro, however, you've got some options. If the logic board fries, you replace the logic board. If a connector goes bad, you can replace the daughterboard. If your I/O panel goes, you can replace the I/O panel independently of anything else. Very little is built into the logic board, which makes the entire system more repairable than any standard desktop computer. And that's really something. 

To put it into perspective, there are Dell workstations less repairable than this. ","1388535308"

When the Warden asks her to break off the affair rather than jeopodise Duncan's career as husband of a felon she reacts by joining a jail-break that turns into a riot.

My point is that there are always outliers.

"badhistory","t5_2wo26","&gt;...but the Athenian idea of land owning being the barrier was almost entirely broken.

*Ahem.*

The primary barrier for Athenians was lineage, not land ownership. Yes, Solon did create ""grades"" of citizenship where agricultural production was the key to opening different levels of possible authority in the government, but note that the non-property owning class had voting rights, just not the rights to serve as officials, or to belong/vote to certain councils. I'd suggest the property requirements more Second Amendment than *Starship Troopers*, and more about military organization with a hint of the (nearly totally lost on us moderns) ancient feeling that STEM was wicked as compared with agriculture and husbandry - and I'd suggest it's that hint of an idea that's more important to Aristotle in discussing democracy that Jefferson picks up and runs with and imparts to the rest of the more Plutarch-loving Founding Fathers. Land ownership had more to do with what the ancients thought land ownership imparted to one's character rather than property itself. The non-landed and the dis-landed made up a voting block that would become increasingly critical to the fate of Athens.

If you're talking about a clear-cut point in time in Athens when only landowners had political power, it was pre-Solon and before most of the interesting things that you think about Athens happened, and not really representative of the messy nest of political bodies the Athenian government would become. Even then, I would suggest they would conceptualize it as Athens for the Athenians rather than about land ownership itself - notably, over time the property rules became less important while the citizenship rules became tighter.

And yes, I've wanted an opportunity to rant about this myself for quite some time.","1388535315"

"startrek","t5_2qixm","It's hard for me to sum it all up but there's a reviewer called [Sfdebris](http://sfdebris.com/) that points out all the crazy shit she does.

Here's what Chuck (sfdebris) has to say about her:

Janeway, Kathryn
Rank: Captain
Nickname: Captain Crunch
Place of origin: Indiana, Earth
Primary Responsibility: Devising convoluted rationalizations for really stupid and dangerous plans while vetoing any opposition
Psychological Disorder: Manic-depressive, delusions of grandeur, caffeine addiction

There are several points of view on the character of Captain Janeway and its acceptance by viewers of the program. One is such vehement hatred that it often turns into bashing of actress Kate Mulgrew, who plays her. I grant that she is naturally responsible for that voice (more accurately, I think a carton of Marlboro's a day are responsible), but for the most part some of these people go way too far. Kate Mulgrew doesn't do a bad job of acting on Voyager, she's just acting out the part of a character who's intolerable. Attacks on her are uncool; bring in the writers, producers, and directors if you're going that route.

On another end, you have Mulgrew herself, who stated in an interview that she believes that fanboys weren't ready to accept a female captain. I can't speak for the entire male populace, but as far as I'm concerned that's rubbish. I couldn't stand Neelix either, but it wasn't because I'm prejudiced against cast members of Benson (I quite like Odo, actually).

There's another group, like the Comic Book Guy, who find Janeway sexy. The less said about this, the better.

So, if it's not sexism, what is the reason for the loathing? Well, let's talk about the launch right out of the gate. Janeway was grating from the first moment. Picard was similar (coming off as a bit of a grouch), but Sisko was quite a pleasant individual in the first episode when it didn't involve Picard, and we knew why that was. But Janeway was micromanaging everything, and everything seemed tainted with smugness, even down to the insistance that she only be referred to as ""captain."" I've got no problem with her being captain, or even with wanting to always be called ""captain,"" (although it sounds pretty damn insecure when you think about it), but she seems to just relish the thought of reminding these two yahoos that she's the captain and they are a couple of peons she can send down to the lava planet to see if the situation is dangerous enough to warrant spacesuits. I practically expected her to get on the communicator and announce to the whole ship ""I'm the captain! MEEE!!! I hold your lives in my hands! My every whim is law, I'm the god, I'M THE GOD!!!"" But of course, we have to save that for future episodes.

But perhaps the best example of what was completely wrong with her the first episode would have to be the ending. That would be how they wound up stranded in the Delta Quadrant, when Janeway blew up the Caretaker's array that they could use to get home. The problems with this are numerous. First, as Tuvok points out, there's a little thing called the prime directive, which says that her interfering in the Kazon-Ocampan conflict that was emerging was a no-no. Second, she wasn't just stranding her crew, but Federation citizens who are not compelled to follow her orders and whom it's her job to protect (even if they are criminals). Perhaps if you spent more time at the casino you would be less inclined to gamble with the lives of anyone unfortunate enough to be on your ship. Third, hasn't anyone heard of a timer? Christ, if John Conner can get ahold of one, I'd frickin' hope that a brand new Federation starship would be able to find something like that.

Further confounding the mix is that Janeway is a Mary Sue. If you don't know, a Mary Sue is a character that exists as an idealized version of the writer. In this case, Janeway is not only captain, but she knows everything. And yet, of course, she's still a sensitive person because even though she verbally castrates every member of her crew, she confides privately of her devotion for every single one. Pardon me while I puke. Let's take a look at the second episode, Parallax. Tom Paris, being only a pilot and not schooled in advanced Starfleet bullshit dynamics, is completely torn down by Janeway when he offers to fly her to the bullshit crack in the event horizon. Granted his tone could be construed as a little smug, but she insists that only someone schooled in high-level quantum balderdash should make this trip, ""and unless you've been hiding your credentials, that's not you."" Paris must have been thinking: ""Gee thanks, you know my morale had dipped a bit finding out you stranded me out in the middle of nowhere cause you're too f**king stupid to use a fuse, but that de-balling just picked me right up. Why don't you just make me Neelix's assistant and complete my total humiliation."" However arrogant Paris might have seemed, Janeway comes across as having an ego that threatens to have an event horizon of its own.


One great thing to note throughout the series is that Janeway has all the moral empathy of a tarantula. What do you do if someone steals the lungs of your crewmember? Obviously you let them keep them, because it's wrong to take away someone's vital organs, even if they rightfully belong to someone else. Now, what do you do if they want to punish a member of your crew by having them relive being murdered constantly for the rest of their lives? Answer: Let them! You don't want to interfere. Now, if someone won't tell you what you want to know, what do you do? You risk killing the prisoner as you interrogate them, because they are clearly the evil ones, and you are morally righteous in what you do. And this woman had the gall to pass judgment on Capt. Ransom? Based on what I've seen of Janeway, I think she's developed the Prime Directive Mark II, which is ""We cannot interfere in internal affairs of other races, unless it will make our lives miserable.""

There are two running gags in Voyager. One is their limitless supply of shuttles, often remarked throughout the web. The other, which doesn't seemed to be noted much outside this website, is that Janeway loves to add people to the crew. She hands out comm badges to people like they were Tic Tacs, and apparently the only requirement to getting one is to fire on Voyager or be a certifiable nut. Getting a comm badge from Janeway is equivalent to having a dog pee around your house: it's a marking of territory, and probably shouldn't be taken as a compliment.

Here's another great example of Trek logic in action: if you were a science officer, you are automatically an expert on everything. Okay, I can see why she would be schooled in the science of made of Trek physics when it comes to black holes, but she also knows everything about engineering, biology, nanotechnology, and anything else you might come up with. She even assisted the Doctor in brain surgery! How many times does Picard take over Engineering? How many times does Archer take the helm? How many times did Kirk get into a fist fight.... okay, bad example. And Sisko? He was too busy changing his hair styles to do whatever the hell he used to do.

Janeway has her proponents, of course. I've no doubt some of them will be outraged by this description and will take the time to write and explain to me how wrong I am and how obviously threatened I must be by a woman in command. Let me just say this: I worked in a project run by a woman that required as long as twenty-hour work days, would go literally weeks without giving a day off (including weekends), and expected perfection from all of us. Yet she never, not once, pulled any of the kind of crap that Janeway would pull on her crew weekly. In fact, if Janeway was running our project I'm sure she would have been thrown out back and handed over to an angry mob while the police turn a blind eye. ""Do what I say"" is not leadership, especially when you're responsible for condemning your crew to exile, and if any of my bosses had ever done that to me, then no matter what their gender, I'd have kicked their ass when it got around to my turn in the ""kick the dumbass boss"" queue.

Captain Janeway is the only character we've seen past the ending of the final episode of Voyager. In any sane universe, she should have, at best, been formally reprimanded, and at worst imprisoned. Instead we find she has been promoted to the rank of admiral, and we actually see her order Jean-luc Picard to the Romulan homeworld. Janeway, who couldn't search for a group of terrorists without screwing it up, is ordering around a man who almost single-handedly prevented a Borg conquest of Earth, revealed the Bluegill conspiracy, and helped halt the Klingon Civil War. Janeway isn't worthy to order his ""Tea, Earl Grey, Hot"" from the replicator, nevermind his ship. If there were any justice in Trek, she would be confined to a mining colony with the important task of turning big rocks into small ones.

Similarly, if team A starts with the ball, drains clock and kicks a FG with 2 mins left Team B only has 2 minutes to score. They don't get too finish their drive of they still have the ball when the clock runs out.

&gt; How about if they ate the entire quarter and failed to score?  

In the regular season it would end in a tie.

&gt;What if a team only left a second on the clock?  Would the opponent have to score in that second? 

Yes, they would have to score in that one play. Not in a second but a dead ball ends the play, so they have one shot.

Also, electrical engineering is a good route.

You'll know how all the equipment in the studio works on a level everyone else in the studio wishes they did. 

The downside is a lack of time to pursue music projects and also there's a difference between knowing how something works and knowing how to use it. I'm never gonna get an Emmy or a grammy but I work with a lot of people who will.

I ended up getting out of school with my m.s. In electrical engineering and going to work for montana pbs. I make half as much money as my friends that went to work in aerospace or utilities, but a lot of the stuff I do at work is stuff I'd be paying to do otherwise.","1388535323"

* The value of bitcoin can fluctuate significantly. If this is a concern, you might want a plan to convert quickly or find another transfer route althogether.
* Anti-money laundering laws can be very onerous for large sums, especially in the US. Bitcoin exchanges must abide by these regulations, which means it could be some time before you can actually convert back into dollars.
* Fees for moving money out of and then into local currency via bitcoin can vary quite a bit, and exchange rates themselves are not always in agreement. Shop around before pulling the trigger.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I've been taking lessons for almost a year now and it's amazing! Pole is absolutely a fitness sport and a performance art.

Some people start off for the wrong reasons or have preconceptions - but you quickly discover the good ways to enjoy it, learn to build confidence, and find self-happiness just like you would with any other type of dance you truly enjoy.

The two main concerns I've heard from women are (1) their body type not working well with the dance, and (2) the clothing. Neither of these should be concerns.

1) The moves are beautiful and can be done by women of all shapes and sizes, and part of the fun is how one person accentuates a move differently than another and vice versa.

2) If skimpy clothing is a concern, start off with pole spins and floor work. You can do most of these fully clothed. Once you transition into inversions, climbs, and aerial work, skin contact with the pole is what keeps you stuck to it, not strength. It is extremely unsafe to do this type of stuff without exposed thighs, arms, and sometimes tummy. But again - of you don't feel comfortable with that, there are sooooo many spins :)

I really suggest finding a studio I train with. They'll show you safe ways to perform the moves. And even better, they'll provide a community of people who become your friends, understand what pole is, and be a good outlet to build and share your dance.

To anyone who gives it a try, have fun! :)

To anyone who knows someone who poles, we would love your support in recognizing it as fitness and performance art! Just like ballet, tap, Irish, or breakdancing, there's a lot of training, strength, and practice involved, and we're really trying to distinguish  our work from other uses of poles.

You have a *different* approach to viewing the world, but it doesn't take away from the validity of any other sciences just because yours is a ""hard science"". This is just showing that you feel more superior, when the only barely distinguishable difference is that ""hard science"" is just more directly observable.

Again, it doesn't mean that everyone who didn't study your field is just talking bullshit. We also uphold rigorous, empirical standard and look to (dis)confirm what we know to practice better. We don't JUST look at simulations in a lab, but also *have demonstrated effectiveness in actual companies*. I do have the backing for it, but you're arguing on such a rhetorical level that citing my source wouldn't do anything anyways.

Just like I've succinctly argued how your views and advice doesn't work most of the time anyways, for very good reasons.

I personally don't think it's an innate quality though.  It's just an illusion, always conjured up in retrospect, used to explain people acting on motivations that others don't understand, or don't find as powerful.  The things that appear to require the most ""self-discipline"" are simply the things that involve to very strong and very conflicting motivations.  

I think it's an outmoded overly simplistic model of the actually complex and competing factors that motivate a human.  And it's outmoded because awareness of the concept fails time and time again to actually help people manage their behavior.  What's the point of a model that doesn't help us better understand and manipulate the universe?

When you think about it, how much more useless and unactionable could the advice ""you need more self-discipline"" possibly be?","1388535332"

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","&gt; A lowbie leveling wand unique shouldn't cost 30X as much as the weapon based equivalent, in a balanced market.

This is a misunderstanding.

There ISN'T a weapon based equivalent of a caster unique.

Caster uniques are often never replaced until late merciless or even early map stage.

&gt; You never really replace it because there aren't any other caster uniques to replace it with. This just goes to show how sorry the state is for caster weapons.

You never replace it because it's good compared to rares until the high 60s when spell damage would beat out a +1.

&gt; And spell mana costs scale a lot faster than attack based skills, so casters need to constantly increase their mana pool or take nodes to mitigate the mana costs, while attack skill gems can often be left at low level to keep mana cost at a minimum- it's a double edged sword, it's not like the gem level damage scaling of spells is a purely good thing.

So what you're saying is that attack based builds don't get massive amounts of attack speed, and have support gems with much higher mana multipliers, eventually ending in higher mana/second costs than spells?

Let's look at Frenzy. It's usual supports are Multistrike, Blood Magic, Faster Attacks, Melee Splash, and Melee Phys.

The gem starts at 15 and goes up to 18 mana, and gains a LOT per level.

18 * 1.8 for Multistrike, 1.96 for Blood Magic, 1.15 for Faster Attacks, 1.6 for Melee Splash, and 1.4 for Melee Phys, After everything this is 163 health per cast. With over 3 casts per second, your health/second costs are near 500/second.

The most costly spell that gets spam cast is Freeze Pulse. With a base cast time of .65, and a mana cost of 23, it has a base cost per second of 35/s

With the standard 6L Of Freeze Pulse, GMP, Added Chaos, Cold Pen, Life Leech, and Faster Casting, you would have a mana cost/s of 360~ You'd need huge amounts of cast speed to get your mana per second anywhere near that of most melee builds.","1388535333"

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","Volume's an option if you have the headroom, do be careful with that though. If you are already sidechaining, some careful low-end eqing on everything in the low end may be of help. That includes cutting some unnecessary frequencies from the kick. Sometimes around 500-1000hz is a good start.    Just as well, eq the parts that are around 40-200hz on other instruments (not the kick)  to make more kick room. If it needs to be there, keep it or reduce it. if it doesn't need to be there, high pass it. 

Parallel compression is another good option, create a send channel, send the kicks(and snares if you like) to it, compress the everloving piss out of it, and keep it at a lower volume to apply more body to the kick. Of course, apply to taste.

 try using free plugins like FerricTDS for some saturation as well, you can get a little more efficiency out of your volume that way. ","1388535334"

&gt; ‘If you worry about such things, and I do, then I specifically said John Hurt’s Doctor doesn’t use the title. [Matt Smith's Doctor] is in his 12th body but he’s the 11th Doctor, however there is no such character as the 11th Doctor – he’s just the Doctor – that’s what he calls himself.’

So really, none of them are the Xth Doctor, that's what *we* call them.  And we call Hurt the War Doctor, but that's still just our name for them.  So technically they all just call themselves Doctor - but Hurt's character didn't.  Therefore we can call him the War Doctor for clarity's sake (or 8.5), but *he* didn't consider himself ""the Doctor"" - the next regeneration to do so was Eccleston's, thus becoming the 9th person to call himself ""the Doctor.""

Edit: Just watched ""The Lodger"" and the Doctor refers to himself - more specifically, his face - as ""Eleventh."" So hmm. ","1388535334"

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","&gt; Racial fetish is also different than other types of kinks because it’s not just about a self-chosen lifestyle (S&amp;M, for example), a self-determined action (thanks for making Golden Shower well-known, R. Kelly), or sexualizing a body part (feet fetishism seems pretty prominent). Yellow/Jungle/Salsa/Curry Fevers are about exotification of groups of people based on a part of their identity that they have no control over.

While it's true that racial fetishes are different because they involve  personality assumptions, it's not completely different from body fetishes. A lot of people have no control over body parts that are fetishized by other people. Women with large breasts can probably sympathize, since that's a common fetish. ""Does he really like me for ME, or just for my boobs?"" 

In fact, it's really nice when someone you're physically attracted to (whether due to a fetish or just a general crush) is compatible with you on a deeper level. The attraction gets you in the door; the connection keeps you there. The difference is that a racist partner may never get to that deeper connection, because his mindset prevents him from seeing his partner as a real person. Either she fulfills his stereotype and he has no reason to connect with her on a deeper level, or (more likely) she shatters his perception in some way and he ditches her, assuming she's not ""one of the good ones"".

In that way, I think it's possible to have a fetish for the individual or collective physical characteristics of a race, and if it doesn't go deeper than that, it's fine. The problem is when the fetish includes assumptions about personality.","1388535335"

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","The ""storage of magic"" you're talking about is generally called ""mana"", at least in video games/RPGs/Magic the Gathering. (You don't have to use that name, just thought you should know.)

I think part of the key to this lies in awareness magic. You're gonna have to work out what that does to inanimate objects. Perhaps it gives them ""awareness"" as well? Or, rather than changing the object's size, it changes its nature: transforming it into energy, for example, or changing its state (ice/water/steam).

Are these three types of magic three ""schools"" with many spells, or the only three ""spells"" in existence?

How are talismans created?

Everything you've described so far is ""casting"" magic. Does potionmaking/alchemy also exist?

Is magic/mana generated by all living things, all animals, all humans, just some humans? Or, perhaps, just some humans, but some animals or other things can generate it as well?

How is it generated? Is aided along by certain processes, like exercising producing strength and meditation producing awareness, or is it purely temporal, where it will regenerate at a constant rate no matter what?

How specific can you be when casting magic? Using strength as an example, must I cast it on my entire body at once? Or could I just cast it on my arm? Perhaps just on the bone and muscle? What happens if I cast it on my blood or my brain or my unmentionables? (Come on, you know someone in your world has at least *tried* that.)

Are the effects of it temporary, or permanent? If temporary, how temporary? Just while the spell is being cast? For a few hours afterwards? Days? Years?

When you use ""strength"" magic on an object, that makes it bigger. Does that mean the individual particles get beefed up, or does the object gain more particles? In either case, where does the extra stuff come from? Does it take mass from the air/water/whatever around it, or create more out of nothingness?

That's all for now, I might come up with more later.","1388535339"

Agreed.

For the most part, yes.

&gt; In the long term, only education would work. The problem is that miseducation and a cultural identity formed on the wrong bases is the issue. Those are pretty tough to fight against unless you get control of the government or real power.

I agree fully. Issues are further complicated by the fact that first world, secular educated students are going on to have jobs in ever more technical fields, and new fields are being created every day. That leaves these unfortunate people so far behind that there's no catching up.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I joined a fraternity in 2005 and saw the ""hazing"" get easier and easier. My frat was pretty mild as there were consistently issues on campus. There were always rumors about bad things that would happen but from what I can remember it wasn't THAT bad, just took up a lot of time and most of the hazing was getting yelled at and cleaning the house. I was the last pledge class where the brothers were allowed to completely trash the common room, trash cans overturned, food everywhere, condiments on the wall. This happened twice and we had to make the room spotless before we could go home. The first time someone peed in a cup and left it in the middle of the floor, the second time someone pooped on a plate.

I didn't see much of it as hazing, just a lot of cleaning and getting yelled at. We did some pretty awesome stuff though, like playing ultimate frisbee at 5 a.m. instead of the usual jogging around campus and towards the end of pledgeship we were blindfolded and driven to a very secluded cave about 45 minutes outside the city. Upon arrival we were un-blindfolded and got to explore the cave together, so awesome. Some of the people I pledged and lived with at the fraternity are still my best friends today

"aww","t5_2qh1o","Wow, I'm really sorry to hear that. Your case is worse than mine for sure. I've had a few sores over the years but nothing as bad as that.  And I know what you mean about the eye flare ups. I also have really bad allergies with my eyes and also stress out when they act up. And this all started about when I was 18 as well, lol.

Avastin is (I think) breast cancer medication that I got injected into my eye over the past few years. It's helped but holycrap it scares the hell out of me. And hurts. BUT! it's experimental and my doctor seems to think its the greatest thing ever so on the bright side there is still a lot of progress being made in this area. Which helps me (and hopefully you) worry less about future complications.

it does not need to get into center of the earth. It just needs to get to the water. Fukushima is build on sea shore. Underground waters are just few meters deep.

It would not help you to run into mountains because higher you are the more radiation it is in the air. Air is transferring radioactive particles.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","&gt; Quite the opposite - it was to attempt to illustrate how much we have in common currently, particularly with regards to the parade of pied pipers - folks that have swept up the scene with NFL-sized aspirations, only to erase years of progress.

Thanks for the awesome response.  But this was exactly my point.  Paulson isn't a pied piper, and noone is following him.  His success or failure need not/will not add to or erase ""years of progress"" or whatever such notion.  Because chess is not in building mode.  Chess is here.  If he succeeds in monetizing something he'll likely benefit himself, and chess fans, and sponsors.  If he doesn't, somebody else will.  It's a non issue.  

The specific numbers probably aren't an issue, but I think ""quite large"" is not quite doing it justice... it's nearly indisputable that chess is a ""larger"" population.  Also it's nearly completely global - which is quite rare in the world of sport.  

I anticipated I'd start a shitstorm, but not a response from the author - thanks very much!

If you're leveling dexterity (or other stats your weapon scales with, eg strength for the club or strength and dex for the zweihander), then the standard path (+5/+10/+15) will outdamage elemental weapons. This is especially true against tougher enemies, because of the way defense works in Dark Souls. It's a logarithmic curve, but the important part is that it's not a straight % reduction. A weapon that deals 250 physical and 250 lightning damage might end up doing 100 of each for 200 total damage, where a weapon with 450 damage might end up doing a straight 250 damage.

With the normal upgrade route, the vast majority of weapons will scale up their damage with your stats, while the fire, lightning, and chaos paths remove scaling entirely. Elemental weapons do good damage early on, but they're pretty bad on NG+ and in the DLC.

So go ahead and level dex since you want a dex build, and add in end and vit to taste. For end, you really want to be fastrolling with your preferred setup, though midroll isn't terrible. Do keep in mind end also affects stamina until you get 40 in the stat, so it's good to have a decent reserve so things don't break your guard or leave you too tired to roll. For vit, that's absolutely your call. I finished my first playthrough using the great scythe with 9 vit because I figured anything that could oneshot me had a big enough windup where I deserved it.","1388535357"

Which ultimately, loses Blizzard money as those people will get better and be less inclined to purchase Arena Tickets as they will be winning more in Arena, ergo, more gold, and thus less need to spend money on tickets.

My dad is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, he is on his third marriage. I have at times in my life also been an emotionally abusive alcoholic, but with alanon, aa, and other self help I've managed to sober up and build a happy life and marriage with my husband.

There is no one on Earth I would have stopped drinking for. Other than my dad and that childhood trauma, my bf died when I was 19, many other friends died or killed themselves in my early twenties, and I coped by drinking and being a shitty person.

It wasn't that no one loved me enough to help me, it was just that I didn't love myself enough to ask for help.

He may really love you, but you cannot compete with alcohol. Trust me, I thought my dad loved me more than alcohol and now that I'm working on year 2 of no contact (because he won't get help or stop drinking) I know that this just isn't true. It hurts, it hurts like all hell, but the only thing I can do about it is love myself, love my husband, and try to live the best life I can.

I have a standing agreement with my dad. If he's 90 days sober or actively in therapy we can at least talk about what's happened. Without that there's no point because drunk brain will always outweigh sober brain and drunk brain lies and tells you alcohol is your only friend/loved one who will always be there when everyone else leaves (the dirty bitch never mentions that she's the reason everyone is leaving, but we all have to learn that in our own time).

Good luck to you! Looking back I see how much my dad's drinking affected his first wife, my mom, and my stepmom, not to mention me, my sister, and my sister's kids. Try to separate your life from alcoholics unless you just really have no interest in having a happy, healthy, satisfying life.","1388535361"

All RES does is append an IMG tag, the same HTML tag that imgur or any other site would put on the page, to display an image.

NOTHING is done differently.

Now, if imgur (or any other site) is purposefully throttling traffic to 'hotlinked' sites, where the referer site doesn't equal their own domain name, then maybe you're seeing something real - but it would have nothing at all to do with RES and would be the case if you hotlinked their image from any other site on the internet, also.

2) Yes, actually it does make the guy a rapist, and if you think that makes the dude a ""normal guy"", it means YOU'RE probably a rapist and I want nothing to do with you.  I know a lot of normal guys who do respect a ""holy shit stop please put a condom on"" and would find the bf to be a total shithead for not doing that in this situation.

3) If I steal something once, that makes me a thief.  Similarly, if a person rapes somebody once, that makes them a rapist, aka a person that has committed a rape.  It doesn't matter that this might have been a one-off instance of sexual assault, *he still sexually assaulted his girlfriend*.  If he wants to stop being a rapist, he needs to stop assaulting people.  It's pretty fuckin' simple.

4) Holy shit the fact you think assaulting people is normal is scary as hell.  Please don't ever talk to me again, you unbelievable creep.

I tried to argue that `map` should be presented *before* queue/workers. My reasoning is that understanding how a single `map` call works is a lot easier than reasoning about the state of a queue and a worker pool. 

Once they understand map, I think it's an easy enough leap to explain how the work of one function can be divided across multiple processors. They don't need to know how to manage a pool or understand how to use a sentinel to shut them down. The picture of a couple of CPUs grabbing elements from the map tends to be a good enough heuristic to get the idea of what's going on under the hood. If that doesn't do it, opening a process monitor and running some benchmarks usually does. 

When they need more control, *then* I think it makes sense to introduce Queues and workers. I think the Queue comes with a lot of caveats that we more experienced people take for granted. An infinitely blocking queue was the bane of my existence when I started with Python. 

So, there's my view!

You pick an appropriate skill for the task.  Lets say it's ""Jumping a river."" So Athletics, and the river is 2 successes to jump (somewhat tough).  You then pick what sort of task it is.  Jumping a river is a Strength task, in your judgment, so they roll ""Strength+Athletics.""  8 or better is a success.  If they get 2, they make it.  1 they might be holding on to the edge of the bank, and need another check to pull themselves up.  0?  In the river.  

As to why they're separate, lets say you're trying to teach someone how to jump a river.  That might be Manipulation+Athletics - Manipulation to communicate, Athletics because you need to know yourself.

If you want to know the best position to jump a river?  Well if someone is bearing down on you and you only have a few seconds, wits+athletics to figure out where the best point is.

"scuba","t5_2qhii","I own a razor, SMS50, nomad, and Manta. I have owned SMS100, Armadillo, and several home made rigs. 

Sidemount is a tool, like doubles or a rebreather. Pick the right tool for the job. 

Sms50 is my harness for cave diving in a drysuit with steel cylinders. 

http://i.imgur.com/GIN4GEy.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/KynajOC.jpg

Razor is my harness for cave diving wet with aluminum cylinders (I do not have the new wing for it, only the MSR system used in years past)

Nomad is my rig for cave diving wet with steel cylinders. It is an older model. The new wings are larger and super fabric. I am trying to get them to develop a 35lb lift version.

http://i.imgur.com/6I7i2YY.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/AsbIa4N.jpg

Manta is my newest rig and will likely replace my nomad for diving in wetsuit with steels. 

http://i.imgur.com/Cn1z9RW.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/UZoJoal.jpg

All of the rigs I own are heavily modified and barely resemble their stock counter parts. As a result my nomad is called ""Normadillo"" as it is a marriage of an armadillo butt plate to nomad wing/ transpac. The manta is ""Manta Lt50) as it is parts from a sms50, Nomad LT, and manta system. SMS50 is a Franken-harness too but I don't have a cool name for it. 

There is not one rig, off the shelf, that works for every situation. Razor comes close, very close, and is the unit I typically recommend. The ""stealth"" is similar and a good alternative. 

If I wanted a rig that was off the shelf, with a butt plate, and extremely universal design it would be the armadillo. Very good piece of kit and can be mounted to a rebreather. 

Sms50 has very little lift. Built in trim pockets are nice, and the butt plate is my favorite among every rig I know of. 

The sms100 is the worst unit I have seen or dove. At least one instructor really pushed it for a while, with modification, and I think it was because of marketing and profit margin. I have friends who dive it and modified the thing CONSIDERABLY. from the factory it's basically worthless. 

Dive rite products are constantly in evolution. They change the nomad at least twice a year. The wing is super fabric, as is the manta, and it's very durable. It seems like their products are being made a little cheaper these days but in many cases they have gotten better. All the cheap looking features are things I remove anyway like pads. 

The moral of the story is that there isn't a rig on the market I am 100% happy with. I change them all, a lot. Sewing, grommets, etc. warranty is voided immediately and changes could inhibit functionality but I accept that risk. 

If I was shopping for a sidemount harness today it would be in this order: 

1- Razor (with new wing)
2- armadillo
3- stealth
4- nomad LT cave
4.5- manta
5- SMS50
6- nomad JT (discontinued)
7- nomad XT
8- halcyon
9- oxycheq recon
9.5- Scubapro 
10- converting a jacket BC into a sidemount harness
11- SMS100
12- using a backplate and wing for sidemount (never ever do that for cave diving) 

(Obviously I am leaving out some for lack of memory or they are rare still) 

Remember, sidemount is a tool and not every rig is good for every type of diving. 

They can all work from a boat, my razor works perfect for that and is my preference. Most work in caves cause that is what they were designed for. ","1388535385"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A lot of people have made great points about the supply and demand in this situation, but I think one thing that doesn't get enough attention is that the living wage isn't just this magic number that works for everyone. For a start off, it depends on location (ie living wage in New York vs small town America). In addition, it depends on your family situation. For example, living wage for a 16 year old fully supported by their parents is essentially $0 (they can survive and live well with basically no income if they have to, as most teens in this situation are working to have money for wants rather than needs). On the other hand, a single mother with 3 children will have a higher living wage. Finally, the definition of what is necessary to own to be living well differs. For example, some people might consider a car to be necessary, while others can make do walking or with public transport.

This may not be directly applicable to your situation. But hopefully it helps explain that part of the problem of arguing for a living wage is that a number doesn't really exist. Obviously I'm not sure of the specifics of your living situation, but The only possible way to make sure everyone has a living wage would be for companies to analyze each person's situation and come up with a number, which clearly wouldn't be fair because you don't want people earning different wages at the same company for the same job. There's really no point arguing for a living wage.","1388535387"

I will make sure you get you Christmas list if you leave out all your nappies for me to take because the elves have all had new babies and i need spares."". Brother accepted this proposal and excitedly put out all his cloth nappies on xmas eve.  

The next morning nappies were gone and toys were there. He asked once. Mum said, ""sorry they are in the North Pole now."" he gave up instantly realising the futility. 

You could always say, santa came by and notices your paci and has sent a letter to say he is going to make a super special trip back JUST for you. because rudoplh has been having bad dreams and needs it, because santa had such a big trip he NEEDS rest for a few months and in return he will leave an extra special toy made just for big boys.

**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted

The full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers"" is inappropriate. However, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos"" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).
5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.
6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).

**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it.

Your best bet might be to locate and reverse engineer the ""virus"" to find where the commands are coming from or gather IP address info from their social media but odds are anybody sophisticated and stupid enough enough to build a botnet capable of this kind of damage is not going to make themselves an easy target.

No.  The duck people aren't involved in hate speech, and the people who think they are need to grow the hell up and realize that people not understanding or even disliking their lifestyle is not hate speech.  This woman was involved in real hate, a hate so strong for the political right that she would use a former politician's adopted children or grandchildren to attack them even after they no longer hold any political power.

Let's say they are currently facing the choice to sell 100 units at $1 profit each or 50 units at $1.75 each. Clearly they will sell at the lower price point and net $100 (versus $87.5). 

Now increase the cost of labor by $.50. Now the choice is 100 at $.50 or 50 at $1.25. Now they will make $50 versus $62.50, so it makes sense for them to raise prices.

Compare him to a more popular choice - Orianna. No matter how far behind orianna is, say you're 0/15 and 0 cs, you can still catch the team out with a good shockwave to initiate for your team. You can still shield whoever is being focused, you can still apply an aoe slow. You still have choices.

If Morde is 0/15 0 cs he doesn't provide those choices to the team.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Obviously there are exceptions. You could be a great surgeon even if you discarded Germ Theory but happened to get lucky or left all the ""sterilization nonsense"" to your assistants. But I wouldn't want that guy operating on me.

Medicine is applied biology, and to quote a cleric who was actually arguing for theistic evolution ""*Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution*"" (Dobzhansky). For someone to be willfully ignorant of a pillar of their entire field presents all sorts of unforseen dangers.

Consider Dr. Leonard Bailey a surgeon from Loma Linda who is infamous for his role in the Baby Fae case. He transplanted a baboon heart in attempts to save her from hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The heart was of course rejected and she died rather quickly (they didn't even match the blood types because it is rare for baboons to have type O blood). When asked why he didn't use the heart of an ape more closely related, such as a chimpanzee or orangutan, he specifically stated that he disputes evolution and said that no apes are ""closely related"" to man because man and apes were created separately by God. Instead he chose based on size alone, and indeed the infant baboon's heart is more similar in size to an infant's heart. Still, one would assume that if the guy had a 9th grade understanding of evolution he wouldn't have tried something so absurd when the Norwood procedure gives infants a 70% chance of reaching adulthood.

I bring this up because it is easy for someone to think that so long as their physician accepts ""microevolution"" with regards to pathogens, everything is mostly alright. This is not the case, as evolution is the pillar upon which all modern biology is built, and anyone disregarding it has an incomplete understanding of all biological systems, including us.
___

Moreover, the entire point of this thread was the collective lamentation of the intentional miseducation of children whose teachers were corrupted by superstition. A physician who rejects evolution is a perfect example of this taken to the extreme. Why are we trying to make excuses for this most heinous of pedagogical sins???

This is part of the picture. The other is there is one story: Income Disparity. The concept of income mobility is inconvenient to this one-dimensional narrative. 

People want to be pissed about this. They do not want to know anything about people getting out of minimum wage jobs.

Face it. Your existence is inconvenient. That people can *move out of minimum wage jobs*, and especially, *that they continue to do so* is why you only get income disparity data. Income mobility data has ZERO demand, for a variety of reasons. Truth is, you need both sets of data to understand what's going on -- good or bad. 

And that is far too complicated for ELI5 America. 

To be legitimately pissed off, the narrative requires you to be *permanently, inexorably trapped at minimum wage.* ","1388535431"

You raise some good points, but even though (most of) the music is more about movement and feeling rather than intellectual content, why shouldn't we want to have in-depth discussions about the people who make it and consume it?

Art is rarely pragmatic.  But i think there is an argument to be made for the idea that music (of any kind) can actually change and affect people in ways that ultimately impact society at large.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I honestly think that they're both very different in terms of development style. Web dev (front-end, as in HTML/CSS/JS) is all about the Document Object Model (DOM) and native programming has no web view (unless you request one to display a web page, PDF, etc). The similarities between the two lie in Object Oriented Programming — but there's not much more than that, in my opinion.

I do believe certain skills will and can cross over. MVC patterns tend to be the same, even in different languages. Using objects (JSON via rest) is similar (native side you may have to serialize/deserialize). Understanding XYZ coordinate systems is a lot like absolute positioning in CSS. 

So in my opinion, it's not too ambitious, but don't be surprised if you get your wires crossed! Learning Java and JavaScript will help your marketability undoubtedly—I know guys who write their own REST in Java and catch it on the JS side, and they are highly valued in the market for being able to cross the stack.

Also—Appcelerator supports Tizen and HTML5 apps, but I can't vouch for them as I've never worked on either via Appcelerator.","1388535432"

""GJ has been inconsistent at times, but usually it's been in one phase of his game OR the other, but rarely both, especially for such an extended period of time. For me, this doesn't come down to a lack of competition at RB, misunderstanding of his role, tiredness, or disinterest.""

""Johnson appears to me to be suffering the after-effects of an untreated head injury. The degree of logginess we've seen of him over the last seven matches is very similar to what I've observed for decades here in the States throughout the NFL. It's clear that there isn't anything mechanically wrong with him. He doesn't appear hobbled or to be favoring any part of his body. The problems are with speed of thought, reaction time, and general game intelligence. Even an undiagnosed low-grade concussion can have this kind of impact.""

""The way he's held the ball in the attacking third near the top of the 18' and he just sort of stands there as if ruminating what to do, that's new. Even on his worst days in the past he would at least try to protect the ball, but of late he's simply been at a loss (much of the time) to do even the basics. Slowness of thought, a fatigued look about his play, confusion, these are all part of the diagnosis. He should be asked about his sleeping patterns, headaches, nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, tiredness, as these are common symptoms.""

""Keep in mind that it doesn't take much to injure the brain. A slight knock from an unusual angle, an awkward tumble, a slip on a banana peel can all produce symptoms. It could also be a recurrence or exacerbation of a previous injury. Many people think that head injury is necessarily the result of hard and/or repeated blows to the head but this is scientifically not the case at all. Also, head injury does not mean a person is non-functional all the time. A person can drift between periods of clarity and periods of malaise or confusion. It's not all or nothing.""","1388535434"

The past Chechen wars were instigated by The Chechen State until Russia had no choice, but to march and put the boot to them. They kept fucking with Dagastan and the surrounding regions. Perhaps you need to learn some history.
I don't want to see Russia march into these Regions and kill people. I would love to see Russia put every person in the entire region under house arrest. Do a sweep and clear of house and building. If you are found with weapons you are now going to spend the x amount of your life swinging a pick axe in the frozen wastelands of Siberia.
No one is saying. ""Go in and murder a bunch of White Chechen's. I support the FSB doing NSA type actions in Chechen regions. If there was similar shit going down in Canada I would be banging on the Prime Minister door demanding he fucking do something. The last time we had shit going down here in Canada the Prime Minister enforced martial law in Quebec. Send in the fucking Army. Round these cunts up and lock them away for the rest of their natural lives.
That is not Liberal, Conservative, Left, Right, Up or Down. It is simple reality.""

Do me a favor.  Point to anywhere in that statement that justify Russia actions in Chechnya in terms of mass killings.  I already said that i agree with NSA type surveillance in a situation that demands it.  ie Canadas Quebec terrorist group kidnapping diplomats.

That is not mass murder and killing of innocents.  The USA dropping missiles on terrorists hunkered down and Russia mowing down Chechens are two different things.  Do not pretend other wise and do not put words in my mouth.

The FSB monitoring a region because it is HIGHLY prone to terrorist activity and the NSA monitoring the entire fucking internet and back dooring every device ever made are two completely different things and of different scale.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I understand and agree completely. I went to college for welding and got an associates degree in Applied Science. This is after serving three years in the US Army Infantry and fucking up my knee. About the time I graduated, I found out the surgery the VA did to fix my knee had been botched and my doctor told me if I took a job I wanted in pipeline welding, I would need a knee replacement every five years. Those jobs started out at $40/hr and went up from there. I opted to get a job in the financial industry paying much less (but still able to support my family) but involving almost no physical labor because then I wouldn't have to have surgeries every five years. I am no stranger to physically demanding jobs, and I would actually prefer something more demanding than the job I have now, but it's not in the cards for me at the moment.

Over its 25 years of existence, the great majority of its forecasts have proven to be underestimates.

The overestimation of Himalayan glacier melt in AR4 was a rare and very isolated exception due to insufficient monitoring stations in restricted military zones in the Himalayas.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt; Can you please ELI5 the difference between a ""anarcho-communist"" and a ""common"" communist?

I don't think there's such a thing as a ""common"" communist. Communism is a broad movement encompassing many schools of thought. What sets anarchist communists apart from the other schools is our rejection of a transitory stage of revolution wherein the working class seizes control of the state apparatus as a step toward communism. So, achieving communism without the help of the state.

&gt; You say you imagine the production of notebooks cooperatively. Do you mean today it isn't done cooperatively? Who forces Samsung to sell their SSDs to Apple?

What I mean is, production can occur without the capitalist. There is absolutely no reason to have an absentee owner collecting a passive income from the production process. Everything functions perfectly well without them.

&gt; Who is employing people in your desired society when it's not allowed to ""collect the income produced by others labor""?

There are no employers or employees. There are laborers, and they manage themselves.

&gt; Are you sure you aren't a ""standard"" marxist?

""Marxist"" is a loaded term because it can refer to various philosophies, ideologies, movements, etc. I have studied Marx's work and consider it to be valuable. But I am not a staunch ""follower"" of any philosopher.

&gt; What has all this communist logic to do with anarchism and the absence of a ruler?

As I said, there are several schools of thought within anarchism. The ""anarchist"" part of it is what you said: an opposition to rulers, a movement to identify and challenge hierarchical systems, institutions and relationships.

What differentiates the schools of thought is the ""instead"" part. That is, if we tear down this institution because it is hierarchical, what do you propose instead? That is where the communist part comes in. It is my personal outlook and preference and represents a very large current within the anarchist movement, but it by no means speaks for all anarchists.

Muslims are offsprings of Ismael, Isaac's brother, son of Abraham. He was the very first son of Abraham (before Isaac), born from Sarah's slave since Sarah (Abraham's wife) repeteadly failed to become pregnant. But after Ismael was born Sarah became jealous of his mother (her slave) and forced Abraham to expel them and the young Ismael from their ""tribe"", into the desert. Ismael will then become the founding father of the Arab people by settling to the south (Arab peninsula). Meanwhile Sarah managed to get pregnant and Isaac was born.

"ashtanga","t5_2wacy","I don't think the author feels the way in the quote but rather uses that as an example of a common Ashtanga mindset.  Later on he says this:

&gt; The universal learning process is ironic: a beginner is often needing extra help and support to learn the tradition, and in many cases variations outside of the tradition. An intermediate level practitioner (I use that term here generically rather than to indicate the Intermediate Series) is best served focusing on the tradition, becoming absorbed in it and surrendering to its processes and structures. An advanced level practitioner must go back to “beginners mind” and abandon the tradition and technique in order to open up and expand into his or her true potential.

I do agree with Matthew Sweeney's thinking and I'm finding with my practice I'm be coming more gentle my approach and outlook.  From simple little things like taking extra breaths, using props.  I would classify myself as a beginner as I've only been practicing 1.5 years and have gone through a couple injuries that has made it necessary to decrease my practice.  With my last injury I stopped practicing for nearly 5 months.  I've just started again but can't do any weight bearing poses on my shoulders like downdog or chaturanga.  It makes the vinyasa part quite difficult. 

I read a statement to the effect that there is a time in your practice lifetime for an external driven practice (a set sequence like Ashtanga) and a time for an internal driven practice. (where you decide what your body needs).  Both have valuable aspects and lessons.","1388535444"

The issue I'm raising is that the dungeon systems (2/1/1) force every jobs to be similar and interchangeable since you can't expect people to switch at any time.

This would further be suggested if the tests were not random. If I knew I was taking a drug test on Monday, I'd lay off the drugs for the time being or not bother picking up my check.

A theory is pretty worthless without any evidence whatsoever.** In this case though, there are Air Force officers who are saying it happened. Granted, that's not strong evidence, but it puts it way ahead of a lot of the claims made.

My issue is with people trolling /r/conspiracy with these ridiculous comments. They are in the wrong subreddit. The discussions about the evidence of any particular theory is basically what /r/conspiracy is for. The part I bolded looks out of place because that's not what I'm talking about. Not sure why you threw that in there.

&gt;A lot of other claims are made with absolutely no substantive backing. Look at any of the recent false flag claims or the ISON thing for examples. Without any evidence whatsoever it approaches ""known truths.""

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","What you said about making a note of the time of your faps and what happened is what I've been doing! :D

I couldn't do the 90 day NoFap challenge as for personal reasons I'm stuck indoors for the vast majority of my time and it's just ridiculous to overcome the urges when you can't go out with friends or whatever so I've changed to doing as little fapping as I possibly can, not judging myself when I fail, and making my goal to go at least 4 days between each fap.

I believe it makes the whole process less daunting and in the past 52 days I've fapped about 65 times less than usual.I think it should also make the 90 day NoFap challenge much easier as I'll be part-way rewired.

I think the most important thing is to not be hard on yourself, and certainly get a hard-on, yourself.

Making fapping a forbidden fruit only makes this process harder.

I just want to gain some confidence and ability to attract girls then have sex karezza-style and I think that'll allow non-orgasmic sex indefinitely.

Best overall whisky: Aberlour 12 NCF

Yes, private single barrels from esteemed distilleries are going to be awesome. Any BTAC, no matter how red-headed, is going to be awesome. Jim McEwan hasn't made a whisky I've hated yet.

But that 12 year old knocked my socks off. I couldn't be happier with it. It's my go-to when I need a bottle to bring to a party, or when I want to share a good dram with someone that isn't ""in to"" whisky and I don't want to waste $150+ bottles on them.

For example: Most people I am friends with baring a few are suffering. If they get sick they refuse to go to a doctor even if its something fairly bad. They tough it out as much as possible. Very few people I know make very much money but almost all of them work very hard. A lot of them have been to college and haven't been able to find work.

Most recent thing that really got me angry: My girlfriend has a minimum wage job that, pays no benefits, no health insurance. It is the best she is able to find even though she is very smart and capable of doing much more. She had to call in sick one day and they started telling her she needs a doctors note. She never missed a single day of work in the entire year she has been there and she never called in sick before she is always on time and she works very hard.

Since temps dropped below 70degrees (i'm a wimp) i've started taking spin for first time EVER (actually, that's a lie, i did it once like 15yrs ago but walked out of the class 15min in because it was too hard). I've been slamming it. Love it, dreaming of warmer temps and stronger body outside soon. I have a specialized crosstour (?) and love it, just got a new saddle for Christmas and cannot wait to get real biking shoes (seriously, what brand should i get - geezus there are soo many, i feel creepy just staring at everyone's feet in spin class trying to figure out what brand shoe they're wearing). Sadly though,  found out I must have a pretty invasive surgery this week with long (6-8wks no bike) recovery ... took my last spin class last night. Now I live vicariously through you all until I recover and get back on bike in late Feb/March. I do hope to read/learn enough from you all to get some drop bars for my bike by March (40th birthday!!) as a gift to self for persevering through it all. :)     (it's NYE and staying in lying low to be ready for surgery but i am slightly buzzed - excuse typos)

Why?  My friend and I were walking her dog who is a rescue, and she has an intense fear of children, so we take her to the dog park.  Which is a park for DOGS not CHILDREN.   However, some parents think it just perfectly fine to bring their kids to the dog park.  This what looks to be a 5 year old screeches and runs right for my friend's dog.  His mother just laughing and waving at us like it was just fine and dandy.  Before my friend could even stop the child, her dog growls and snaps at the child then hides behind me and my friend.  The child starts bawling and his mother starts to scream at us.  Like how could we bring such an unstable socialized dog out in public.

"dredmorbius","t5_2z471","StackExchange's scoring system, goals, and a frustrated user's rant:

*If you're going for points (and that's the entire raison d'être for gamification!)*

That's the faulty premise.  Or rather:  it strikes at the weakness of gamification.

Yes, there is a very strong tendency for reward and effort to be grossly mismatched in user-ranked and filtered sites.  Guess what:  there's a copious amount of similar mismatch in real life.  Jobs which are painfully difficult offer little reward, other times a casually tossed off effort may gain endless plaudits.

On HN, I think my top-voted comment remains a sarcastically flip jibe at PHP (a couple of submissions have out-scored it).  On reddit, [something of a throwaway about terminals vs. glass TTYs](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1te9e1/found_this_in_a_closet_at_work/ce75jp9) (at least it's technical).  On the other hand, [I scored my first reddit gold](http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/1ttsp2/why_are_so_many_redditors_obsessed_with/cebhban), which is to say, someone was sufficiently moved by what I'd written to actually pay something, for a longer and more detailed post, but one which my research of the topic made pretty easy to write.

## But that's not why I participate.

My principle objective is to learn, explore, examine, have my own ideas challenged, and generally expand my capabilities and understanding.  And used correctly, HN, reddit, and StackExchange *all* accomplish this pretty well.

The rating systems are there less for the person being rated and more for the benefit of others -- they're a first-level indication of how well trusted and respected someone is ... or how long and obsessively they've been using the service.

A recent HN post (also appearing on reddit) was ""We Have to Talk About TED"".  I wrote my own riff on that:  ""We Have to Talk About 'We Have to Talk About TED'"" (http://redd.it/1te3hz) (and yes, as the woman in the back says, its TEDtles all the way down ...).

## The key problem:

*There's a fundamental problem with democratic voting processes and voting systems (such as reddit's own post and moderation processes[2] -- which are, in their defense, better than most) in assessing who's qualified to make a judgement -- and then, of course, in determining who's qualified to assess who's qualified.*

There's been a strong focus in the online world for the past decade or more over user-moderated discussion.  Slashdot was arguably one of the first such sites, many others have come along, most have gone.  I think a fundamental misunderstanding is that the most democratic moderation systems are the best.  I don't believe this is the case.  Rather, *any* distributed moderation system *shares the load of content filtering*.  Which is a good thing.  But distributing that load *to those unable to draw meaningful distinctions between ""good"" and ""entertaining""* is *not* useful.

This is most crucial where you're not measuring, say, marketplace potential (where popularity is in fact by and large the metric you're looking for) as opposed to, say, technical correctness.  In which *tests of suitability* are more significant.

And that's the point of StackExchange:  it's not a platform with the goal of scoring people the most points, it's a platform on which *if you go there with a question, you'll find a good, and hopefully the best, applicable answer.*  And to that end, I've actually found the site extremely useful.

So:  HN, StackExchange, reddit, Facebook, Google+, and other similar sites tend to fall down a bit of a rathole.  Clay Shirky's noted that the problem isn't information overload, it's filter failure, but there are also two modes of filter failure:  one is filters which are overwhelmed in the classification task and can't keep up.  But another is filters *which select the wrong stuff.*

Which isn't a particularly easy problem to solve.  StackExchange actually takes a decent cut at it (as do other services such as Yahoo Answers, though with varying degrees of success) by having the submitter select the best answer.  Within the ranking system, this might carry some benefits, and in particular, submitting a lot of wrong, or simply unselected answers, might carry a penalty.  Another way to switch up the voting system would be to assign more points for answers to harder, less-answered, or unanswered questions.  Or to provide a means of judging between solutions:  what's faster, simpler, more comprehensive, more robust, etc.

Which gets down to determining what quality and fitness are.  In which case I'd recommend taking another look at Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*.  Though you need not agree entirely with what he has to say.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","No, I'm saying that there are very few cars I wouldn't recommend to a young and enthusiastic driver, but a WRX is one of them. Not only for financial reasons, but from a car enthusiasts point of view they spoil you. If you want to get GOOD at driving, have refined driving skills, appreciate a cars handling limits and be able to play around with them, then the WRX is NOT the car to start with. It's handling limits are too high, and the handling behaviour to ""snappy"" at the limit, because by the time you approach that limit you are going very, very fast. You also can't fully exploit them on the road, because you're doing illegal speeds to do so, but paradoxically their surefootedness makes them dull on track until you've tuned and modified them, which guess what? is more money you DON'T HAVE.

I'm not saying you should never have a WRX. I'm saying that you should wait. You should build both your financial position and your driving experience so that you are able to enjoy the car you've ""always wanted"" without fear of life, licence or financial ruin.

I appreciate that you don't know me, but I have taken the time to offer my honest advice from a point of expereince: That point of experience is a mid 30's guy who's owned a lot of very fun cars, driven many more fun cars, has had significant advanced driving tuition including trackdays, skid pan training and time at the Nurburgring, and currently competes in tarmac rallies.

By all means ignore me and buy the car of your dreams. But my advice is, I feel sound. There is always time to buy a WRX down the line. It's the car you want right now, but it's not the car you need. If you wait, you will get more enjoyment from it and it will cause you less anquish. Because cars cause anguish.","1388535471"

Yet, if you knowingly buy a fake, because dropping 50 dollars on an unneeded vanity item is so much more economical than dropping 100 dollars on an item....you're deliberately hurting that team by doing that.

"frugalmalefashion","t5_2s8e9","If you're looking for an alternative that's not as ""clown shoes"" as CDB Bushacre 2 is always an alternative (personally I can't see what the difference is but some people report strongly favoring one or the other). If you're talking about boots boots (works well in snow) I think the gamut runs from LL Bean to Alden Indy to Wolverine 1k. I personally own the W1k emerson over the regular recommended Rust 1k and I think it works well for me. Those are all regularly 300+ so you're going to want to wait for a special sale or go for seconds.

In terms of stores, just a brief list off the top of my head:

**Shirts** (as with all articles of clothing, know your measurements)

* Charles Tyrwhitt -  Mine just came in and holy shit are they nice. Best out of the box fit for me compared to J Crew, Brooks Brothers, Uniqlo, JCP Staffords, and trash brands (CK, etc.) They were on sale for 29.99 earlier in the season, expect them to roll around again eventually. Staples include the white/blue OCDB, and gingham blue OCDB. My personal recommendation

* J Crew / Factory - A lot of people think Factory is trash, but I can't tell the difference. Fabric is thinner relative to CT, but they fit well and look nice so no complaints from me. Shirts run $25-45, with sales leaning more towards the $30 range.

**Pants**

* Levis - I know you have dark jeans so I'll keep it brief. MFA loves 511 in Rigid Dragon and they went on sale on Amazon for $26, lowest I've ever seen. Also available at outlet stores 2 for $60 or some deal like that.

* JCP - Jesus this season at JCP I snagged some really nice fitting chinos. Docker Alphas also available if you get lucky. 

**Other Stores**

* Target - Mossimo tees, cardigans, long sleeves, awesome dinosaur socks

* Uniqlo - dollar socks never forget. was only available during black friday/cyber monday but hopefully it comes around again. Really nice socks, I've heard good things about their tees but never have bought any myself. Some claim fabric is thin and waist fit not as great as others. 

* Costco - pima cotton v-neck white shirts 4 for 14.99, great undershirts for my own use, trail wool socks also very very warm for winter season.","1388535475"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Apathetic in terms of airing actual coverage live on television. US national team matches have been pushed to other channels for portions of the game so that they can finish airing something worthless more times than I can count. Most recently they were supposed to be airing Portugal vs Sweden, but lost the feed for the first 15 minutes or so of the match and just aired their regular sports news over it. Then said they were going live to the match and threw on Croatia instead. Didn't say a word about Portugal Sweden. They eventually switched without saying much of anything. It was sloppy, unprofessional, and extremely apathetic. They also never air soccer on their main channel. They would rather play the 15th repeat of the day of SportsCenter. They have absolutely no pre or post game coverage and only recently started airing their ESPNFC television program. At the worst possible time slots. ESPN doesn't give two shits about soccer outside of the World Cup.","1388535475"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I agree, its somewhat the inverse of most traditional fantasy books. Normally in a story you have the protagonist with the proper character to achieve their goals, but generally lacking the skill, information, or other external factor. In this book though the character starts with all the external factors he needs to win, but instead must develop his own character in order to wield it properly and win in the end. Its a very refreshing story and a nice change from most other stories out there, but requires you to not try to view it in the same light as most fantasy stories.","1388535476"

Those two things aside, I just want to get it over with as quickly as possible so I can go home.

But in the real world, M31 is about two and a half million light years away, and the Sun is about eight light *minutes* away. That's a difference of 6 trillion in distance. Andromeda is about 30 billion times as luminous as the Sun, and radiation follows the inverse square law, so we get about (3 x 10^(10))/(6 x 10^(12))^(2) = 8 x 10^-16 times less light from Andromeda than we do from the sun.

Simply because the people in firms who set the wages want to pay themselves more, and nothing is stopping them. With high unemployment and with every other firm following along with the same strategy, there's no reason to pay anymore than you have to. 

If we actually wanted to say ""from a Macro perspective, what are the best wages to pay?"" you'd see a lot more profits flowing to workers on the lower end, since them getting paid better has a more direct impact on a firms success (through customer interaction, economic activity etc) then sending most of those wages up to the top.","1388535484"

*Sherner had been talking with Arata for a few moments when the barrier suddenly overtook the area. Sherner gave him a confused and concerned look before flashing off to see what was happening. Looking  on in confusion before he felt the crushing weight of Seraphim reitsu.... Big Trouble. Sherner could tell no one who was currently near the manor would be able to handle this, that is until he felt the Captain commanders reitsu suddenly spike. Quietly Sherner bringer stepped off behind some cover and peered out at what was going on. At the moment the best option was to gather as much information as he could. Rukia would be far to busy actually dealing with the Seraphim to be able to pick up every detail. noticing the hundreds if not thousands of odd apples floating about the area Sherner looked on as Rukia spun and stabbed the Seraph in the skull. What Sherner thought was an obvious killing blow seemed to be ultimately shrugged off. Watching the apples seem to regenerate the man Sherner thought back to the reports Rukia left about an extremely powerful Seraphim and paired it together..... Averonis. Watching the battle continue Rukia had lost access to her zanpaktou and the apples seemed to be keeping Averonis alive. He needed to reequip Rukia and destroy the apples while Rukia kept him busy. It was then that the gem in Sherners pouch became noticeably hot. could it be that this gem was attuned to the Seraphim in some way....*

*Quietly Sherner began to charge up his aura aiming to take out a large chunk of the apples with it. slowly the aura began to wrap around his body and then to the tips of his kunai. Using the focusing techniques kylar had taught him. The swirling energies becoming more and more intense before he slashed outwards unleasing a massive hell storm of swirling energy from his hiding spot attempting to whipe out as many of the apples that he could that were behind rukia. not waiting to see if his idea worked Sherner quickly pointed a finger towards Averonis and a small white orb appeared and quickly began to give off a hazy steam to burden Averonises sight and sensing abilitys. After a few seconds a moderate sized cloud had formed in the area and Sherner bringer stepped into the cloud, towards Averonis while he held Rukias zanpaktou Using his rebuttal aura Sherner attempted to slam Rukias Zanpaktou out of Averonis's, hopefully off guard grasp and out of the hazy cloud giving Rukia a chance to retrieve it. Informing Rukia of the gem would have to wait until she was re-equipped*

Source: A lady my mother knows who lives in Canada had to buy a plane ticket into the US to get a CT scan to check for a tumor because the waiting list was too long in Canada. I like having my healthcare I already get.

Another problem is many companies see it as cheaper to drop healthcare for their employees. This causes workers feeling uneasy because they don't know if free healthcare will cover them as well as company provided that they used to get. If it doesn't, then you're screwed.

Yet another problem is we do not trust our government. If they can't get the healthcare website working properly when it's supposed to, how can we trust them to get us our actual healthcare properly?

So tell me this. Your company drops your very good healthcare for a system that may require you to wait for life saving treatments, which may not even provide you with everything you had.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","If you want the original source for the Enoch story, you need to get a copy of the [Pseudepigrapha](www.amazon.com/The-Old-Testament-Pseudepigrapha-Volume/dp/1598564897/).  There are two books Volume 1 and Volume 2.  Not sure which volume has the four lost books of Enoch.

These are apocraphyal stories from the Old Testament.  The book was lost in antiquity and found in the early 19th century and translated.  However, the book was not passed around much.  JS somehow got an actual copy and created parts of the BoA from it, especially regarding Enoch and his dealings.  There are a great many other books in the Pseudepigraha dealing with religious themes.

If you are/were a Hugh Nibley fan, Nibley states how JS was truly a prophet because he erroneously believed the Pseudepigrapha was not available until after JS's death.  Thus, his writings on Enoch were revelation from god, because not surprisingly the stories from BofA on Enoch correlate with the stories from the Pseudepigrapha.

When I first read this statement from Nibley, I was like,""Oh shit!"", incorrectly thinking JS was a prophet of god.  However, in reading exmo sources, there was a statement from a historian somewhere, please do not ask sources as I don't recall, that talked about how a copy of the Pseudepigrapha fell into JS's hand and they have records of him having access to a copy.  Thus, Nibley was uninformed on the subject, like so much else.

The Pseudepigrapha is an ancient source, which was not commonly known or passed around, that JS used to create scripture.  In the Books of Enoch, there are four, it tells Enoch's story in some lengthy detail.  He was righteous and was invited to take a tour of heaven.  He was shown around and met the various officials and learned of their authorities over the earth.  He spoke with jesus and that whole scene from the BofA played out there.  Later, Enoch was called to be as a sort of Executive Secretary for the godhead and oversaw the records of heaven, etc.  Its an interesting story as fiction.  

In fact, the book has a great deal of other stories that are real interesting and entertaining.

That's the tale of Enoch.","1388535486"

The combination of effects means they could get what is essentially the last vehicle of the wastes going.

It's absolutely nothing about exacting vengeance. You must think there is some ulterior motive, or have assigned some perceived, imagined motive to me. It could be true of some others, but to make a blanket statement like that is misleading if deliberate and ignorant if not. Sounds like a straw man argument of a different sort.

I myself have my faults and have made poor decisions in life, and I suffer for them. (And I've learned from them, too.)

What's comes out of it is the WD has to hit very hard and on most builds, if you use up your mana too fast, your dead. No nothing. Even the WDs primary attacks use mana. And the WD has almost no generators. I say almost because there are some runes and Passives, but you'll have to sacrifice DPS on those runes and passives just to maintain attacks. In the end, attack speed is the enemy of WD DPS. Your paper DPS will go up (that number you see in the box in game) but your real ability to keep damage on target will go way down. ","1388535493"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;My argument is basically learn to play unless you can't haha. 

Anyone can learn to play against an OP champion, even OP champions typically have a counter or two, but as a competitive experience, and one that positions itself as a sport no less, balance should be at the heart of the game. 

&gt;I highly doubt most of the things that are being complained about are truly broken in a huge way.

We might be working with different ideas of balance. I care about things being even slightly out of line or edging others out, where there are players who talk to the effect that as long as there is a champion or two who counters the latest OP (see Kassadin and Riven) they are perfectly fine. I understand that the game cannot be perfectly balanced, but Riot should try to get as close to balanced as possible either way. To that end, Riot at one point evaluated the worth of every stat in the game and put a gold value to it, rebalancing gold costs for items in the game based around these assessments. That was a good effort on their part to make the game balanced, but I worry that they also sometimes make frivolous or ill-considered decisions (such as the Trinity Force buff and the early Blade of the Ruined King). Item passives and champion kits seem to get far more leeway because they are not budgeted in the same way, leading to champions and items that dominate the game in certain metas or all the time (Lee Sin and Elise will ALWAYS be good picks because they are mobile, high damage and safe).

Also, there have been several posts here on Reddit about how egregiously powerful tanky top laners are at the moment - Mundo, Nasus, Shyvanna, Rengar, Renekton mostly. They edge out virtually every other champion in the game because their base damage is ridiculous when combined with their tankiness; they have kill potential but are very hard to kill when played right. At the moment those kinds of champions are broken in a huge way in my opinion. It was hard laning against a Renekton as Wukong in the past, now it's just masochistic and bears no fruit.

I also liked Daniel Way's long run of the series, although I haven't read all of them. You can either get the TPBs which starts at ""Secret Invasion"" or there's also complete collections of his work.

If you're looking for something a little less, uh, pooley, then you should check out the Uncanny X-Force series written by Rick Remender - it has some good Deadpool but also focuses a lot on Wolverine and the other members of the team.

Deadpool Corps is a bit much for me, a little too zany although there are some funny moments. I still haven't read Deadpool and Cable but you can always continue that series as well, I heard it's one of the best.","1388535500"

"Norway","t5_2qwrb","Personally, I'd bring a lot more wool underthings. I wear wool long johns eh, 8-9 out of 12 months, and I tend to wear them out in a season. They're pretty easy to find here as well though, any sporting goods store will sell wool baselayers. I find that the long sleeved tshirts doesn't get as much use as the long johns, but you'd still want a few to swap with. You mention winter sports, and bringing a dry wool shirt in your backpack is a lifesaver. I have about five wool shirts that I use regularly. And remember that wool garments can just as easilly be aired instead of washed, that way the garment will last longer. 

You'll probably also need more than one pair of gloves for snowboarding, those suckers get wet a lot. :p I'd not bother with the acrylic scarves unless it's a fashion thing, two wool scarves will be more than enough.

As many before me mentions, it is extremely important to make sure the outer layer is wind proof. My basic setup for a hike or cross country during winter is: thin wool socks, water proof shoes, make sure there's plenty of circulation in the shoes. Wool long johns, wind proof/ water resistant dual layer pants (a mesh and an outer layer). Wool long tshirt, knitted wool sweater, and a dual layer jacket, same build as the pants. A wool buff,  and a wool hat/wool gloves. This gives me the ability to be outside comfortbly in 30 degrees below C, or at 2 degrees above. I will always bring at least one pair of extra socks and tshirt, possibly mittend depending on the activity!

For everyday wear in winter I use a wool long john and a pair of comfy jeans, and a cotton top of some sort. A wind resistant coat, a scarf, and I'm good to go. I hate that icy feeling on my thighs when I'm not wearinga layer beneth my trousers!","1388535509"

This year we went to the Eagles game.  While watching the players warm up, one of their most famous rookie up-and-comers, Cordarelle Patterson, walked over to where we were standing (we were in row 3 but noone was there yet so we were standing in front looking at the metrodome).

He started signing autographs of kids, and when that was over, we moved up the line to shake his hand/get my friend his much-deserved autograph.  We're all 20, so we had no problem waiting for the kids.  Experiences impact them way more.  Anyways it gets to my friend, who reaches out his hand to get a hand shake.

This portly lady comes running from opposite of the isle and pushed my friend's hand out of the way, grabs the bottom of her Vikings shirt, and pulls it down over the concrete wall for him to sign.  She didn't even care that her multiple stretch marks were exposed to every disgusted onlooker.  As soon as that was over, it was time for warmups, and the player had to return to the field.  No handshake for any of us.  No autograph.  The lady joined her kids (who also got autographs.  at least their whole family lucked out) to our left and sat yelling to everyone: ""HE SIGNED MY SHIRT!  HE SIGNED MY SHIRT!  IT WAS AWESOME!""

Seriously, fuck that greedy bitch.

The weekly extractions to me, seemed very intense as I didn't believe my acne was that bad. I went to another dermatologist recommended by a doctor friend, and she had me on oral antibiotics, and topical antibiotics. No extractions necessary. She would extract 1 or 2 during a follow up, but nothing as excessive as weekly extractions. She cleared my acne up in about 3 months. Be wary of some dermatologists.

If you haven't read the book or are aware of its content, that's fine and I apologise for calling you a liar on that basis, but you gave such a strong impression that you were an apologist for Peters (even using one of the most prominent examples of that argument, Twain's quote) that I feel justified on /r/badhistory in replying strongly your post.

&gt;Can you please clarify this? Does this just mean that the population was 95% Christian and Muslim? 

Correct.

&gt;Or did you just raise this to gear up for your next argument that the Jews are all foreign invaders with no connection to the land?

I never argued that, and I don't think that. There was and is nothing immoral about making *aliyah*. It was Arabs who weren't able to come to a settlement in the run up to the establishment of Israel as a state, and in that sense at least the Arabs have only themselves to blame for being pushed back to the Green Line.

However, you don't need to argue that Palestine was a 'land without a people for a people without a land' to justify Zionism as an idea. I am a Zionist, insofar as I believe in a democratic state for Jews centred on (West) Jerusalem. There are plenty of other people like me (who don't both commenting on internet debates like this) who hold similar positions, and you just turn them off when you resort to complete bullshit like this.

I agree that judging draft picks after one season isn't entirely fair to the players. 

That being said i disagree on the following:

Dion Jordan was the #3 pick, which should instantly be a starter. He rarely got pressure on QBs and thats with o-lines focusing attention on Wake.

Martin isn't average. He was a bust and will not start on any healthy nfl team next season. The dolphins will not miss a beat without him.

Egnew is a bust. After 2 seasons he is still at best still a development project. Replacements better then him will still be available in the 5th round of this year's nfl draft.

Letting Carpenter walk for Sturgis was a mistake. Even if he saves the team money. Teams restructure contracts all of the time.

Tannehill does have potential and with a good offensive coordinator and o-line he might be good. Right now though he is a below average QB, who CANNOT throw accurately down field. He has a [QB rating of 81.7 which ranks him 24th](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating) in the nfl.

Also the new LBs Wheeler and Ellerbe haven't exactly lived up to the hype. Or match their predecessors on the field performance for that matter.","1388535520"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No offense, but you sound like someone that has never managed minimum wage employees. I was an assistant manager of a BK in college and when staffing the kitchen there were some employees I knew could do the work of two people and staffed accordingly. There were some people that could handle front line alone and if I staffed them I could send the second person home early and save the company money. Conversely there were employees that would never be able to close by themselves because they'd drag their feet and turn a 30 minute close into an hour and a half process.

There is a lot of elasticity at the bottom wage where you can't exactly fire people because you need every body you can get and turn over is already so high, but corporate or the owners WON'T sign off on raises even when you show them cost/benefit and productivity analysis showing you could pay employee x 30% more and you'd still be saving them money.

The real problem is that owners and corporations don't have much flexibility and if low skill workers try to prove they're worth more through hard work, ingenuity, or excellent time management that is more often than not used against them.

As for just firing everyone, well you could try that, but I think you'd see the difference immediately between someone that has worked a job for 30 seconds and someone that's worked a job for 3 months. On top of that, if you tried to fire and replace your entire staff you'd most likely have to close until they were trained. Good luck trying to pass an inspection from the health department with 25 brand new employees.

As far as supply far exceeding demand, look at Applebee's and Walmart's response to the ACA. Initially they capped hours, cut benefits and tried to institute the same kind of heavy handed policies I think you're saying they could. Walmart lost so many employees and couldn't attract retrain employees to the point they couldn't keep their shelves stocked or the registers manned, and ended up losing billions of dollars and had to not only reverse their policies but sweeten their starting benefits in order to attract employees. Applebee's lost so much market share and profitability they fell below Denny's.

The problem isn't that simple, for a long time employers had a massive upper hand, but the economy is starting to recover enough and enough places are hiring (especially at that tier of work) that there are enough options for people to walk away from abusive employers, after all why should they care? It's not like the employer has done anything to foster employee allegiance or goodwill in that case.

Right after college I worked for a contractor that would sell my labor for $35/hr but only pay me $20. A bunch of us found out they renegotiated a couple of the contracts so that they were making $40/hr and they did this by convincing the client they would be able to attract much better quality and efficient workers with broader skill sets etc... they still just paid us $20/hr and kept the rest as profit.

So is part of it due to economies of supply and demand in the labor market? Yes. But a huge part of it is employers pushing the envelope to see what they can get away with until they break their own systems and take a hit. ","1388535520"

My mom really shouldn't have had 5 of us. I can remember what she was like with just 3 (she'd leave my baby brother inside napping to go outside and play with my sister and I. 

But by the time #5 happened, I think she'd had enough. My dad was of the ""parenting and housework is women's work"" school of thought, because that's how he was raised. He also worked rotating shifts, days, afternoons and nights with a week spent on each shift. Sundays before night shift he had to go in and set the machines up, replaces dull blades and such. 

My parents also had a farm. Still do, but now they're down to about 8 horses and a couple dogs. They had over 20 horses, most of them minis they wanted to show when I was growing up. 

My older sister always managed to get out of housework and childcare. I wish I knew how. So I had the misfortune of being stuck with most of the caregiving for my younger siblings. It sucked. I had to make dinner,  try and get them to do homework, and referee fights (which felt constant back then). On top of that, my mom wasn't big on housework and was a hoarder. So, every time Dad was around and Mom wasn't, he'd make my younger sister and I clean. My dad always tried to tell me it was practice for when I had my own family.

I've got to be honest, I left as soon as I found out my mom wanted me to move in with her elderly CF aunt and become her caregiver. I'd had enough. I only go back when they start threatening to come and visit me now. 

Once I figured out having kids was a choice, I was decided - None for me. I still hate housework, but I don't let things get too gross. There's no mold growing in old food left on counters, fly problems are dealt with quickly and my house is quiet unless my SO is gaming without his headset or we're watching a movie.","1388535524"

secondly, the uk isn't really a nation-state. it's a union of nation-states which share adminstration through a unified governmental structure ( with devolved adminsitrative bodies in 3 out of 4 cases. ).

and again, i have to point out, the statistics aren't particularly reliable. it's long been the case that statistical polling in scotland is generally only remotely accurate for westminster elections.

also, we've had polls with a yes vote in the lead. we MOSTLY see polls of rough parity between yes and no, just a couple of points in it, with the rest being predominantly 'don't know'. it IS confirmed that the vast majority of scots want more powers for holyrood. it's confirmed that many westminster politicians want holyrood to LOSE powers if we vote no. scots CAN do maths, y'know.","1388535527"

I think the game could benefit from receiving a small sub-team (1-3 people?) within QA dedicated to consistency within the game.

I have all but 9 champions at the moment, and since I normally queue up for normals, I end up playing quite a variety of champions and tinkering with strange builds

I've noticed a lot of champions suffer from inconsistencies in tooltips, scaling, or other various aspects of the champion and their deigsn, stats, and clarity.

For example, the mana scaling on Soraka's E (Infuse) does not display as blue, as some other mana scaling has been shown in the past (Such as on Ryze)

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","Player purchasable base upgrades, requiring resource pooling. It would also be the start of a system that let players vote with in-game resources.

Some would be small like faction specific turret upgrades that could be bought by a single infantryman with a max pool of the right resource. For example AA turrets might be upgraded into a TR point defense vulcan similar to the current AI turret, a slower firing large AOE/damage variant for NC, and some kind of laser/plasma charge system for VS.

Others would be big and require thousands to tens of thousands of resources pooled by community members to get them up and would remain until the base was captured by another faction.
A large upgrade might be anti-explosives shielding for the bastions around an amp station/biolab doorway, new jump pads, or making a network of saferooms in buildings around a facility.

These functions would help give infantry that don't participate in armor/air a way to expend their resources and beef up the infantry game a bit.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","It's a little of one and a little of the other. Like others here have said, changing smoothly (without any errors, buzzes, ringing notes, other unwanted sounds) is extremely important. But I find in my own practice that *also* practicing making changes quickly and loosely is a good idea.

I remember I used to get this anxiety when playing a difficult new song: ""a difficult change is coming up!"" and just *worrying* about the change would cause me to make a mistake.

* I used to practice quite a lot changing between two chords. I would slow it down *very* slow and switch back and forth between the two chords for a good 2 or 3 minutes until I didn't make a single mistake. A metronome can help but keeping a very slow cadence works as well.

* Then I'd practice changing between the two chords up to speed without worrying about minor mistakes (but if I made major mistakes I'd slow down again). This was to make sure the changes weren't rigid - that they were loose and followed the groove of the song. You want to avoid tension which can happen when you become too focused on technical perfection.

* Then I would add the chord just before the difficult change and then add the chord just after (so 3 then 4 chords) and finally I'd start from the beginning of the passage. It really helps to break things down into small chunks which are easy to master and then slowly add the surrounding context one or two notes/chords at a time until you can play the entire passage from start to finish without error.

Finally - context is everything. If you are just learning the open chords for the first time, maybe drills are a good idea. But for the most part I'd tackle new changes as I came across them in the songs I was learning and writing.","1388535534"

I would highly recommend anyone traveling to Rome to take the tour, [Scavi Tour]( http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/institutions_connected/uffscavi/documents/rc_ic_uffscavi_doc_gen-information_20090216_en.html)

For clarification and for those who did not know during the times of the Ancient Roman empire, pre 1 AD the area of the Vatican a city is used by the Romans as a circus and various bariel grounds. For those who don't know a circus was a chariot racing circuit in the shape of a rectangle with rounded sides. It was used for racing and public crucifixitions. I mention this because this is the [Circus of Near]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_of_Nero) , where saint Peter will be crucified upside down. The current circus no longer exist as Saint Peters is where it would have been if it had survived.

 After saint Peter was crucified, around 64 AD, some of his followers took his body off of the crucifix and barried in what used to be a hill near the complex. Roman law stated Bodies that were barried could not be disturbed by yourself law, even those of convicted criminals. His followers barried the corpse in what is believed to be a wooden casket. Over the years it was forgotten until emperor Constantine. 

After Constantine took power in the 4th century AD it was the first time a Christian took power. He took steps that would create the beginning of the Vatican City. He built the first Saint Peters Basilica. The cemetery where Peter was barrier has been on a while so to compensate the cemetery became a Necropolis, in other words it was buried and became part of the foundation of the Basilica.

 It was forgotten about until around the 1500s when the church wanted to expand the Basilica downwards. This didn't work out as they discovered only one of the Roman tombs that lay beneath. A worker sketched what he saw and they sealed it up to be forgotten until the 1900s. Around the year 1939 is when the tombs below are actually discovered and the search for Saint Peters burial starts. They discover one of the tombs as they are trying to lower the floor of the catacombs of the official Basilica burial site. This lower level is where many Pope's are buried. And is used daily. They wanted a higher ceiling and the only way to do so is to go down. 

They discover one of the best preserved Roman tombs as it has been covered for the past 1600 years. After they discover the roof of tomb they look to the Pope for permission to excavate bellow to see if there is anything else to find. To there astonishment they find and excavate, again with the Pope's permission, a large cemetery with various tombs. Many of they are very rich Romans who worshipped Pagan gods but there were a few Christian ones as well. They as found a wall that was described where Saint Peter is buried. They frantically search and after 11 years only come up with skeletal remains of multiple people that do not match Saint Peter. One being a woman and the other two were not of the right age. The burial of Saint Peter was described to be under a shrine agasint a red wall. Both were found and years later a third wall called the Grafiti wall was found. 

The Grafiti wall was a marked up wall giving thanks and prayers for Peter. It was known long ago that he was buried near the wall. One inscription stands out as it says Peter is Here. The church was not sure when they found the wall whether that was literal or metaphorical. After a while of more searching another body was found. It fit the description very well except for the missing feet. It is assumed that they were either lost in burial, movement of the body or when his followers got him from the cross in the night they chopped his feet off to save time. 

The excavations were done only at night and in extreme sports secrecy. It was kept very quite and few within the Catholic Church were made aware of it until after the war. I do not know who the first public announcement of the discovery was made but the first announcement by the Pope was in 1950 regarding the discovery of possible remains of Saint Peter but without absolute certainty. 

During this time of excavation very little was told to the world and very little outside of the Vatican. The Pope was specifically concerned about Hitler founding out about the Roman Era crypts and the possibility of Saint Peters body. Hitler was obsessed with the ancient world and took many ancient works of art with him back to Germany. The Vatican feared this was Saint Peter was only at home below the center of the Catholic religion and below his own church. 


I hope this interesting and I wish I could format it better or with more sources but I am on my phone. Almost all of this information comes from my tour which is run by the Vatican and is done very professionally. I would highly recommend the tour as it is very interesting. Any questions about what I said please ask and if you have a source to probe me wrong let me know I will change it or argue with you. ","1388535535"

"microbiology","t5_2qirk","R is the language you'd learn in an Intro Bioinformatics course. I believe our bioinformaticist uses Python to run some theoretical algorithms to track and predict viral evolution. I also agree that knowing about databases is helpful.

Working in a lab and coming from a programming background, there is a huge gap in understanding between programmers and scientists regarding how programming works and what it can do. For instance, we track all of our samples in Excel spreadsheets, something that could be more efficiently wrapped up into a database. Our bioinformaticist knows how to develop such a database, but doesn't always know our in-lab processes. Luckily, I've been there to help him connect the dots.

It's great you have a desire to learn some programming. It may become very handy later on and it's a great skill to have. If you're able to, try to take an intro programming course or bioinformatics. Even if you don't start with Python, the logic and design principles remain the same across most languages.","1388535542"

While none of these are particularly ripe targets, most of them *can* be shipped overseas.

Many of these already have been shifted off-site (though generally not overseas):

* food prep - most fast food places receive their food partially prepared to minimize the prep needed in store

* cashiers - this is two jobs, order-taker and money-taker. The first one has already been moved off-site in some cases (e.g. McDonald's has experimented with connecting drive-thru customers to a central hub of order-takers). The latter is begging for automation.

* janitors - you've got me... for now. Don't rule out innovations here.

My point is that forced labor was put into the economy with zero return to the laborers and those labors were set free without any return for their effort and all of the problems that come with being a former slave community. The economies of slave nations are, in my opinion, morally obligated to pay reparations with some reasonable effort.

Psychology especially is a game of ""let's throw stuff at the wall and hope it sticks"", and some of it slides off really slowly and it takes awhile before anyone notices it's touch the ground. Occasaionally, you'll get some stuff that's built on that and it turns out to be legit, or that there's an actual reason for it. But for the most part, almost all of our psychology stuff can be tossed out on a whim. There's several points where prior knowledge is made to look silly.

That's not to knock all psychiatrists and others in the field, but people need to be honest about exactly how much of this stuff is pure conjecture that sounds right, so it's taken as a fact. Not to mention the whole controversy over what should or shouldn't be a mental illness. Some places don't suffer from certain issues until people talk about them.

In a hot shower, you quickly feel getting warmer when hit by the water but when some part of your body is exposed to the air and is wet, you're quickly shedding that heat by having all that water evaporate off you. So while you are getting hot quicker, you're also shedding that heat quicker too. Also, you easily have the ability to control this by choosing the temperature of the water you're standing in and how much of your body you expose to it. You basically naturally balance the two to a point where they cancel each other out and you're left feeling the warmth of the water but not overheating.","1388535550"

I think it's also okay to go over just a little bit, because your body will naturally balance out with a lower appetite and tiny increase in calories burned during the week of your actual period**. Also, a small fluctuation in weight based on your hormonal cycle is completely normal, so changes in a range of 2-4 pounds is not necessarily detrimental to your overall progress.

As far as requirements go, the minimum flight time is 40 hrs. Some people hit it, lots of people don't. A big factor is going to be your commitment and how often you take lessons. Generally speaking, the more often you take lessons, the less time it's going to take. I got mine done with 50 hours of flying. I was taking lessons 4 times a week, with Saturday as a double header. 

Your cost estimate isn't bad. Mine ranged closer to $11k including the checkride. The plane you use and the hours it takes are obviously the big factors here. As far as instructors go, you'll see a couple options. Mine was fairly unique in that he offers a flat rate depending on the frequency of the lessons. Others will charge by hour.

I'd have an end goal in mind as well. I see it recommended often to define what you want to do with it before you start. Doesn't matter if it's totally for leisure or you want it to be your profession. There are lots of good resources and lots of good people here to help point you in the right direction.

I'd be happy to answer any questions I can. I can also get you the info on my instructor and some of the really good resources I used. PM me.

Two bottles of 120ml is the same shipping cost, much cheaper than the $66.45 shipping for a 250ml bottle.

&gt;Placebo effect and the brain
Functional imaging
 upon placebo analgesia
shows that it links to the activation,  and increased functional correlation between this activation, in the anterior cingulate
,prefrontal
, orbitofrontal
 and insular
cortices, nucleus accumbens
, amygdala
, the brainstem periaqueductal gray matter
,[77]
[78]
[79]
 and the spinal cord
.[80]
[81]
[82]
[83]

These changes can act upon the brain's early stages of information processing: Research using evoked brain potentials
upon painful laser pulses, for example, finds placebo effects upon the N2–P2, a biphasic negative–positive complex response, the N2 peak of which is at about 230 ms, and the P2 one at about 380 ms.[41]
 They occur not only during placebo analgesia but after receiving the analgesic placebo (the areas are different here, and involve the medial prefrontal cortex
,posterior parietal cortex
 and inferior parietal lobule
).[84]

Different areas in the higher brain have different functions. The prefrontal involvement could be related to recalling the placebo and maintaining its cognitive presence in a ""self-reinforcing feedback loop"" (during pain an individual recalls having taken the placebo and reduced pain reinforces its status as an analgesic).[85]
The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and its subcortical connectivity could be related to the expectation of potential pain stimuli[86]
[87]

The higher brain works by regulating subcortical processes. High placebo responses link with enhanced dopamine
and mu-opioid
 activity in the circuitry for reward responses and motivated behavior of the nucleus accumbens, and, on the converse, anti-analgesic nocebos responses were associated with deactivation in this part of the brain of dopamine and opioid release.[78]
 (It has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of endogenous opioids
 since 1978.[88]
) Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray[78]
 on spinal nociceptive reflexes
, while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.[80]

The brain is also involved in less-studied ways upon nonanalgesic placebo effects:
  * Parkinson's disease
: Placebo relief is associated with the release of dopamine
 in the brain.[89]

  * Depression
: Placebos reducing depression affect many of the same areas that are activated by antidepressants with the addition of the prefrontal cortex[90]
[91]

  * Caffeine
: Placebo-caffeinated coffee causes an increase in bilateral dopamine release in the thalamus.[92]

  * Glucose
: The expectation of anintravenous
 injection of glucose increases the release of dopamine in the basal ganglia of men (but not women).[93]

  * Methylphenidate
: The expectation of intravenous injection of this drug in inexperienced drug users increased the release of dopamine in the ventral cingulate gyrus and nucleus accumbens, with this effect being largest in those with no prior experience of the drug.[94]

Present functional imaging upon placebo analgesia has been summarized as showing that the placebo response is ""mediated by""top-down""
 processes dependent on frontal cortical areas that generate and maintain cognitive expectancies. Dopaminergic reward pathways
 may underlie these expectancies"".[95]
 ""Diseases lacking major 'top-down' or cortically based regulation may be less prone to placebo-related improvement"".[96]","1388535561"

Sometimes I actually wanted to hurt her back, but I felt week inside because of her, so I spend my time in my own anger.


One night I had a dream, I don't remember how it started, but I remember at one point I was fighting with my mom. I wanted her to do something, which she was uncapable of, and that made me really angry. 
In the dream I felt really strong, and I started fighting my mom and physically hurting her.
Each time I hurt her, I grew bigger and she grew smaller, and at first that felt great, finally being the ""big one"". But with each hit, I also grew more angry, and the angrier I got the more I wanted to hurt my mom.

And then suddenly my mom tells me to stop, but in my voice, and I look down and it's me, and I am my mom.
And in the dream I had this epiphany, that hat only generates more hate, and no matter how much I would hurt my mom, it wouldn't help, because it would only make me more angry, and I would be the ""monster"" I hated.

After that I worked hard to turn things around.","1388535564"

"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","FYI, my Cerium LT hoody in size Large is 10.9 oz. 

I work at a outdoors store so I got a discount on it but if I were to buy a jacket at full price I'd also look at the Feathered Friends Daybreak, Marmot Quasar, and Montbell UL Down Parka. The Arc fits me great and its really warm but it doesn't have a waist drawstring and I miss it. It does have some elastic sewn into the waist that keeps it snug-ish but I'd prefer a drawstring. For reference the Arc also has 97g of 850FP down.
The Daybreak has a drawstring and is all down (Arc has some synthetic in places) and I like supporting small companies if I can. Its got 90g of 900FP down.
The Quasar is pretty sweet. We have it in our shop and its almost as lofty as the Arc but and has a drawstring waist and adds a chest pocket. That would be nice. And Marmot's specs are off, they have it listed as 13.1 oz but a thread on BPL said the Medium actually weighs 10.7 oz. Not sure how much down it has.
Saisann already mentioned the UL down parka, but it also has a drawstring. Only 70g of 800FP down though.
If you're looking for sub-8 oz jackets the Outdoor Research Filament looks nice but there's no hooded version. The Montbell EX Light pullover is also in that weight range but, again, doesn't have a hood.","1388535570"

Basically, putting the TV show and the Movies in the same universe greatly limits how good one of them can be and since movies are seen by more people than the tv show, it's likely the tv show's quality will suffer.
It's very difficult to put both universes together and if you want the highest quality for the tv shows then it's best to keep them separate. ","1388535573"

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","No, it doesn't work that way.

In-N-Out is private, but they are NOT trying to restrict sales!  They have been carefully expanding for years and will keep doing so.

There are a few reasons unique to the company why they don't expand faster.  One, they have a careful supply chain and are particular about food quality.  They cannot expand until they can supply a region adequately.

Second, they only promote from within, so the amount of new managers is somewhat limited.  They are not going to just hire a bunch of people off the street.  You have to be in their corporate culture for several years and know how everything works before you get a restaurant.

Third, there's no way to know for sure because they're private, but fast food chains are VERY particular about locations.  McDonald's does *amazing* work on the real estate end - they own most of the property and the corporation makes most of its money on rent, believe it or not.  McDonald's has lots of analysts and lawyers to nail down the best locations.  It's safe to assume that In-N-Out has a similar process for locations.  They probably buy the land, but they won't buy just any old commercial lot.  They need a thumbs up from the property analysts.

So when you have a limited supply chain, limited new management and are particular about new locations, growth is not as rapid as it could be.  

I think In-N-Out is very smart and they do business the right way.  That is much bigger than paying employees well - they seem to do everything well.  

Also, I do not like companies with shareholders.  Shareholders are bent on short-term gains.  They file lawsuits when they're not happy, they can hurt the company with stock trades, and much else.  Further, it is *very* expensive for publicly-traded companies to comply with SEC requirements.  Add that all up, and you have huge costs and a load of perverse incentives.

If I can rant a little, I'd like to see shareholders become financially liable for corporations.  Today, corporations can be complete assholes and if they cause a real mess, no problem!  The worst that can happen is that your shares become worthless.  On the other hand, profits flow right through to shareholders.  I think that's wrong.  If you get profits, you should also be responsible for losses.

If that happened, corporate America would become a *very* different place.  Corporations would shape up practically overnight.  As you'd expect, the possibility of actually being responsible for things instead of just reaping profits with no risk freaks those people out.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Exactly. It took too long. As a result it would have been a much better product if it had stuck to one of the things it was trying to do. Gargantia could have been a great Slice of Life. It could have also been a good drama. The episode length does not help at all, and the result is that it feels rushed. Don't get me wrong. I really do like Gargantia. I just feel that it would have been of much higher quality if it only did one of the things it had done. 

As for Samurai Flamenco, I really feel as if it has changed a bit too much, or at least too suddenly after too long. The tone is still over-the-top as it was before with exaggerated characters acting like their usual antics, but [ep 7](/s ""the superpowered villains feel out-of-place and pointless when they're so ridiculous and gagworthy. Frankly, it just feels like a huge troll, and as that idol-girl put it, they're just like monsters of the week. If the show had tried to be even a little grounded with their villains, say a super-powered humanlike villian instead of a straight up guillotine/horse/goon monster, it would have at least kept a tiny bit of sense."")

You tense up as it looks like he's going for his knife.

BANG.

... That wasn't a gun. Everyone flinches and turns around.

Lump. He has his Mask on, an old Hockey Goalies mask with strips of raw heavy metal. He has a chainsaw strapped to his back. And a sawed off shotgun in his hand. But its not the gun that went off. Its his fist.

He's slammed it into the side of the concrete wall. And *left a dent.* He looks angry.

""LUMP NOT LIKE ANGRY FIGHTY IN WARREN. SHUDDUP AND BE NICE. OR LUMP DO HURTY.""

He stares intently. You've seen this before. When Lump gets pissed, shit *dies.* Everyone.. and I mean *everyone* starts backing off.

Except you. You can't help but smile. Maybe it won't be so bad with him on your side after all. 

Regina chirps up quietly. Of course she wouldn't let this die; ""Lump, we just don't want you to risk your life for something some outsider is saying *might* be an answer. We love you down here, man."" People around her mumble in agreement. ""This .. *Kid* says there is an answer to all of this there. But every scout we have sent has died. Its not worth it.""

Roachdude throws his knife down into the dirt when she says this; people are started until he gets down on one knee and starts drawing with the knife..

He .. isn't a bad artist apparently.

He draws a ring of thorns and barbed wire. 

And then a lightbulb in the middle...

It clicks immediately. *You protect things that are valueble; especially the truth.* So this is why he hasn't bothered handing back his crap and abandoned you. This is the real deal for him.

Cassie whimpers slightly through her tough exterior.. ""If I share what I know with someone you consider an insider that you trust, and they vouch for this... will you back the fuck off?""

Creative wise it went down hill with things like Russo doing stupid shit with the title. The biggest flop (In my opinion) was the Hogan vs Jarrett issue.

Also, try to always look at what you could have done better. Never assume you lost a game because of your teamates, always ask yourself after a game or even during what you could have done better. I didn't write it down in a journal like some people do, but if that helps you go for it. Also, focus on your cs. Killing creeps should be at your number 1 of how to get better at league. If you can get a 50 cs advantage over your opponent then you can snowball from it. Luckily I mained support so I didn't have to focus on cs'ing, however I still learned how important it was along my path to diamond. Focus on your decision making as well, because I often see silver people just making terrible calls mid through late game. For example, if you get 2 kills bot from a gank, don't just go back to base or continue farming. Go take dragon and try to snowball your lane from that. Also, be aware what level you are and what level your lane opponent is. If he is level 2 and you are level 1, play passive so he can't all in you. Also, if you are level 2 and your opponent is level 1, try to all in them when they go for cs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;To be 100% fair here, people usually want more.

Some people do. As far as I've seen, most people just want to exist without having to push themselves too much.

We have a guy in our office - let's call him Stan. Stan is a solid guy. Nice. Young. Able. He puts in the minimum amount of work possible. Suddenly the dynamics of the company are shifting, and there are jobs going away. The company is downsizing a few positions, and it's musical chairs for the last few open spots. Think anyone wants to keep Stan around? Not a chance. Another worker, let's call her Jill, is also young, and a go getter. She produces, and is constantly trying to find ways to add value to the company. Within 30 days, she's going to end up landed in his job, and he'll be out having to look. Oh, the company will do it the way it's done now: they'll close his position, and open up a ""new"" position and allow them both to apply for it. But so far as I can tell, it's a done deal.

There are way more Stans than Jills out there. I've seen it again and again. It's relatively easy to distinguish yourself in middle America and make yourself indispensable to whoever is signing your paychecks. People are lazy, and if you force yourself to not be so, and look for ways to add value in everything that you do, eventually you'll find yourself with opportunities that you never imagined before.

Most people wouldn't know what to do with opportunity if it sat in front of them. Most people aren't in a state of mind to recognize it for what it is. Most people see the world as an unfair place, and themselves being the chief victim.","1388535581"

It does not mean that you are at that wage the whole time. you start at minimum and then progress to a better wage. You get a promotion or because you have worked there ""X"" amount of time you will be paid better. However, you need to show that you are worth that extra pay.

For example, I was paid minimum wage for the first 6 months of my very first job. Since then I have progressed via promotions and hard work. I transferred to other companies that saw my potential and gave me a raise to switch companies. I now make a large multiple of minimum wage at the company I work for. I really don't worry about living paycheck to paycheck. I can take a vacation whenever I want to.

People that only work minimum wage their whole life are there because they want to. Either Because they don't want to work hard for it or because they are comfortable with the position they are in. In either case, I'm not in the least concerned with their predicament. They are there because they want to.

And if you plan to run both together, you'd need the same card, another 560 Ti, you'd also need a capable PSU.

My suggestion: If you plan to mine doge 24/7 go for 7850 or above on AMD's tree (note that these are well over original retail price because they're always sold out due to us and LTC miners) the higher end cards are good for gaming, but you'd be paying a lot for those, if you can afford it, go for a 290x. If your wallet is too tight for one of those, go for a 770-780 Ti, these aren't nearly as good for mining, but they get the job done.","1388535584"

"news","t5_2qh3l","YES I WAS USING HYPERBOLE, THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT.

My point stands, even though we *both* know I wasn't literally suggesting that passengers could carry firearms on board. Do you hate security? How much of a hassle it is? Would you choose an airline that promised that its security would not be a hassle? Many people would, and they would not be able to determine if security was less of a hassle because it was streamlined, or because it was reduced.

Security protects the public. Corporations protect their profits. If security is run by airlines, then security will be optimized to make airlines profitable, which means, of course, that there would be one airline with very low security, to get the market niche of people who hate security and don't fear hijackings, and one airline with very, very high security, to get the market niche of people who are paranoid.

Of course, if somebody decided to crash a plane into a building, they would buy tickets for the low-security airline, because nobody would hassle them for anything suspicious, because the profit comes from low-impact security, and any security officer who held up the line would be fired immediately--because terrorism is not frequent, and customer dissatisfaction is constant.

This is the risk of privatizing public services: the incentives for private companies often do not align with the public good. In this case, that's moral hazard: the airlines do not feel the risk of lighter security as much as the public does. As long as they make more profit, they'll tolerate more attacks. If you can prove that more security will improve the profitability of the airlines, then the security would improve; otherwise, security would actually get worse.

The free market doesn't fix everything, and blind faith in privatization often leads to boondoggles.","1388535587"

Super Mario 3D World is a good game, would have been a good launch title but oh well. It tries a few things to keep things interesting. It's not something I'd run out and spend $299 to play (in this economy), but throw in Zelda Wind Waker HD and Mario Kart 8 (this spring) and $299 seems like a good deal for the content. 

All the next generation consoles are looking to be over priced and underwhelming, but Wii U's library of games is shaping up. I think at a minimum give these consoles 18 months from launch to prove themselves. Asking top dollar for little content is ridiculous other than for the bragging rights of being a beta tester for everyone else who ends up buying the inevitable cheaper, better, version of the console.","1388535590"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I went to middle school with her, although we never talked much. As a freshman in high school we began talking on Facebook, and although I lived in another state, I fell in love with her and we started a long-distance relationship thing. Typical cheesy high school kid love. After two years of endless talking on the phone and texting, I moved back to the city where she now lived, where we went to middle school, and where she went to high school. I went to her same high school, finally got to see her for many years, and all around it was fantastic. I dabbled in drugs here and there and I was much more focused on this new world than her. I started paying less and less attention to her, but she was always there. Smiling and putting up with it.

Next thing I know my mom had to move to get back with my dad. So after a deep depression I finally managed to say goodbye to her on a sidewalk, where for hours on end she just layed in my arms remembering all the good times we had. With tears in her eyes, she finally said goodbye, and walked away. That was the last time I saw her sweet smile, her deep blue eyes, and felt her touch. 

When I moved away we maintained the relationship for a few months.

One night I couldn't sleep and I knew something was wrong so I called her. She said she couldn't handle it anymore, she couldn't do this long-distance thing where she can't even see her own boyfriend. She was sobbing saying sorry and we can still be friends and so on. I just said ""ok.. goodnight"" and hung up.

I haven't talked to her since then, that was three years ago. Actually, I've texted her just recently but she doesn't really talk much. There's nothing to talk about anymore, and she doesn't have that enthusiasm to talk to me she had long, long ago. She's moved on. Now she is nothing but a phantom, a memory, a character in a story I seemed to have made up.

More than a mere girlfriend, she was my best friend. She was the only one I could talk to. Now I have no one. I miss her everyday of my life.","1388535590"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","The reason that deficit spending boost demand is GDP = C + I + G + (X-M). To end the paradox of thrift causing the shortfall in C (consumption) and I (investment), government artificially boost GDP by increasing G to bring GDP back in line. However, if ΔG is financed by increased taxes, then it comes at the expenses of C and I. As a result, the impact on short term GDP is neutral *at best*.

The tax cut works in reverse. While holding G steady, it increases both C and I as people have more money in hand that they can either spend or invest. I consider it less effective than increasing G (which, in turn, is less effective than monetary stimulus), since it still runs into the paradox of thrift, but it can work.

I'm on a bit of an unstable connection (and some of you have been unlucky enough to queue with me, for which I am *so* sorry) which, while not having been stellar in the past, always used to be good enough for Dota. Now, though, I'm getting absolutely game-breaking lag spikes that last several fucking seconds (usually during big clashes too, so I can't do shit), ruining the matches for me as well as my team mates. Haven't been able to figure out what the problem is, downloading etc. works fine. :(

Which brings me to the rest of the games I've been playing: Steam Sale purchases! Woo! Let's see...

I got myself **Space Engineers**, which despite being pretty bare gameplay-wise, is still pretty neat already. I've sunk, like, three hours into it in a few sessions, just building single parts to space stations and whatnot. If future updates actually make it, like, interactive and add shit to do, it'll definitely become one of my go-to offline games.

*Finally* bought **Don't Starve** when it was 75 percent off or something, and it's great! I have no fucking clue what I'm doing lol, but the unique look and everything is pretty enjoyable. Plays very smoothly too.

Another early access game I got is **~~Sir~~ Madam, You Are Being Hunted**. You don't really do much more than run around bleak procedurally generated islands and collect shit, but the atmosphere is extremely well done. The robots hunting you are sufficiently British, the landscape is nicely bleak and creepy, and trying to hide from the robots can be very nerve-wrecking. I even got my fiancée to stay and watch me play over my shoulder, which doesn't happen a whole lot.

Also played some more **Terraria** and **Starbound**, but I feel like those will just collect dust again once I can get my Doto going again.

I also bought **Dungeon Defenders**, **Gnomoria** and was gifted **Trine 2** by the extremely generous and awesome /u/OthelloNYC, but I haven't got around to playing them just yet. Same with **Left 4 Dead 2** when it was free that one day the Steam Store was down lel

---

DQ: Either something involving an e-sports organisation or something where you'd get to know players, games, tournaments, and all that... or, really, I'd also watch devs work on **Aquanox 3** just because that'd mean the game was actually in development. Sigh.","1388535595"

"Africa","t5_2qh1p","I think a really good, comprehensive, and easy-to-read summation of African history from the independence struggle(s) to now is the Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith.  It's a big book (like 800 pages) but it's organized into lots of chapters so you can pick and choose based on what you want to read about.  It covers quite a bit, everything from Nkrumah to Rwanda's genocide, so you're going to have lots of information.  Make sure you get the ""Fate of Africa"" though, and not the previous edition called ""the State of Africa"".  The recent one added chapters about Africa's recent democratization and economic growth, which is pretty necessary for a full picture.  The previous edition was attacked as being too pessimistic, so the newer one is better.

If you want a good explanation of Africa's structural problems, Jeffrey Herbst's States and Power is Africa is my go-to.  It explains why Africa is rather unlucky with regards to development.","1388535596"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","   For me, the quality of the writing was the biggest selling point for me. (Meaning the actual writing itself, sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph). Fantasy/Sci-Fi, as a genre tends to contain a lot of sub-par writers. Having someone that elevates the genre is something that many fans cherish.  

   Most of the issues you complained about are big picture things (plot stricture mostly). It's possible that the plot, action, setting, or characters just don't appeal to you. If that is case, you are simply not going to enjoy the book that much no matter how good other elements of it are. Of course, a good writer can make a story enjoyable even when the subject matter doesn't appeal to you and a bad writer can ruin a story you would otherwise enjoy. 

  Back to my point about the writing though, if you really enjoy both good writing and the subject matter from the fantasy genre, there aren't many books were you can find both (Rothfuss, Guy Gavriel Kay, &amp; R Scott Bakker come to mind, but they are definitely in the minority). Personally, whenever I come across a fantasy novel where I can actually quote multiple lines, that is something I cherish (and tend to recommend quite exuberantly). And, there's a lot of good lines from the name of the wind.  I put two here just to make the point. The first is the one from the end of chapter one (and it was that chapter and this quote that really sold me on the book)
""The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn’s ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.""

Then there's this one, which paints a picture of the scene so well that I can't think of a way to improve it:
""It slowly began to dawn on me that I had been staring at her for an impossible amount of time. Lost in my thoughts, lost in the sight of her. But her face didn't look offended or amused. It almost looked as if she were studying the lines of my face, almost as if she were waiting. 
I wanted to take her hand. I wanted to brush her cheek with my fingertips. I wanted to tell her that she was the first beautiful thing that I had seen in three years. The sight of her yawning to the back of her hand was enough to drive the breath from me. How I sometimes lost the sense of her words in the sweet fluting of her voice. I wanted to say that if she were with me then somehow nothing could ever be wrong for me again. 
In that breathless second I almost asked her. I felt the question boiling up from my chest. I remember drawing a breath then hesitating--what could I say? Come away with me? Stay with me? Come to the University? No. Sudden certainty tightened in my chest like a cold fist. What could I ask her? What could I offer? Nothing. Anything I said would sound foolish, a child's fantasy. 
I closed my mouth and looked across the water. Inches away, Denna did the same. I could feel the heat of her. She smelled like road dust, and honey, and the smell the air holds seconds before a heavy summer rain. 
Neither of us spoke. I closed my eyes. The closeness of her was the sweetest, sharpest thing I had ever known.""

Wage theft is fucking rampant, especially in the service industry, and double especially for undocumented workers.  FYI, the FLSA protects all workers in the USA regardless of immigration status.  You can not be punished for being undocumented and complaining about a federal, state, or local labor violation.

Source: I am currently in a legal case against my former employer.  [Back story here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1r18f9/to_the_3_suits_who_walked_out_on_your_96_check_at/)

OTHER FORMS OF WAGE THEFT:

- Management taking your tips or making you tip out staff such as kitchen workers

- Holding you accountable for walk outs, damages, losses, etc.

So, now that I got some basics out of the way, I'd like to inform everyone here that NJ has some seriously amazing laws, such as the [Conscientious Employee Protection Act.](http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2013/12/new_brunswick_becomes_first_town_in_state_to_adopt_ordinance_banning_wage_theft.html)  I hope everyone at least glances at that (PDF warning).  NJ is by and large VERY friendly to the employee.  My battle is in NYC so there are some slight nuances of the law there that I'm dealing with, but if anyone reading this is dealing with ANY form of wage theft and needs help, CONTACT ME at any time and I can refer you to a very dedicated firm in NJ that can help you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;  Why should somebody who makes 100 grand pay 60% income tax while somebody who makes less only pays 50%? 

To pay for the upkeep of public infrastructure they use to derive their income or profits. More income usually = more use of that infrastructure. Also, unless your tax system is completely arse-backwards, they'll still have more money than people who earn less and pay less taxes.

&gt; minimum wages doesn't benefit the whole society. It simply relocates money from person A (the employer who now makes less profit) to person B

People in lower income brackets tend to spend more money when they have more money, which leads to their cash being injected directly back into the economy when they buy goods and services, increasing demand for that stuff and creating jobs.

&gt; other economists think it will hurt the economy since there are less investments and savings on the company's side

Those investments can now occur through a range of different businesses because more people are able to buy their stuff.

Yeah any barrows you have would be great. Since RS3/EOC the main defence/combat triangle orientation comes from helm, body and bottoms. Whereas boots/gloves don't count *as much* so you can mix Gano boots/gloves, which are non-degradable, for the added armour/hp and it won't bend the combat triangle for your set up. Plus they're cheap (30k-40k for both).

This is why you see high level players only wearing ragefire glacor boots (magic) with melee sets. Cause it's the cheapest of the lot - ha.

So in conclusion: use degradable barrows for defence, then with more money kit yourself out with better equipment. Hope that helps! ","1388535608"

After 5-10 mins of simmering strain the avb out of the milk, or if u only put a stem in just take it out when the stem is clear. Once it's all strained and yummy then put it in a mug and put hot cocoa mix into it and stir. Put more mix in if it tastes gross still. Then chug it.

Make sure u use whole milk or 1/2 n 1/2 or something, needs to be reaaaally fatty. ","1388535612"

"stunfisk","t5_2sn6d","On my special Mega Lucario i run Nasty Plot, Aura Sphere (adaptability), Flash Cannon (adaptability) and Dark Pulse (coverage). Vacuum wave is an option over Dark Pulse for priority but my team is packed with aqua jet, shadow sneak and brave bird so i'd rather have the extra coverage against Ghosts. Between Aura Sphere and Dark Pulse and Flash Cannon, Mega Lucario gets perfect neutral coverage. 

The potential 20% flinch chance on Dark Pulse (which is why it's better than Shadow Ball seeing as they hit the same types and Aura Sphere covers Dark and Fighting types resisting Dark Pulse) can also get you out of sticky situations and allows Special Mega Lucario a way (however unreliable) to potentially beat Aegislash 1 v 1. 

In Smogon OU, Timid Mega Lucario is only outsped by Jolteon, Alakazam, Dugtrio, Starmie, Talonflame, Greninja and Noivern (off the top of my head).

Vacuum Wave won't really help against Talonflame, Alakazam, Starmie and Noivern so really it's only helpful against Dugtrio (which is normally sashed and will ohko you with earthquake), Greninja (assuming it's Protean Dark), and Jolteon.

If you do fear potential Choice scarf users such as choice scarf Excadrill (or similarly sand rush Exca), Terrakion and Hydreigon then Vacuum Wave is an option (but won't ohko either unless at +2 with Nasty Plot). Vacuum Wave does ohko Scarf Tyranitar seeing as they don't invest in bulk. 

At the end of the day, vacuum wave isn't really necessary on every team but there might be a place for it on your team. ","1388535613"

Petulant children that never grow up and become whiny children in adult bodies. 'Nobles,' incapable of even understand basic concepts a normal child knows.""

He turned to the girl.

""In the end, you are only you, your ancestors mean little to anyone else. You think your 'noble blood' will protect you? The world does not care about who you think you are. Act like you're superior and the world will be eager to show you just how wrong you are.""

Atrus walked past her toward the town center.

""And as for the incest remark, I've seen family trees of noble houses, though pretty mutant trees they must be. Branches coiling round each other as cousin marries cousin and uncle marries niece.""

The most baffling part of TheBluePill/SRS is how not one single person from these sites ever tries to disprove the allegations against them or whoever they fight on behalf of without resorting to mockery, spiteful commentary, and deceit. I don't know about you, but I'd think a sub devoted to satirizing TRP, as the more rational and civil party, would be making fun of red pill concepts by providing examples from reality that completely and utterly counters the notions it purports in an amusing light-heated manner that not only shows TRP is bunk, but also proves women aren't going to behave like wild bitches that don't understand humor or irony.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","For someone who has back pain/injury repeated flexion under load places a great deal of compressive stress through a range of repeated flexion and extension. This creates microtrauma and/or can create, exacerbate or herniate an existing spinal bulge. 

&gt;There is nothing wrong with using the abdominals to flex the spine - it's a matter of stabilization and correct muscle firing patterns.

Look, you can say ""There is nothing wrong with a person with knee pain doing sprints and deep jump squats as long as they have perfect form, stabilization and correct muscle firing patters"". But that doesn't mean you rehab them with springs and jump squats, that's not how rehab fucking works. 

People with back pain almost always have bad stabilization and incorrect muscle firing patterns. You correct those with...not crunches which have the propensity to do damage without and possibly even with perfect form and put a huge amount of compression on the spine through repeated flexion...but with isometric exercises that show measurably lower spinal compression and flexion with just as or higher abdominal challenge. You can introduce situps if you want when they are pain free but I really see no point to as there really is such little benefit to them for their risks.

Rupert is a U. S.  citizen.  

Publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch became a U.S. citizen in September 1985, during a 15-minute ceremony with about 200 other immigrants in New York. 

Murdoch took the oath out of necessity. He wanted to become a force in U.S. broadcasting, and U.S. law and the Federal Communications Commission does not permit foreigners to hold major stakes in U.S. networks. 

Asked why he became an American citizen, Murdoch’s response was typically gruff: “Because I wanted to.”

But steel rails do rust - when you think of a picture of a rail, what you see is, not shiny metal, but a heavy piece of steel, with a coating of red rust! But the rusting isn't generally a bit problem. The alloy they use for rails doesn't rust readily, and the rail is big and heavy, so a bit of the metal lost to rust doesn't matter for a long time.

&gt; You have all sorts of crazy psychic space magic going down, the queen possessing a dead or mortally wounded Asari just to speak to Shepard would instantly rule in the likelihood of additional telepathic abilities.
&gt; This isn't the time to go all Scully on me :P

Well mostly based on the fact that it seems that every sentient race evolves in similar manners to humans or other earth species. The Salarians are clearly amphibian-like. The asari are human-like. The turians and krogan are both reptile-like. The Rachni hatch eggs and act similarly to other insect life on earth and other alien planets, so it would be logical to assume that they may share other traits with those insects, such as not being able to communicate with them while they're still in their egg. 

&gt;That's not what I was questioning, I was questioning if they cared. Pigs have feelings, we still butcher them. Why wouldn't another species we've had no previous verbal contact with not have different morales and instincts?


They could totally have different morals than every other race, though that once again seems fairly unlikely given that every sentient race discovered thus far has had extremely, improbably similar moral and government systems. Even if they did, we wiped them out the first time. They're rebuilding from a single mother and the council races are just getting stronger and stronger. The next time a Rachni invasion would happen, it would be a slaughter now that humanity entered the mix, along with krogans now being a space faring civilization (and possibly having a short-term genophage cure to reproduce faster), not to mention the countless technology improvements in weaponry. 

Sure, a lot of soldiers on both sides would die, but is genocide better than war? I mean, obviously when self interest comes into play, it is, but from an outside perspective, is killing off one race so they don't start a war that they will likely lose a smart thing to do? Both species will survive and possibly unite in the future if a war happens, but genocide? The Rachni are gone from existence, period. 

I think that unless they pose an active threat to the safety of the council races, they should be spared. That's all there is to it. They obviously don't pose an active threat; there's only one queen in existence. That queen knows nothing of the prior war, there's no reason to believe she would be as hostile as her former generation. Granted, there's no reason to believe she isn't as hostile either, but I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy. Innocent until proven guilty.

Between turns generating minimum of 32 mana from Titana and arch druid, Elvish Guidance x2 with arbor elf 64. 96 ish mana. I think channler still has summoning sickness. IMMACULATE on fathom again.

In theory you can do fun stuff like doing one stomp that will hit in front and then a cross up LK, but you need to land in a very specific angle to the opponent. It's not practical. Since the jump is so floaty anyways, what good is a better hitbox on such a specific move?

PS: By the way... 5th hit of EX SBK has its hitbox expanded upwards? Why the fifth? Who's still in the air above Chun by that time? Why not make the move suck the opponent in like all Tatsus do, instead of propelling them away while hitting only once for 30dmg?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;HEHE TRY LE BERTSTRIPS!!!

Never heard anyone say it like that. 

","1388535645"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a 'nice guy', who has 'finished last' a lot, I believe this is a generalization, but has there is a truth in it, which I believe is closer to something like 'Why does being nice not get me to where I want to be?'. There is a lot of good advice and some truths in these comments already such as being funny, being able to offer something, and not worshiping the ground girls walk on, moving on after a rejection, etc.. so I'll add my own $1.02. 

You are probably willing to help girls and guys alike when they ask for help, for nothing in return. You probably don't see what is so attractive about going out and getting drunk and risk getting jailed, and you probably too intelligent to understand why you need to wear your pants around your ankles to be stylish. You are not doing anything wrong, and I guarantee you there is a girl out there that appreciates an honest and caring guy, but who knows where she is and when she is going to appear, so for now you do need to change if you want access to those social cliques you see around you.

Firstly, you have to be attractive. I'm sorry if this sounds cliche, but if you want to get close to a girl, she has to feel comfortable being seen with you. However, even ugly guys can get laid, and this is where style comes in. Ditch the baggy, comfortable pants, get some slim jeans, get a collared shirt from a good brand, or better yet, ask a sister or other female friend who is stylish and willing help you. Girls love doing this. Worst case, if you have no help, check the internet, browse fashion magazines, find a persona that you think you are close to, and try matching it... no fedoras please... So now you look like a douche on MTV, but that is what is popular, and just because you dress nice, doesn't mean you have to have the same attitude.

When helping people out, make sure you are benefiting from it, or get favors in return. For example; ask other people for help more often, but it has to be honest, and you have to know they can actually help you, and not trying to drag them into helping you when you know they can't. When they directly refuse to help you, then that is fine, just don't help them in the future. This is when you know you are being used. This is where people start thinking you have become a bit of an asshole, when in truth, you just started standing up for yourself. When a cute girl asks you for help, say it straight and with confidence (not arrogance) “Listen. I like helping you, but if I help you I want a favor in return.” If she says ok, then push forward  “There is a new movie/bowling alley/concert I want to see/do/goto, and I'd like you to go with me” If they say no, its up to you if you want to help them just as a friend, or not help if you feel you are being used, but now at least you have made your interest clear.

And lastly, be able to relax. This is where I still fail sometimes. I still don't see the benefit to getting sloshed every Friday, or breaking the law in small but self satisfying ways, and this cost me a relationship. An average girl wants to have fun, and get a thrill out of life. At your age this means doing possibly risky things. Don't force an opportunity, but if you ever have the chance to go to a party, just say sure. You can draw your lines, and you need to be able to walk away when they are doing something stupid, and not worth the consequences (hard drugs, breaking and entering, etc..), because if this is what it takes to get the girl you are interested in.. then it is not worth it. Also, don't do anything compromising that can be used against you in the future. I take my own risks in my own ways, but being older and independent gives you more legal options.

Keep in mind a lot of what I just said can be generalized into larger situations... basically, be confident, be able to adapt and willing to change, and appearance matters. If you don't want to change, then don't. Like I said, there are other girls out there, be patient, but there are benefits to having 'fun' when you are young.  Good luck and wish you the best.","1388535645"

If you speak Spanish you can spot a Mexican/US accent (Granted the US one has a really heavy English influence) right off the bat, but for some reason a lot of Mexican players are very quiet with regards to the mic. I presume because of all the hate I see South American players give them if they try to say anything. 

The amount of racism between South Americans and Central Americans who both speak Spanish is staggering. ","1388535653"

"WarshipPorn","t5_2tg3p","USS Pueblo (AGER-2) is an American ELINT and SIGINT[1] Banner-class technical research ship (Navy intelligence) which was boarded and captured by North Korean forces on 23 January 1968, in what is known as the Pueblo incident or alternatively as the Pueblo crisis or the Pueblo affair. The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on Pueblo during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y.[2] The capture, less than a week after President Lyndon B. Johnson's State of the Union address and only a week before the start of the Tet Offensive, and subsequent 11-month prisoner drama were major incidents in the Cold War.

North Korea stated that Pueblo strayed into their territorial waters, but the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident.[3]

Pueblo, still held by North Korea today, officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy.[4] She was moored along the Taedong River in Pyongyang, and used there as a museum ship. Pueblo is the only ship of the U.S. Navy currently being held captive.[5]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pueblo_(AGER-2)#USS_Pueblo_incident

Edit: If any of you are interested in knowing more about the pueblo incident, check out the book ""Act of War"" by Jack Cheevers. I'm reading it right now and it's incredibly fascinating and very well written. North Korea maintained (still maintains?) a 12 mile coastal boundary that no enemy ships are permitted to cross. According to the commanding officer of the ship, Lloyd Bucher, the ship was at least 16 miles from the North Korean coast when Sub Chaser 35 caught up to them and threatened to fire on the ship unless they ""heaved to"". The men were captured and endured weeks of terrible torture and interrogation at the hands of their captors and they all became severely malnourished.","1388535659"

I thought you'd met your doom and it was unlikely that we'd ever find out the exact circumstances ... well, don't apologize for real life stuff, it's good that you're alive and well. I never let go of the idea of this project, it would please me very much to put out the basic or experimental patch that I posted about earlier (covering possibly the quests, diary entries, letters, items, and maybe the first day for the three PCs), but I only did a little bit to entertain myself and the fandom on Tumblr, poking around the script, jumping around translating things that I like, compiling a bible of terminology and that kind of thing, so a lot of fooling around and not a significant amount of actual work - most of the past few months was spent hoping for the database, and then I got my hands on the scripts, but shortly thereafter I got suspicious about how to stick them back in the game and put everything to a halt until we could figure it out. So although I haven't been able to quit playing with the text (like I've said in the past, I really like translating as a hobby) I haven't done enough yet to create a significant enough body of work. Fortunately, I'm on winter break until the end of January and I'm already bored stiff, I've been dying for a project, if I can ask you to let me have a few weeks first I'll able to get enough done to justify such a creation. It would make me very happy to produce something at this crucial moment, especially so that it can generate some interest for the remake when the Kickstarter comes up.","1388535664"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","That doesn't mean things will magically get better with any other future relationship, some people are just bad at marriage and long term relationships and it's not a reason to endlessly seek perfection or a reason to endless reject companionship, it's just our own individualism at work. We all should face the reality that at some points in our lives we get our best shots at things, but we will never know which one was the best choice. We don't all get to be astronauts and we don't all live story book romances. This could be as good as it gets.. or it might be just the opposite. One thing is certain though, there is no way anyone on reddit knows the outcome of this persons life, thus anyone saying to marry or not marry for reasons X is just arrogantly talking out their ass and trying to project their lives and opinions onto others. 

Sometimes our mistakes are our greatest achievements in life. Maybe you get in a less then fulfilling relationship, but you push through and deal with it and wind up with an amazing job and child or your responsible for a breakthrough in your field. Would you really want to go back and change things at the risk of losing one to gain the other? 

I say we let people make their own decisions. Point out the pros and cons, but don't EVER give people direct advice on a decision of this importance. It's childish to think your random advice to a person you don't know at all will be beneficial.

"RadicalChristianity","t5_2ty95","&gt;In the rest of this blog, I name a major American cultural value that has pervasively affected American Christianity: the ethos and ideology of individualism. We are, according to many studies, the most individualistic country in the world.
Individualism as an ideology should not be confused with the value of individuals. Individuals matter. It is a central affirmation of the Bible and Christianity: we all matter to God. Individuals and progress in individual rights, human rights, matter.
But individualism as an ideology is quite different. It is the notion that how our lives turn out is primarily the product of our individual achievement. Those who do well do so because they have made the most of their opportunities. It is the notion of the “self-made” person.
This ideology generates a politics and economics that privileges the successful: they deserve the fruits of their achievement. It dominates the political right, Christian and non-Christian alike. Most often absent or minimized is a concern for “the common good,” except perhaps when it is alleged to be the product of maximizing individual opportunities.


Here's my problem with Christianity. On the positive hand, christianity fusing with Platonism gave rise to the modern ""individual"". Pre-socratic and Hellenic Greek culture was a kind of transitional mode out of tribal and thus shamanistic thinking.

We can actually view the Jewish weaponization of monotheism as a political tool as the de facto creation of *the archetypal individual*. A priceless pre-requisite of nationalism and thus modern political modes of ""agency"" and containment.

The individual soul concerned with hell or heaven pulled kicking and screaming from the warm gooey typhonic tribal proteum.

Because we could not truly be individuals if we were not scared to death of hell. Nothing is more terrifying than death except an afterlife of eternal immolation. So we take the animalistic/primal fear of biologicsl survival and project it into the afterlife.

THIS is possibly the sickest most torturous, (and *sorcerous*) political charlatanism ever created. VERY powerful magic.

But my point is that christianity is really at the center, if not at the drawing board of many of these sticky existential problems. But instead of these supposedly ecumenical theologian types taking doctrinal responsibility for the creation of these problems, they instead attempt to insert christianity unwittingly (oh my, how in the world did we end up with THIS problem?) into the very center of these problems as somehow foreign to the inception of the problem, instead of as a force of perpetuation or as perpetrator of the madness, christianity tragically must solve this crisis.

There is a reason why the vampire big box churches are the most vocal perpetrators of this disgusting *materialist* ideology.

As you said, it is very subjective especially unpredictability. 2^nd for Serie A (top 3 are separated by 10 points) and 3^rd for Bundesliga (11pts between the top 3) are quite surprising, while La Liga have the top 3 separated by 5 points - with Atletico and Barca separated by 2 goals.

Making a more reasonable La Liga 2^nd, Seria A 3^rd and Bundesliga last, reduce the gap between the EPL and La Liga to a single point, which seems more adequate (and also quite marginal).","1388535670"

But... why Bilbo? Of all the major characters in The Hobbit, isn't he pretty much the most stereotypically feminine in traits?

Why not Thorin Oakenshield? Or Gandalf the Grey?

Why do so many feminists talk at great length about deconstructing the social stereotypes that make up what we think is true about genders, but then always seemingly want characters who reinforce those same stereotypes in ways that appeal to them?","1388535670"

I have been working the service line at a VW dealership for 10 years, and I have never heard the noise at 1:00...

...but I have a guess.

So, I noticed you have an aftermarket radio installed. Did the person that performed the install have access to VW wiring diagrams? What did they do about the Soundaktor? 

The Soundaktor creates artificial ""Engine Noise"" to mask the unpleasant clatter that the TFSI engines normally produce. It is mounted on the bulkhead. I believe this is what you are hearing. It is wired into the radio to adjust the output of the Soundaktor.

Since the noise only occurs when the aftermarket radio is activated diagnosis and repair will likely *not* be covered by VW.

I hope this helps!

"RandomActsofMakeup","t5_2vigj","I have 2 favorites when it comes to makeup removers:

**1. [RMK Cleansing Balm](http://www.beautybay.com/skincare/rmk/cleansingbalmm/)** - This comes in a jar with a little spatula under the lid. The balm is light pink and solid when it's in the jar but will melt when you place it on your skin. You take a little bit of the balm and rub it over your face. It's gentle enough to use on your eyelids as well. Your makeup will simply come off and mix with the balm liquid. Then you just wash it off and towel lightly and you've got a makeup free face =) I love this balm because it's so fun to use (the whole solid balm melting thing when you rub it on your face is kind of cool), it works really well in terms of ability to remove makeup, and it leaves my face feeling refreshed with a light rose smell. Unfortunately this product is also really expensive... especially since RMK products are not readily available in the US. 


**2. [Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/makeup+remover+cleansing+towelettes+-+25+count.do)** - This is what I usually use because they're cheap and easily accessible (I buy them in bulk from Costco, it's less than $20 for 100 some sheets). They just work really well and feels gentle on my skin. They don't really leave much of a fragrance so pretty solid product all around. I think I've been using these for 10 years or something @__@

So a bit about my skin - I have combo skin (oily when I wakeup and gets drier and drier over the day...) and very acne prone :(","1388535672"

while dissonant, a lot of the this feels like it never really gets out of one key except for in a few moments. this gives it a certain drearyness. The motifs, etc are interesting enough, but it feels too static.

All I said is Ron Paul doesn't have the same affection for Israel as you claim AIPAC would make him. 

I don't know much about Ron Paul being an anti-semite, but I did a quick google search and got this: 

*A physician before entering politics, Paul got into considerable hot water in 2008 when The New Republic published “Angry White Man,” an article about the contents of newsletters he published. What the newsletters revealed, the magazine reported, “are decades worth of obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry against blacks, Jews and gays.” Paul denied writing the newsletters that bore his name.

It's kinda fair that a controversy such as this one would exist, considering the clearly anti-semitic, racist, and bigoted newsletter **did** have his name. I don't think it has anything to do with AIPAC, but nice try. ","1388535680"

I agree 100% with your point.  Generally, I try to add some comment to let readers know that I understand life isn't as cut &amp; dry as how I stack it up, but I may have missed it in my prior post.  There are no absolutes with life, as there are plenty of exceptions to whatever rule you can find.  Like your story, there are plenty of exceptions for whom simply ""ambition"" isn't the answer or the problem.  I think in all situations, whether involving depression, drugs, bad luck, or bad decisions, the single greatest gift you can give anyone is care and concern for them as an individual.  We, as a nation, have a bad habit of trying to throw money at problems for which the solution is humanitarian.  Like you noted, and I did in a prior post, many people are in their situations b/c they didn't have proper parents, role models, and people in their life to help them develop a vision for what their life *could* be.

My past experience has taught me that until someone wants to help themselves, when whatever it is that they are doing costs them more than what they can tolerate losing (whether that be money, resources, friends or family), there is nothing more that can be done.  I hate to say something that may sound insensitive but sometimes you just have to give an ultimatum:  *""Stop doing xyz or we can no longer be in your life...""*, and be prepared to follow through and stick to it if necessary.  As painful as it is, sometimes that is the only way that change can be brought about.  I also won't lead you into any delusions here, some folks never will change for the better no matter what stimulus or incentive/disincentive you use to try to compel them.  In this case, prepare for the worst but hope for the best and follow through on what you say.

Anyone see anything wrong with that scenario. I was even thinking why not build the pipeline and follow the railway right through the center of Toronto, Maybe build a refinery not to far from the Toronto and save on shipping costs. With half the population of Canada in that Corridor you couldn't go wrong. I would even take a guess that Ottawa would want a branch off the main pipeline to show the Parliamentarians looking out their windows the wealth Alberta is creating.

So, here's the thing, don't take this personally, but if you're having a hard time beating the computer on Moderate there's probably a lot more wrong with your game than a ZeroEmpires video or build order can do for you. So I'm going to give you a few tips you can focus on next time you play and hopefully these will improve your overall play:

1. The most important thing to remember no matter how you play or what you play is to keep the Town Center busy. Every single millisecond the TC is idle is a step back for you. Always build villagers. If you don't have enough food for villagers, you aren't putting enough of them on food sources. 

2. Advance quickly against the computer. Aim to hit Castle Age sometime between 15-20 minutes with 30 villagers. 

3. Against the computer you don't need to build military until Castle but when you do, don't stop. Always be building something - a knight, a Cav archer, a Mangonel... And this is in addition to rule 1. Don't stop building villager.

4. Production buildings. Build more of them. Especially in the Castle/Imperial Age. Two stables build two knights at once. If you have the resources to queue up more than one knight, build another stable and queue him up there.

5. Spend your resources. The turtle strategy involves walling up and going defensive and staying protected but it shouldn't mean hoarding your resources. If you have the food and gold, build the units you need.

6. Play Huns. Huns are one of the easiest civs to play and have the best units for fighting the computer - Knights and Cav archers. I've beaten 7 computers on hardest with just Cav archers and that will help you cause they're so cheap. Very effective civ for fighting the computer.

7. Use a large group of units to hit and run the computer who will almost always send their units in one big grouping at a time. Anticipate their path and intercept them. Should hold the computer at bay that way.

You're working voluntarily based on an agreed amount between the employer and yourself. If you don't have a choice because you will die otherwise, then that is your problem. You're a slave to life - not the economy. If we suppose there is no economy, you're still forced to hunt for food or else you'll die and that is how life works. With the economy, you can trade other services for food so instead of being forced to hunt, you're forced to work.

Don't be selfish to feel entitled enough to be paid luxuriously without working. Where do you think that money comes from? Off other people's hard work. No one is immune to economic slavery. If everyone stopped working to abolish economic slavery, then guess what? Everyone dies because there is no one to leech off of. Food doesn't magically prepare it self.

I am a supporter of a minimum wage (i.e. to cover basic necessities as the current minimum wage does). I am not a fan of a ""livable"" or luxurious wage because that would be taking advantage of the greater society's generosity.","1388535696"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","By Western Zodiac, I presume you mean the Babylonian Zodiac? 

I'm just trying to cover my bases just in case there is an actual zodiac set that originated all on its own in Europe. 

Quickie about the Babylonian Zodiac: 

Babylonians divided the changes seen in the sky into twelve parts and assigned each 'section' to a month starting at the Sun's vernal equinox (Aries comes first). As the earth orbit and as the moon orbit, the 'background' sky 'changes' (as in new constellations show up, etc). 

Now, the issue is that where the Chinese Zodiac signs came from is still discussed. The Chinese zodiacs were extremely popular during the Tang Dynasty (they are all over the potteries, etc) but were already known to the Chinese even way before that. Some say that the Zodiacs came via the Silk Road from a civilization in the West of China (Babylon anyone?), others suggest that it came from nomadic tribes that, like the Babylons, observed the heavens and noticed the strange changes in the sky. There is also a hypothesis that Chinese astronomy in which Jupiter was observed to orbit the earth every 12 years is the source of the zodiacs. 

But anyway, the Chinese zodiac is extremely Confucian. All animals have a purpose, a reason, and duty in society. ","1388535699"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Women weren't allowed to vote, that's kind of a big one. The treatment of women in the mental health field was pretty outrageous at the time, too. If you've ever read The Yellow Wallpaper, that's an extreme example (sort of) of the ""rest cure"" that was prescribed almost solely to women that would now be considered a form of torture, depriving them of all stimulation and activity in order to cure them of ""hysteria,"" the concept of which is pretty fucked up and sexist.

Also, up until the middle of the last century, it wasn't a secret or even a problem that women were paid less than men because men were automatically assumed to be ""bread-winners"" while women were primarily employed as supplemental income. Single women couldn't get paid as much as single men, if they could even get employed, because there's always been this concept of single women ""belonging"" to their fathers and being given to their husbands when married. If a single woman was poor, it was the fault of her retainer, and she had no power to better her situation except marriage. That's why so many poor women turned to prostitution. That was really the only way of using their sex, a disadvantage, to their advantage.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh, I agree with you. The video presented a few cases in the form of interviews with young people who had quit. None of them had gone to college (that the video showed) and stated that the work was just too hard. The video then interviewed workers at the foundry or whatever it was and they said kids these days ""are just too soft"". *Edit: The video may have been biased, it's been too long for me to remember clearly.*  
  
I think in some cases, it could be about entitlement and in other cases it's just the fact that young people today aren't used to that level of physical labor and/or have other options. I have seen both cases in my lifetime.  
  
Edit: I feel I should point out that where I live, oil and gas is a booming industry. Oil companies are snatching up pretty much anyone they can find that can read warning signs and plopping them on a rig in the middle of nowhere. I see a lot of people who have quit because it's ""too hard"" and are having financial trouble because they can't find a decent job (I work in the financial industry). I look at their employment history and ask what happened to the job they had and I get a varied list of why it didn't work out, but usually it's because they couldn't handle the physical demands of the job or the long hours they worked. That said, they aren't out there getting a ""good"" job with less hours and an easier work load, they are out there getting minimum wage jobs and then trying to get a loan to cover their bad budgeting habits because they are still spending money like they still had that oilfield job.

Well, if I start from the very beginning... it was in July that everything began. I'm not sure if you are familiar with [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/about), but I decided to partake in the summer version of it which happened in August. To prepare, I thought up an original story with original characters involved. Imagining the scenes of the story in my head, I wanted to draw them out and see them for real.

Starting some time in July, I learned about Mark Crilley's manga tutorials on youtube (which are awesome) and stared off by watching those and attempting to replicate his works. I then found the famous [Loomis](http://illustrationage.com/2013/04/02/free-andrew-loomis-art-instruction-downloads/) books online and practiced some realistic proportions a bit with them. Also, I found [budgierRcool's youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/budgiesRcool) which served as a great SAI-specific resource.

I suppose I took advantage of my free time over the summer (latter half of July) to begin looking into the nuts and bolts of how to draw. Lucky for me, I was quite tolerant of criticisms and began to learn a lot from my mistakes.

To be honest, it really comes down to two things: Your mindset and determination. Practicing consistently, even if it's just an hour before you sleep every night, goes WAYYYYY further than any tutorials or books. Draw draw draw! That's THE number one thing and I can confirm that I noticed it myself.

Your mindset is also important, though. Whenever you draw, always be critical. Whether it be tracing/copying another person's work or following a tutorial, try to understand WHY things are being drawn the way they are. If you don't try to grasp the concepts, the hours spent practicing are going to feel like a mindless waste. On the other hand, don't beat yourself up too much -- be flexible about accepting criticisms. The last thing you want is to depress yourself in the first few days of drawing and quit. Keep trying! and like I said, draw draw draw!","1388535704"

"medicalschool","t5_2re2p","&gt; No need to be an ass, dude. You have no idea what my school is like.

Sorry. That was not my intention.

&gt;Are you in the US? I find it absurd that residents aren't writing notes on patients you are following. Dunno what legal bermuda triangle you live in, but at my school (in the Midwest), across our several teaching hospitals in town, residents have to write separate notes from med students and oftentimes attendings (in internal medicine) are required to write a note daily as well (like at the VA). At some places, they let residents put a progress note as an addendum to a med student note. But, at all places, an actual MD has to write a note. From talking to friends at other schools and from what I've read online, this is the norm. And what this does is puts a gigantic safety net behind you and your notes. There is no fire under my butt to write a good note, and while I always tried to, there is a psychological safety net.

I'm in the US. An MD state school in the midwest.

Yes, our notes count. The resident and/or attending addends our note and co-signs it. This has been the norm for the hospitals my school is associated with. In the cases where the residents had to write a separate note, they pretty much copy-pasted our notes verbatim. We're expected to be thorough in our data-gathering, so that makes sense. I never said that my notes count without anyone else co-signing it -- I said the resident and/or attending co-signs it. So, yes, an actual MD co-signs my notes.

&gt;My point was not that you can't do something important as a med student (like suggesting some labs or being really organized and helping the team's workflow), but in my experience, clerkship students don't carry patients alone. They are paired with an intern, and may be the first set of eyes that see the patient that morning, but the responsibility is ultimately on the resident.

I've very rarely been paired up with an intern. We're usually paired up with junior or senior residents.

&gt;This completely different than an acting internship or a sub-I rotation. I did one month in medicine where I was functioning like an intern, and it was completely different than my 3rd year clerkship, obviously. **I was supervised by a senior resident, not an intern, and thus had more responsibility: I did the daily progress note and the senior just had to addend it, I did all the orders and the senior just had to cosign them, and I was the sole person looking up the details.** As a clerkship student, if you are paired with an intern, you are not the sole person looking at the details. There is an intern there too who is doing just as much work if you were there or if you weren't.

That's pretty much how my M3 year clerkships have gone so far. Heck, I just even did an ICU elective where I was taking care of reeeeeally sick patients with only the senior and the attending overseeing what I do. So, I definitely had a lot of responsibility.

The vast majority of the time, my patients are my own. I'm not sharing them with interns. *I'm expected to function like an intern* -- obviously, with a lower patient load (I'm only carrying 3-4 patients at most, usually).

&gt;Yeah but there are certain inflexible things about medical education. And most of them involve the safety of patients. Like, you never get to make independent decisions regarding a patient's care. Sure, you get to brainstorm and you may come up with some great stuff to help out patients. But you are the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. If you think that ""getting involved"" means ""having responsibility"", then we simply don't agree on the terms we're using.

I stand by what I said about having responsibility. Especially considering my clerkships have been pretty much exactly like what you did in your sub-I as an M4.

&gt;Massive eye-roll. We do just fine.

Sorry. That was snarky of me. I really do think that schools, in general, ought to do better though -- this is just based on my interactions with M4s from other schools who have done electives at the hospitals I've rotated at so far.

&gt;No, you do not have unique expectations. Sounds exactly like my school (except I guess we're an 'academic powerhouse', depending on who you ask). I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm saying you really don't have as much responsibility as you think you do.

Based on what you say your clerkships and what your sub-I were like, I really think that my school does give us more responsibility as M3s. At least, as much responsibility as you received as an M4 in your sub-I. So, I still stand by what I said earlier -- I do have quite a bit of responsibility and I actively seek for more and more.

&gt;I'll admit I'm cynical. I'll admit I really don't like clinical medicine all that much (I'm going into radiology after all) so I tend to complain about it. **And it really wasn't until my acting internship that I realized most of what I did was sit on my ass doing very little as a third year med student.** And heck, I was getting honors grades left and right for it, so don't just assume I was a lazy student.

That's certainly not the case with me. It seems like your M3 year clerkships were designed much differently than mine. The one rotation so far where I had a lot of downtime was ob/gyn on the L&amp;D service -- I just carried my Case Files book with me and did pretty much all my studying for the shelf during the 3 weeks I was on the L&amp;D service. I didn't mind it too much because I'm not planning on going into Ob/Gyn anyways. Other than that, I've been pretty busy on my other services. Heck, even when I was on 30-hour call during surgery, it was pretty much non-stop action the entire time -- the most sleep I've gotten on one of those calls was maybe 1-2 hours. I've also been lucky to have had really awesome residents and attendings to work with so far -- they've expected a lot out of me, but they taught a lot in return as well. I'm the complete opposite of you. I love clinical medicine and look forward to going into the hospital every morning.","1388535705"

"PlantedTank","t5_2szbf","If you are adding Co2 via pressurized or DIY method adding an airstone will decrease your Co2 concentration. This is because you have Co2 bubbles in the tank that can be pushed out. Think of it like a bottle of soda. If you shake a fresh bottle of soda full of Co2 it will foam up and rise to the surface, bubbles will pop, and Co2 decreases. BUT if you had a bottle of soda that has gone flat (No more Co2) and you blew thru a straw into it creating bubbles it will increase the Co2. This is because the air we breathe contains Co2. The levels are very small but my point was that an airstone will not gas off Co2 levels unless you have more Co2 in the tank than in the air. ","1388535709"
