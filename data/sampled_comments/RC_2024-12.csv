The $2.5 mill supposedly offered to Memphis is about 10% of their base fee (without negotiation) and there are no reports at this time to say the Pac-12 paid more than that toward the MW schools. 

And Memphis didn't say anything about the Pac-12 paying their exit fees, only that the amount(s) offered were too low and too speculative to accept without further negotiations.  Which is why the Pac needed more media feedback.  Make no mistake, the Pac-12 is not buying members.  It is recruiting schools who believe enough in themselves and the goals of the new Pac-12 to help build a new conference.  All schools, including WSU & OSU will be expected to make financial investments to get the new Pac-12 runing as the power G5 conference.  If a school doesn't believe in either, that is fine but they really wouldn't belong in the new Pac-12.

And it is very unlikely the Pac-12 will pay all the poaching fees.  Neither side will want to go through the messy and embarrassing legal process for resolution.  Those fees will be negotiated out and I wouldn't be surprised to see the MW accept payment for whatever penalty fees the Pac-12 owes paid in Pac-12 Enterprise services.  The MW is in need of a new media contract too, remember.",1733011200.0

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","Well, i think the overall structure you brought up is overall how nen is implied to work, but there are still some major question marks i think need some overall answers from Togashi, before we approach the heavier part of pure perception being the strongest implication/thing about nen.

My main thing is that it is basically magic, like in some Star Wars shit, where the force would be the magic equivalence(at least originally). These system generally imply an origin of objective/subjective perception other than the involved members ones, to prevent delusional situations spiralling to a plot defect.

To further exemplify: how would you set a condition that works around someone saying something true or false, and then use that to power up the original condition? We have seen nen that basically sees things beyond the user's perception in that very sense, but you can also argue knowing the person is even lying itself can often be a pure advantage, and a 'loophole'.

So the very concept of them doing it is reasonable enough, but that being the way through which they achieve power is almost inevitable in a sense, since great people are often the ones who achieve great things consistently, regardless of set goals. 

I think this matters because you can also argue for linear techniques of progress vs variable ones being exactly, as you say, optional systems almost like an 'accident'. As in, Chrollo's condition definitely fucks him up for training, because he actually needs to spend a ton of time just with planning and leading, but you can argue someone like Razor is the exact opposite, where him sitting his ass in that place for however long, despite possible condition of allowing someone to finish a game, is more like a space that allows him to cyclically use his emission to feed the island while he goes about other things, which would be a consistent way of just improving his control/aura output, with added risk of assassination, even if the game is never finished.

All in all, i like the skill tree setup mention, but you can also argue that's generally how it works in real life with basic skillsets development vs progressing through them. Like you see the MMA fighters from buttfuck nowhere who even make it alive despite being knocked out all day (very dangerous) vs. the fighers who are in professional gyms the whole time with specified sparring partners and styles.",1733011200.0

"BravoRealHousewives","t5_2v6dk","The technology for Palm - and all cell phones - started out as a military application.  Palm was also a big government device provider back in the day, deemed the most secure until Blackberry came out.  This where I’d suspect Todd got cleared, if he hadn’t been before.

Todd owns a partnership interest, paying out carried interest, in his private equity fund.  If he died, Bronwyn might inherit his partnership interest and right to receive accrued carried interest (so investment growth to date) - she wouldn’t have active management rights or a right to future investments’ growth.  Some funds make deals to buy the spouse out.  But that usually doesn’t work well because you need to drain money out of the fund instead of using it to make investments, or you might force a sale of an investment to generate the cash.

Long story short, it makes perfect sense to me that Todd would have Bronwyn investigated, and I’d strongly suspect she has her own clearance of some kind.  NSA sounds right, because Todd invests in sensitive technologies with military applications.  The only thing that is a bit off to me would be Todd getting the results of her check.  If she had nothing to hide, they might just have agreed to share their results with each other.  People with high level clearances also get tips all the time - when their kid gets pulled over for speeding, when a co-investor has prior legal problems, if something happens with a close family member, etc.  Especially if it could threaten the clearance holder’s status.

Thank you for reading and seeking clarity!",1733011202.0

"ateismo_br","t5_2xh37","> Acredito que devia ter mais debates sobre o tema. 

Mas _tem_ esses debates, só que é por um prisma diferente: você tá negando que essas _experiências pessoais_ (e milagres) de fato são experiências religiosas em que a pessoa encarnou tal espírito ou divindade. Você só precisa saber generalizar e procurar em outros lugares.

Mas, como um certo usuário deste subreddit sempre gosta de dizer: quem tem que demonstrar a veracidade dessas experiências são eles (os religiosos).

&nbsp;

> entendo perfeitamente que por não se tratar de uma religião eurocentrada, colonialista e afins 

Não é como se o cristianismo _em si_ fosse uma religião que surgiu na Europa, mas eu entendi o seu ponto.

> Porém, em suma, tanto a Umbanda e o Candomblé partilham da lógica do medo 

Não precisa ter que partilhar essas coisas em comum com o cristianismo. Até porque praticamente a _vasta maioria das religiões_ são por Revelação, em que o conhecimento divino deles veio a eles por: texto sagrado, milagre (quando dois ou mais experienciam algo que consideram não natural) ou/e experiência pessoal (quando uma pessoa experiencia algo que considera não natural).

"LegoDC","t5_253ty3","I have watched almost every single animated comic series since day one back in 1992 with Batman the Animated Series. I get fanboying over what we thought was the best interpretation, but LEGO needed Superman to sell the set. Unlike previous Lex mechs, this set puts Superman front and center with his own vehicle. They are selling the iconic color scheme. It makes perfect sense from a marketing standpoint. Nothing (besides the lack of dual molded legs and red trunks) is lazy about this set. It’s $15. And actually comes with more than one minifigure (I’m looking at you, Batman mech). I won’t argue that LEGO has gotten bad with their selling tactics and pricing in the last few years, but this is actually a cheap set (again, looking at you Batman the Animated Series sets) that diversifies the line up. I’d rather encourage that than not in the landscape of $200+ adult sets we’ve been seeing.",1733011203.0

"singing","t5_2rlcx","MJ didn’t have perfect pitch.  

All of what you’re talking about is technical.  

I think it’s beyond technical.   The talent comes when it seems effortless, or if someone performing makes it look easy, and like they’re enjoying expressing their art.  

Then when that enjoyment is transferred to the audience, the talent is felt.  

Some folks are born with a gift and could sing by ear at a young age , once again MJ is a great reference.  But if you look at guitar players for instance, nobody is just born a guitar player the way MJ came out the womb able to sing.  

Most child prodigies aside from singers, like George Benson for example, pound for pound of the most talented people ever on the planet… he could probably sing very well at a young age, but also he was a whiz kid at guitar.  

Something clicks early on in childhood or in teenage years when the brain is just so elastic that it can learn immense amounts of data from practicing.  

It can be done later in life too, but it’s way slower then.  

Connecting what you’re hearing in your head, feeling in your heart, and actually singing with your mouth, and then also having the listener be dazzled, that alignment, that’s talent.",1733011203.0

A lot of it comes down to who's saying it. Generic chinese drop shipper website? Very likely bullshit. 

Car Dealership? Ehh- depends. If they're telling you the deal they're offering you today will not be available tomorrow? Decent chance they're telling the truth based on incentives and the managers motivation (ie; last day of the month I'll take a $4k loss to hit a volume number. First day of the month, nope, gotta make my money while I can).  Also, depending on how the dealership strategizes, it legitimately could be the last one that they'll have for awhile.  I tell people on a regular basis ""hey I absolutely respect that you want to walk away, but in the interest of full disclosure, I do have another appointment on it this afternoon, if they want to purchase it, I am absolutely going to sell it to them""

"AutisticAdults","t5_2zf7w","Indeed. Thought I was doing okay after I finally got a corporate art job even though every day was an increasing struggle--I just thought that was what all adults went through because that's what everyone made me feel like by dismissing my issues every time they were brought up. Then I found out 'critical burnout' is a thing when the doctors started rushing to get me MRIs because they were pretty sure I was having strokes. Turns out it was stress and my body and brain were just shutting down. I didn't leave my house for five months and was pretty much positive I was about to just not wake up one day. I just got lucky my brother moved back in with me around that time and has been taking care of me since then while I try to beat this skill regression and cPTSD alongside the physical neuro issues I have now.

But it'd have to be long term, you'd want to focus on subsidizing and incentivizing domestic production so the US could build up that base then slowly introduce tariffs to weigh it in its favor.

It would have effects: Consumer goods would be better quality but they'd be 10x more expensive or more. We'd be pursuing prosperity in a wildly different way that America abandoned decades ago and has no experience with anymore.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","I completely disagree because why refer to an entirely different penalty to justify this one? Either it’s impeding related or it isn’t. Max driving slowly can happen anywhere on the lap and it just so happens George caught up to him when he was - he’s still not obligated to get out of the way (off the racing line) unless George is on a push lap so noting that in the document seems irrelevant.

What would’ve made sense would be to refer to other ‘driving unnecessarily slowly’ incidents, and then explained why this warrants a greater punishment than those. Remember Max drove slowly at Monaco this year? He didn’t get a penalty then, just a reprimand, and there were cars flying past him on the grid to do their final laps. What’s the difference?

To your second point, Max can point to his telemetry to say he was cooling the tyres and had let other cars past, which he did.  Stewards are then obligated to outline why that’s not a good enough reason but other people citing traffic is.

Again it’s the consistency that’s the issue here. Yes there was a near miss but again there have been near misses before that went unpunished, why is Max’s one the one that gets the punishment, and why is the punishment a grid drop & penalty point? These documents need so much more detail if they’re going to make the mystery behind these penalties make more sense, but I believe it’s likely no mystery and just inconsistent stewarding in general to blame.",1733011205.0

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","They’ll even try to shove their balls in too. After all, they’re not very knowledgeable when it comes to anatomy. Saw a post on X going around yesterday of this super hot volleyball player who had a nice uh… I’ll say so as not to sound like a horny pervert and to be more medically accurate, a large mons pubis. It was very noticeable through the short, tight shorts. It was hilarious how many conservative Christian men in the comments were talking about her “bulge” and how “big” it was suggesting she was clearly a biological man and that what we were seeing in the photo was her dick and balls. The funniest shit about it to me is these are the same men who always say “we can always tell” when it comes to pointing out trans women in comparison to biological women, and were just going out of their way to out & tell on themselves that they’ve likely never actually seen a woman naked in person or gotten laid, and if they have it was clearly with maybe one woman despite them wanting desperately to sleep around and fuck everyone. And the most hilarious part of all is that they thought that little vaginal bulge of this chick who had a very nice, hot… area was big enough that they thought it was a bulge of both a dick and balls… and what that says about how teeny tiny their own bulges must be if they thought her slightly large moms pubis was actually the same bulge size as their own dick and balls. Very funny watching these people put themselves in various ways; letting the world know how stupid/uneducated they are, how little (if not none at all) experience they have with being with and/or seeing women naked in person, and how tiny their junk is. Now, with that said, I don’t think there’s anything wrong whatsoever with a man being a virgin, nor do I care or see any sort of negativity regarding not having a big dick or positivity if you do have one, it’s beyond one’s control of course. However, these tend to be the very same kind of dudes who value their body count being higher the better and that it somehow makes you cooler and more successful, and are obsessed with dick size whether they’re insecure about it, or if they’re hung and weirdly proud and braggadocious about it when it’s arguably their only “positive” attribute and is also one thing they actually didn’t put effort/work into to earn. But anyway, it was fucking hilarious watching these hardcore conservative Christians genuinely arguing and honestly believing this super gorgeous, insanely hot woman had male genitalia because she had a really good looking thick ass pussy. I can’t tell if they’re just dumb or gay. And if they are gay, that’s fine, but they also tend to be the most homophobic and hateful out of all people.",1733011206.0

Walk! Maybe add a weighted vest, or a backpack for hiking, or pick more challenging routes as you become able to do them. Dance! There's so many dance workouts out there, and even just learning a routine you really like is good exercise.

There's rollerblading, ice skating, parkour - I've tried a bunch of different things just because I had a friend who mentioned they were into it and I asked to go along. Most people are happy to share something they're passionate about, and that can include strangers you meet out walking or slacklining in the park. Spooky but rewarding, I've found :)",1733011208.0

So the rings’ position in the horizon shouldn’t change? I guess this is going into physics but is this because of the process by which orbiting bodies/rings are formed during planetary formation or is it because the axis about which a planet rotates affects the rings stability, regardless of formation?

After a quick Look around it seems like the equatorial bulge produces a closer and so stronger gravitational pull on orbiting bodies directly over it. A body orbiting perpendicular to this bulge would feel alternating strengths of the planet’s gravity, making the orbit unstable. Is that correct?",1733011208.0

>I'm also curious if Cell is immune to mind manipulation and corruption

Mind manipulation can be resisted with enough ki, seen with Vegeta resisting Babidis mind control, and Buu being too strong for Babidi to control his mind. Cell having Vegeta cells would make it even easier to say he can do so.

Corruption as I mentioned in the link I showed, can be dealt in a number of ways, apart from Cell possibly having resistance to it.

District level admin decided to change the science sequence.

One of those areas, because I know how admin thinks, was cost. To change the sequence they would have to buy all new text books for every science course which will costs MANY tens of thousands of dollars. 

They did it anyway cause OF COURSE they did. 

So now here we are. Next year I’ll have the first batch of student in my room who DIDNT have the year 1 course that my class was COMPLETELY designed around. I submitted money for a budget for text books. Admin will have to be the ones to pick it out because when our test scores get back and they have all failed I don’t want ANY part of it.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","> DWS 39 har funktioner som ska minimera risken för blindgångare och helt eliminera risken för fungerande blindgångare. De delar som inte exploderar senast vid nedslaget har inbyggda självförstörings- och självdeaktiveringsmekanismer som gör att de förstör sig själva på mindre än en minut. Om detta inte fungerar töms de på elektricitet och blir därmed ofarliga att hantera. Systemet har även byggts upp enligt ""svagaste länken""-principen så att extra känsliga delar har placerats som mekaniska säkringar på olika platser. Utsätts systemet för något som skulle kunna skada det så går dessa säkringar sönder och hela systemet slutar fungera.

"MSUSpartans","t5_2sp8o","The lack of identity is concerning. I think Smith wants to establish a run first, hard-nosed mentality, but our lack of talent on the O-line prevents him from establishing that. Then you find yourself resorting to whatever works to try to be competitive. The lack of talent on D-line combined with injuries in the secondary also results in the apparent lack of a defensive identity as well.

I never saw the quit that other commenters on multiple MSU threads have mentioned. I didn't see heads hanging or guys bickering on the sidelines or anything. I see under-talented guys playing hard but not getting good results. For example, after fumbling the snap on the punt, we held Rutgers to a field goal attempt on the ensuing drive. That shows me the guys still played with heart and refused to give up. I think people are complaining about our players lacking effort or emotion because they don't want to admit we currently have some of the worst talent in the conference on both lines, and we don't have great depth at any position.",1733011209.0

The universe we live in has an intelligence that wants to teach us about itself, you just have to tap into it in a comparable way.  Everyone here is assuming that we are more than just organic materials organized by chance, that there is more structure and strangeness to be just chance.  10,000 years ago the nervous systems of humans were more primitive, our brains and nervous tissues, while advanced, aren't necessarily as complex as they are today.  The dumbest human today would be the savant of their day etc.  We are evolving rapidly woth our conscienceness,  and you are all noticing things because you are capable of it now.

"SBCGaming","t5_dgcm1","One thing that I find very important with this is pocketability, and in general just how this works on the go.

I've read in the comments of this post about ""needing to carry another device"" referring to a controller for your phone, which is kind of a moot point considering if you go with a handheld you're not suddenly going to leave your phone at home. So you're gonna carry 2 devices regardless.

What does change in that regard though is the pocketability, many handhelds are made with this purpose in mind whereas it seems like it's not a concern at all. From what I've gathered, the only truly pocketable telescopic controller is the Razer Kishi V1.

The Kishi however has a fatal flaw that is also important to take into account if considering phone+controller: it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack port (most controllers don't). Which makes it basically useless when out and about unless you have low latency Bluetooth headphones (and a phone that supports that codec) or you don't mind the noticeable delay.

This is just what I've encountered trying to make a choice for myself between phone+controller or something like the RP5. While I'm at it, is there any pocketable telescopic controller with an audio port? I've considered the Backbone One. It's the only one with an okay-ish size (not as good as the Kishi unfortunately) and the port.",1733011211.0

They offered me a nephrostomy bag, but then said my liver was in too bad a place for the ostomy, so they could only do a stent. Which honestly sounded better to me anyway! The OB team here told me there's no reason the stent should impact delivery, which is great as I'm planning an unmedicated VBAC with midwives, so I don't need any more complications in my delivery room!

Traditional values: They just elected a twice-divorced serial adulterer and rapist. [He's pro segregation](https://clearinghouse.net/case/15342/), though, so I guess that's *one* traditional value.  
Individualism: Not really. Conservatives' message is that you either conform to the status-quo, or get hate crimed.  
Limited government: Laughable. Conservatives love authoritarianism. Our modern surveillance state comes courtesy of George Bush, and Trump ran on a platform of state-sponsored retribution against anyone who's ever said anything mean about him.  
Free-market capitalism: I'll grant you the capitalism part. Conservatives will do anything and everything to maintain power for billionaires and hedge funds. The free market part, not so much. Tariffs and trade wars about as anti-free market as it gets.  
National sovereignty: Not for Ukraine, apparently.

However, if humans weren't in the picture, they'd just collect nectar for their own hives, as wild bees do. It's crazy that the movie portrayed this as bees boycotting work entirely instead of just refusing to produce honey for humans, and is part of why the movie isn't exactly known for its thought-provoking writing.


Beekeeping is actually one of the least brutal uses of animals by humanity, since we're basically just giving them a home, letting them do what they already do, collecting the honey, and giving them substitute food, so I don't mind it in real life. However, it would absolutely count as slavery and robbery if bees were sapient, so I do have to say that it is wrong to beekeep in the Bee Movieverse.",1733011211.0

This could indicate pain/discomfort).

I'll give you warning, some frogs scream. My girl Lily screams if she's removed from the water, like just transporting her in a net to a new tank (no possible way she was being harmed in the soft net), a 30 second ride across the room, and she was screaming like she was being murdered.

Det viktiga för vuxna invandrare är att ha god förståelse för landets lagar.

Vi behöver satsa på skolan. Avskaffa först och främst alla friskolor. Sedan tror jag det är viktigt att jobba ännu mer på sekularisering av samhället. Ett sätt vore att förbjuda all religiös aktivitet för minderåriga! Självklart oberoende av religion, så även dop och konfirmation får vänta till efter artonårsdagen.

Om Sverige får ett internationellt rykte som en extremt sekulär stat så slipper vi troligtvis också en stor del av de religiösa seloter som vill uppfostra sina barn i en specifik religion.",1733011212.0
"Prolactinoma","t5_2xv1l","Hi. Welcome to the club. Everything you are feeling is real. People will say no but you know your body and you are right! Terrible migraines, drowsy at work, weight gain and focus issues plagued and occasionally plague me. 

Discovered the issue at 16 and just about dealing with it at 24! Awaiting some MRI results.

I highly recommend maintaining your exercise. Steady state exercise is good, swimming and lifting weights. Nothing too vigorous as high stress is not great for your body just now. 

Ensure you have your regular vitamins and walk in the sun when you can for your vitamin D. Vitamin B12 also is needed. These will help your body feel better rested. Junk food, alcohol and processed food cut them out as much as you can. 

Work wise- begin to reduce your external stresses as much as possible. I suggest to be very careful about how you choose to share any medical concerns in the work place. I prefer not as they usually treat you poorly after that. Try to time block your days and do what you can in a day reasonably.

I’m not sure of your location but try calling around to different radiology and imaging centers and ask them if they accept your insurance. If they do then continue the conversation from there! 

Treating this condition or experience has made a vast improvement in those lethargic feelings and I pray you will experience an improvement from this too. You aren’t alone! Don’t give up c:",1733011212.0

"DACA","t5_35gav","You are missing that many of the items you are discussing were already ruled on in this case in 2022. Texas has standing through special solicitude and due to injury. Court is procedural. They are going to make all their arguments again in prep for the supreme court case. 

This same court has already ruled that DACA is illegal twice, including in this case. 

In 2022 this appeals court upheld the ruling that DACA was illegal, and that that Texas had standing, but sent the issue back to the lower court for judge Hanen to determine if Biden's formalization of DACA under DHS policy during the case (thanks Biden) meant it was still illegal. Hanen said yes in 2023, and here we are again. 

Even if the 5th circuit were to determine DACA is not illegal, this case will likely be appealed to an unfriendly supreme court. 

It isn't over until it is over, and any time that can be bought is a victory, but DACA is hanging on by its finger tips and a lot would need to go right to save it over the next couple years not just from this legal battle, but from the other legal battles about to come. 

On the issue of standing, the court has already determined in its 2022 ruling that Texas warrants ""special solicitude"" in this case, meaning most normal standing requirements do not apply. The reson they also argue about standing is in case the supreme court reverses that part of the ruling. 

The court determined that Texas has suffered injury. 

The court has also determined in the 2022 ruling that a single state's standing is sufficient. 

I appreciate the optimism, but what you are hearing is lawyers laying the groundwork for the next fight, not successfully winning this fight. This fight is already lost on those points.",1733011212.0

- The words you chose are grammatically wrong for the meaning you intended.
- *Off of* can always be shortened to just **off**.
- Example: The tennis ball bounced **off** the wall.
- Now that you are aware of this, everyone will take you more seriously, hooray! :)

"sunglasses","t5_2rc6z","I'm happy with my Wayfarer 2140, 2132 and also Aviator inspired RB3683. All Made in Italy and all of them are solid to me. They simply suit and fit me great and I like the classic lens colours. I also have a pair of Sergenti Delio's. I paid nearly 2x more for them than my 2140s. Are they 'better'? I would say objectively yes. But I still love my 2140s as well, depending on what I'm wanting to wear that day. I don't really feel like it's a night/day difference between them, they're both really good.

So unless Ray-Ban just stops offering any Italian made sunglasses at all and still charges a premium price on them, then yeah I would probably stop buying them. But until that changes, I'm fine with certain models they still offer that are made there. To me they are still worth the money, despite all the constant hate online.",1733011213.0

"KiaEV9","t5_5v4ik9","I have not seen those details yet about the range or simulated gear changes a la Ioniq 5N.  I would be happy with that range considering the power, and I love seeing the videos of the simulated gear changes in the Ionic 5N videos I have seen.  Everyone seems to get giddy when they use it.  The seats in the GT have more bolstering, and the materials are the same as the regular EV9's except for the inserts which are a simulated suede.  I currently love the seats in my GT-Line, and at first I thought the synthetic leather would be a downgrade from my previous cars which had real Napa leather, but I actually like them more than real leather.  I could take or leave the synthetic suede inserts though.  It may be a controversial hot take, but I am glad that there is not true air suspension.  Seems like that always ends up being a high-cost durability issue down the road.  Sure it would be nice to raise the ground clearance like a Rivian, but I am never off-roading my heavy, electric SUV.  I have a Kia Stinger as well and it have adaptive suspension (without air) and it seems to be able to make enough of a difference to be usable and noticeable for when I am hustling it through the curves.  Our current EV9 is my wife's car primarily.  I would definitely consider trading my Stinger for the GT EV9.",1733011214.0

"nonutnovember","t5_3pnv2","I had a response to this. Idk where it went, I may have accidentally deleted it, but I'll just make a shorter response summarizing what I said.

In previous posts of mine I have noticed that was an issue, and I did go out of my way to inform people that they need to reply to the *original* post, not the ones I made.

After that people seemed to get the message, so I stopped. Since then I have had nobody else reply to my post with ""Still in!"" that also wouldn't have responded to the original post with ""Still in!"" as well. I'm pretty sure I made that abundantly clear, and if people read *past* the disclaimer in **bold text** stating that they need to respond to the original roll call post and not this one, then I don't see how that's my fault.

The thing I'm upset about is that I still see top comments with people replying ""Still in!"" to, with nothing being done against them. You can say that this is being done to other people too, whether or not I believe it is a bit of a 50/50. Alas, if it was, then how does that make it any better?

You've already made countless posts about how the roll calls work, what does and doesn't count, and I get it can be frustrating that some people just don't read and bombard your modmail with useless questions, but why blame the writer and punish them for other people's actions?

All I've ever done is just make posts giving people stats, a story to follow, daily questions and advice, and a shoutout system to keep people engaged, and all of this whilst respecting the rules and mod authority as much as I could.

I'm not blaming *you*, Nick, but I'm sure you can see why this whole thing upsets me. If you or any of the mods want me to add into the base disclaimer that people need to reply to the original post with ""Still in!"" and not my post, then just say so.

Firstly I haven't seen that issue, as I assume pretty much everybody who responds to me already knows this fact as they're long-term followers.

Secondly, it's not my fault if people ""don't read the full context"", that's *their* fault. The point is, just *ask* people like me to change something first before resorting to the deletion of something we work hard on to contribute to the sub and discussion.

I'm not blaming you directly, Nick, as I know you weren't the one who did this. But to say ""What's done is done unfortunately"" makes it feel like you aren't making an effort to improve things.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","It's not super hard. Get a power tester and turn off power at breaker. Test your wires.

Vanity light are fairly basic. Trouble happens if older home where sometimes you get strange configurations and older wire can be brittle and have issues with insulation (the plastic covering on wire).

Once you loosen light take pic of what is connected to what (note color of wire). You can get wire labels as well. Sometimes you get the wires that are same color. Some led fixtures need to be connected in specific order...if it doesn't work try switching the wires.

Plenty YouTube stuff out there on how to.

Chandiler I would recommend you pay someone to do. The connections are the same but trying to support Chandiler while wiring and adjusting wire length can be challenging.

Pendants are same a vanity wiring, but if wire needs to be cut or pendant is adjustable lengthwise, go slow measure multiple times. You can run into challenges mounting them, but much easier than Chandiler.

Maybe best is to do vanity lights, pendants if you just need to mount (no adjustments), but leave trim off and have electrician come for Chandiler and check your other work.",1733011214.0

I reached out to the New Hampshire community for information about their culture because I do not know any of it.

"DungeonsAndDragons","t5_2qwdo","A campaign is an overarching story with a set of characters, rolling in and out with disinterest in classes or death. It can be either one big module or a series of modules (either related or not). A module is a single adventure. Some books are full campaigns, like Tyranny of Dragons, while others are just short modules.

My current one was Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, and I'm running LMoP now. I'm starting a secondary smaller one here soon.

So, it is up to you.what I will say is that if you are getting into the groove of how DMing works, adding a couple more players isn't a bad adjustment. I currently work with 6 and occassionally two of them need to work, so I get 4. I just adjust the encounters based on how many I have to not make something too easy or too deadly. If you are going to add some more, the time between modules is a great time to since it typically comes with downtime. 

If your players, and you, plan to continue with these characters, I would suggest taking your players back to Neverwinter and giving them two in-game weeks to purchase things, work on spells, crafting, etc. I typically have this happen between the sessions so they can send me shopping lists and ask me questions so we start the next session after that time and ready to start the next adventure.

If you aren't planning on continuing with these characters and starting a new campaign, feel free to hit me up with questions/suggestions.",1733011215.0

Also, it felt like they moved the weapons because everyone had to look multiple times for what they needed

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly it would take a long time for me to fail surviving in the wild with nothing. My grandma was a homesteader's kid so survival skills are engrained since as early as I can remember. 

I know how to collect, store, purify, and maintain water supplies in nature using environmental elements. So I don't need much to maintain a water supply.

I'm familiar with and can identify edible and inedible foragable plants in North America. 

I know how to make spear and arrow heads by flaking stone (I also know how to make axes, knives, and other bladed tools using the same methodology). 

I know how to make fire using a bow drill. 

I know how to make rope. 

I know how to hunt and I'm not squeamish. 

I know how to fish using primitive methods like a trawl line crafted from grass rope. 

I know how to tan hide and I know how to sew.

I know how to build shelter and find habitable caves. 

I can navigate by the stars. 

I know how to find signs of active civilization. 

Offering me three tools just makes survival easier and there's no guarantee I'd fail. Hell drop me in the middle of the woods a hundred miles from civilization with only the clothes on my back and I'll return to civilization in 14 days (varying by terrain) no worse for the experience. I might need a shower before people would want to be around me but that's on them not me. 

With that out of the way here are my three tools. 

A rucksack (made of untreated canvas)

A piece of Icelandic Spar Crystal (3x4x4 inches is the one I usually carry camping)

A collapsible shovel. 

Every single one of these is capable of multiple survival functions. 

A canvas rucksack can be utilized as a water filter, for the carrying of supplies, for tinder, for bandages, for a tourniquet, as a pillow, and a whole bunch more I'm not going to list because I don't want to be here all night. 

Icelandic Spar has another name steeped in history and you might know it. The Vikings called it a Sunstone. They used it as a navigational tool to find where the sun was, even though clouds, fog, and other adverse conditions, because of it having polarization innate in the crystal. You can find the sun by watching how the polarized light filters through it. You'll get two equally intense strands of light throughout the crystal when you're pointed directly at the sun. Knowing where the sun is is  crucial to survival. If you polish a small part of the spar you can also use it to ignite tinder to start a fire if you need to. 

The collapsible shovel is a weapon, tool, and potential cane if you have a splint on due to an injury. You can also use it to create sparks when striking stone as way of starting a fire.",1733011217.0

Lifetime Win Shares

While no statistical metric is perfect, it removes the recency bias, and other subconscious human errors.

All Time Top Career Win Share Leaders:

1.	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\* 	273.41

2.	LeBron James 	265.17

3.	Wilt Chamberlain\* 	247.26

4.	Karl Malone\* 	234.63

5.	Michael Jordan\* 	214.02

6.	Chris Paul 	211.44

7.	John Stockton\* 	207.70

8.	Tim Duncan\* 	206.38

9.	Dirk Nowitzki\* 	206.34

10.	Kevin Garnett\* 	191.42

11.	Artis Gilmore\* 	189.65

12.	Oscar Robertson\* 	189.21

13.	Shaquille O'Neal\* 	181.71

14.	Julius Erving\* 	181.11

15.	Moses Malone\* 	179.15

16.	David Robinson\* 	178.67

17.	Charles Barkley\* 	177.21

18.	Reggie Miller\* 	174.40

19.	Kobe Bryant\* 	172.74

20.	Kevin Durant 	171.21

I see below some arguments about Chris Paul, but according to this metric he is #6.

And Jordan is as low as he is, because he only played 13 1/2 seasons, a testament to his greatness to get so high in so short a time.

Also, Chamberlain to get to #3 in only 14 seasons, the two above him have 20 and 22.",1733011218.0

I'd say Rihanna could maybe come close, but she isn't releasing music anymore and seems fairly adamant that she's a businesswoman now, not a singer - that's partly why I said ""currently"", because you can also say that Michael Jackson could belong in this category. The Weeknd I don't think is more popular. There are still people who can maybe name one of his songs, and maybe don't know him at all. However, Beyonce has plenty of songs that people can name even if they don't care about pop music. She is also idolised to such an extreme extent that even Rihanna simply isn't. While Rihanna is idolised, Beyonce is made into a queen, a goddess that can do no wrong. You can talk about Rihanna's mistakes, like the 777 tour or the racist things she's done. But you could never say that about Beyonce without some backlash. Taylor Swift fans (like here) are willing to accept that Taylor is human and also being curated for us. Beyonce's fans don't like to think that she's human lmao. 

I think that no matter how popular Rihanna was at her height, Beyonce was always positioned as being bigger. I mean, I was there, so I remember it, but Rihanna was the pop girl, pop princess, Beyonce was the queen of pop and trendmaking. I genuinely don't think anyone can compare to that level of hype. Even Taylor Swift has detractors, and she's more popular than ever.",1733011219.0

"realmadrid","t5_2rr0e","I once supported someone like Hazard, who wasn't interested at all in making history and just wanted to wear the shirt and take it easy, then after underperforming for 2 years, and being one of the reasons we got eliminated by his former club, he left the stadium laughing and joking with his ex-teammates, despite being the highest earner ( I think ) in wearing number 7 and literally offering NOTHING to the team for 2 years, other than injury.

I supported Vini when he was 19 and 20 back in Solari and Zidane days because I saw potential and I felt his passion. Also I watched interviews and I love him, he wanted to win the CL, you can see he is not selfish, despite possessing terrifying dribbling skills. This man himself wants Mbappé to be the star, offering him passes and giving penalties.

The thing about Mbappé is that I fear his real objectives and what he wants to achieve in Real Madrid... for starters, he won the WC and was in another final where he scored a hatrick and became a legend for that. For many players, WC is a much greater trophy than CL... Mbappé was in a CL final already but lost... maybe it's not that big of a dream for him... and according to his mom, he came to Real Madrid to win the Ballon d'or... when I hear such thing, I wonder what's going through the player's mind when he is on the pitch.. Jude and Vini were pushing the Ballon d'or towards each other... they didn't care about such stuff and wanted to keep winning trophies ! They want to win ! Not to win individual trophy ! 

I'm not saying Mbappé doesn't want to win, but according to what I'm seeing, the way he walks casually walks in the pitch without pressing when we don't have the ball, combined with very clumsy play is just frustrating combined with his disputes over money with PSG and some image rights with the French national team and this Ballon d'or statement, I question his mentality.

We're doing bad, very bad in the CL now. Half of the season is almost over and we are still 'giving Mbappé' time. The pressure in Real Madrid is the main reason why the club is successful. I will follow the mister, who is of course supporting his players and standing by their sides. But I can't take the fact that Carlo is getting shit on by the fan base for these losses because Perez wanted a luxury signing and we ended up ruining the team's system, who was already hurt so bad when Kroos left...

The best attack we had since CR7 was the 2022 one, with Vini and Benzema literally creating goals out of nowhere, together with super sub Rodrygo, who always comes in and scores in decisive moments... can you blame the fans for wondering how things could have turned out if we went with Harry Kane, who has a similar style to Benzema ? 

In the Clasico, fuckign 36 years old Lewandowski cleared a corner and then made one hell of a run for the counter attack and almost scored a hatrick... while Mbappé is 'saving his energy' for a counter attack...

The board should have noticed how important a classical number 9 is after watching Joselu last year ! But instead, here we are making Vini a false 9 for Mbappé's sake to play LW ( Leganes game ), benching Rodrygo, making Brahim Diaz, who was our super sub last season, play less minutes...",1733011220.0

"QNX","t5_2rc0t","I do have some thoughts on this (that so far haven't given me a headache)!

I see three issues that need to be dealt with:

1) While the production of the Quick Start RPi4 image is an excellent approach, I imagine that people genuinely interested in learning more will quickly want to know what is actually happening under the hood. Basically, how does one actually **do** this!? The answer of course is to use the stock BSP (as I did before I found the Quick Start). 

2) As for ""beyond the .build file"", well, I think detailed instructions with practical real-life examples (that work) are required. For good reasons the .build file for the Quick Start image is not \[yet\] released but as I said, it won't be long (I suspect) before people want to see either it, or something similar. And an explanation of how it is done and works. For this reason I am working on a ""how to and why"" document.

3) Working with a BSP is just one aspect of producing an embedded QNX system. With the BSP comes a lot of C code that is primarily to do with the various startup routines and hardware drivers specific to the particular platform (in this case the RPi4B). But you're probably not going to learn much from the BSP about how to actually use (meaning develop) code that takes full advantage of the esoteric and unique features of the operating system. By that I mean use of the QNX specific functions associated with IPC, the Resource Manager model for device drivers, event driven program design, and so on. Sure, one can keep themselves to purely POSIX constructs but who wants to invest in a serious (costing many $$$) OS just to turn it into a glorified Linux system? I have met engineers that want to do exactly that! But I also understand why.

There are many things provided by QNX that simply are not available in Linux (or Windows). One that immediately comes to mind is the Pulse (part of the native IPC SRR suite). There are also a number of tricks that can be used to, for example, allow use of C++ (often said to be unsuitable) in resource constrained embedded systems. Why I bring that up can be explained elsewhere if anyone is interested.

I guess, from my point of view as someone who has been in this business for nearly 40 years, the idea of helping train up a new generation of QNX system developers is attractive. I don't mean to be disrespectful or sarcastic, but I'd just love to engage with a dedicated QNX ""geek"" who wishes to take QNX and run with it for all that it's worth! But as I have said in a different posting this morning, I'm not sure this Reddit channel is the place to do this.

To me, regardless of how bad the kicker had been I would have had him out there when the clock started at 14 seconds. No way do they have time to complete a pass get back to the line and spike the ball in 14 seconds. So it was TD or nothing. At least let the kicker get a shot at redemption.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I can understand hearing that someone has an STD can be surprising, scary, and might make you want to cut it off— but this is where being well educated on the types of STD’s and what’s curable, and what’s not, is incredibly helpful. I received Chlamydia from and ex-girlfriend after sharing toys, she didn’t say anything to me about it, and I didn’t know I had it until a month or so later when I got my routine check. They gave me antibiotics and it was gone in a week. I immediately cut it off with my ex once I found out because she admitted to knowing about it but not telling me, I can understand she was afraid to mention it as something like that can be embarrassing, but it is basic respect to inform someone of that. 
She swallowed any embarrassment she may have had in order to tell you and even informed you that it’s being treated. When things like this are cured it’s like they were never there.
I can understand not knowing or trusting her as much as you haven’t known her long, so just ask to see the paperwork of the results, yes it is private medical information, but as her partner you have a right to know in order to protect your own health.

That being said, a major factor that hasn’t been mentioned here is the disparity in enthusiasm when it comes to showing support between males and females. There’s a popular Korean meme that goes something like this: if a Korean male likes a restaurant, he’ll support it by becoming a regular, whereas if a Korean female likes a restaurant, she’ll support it by leaving positive reviews. In general, Korean males tend to be less enthusiastic and active than Korean females when it comes to outwardly showing support for things they’re fans of.

You can indeed convert the imperial knights to chaos; every single option for large and small chassis's are playable apart from Canis Rex. And even then you can use his fancy las cutter as the desecrator weapon variant.

As for themes, go wild! Spikes and skulls are the go to, and people do some gross looking muscle and skin themes. I have opted for a skinless muscle scheme growing over metal, so lots of sore and weeping skin as the knights become more daemonic.

By the time that you take a problem as being true it is often too late to do anything about it. You don't know who to trust and question everyone's intentions. Constant mental fog and fatigue. Constant anxiety and frequent panic that reek havoc on your life but you don't really notice is there because you've become numb or accustomed to the feeling. The list goes on and on and I personally don't have a lot of the more severe problems that you see people here have with hallucinations or voices or any of that. Mainly just paranoia and short lived delusions.

I'm not going to lie. It's taken a lot of suffering to get to the point that I am now with my level of insight and the thing that sucks is I've pretty much had to get to this point by myself through constantly dwelling on my problems and looking at them from different angles and entertaining different possibilities and learning to be more open and vulnerable to myself and view my problems as they are and not as I wish to see them. I understand the obsession with the suffering though between the whole ""life is suffering"" and focusing on ""finding meaning in the absence of meaning"" and ""Using adversity as a means to grow and develop on a spiritual level: and so on and so forth with the strong fixation on existentialism and making the most out of shitty situations.

 My main recommendation towards him based off of what has worked for me would be trying to simplify life so it is more easily manageable (I found that through minimalism by reducing clutter, possessions, finances and responsibilities) which helped reduce the amount of stuff I had to deal with and stress over. Using Reddit has been helpful by browsing specific sub-Reddits that address different problems I am dealing with whether it be here, or with anxiety, or minimalism, etc. Exploring certain philosophies like Stoicism and personal philosophies like with Einzelganger on Youtube have helped me shape my outlook on life and perspective towards different situations (though if he were to look into Stoicism I'd just read some books on it instead of listening to a lot of what you find on youtube which would reinforce the whole toxic masculinity ordeal). Journaling can be helpful whether it be on paper or computer and if he doesn't know how to express or word a problem (which I run into all the time) simply do some research to find ways to better word and understand that problem.

If you don't mind me asking, can I share in more detail about what I wrote about how I was afraid to be seen by that chick, mainly the situation that caused the anxiety and shame that surrounded that. I haven't shared in great detail about that whole situation and just want to get it out instead of having to deal with the thoughts of the situation replaying in my head.

No it wasn't. The invasion in Hamas's own words was to destroy Israel. You don't need to carry water for a terrorist group.

\> Israel maintained total control over the Strip through a harsh blockage. The occupation never ended;

Actually the blockade didn't start until 2007.

[Gaza explained: What to know about the enclave | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/15/middleeast/gaza-history-explained-intl/index.html)

Despite Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, since 2007 it has maintained tight control over the territory through a land, air and sea blockade.

So that leaves about 2 years where there was no blockade of Gaza. The next important question is why did the blockade begin? The answer is that after the 2005 withdrawl, militant groups in Gaza began firing rockets at Israeli citizens. The first rockets came within literal hours of the withdrawl. In those two years without a blockade thousands of rockets were fired at Israeli civilians. The blockade went in after the people of Gaza saw fit to elect Hamas as their leaders, a terrorist group whose charter called for the death of Jews worldwide.

\> There’s been many Israeli conferences advocating for resettlement in Gaza, which have been attended by many government ministers.

True, but it has NEVER once been official policy by any Israeli government. They actually tried to return Gaza to Egyptian control during the peace accords with Egypt. Safe to say that outside a few fringe folks like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, Israel has no interest in the Strip.

\> Would they be in Gaza at the very moment? I’m not sure. Would they be in Gaza at some point? Most definitely, yes. They consistently go into Gaza every few years to bombs them. They also would still have a blockage on the Strip.

Come on, don't answer in bad faith. Israel was absolutely fine with the status quo. They were actually starting to loosen restrictions on the strip and grant more work permits becasue they believe that Hamas was starting to lose interest in war. Of course noone knows exactly the future but it is an extremely safe bet that they would not be in gaza right now with the Oct 7th attack.

Bombings of Gaza have always been in response to rocket fire attacks from Gaza. All indications have been that if Gaza stopped interacting with Israel, Israel woudn't have interacted with Gaza.",1733011223.0

And next year, a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, invite your subordinates to join you for an office decoration party. 

2. Get thoroughly acquainted with the policy manual. There is probably a policy against hate speech. Then call a meeting with all your subordinates. Remind them that there's a policy against using racist language, and you intend to enforce it. Tell them that racist language has no place in a team environment.

3. Remember to be the three C's: Calm, confident, and considerate. They're testing you. Don't react as if you're on their level. You're not. You're above them.

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","Way tf back in the early 80's, my mom and I were twice attacked by a man who was convinced he was a vampire. 

The first attack happened at sunset on a friend's farm in the fall. He had apparently been squatting in their barn off and on, idk for how long. After the sun had set, but before full dark, he came running out of the barn, dressed in full Dracula regalia. Cape, tux and everything. One of the men in the house at the time said ""Oh shit, it's him *again*!"" And all the adults started running around the house grabbing rifles. That is the last thing I remember of that night. 


The next time we saw him was later that same fall or early winter, it was coldish outside. Mom and I were walking down the sidewalk downtown in the city I still live in today. He came up behind us, grabbed mom by her shoulders and bit her neck. I can remember her having a big white bandage on her neck for what felt like ages. 


For reference, I was approximately 3 when these events took place, and they are what kindled my interest in the supernatural. Was he a vampire? Hell if I know, but he sure thought he was. How did he find us for the second attack? Idfk, even if he was just mentally ill, idk how he would have gotten our names, let alone our address as I don't remember the police being called the first time. But I don't remember ANYTHING about the first time after the adults started grabbing weapons and running outside to meet him, so your guess is as good as mine. 


These two incidents have weighed heavily on my mind for more than 40 years. Mom has been gone for more than 30 years, and always discouraged questions about both incidents, so I don't know what to make of my memories.",1733011224.0

I was genuinely creeped out as she literally hates me. When I went home I opened the gift and it was a bracelet in a little “Dearest mum” box from a gift store, obviously a gift one of her daughters got her so she put it in a bag just to regift it to me in front of these family members LOL",1733011225.0

But most people outside the rivalry know that ASU started as a teachers college and even offered high school courses. 

Since ASU first came under the Arizona Board of Regents (which also governs UA) in 1945, the record is 44-1-34. 

The next meeting between the schools was in 1946 and it's been annual ever since.

And since ASU became a full-fledged university in 1958, the record is 37-1-28.

"lostmedia","t5_38s0f","The livery at time it went missing is unknown so getting a photo of the plane would help to confirm or deny potential debris that was found and potentially help in future search efforts.

It discusses a photo of the plane from before it was in Alaska and how the equipment is inconsistent with the NTSB report. In general, the potential to learn about the plane, the pilot, and Alaska at the time (especially since it was just months before the disappearance) could potentially at least provide very helpful context and there's even a chance that it would provide huge new clues. As one example, it's unclear whether the plane actually had an ELT, as had been made a requirement shortly before the disappearance. An offhand comment or walkaround of the plane might settle that. As I said in that other post, it's a bit of a long shot but it's one of the highest potential leads that I've come across in researching this. Three is just so little in the way of primary sources outside the NTSB report so anything is potentially helpful or at least worth reviewing.",1733011225.0

This is because in both playthroughs 2 out of the 3 choices favor the N.S.A which determines you getting the good ending, Enrica being alive or not is just one of those 3.",1733011225.0

Yup, it's always about their reputation.  
Good, yeah, they don't all push for reconciliation; but, most do it if: they think they can manipulate you into accepting blame for everything, and you are willing to tolerate more abuse; they're at rock bottom; they're starved for supply; or they want to dodge child support and alimony. When they start being unusually nice, know that they're scheming.   
Is your ex really calculating? Was he more overtly or covertly abusive? It isn't that surprising. Most of them have tonnes of self control, if they didn't, they'd be running around punching anyone who disagreed with them, instead of just their families.   
He doesn't have private 24/7 access to you to be able to be abusive, but he narrowly avoided jail, and probably has the common sense to know all abusive electronic messages can be used against him. Winning in court and sharing custody might be enough. He will probably use the kids to abuse you (mom-shaming, parental alienation, manipulation, etc.) and you have to watch out for signs he's abusing the kids.  40% of abuse doesn't ramp up, 40% of abuse starts post separation, and in 20% of cases it continues and becomes more severe. 6-12 months after court is typically when you can expect retaliation, if there's going to be one. 50% of DV homicide victims are murdered in the first 2 months after separating, 30% in the first 2-12 months, and 20% in the first 12-24 months. Once you hit the 2 year post court mark you can consider yourself statistically in the clear. A new relationship is usually the triggering event.",1733011226.0

"lawschooladmissions","t5_2y2gn","I don’t know, maybe it’s an elitist opinion but I think barring a few questions that are purposefully tricky, LR is a good reflection of your reasoning abilities which are absolutely integral to being a lawyer. If you cannot do that well, a different career choice is probably worth considering. Also, while the LSAT isn’t perfect in tracking your reasoning abilities, and it is variable based on how much you study, the alternative is of course something like an IQ test which would not be able to be studied at all.  I think the LSAT is a good middle ground in that regard. It isn’t so unfair that your very biology precludes you from being a lawyer, but it also isn’t a free pass for the least capable in argumentation to cause problems in the justice system which I think is important when we’re discussing an area of work that has far-reaching implications for society as a whole. 

Now of course I must confess that my opinion might be warped on this being someone who started with a diagnostic of a 167. If you started with like a 140 and got up to a 177 through expensive tutoring programs I imagine your opinion would be radically different from my own given lived experience. My take on the LSAT though is that both alternatives to it are bad, that being a more rigid unlearnable test that would generally bar URM’s from law, and no test whatsoever in favor of idk lol GPA or something. GPA is especially problematic because it generally means nothing in an era of extreme grade inflation. Also, the LSAT stuff is inflated to me IMO because a lot of it seems like people attempting to go to schools above their means where they likely wouldn’t do well to begin with. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with settling for like a top 100 ABA accredited school, you can still do well for yourself at a small to mid sized firm. I suppose what I would like to see to make things more equitable though is a return of the Kahn academy course material to Lawhub, so that way people who are not in a great place financially don’t have to shell out money for a program like 7sage.",1733011226.0

The only advice I would give you is to look at the cards you own, look at what you're missing and look in what packs you could find what you need.

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","Not everyone likes rules, giving or receiving.

Like the drinking water is really only during the summer. In 3 years I've only punished 2 times, because her punishing herself for disappointing me doesn't deserve me adding to it.

In reality many issues, in my personal opinion, in dynamics is this expectation of how things should be. But that other person is human, not a robot. So how things are is what you have to work with. You can voice your conserns, point out need and wants, but in reality you have to realise that person ultimately has to fit their place into this dynamic themselves, and if they can't be what you want them to be the you can't push change on them, that leads to issues, toxicity and even abuse. You only have control over yourself, so you can change your self and hope that they follow suit or you two at least get to a level of compromise.... Or come to the conclusion that you two are just uncompatable in this and decide what that means to you.",1733011227.0

His son Yazid isn't looked on with the same positive light, we think he made a lot of bad decisions and bad things but he was just a Muslim ruler like any other.

I say this because I was in your shoes as a PIC at CVS. I get it. You're swamped. You have a million things to get done, and there's zero help. Corporate keeps cutting hours and expecting more and more. Yet you're drowning. The quick fix is just to stay and get your work done because it makes the day to day easier right? 

Guess what? Corporate doesn't account for those unpaid hours. All they see is that the work was done with 40 tech hours so let's cut that by 10% to save on payroll. Unpaid pharmacist hours are never going to be accounted for at the corporate level. And why would they? Shareholders love a great financial statement and good stocks. So stop. Stop contributing to the problem. Every hour you choose to work unpaid tells CVS you are OK with it. STOP. 

You'll panic and say ""but if I don't care you and z will happen!"" Yeah. It will. Let it burn. Stand with your fellow colleagues that have taken a stand against CVS and let it burn. CVS is starting to fail and some stores are closing. I can't remember which state, but a state fined CVS for their lack of staffing and safe practices. So STOP cheapening our profession and let it burn. Poor staffing and business choices on their part doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your personal time.",1733011228.0

"Soldier11Mains","t5_6idmyu","Your question is extremely good, it generates a good discussion, I advise you to take these three main stats on disc 5: ATK% Fire DMG and Pen Ration, with all of them having similar stats, and test them alone in training mode. 
But, I've already tested my soldier with Rina, it's not that good, but depending on whether you put pen ration disk 5 plus 30% buff from Rina it can work and have better results. 
It's still very difficult to answer this kind of thing, there aren't many creators who make an in-depth video about the total damage obtained with different builds, plus Lightier has just come out.
Now this is a theory from my head or extravagance, call it what you want, but I watch a guy on yt who has the M6W5 char and keeps doing speedrum, and in all of his attacking char the 5th disc has pen ration and the set that gives 8% pen in two pieces, so I kept this in my head and tried to understand, Ellen and Zhu's weapons already provide an elemental bonus and as you refine it increases this bonus reaching 50-60 (I don't remember the total now), so it would be a waste of damage to put more elemental bonus if you already have a lot and have no pen ration, so to better balance the status add piercing rate. So since your Lightier already gives 75% fire bonus to Soldier, I believe that adding Pen Ration will increase her damage, because that way it will ""balance"" the status. 
But of course, try to get the 5 discs of each bonus and do the test there in training mode, and then bring your result to us on the sub, because I'm also curious lol",1733011228.0

I also made cream of asparagus soup with our leftover asparagus w thyme butter. I rough chopped the spears and dumped into a pot with 3 cups turkey stock and some dried shallots I had in the spice drawer. When the asparagus was soft I used an immersion blender to purée to a smooth consistency. Mine was a little thinner than I wanted so I continued to simmer until it reduced some.

"australian","t5_2qmdy","I actually believe negative gearing is not the problem driving price growth (you couldn't use tax offsets in servicing at the bank I worked for). Negative gearing impacts mums and pops, while population growth/demand, poor construction training and standards, poor infrastructure planning, low wage growth and foreign ownership is what hurts the youth looking to get into the market. However if it's good for an investment why can't I claim the interest on my PPOR? But anyway I would vote against removing it if my personal tax went up $20k. Investment properties that are rented out and claiming negative gearing are actually good for rental supply. 

And therein lies my issue with labor, band-aid solutions while refusing to address the underlying issues because they are scared the lobbyists will withdraw funding and run smear campaigns. Grandfathering negative gearing reform just means millennials and below will not get the benefits the older generations were afforded while not actually solving the problem.

They just need to campaign with clear punchy policies we are going to do X to achieve Y. And make sure Y aligns with what the public want. For example Poor wage growth can be solved with a UBI funded by mining royalties and removing the bullshit tax write-offs multi-nationals use - this can also be spun as increasing the old age pension too.

"ComicBookCollabs","t5_2t6p2","This was super helpful! I’m still working on cracking writer-artist-communication, so posts like these are really appreciated.

Got a question about what you said though: Isn’t it a good idea to convey the experience that the reader is meant to have? For example, if I want a panel with a character whose facial expression / body language is ambiguous, could I write “Character A smiles and raises an eyebrow. It’s unclear whether or not they took this personally.”? In my mind, the artist could then visualise an ambiguous expression that could fit either scenario. Or should I always write something like “Character A smiles and raises an eyebrow. They’re pissed, but trying to play it off.”

I generally try to describe the comic roughly how the reader will perceive it once it’s drawn, because that gives the artist a stronger idea of the impact their art is meant to have on the reader. But should I instead put all the information on the page that I’d otherwise leave ambiguous, and tell the artist to obscure certain parts instead?",1733011231.0

John wiped his brow, stepping inside. A sign in front, with letters so begrimed from years of neglect you had to squint your eyes to read them, proclaimed the grimy building to be ‘Lazy Escape Pub’. It was such a familiar routine for John to come here after a long day in the fields, he failed to notice an eager crowd sitting around a mysterious figure; a rare sight in a village as bland as this one . It was only after a third refill of his drink, and after he realised the bartender had stopped listening to him complain about his tractor's engine a while ago, that he registered what was going on. 

“What’s all this then?” John demanded, turning to face the group. Receiving no response, he plucked the piece of wheat he was chewing on out of his mouth, cleared his throat, popped it back in, and repeated, “So, what’s all this about?”

His words were like a knife slicing through the buttery goodness of conversation. All heads twisted his direction. Disapproving glances were fired his way. The tension was so palpable you could cut it with the very same knife. 

“Nothing much,” sounded a relaxed voice. As if in a pantomime, all heads turned in sync away from John and back to the mystery man sitting in the centre. “I was just telling these lovely folks about my new tractor. It's the latest EK1-28 model. I assume you know all about it.”

John looked the man up and down with a suspicious gaze. He too chewed on a wheat piece. “How'd you know I'm a farmer?” 

“Oh, well, all it took was one look at your attire. All that dirt and grime can only come from the fields. Though personally I prefer to change into a cleaner outfit before going out to meet the people.”

His comment was met with a roar of approval from the crowd. 

“Right. Well, I don't know what your whole deal is, pal, but you should know you're dealing with the most respected farmer in town.”

“You're the only farmer in-.”

“What's your name, anyway? I reckon I deserve to know should we be rivals in business.”

“Johnny.”

John tried to divert his attention back to his drink, yet could not help overhear Johnny explaining how he's automated chicken feeding.

“Actually,” John interrupted, slamming his beer, “I find it humbling doing things the traditional way. More rewarding.”

“To… make less profit?” Johnny countered, sipping his own beer.

Like enraged jacks-in-boxes, both men stood up at the same time, brandishing their wheat at each other as if it served another purpose than letting people know they're farmers.

“Farming is an art!”

“It's business - the future lies in automation!”

“Sit down, boys.” a third voice sounded from the corner. John and Johnny turned to see a third figure sitting cross-legged in the corner, glass of wine in hand. “Name's Jonathan. Land owner and farming enthusiast. Say, what seems to be the issue?”

Heavy Financial problems? Yes I have. Let alone all the issues with relatives and friends. But I never count these, as family is the closest that one has. 

Please do not be so quick to judge. And to be fair, there are many who have had it 1000s of times worse than me. I had Kirpa of Guru Sahib, that they aided me in the worst of the worst times. Especially because I had no one I could talk to, no friends, no relatives, couldn’t talk to my own family. Indescribable times.  

Hearing that you have been through things as well, I would also expect you to be more understanding of others emotions brother. Think about the Bhenji. In weddings, if some relative was drinking, I would not sit next to them, I would not interact with them. Why? From personal experiences, it’s not like they will come in aid in worst of ur times. Only Guru does. 

You should encourage her, cuz she’s not having alcohol. And she’s the one who can’t chill with her brothers and cousins, while they all can enjoy among themselves. So who’s the one who has it harder there? She sounds really young, is it wrong for a teenager to not feel lonely and chill with her own brothers and cousins? Ask for their understanding? She has no benefit whatsoever from making herself ‘feel like she’s better than them’ when she’s the one getting hurt. 

This is exactly why people are moving away from Sikhi as well, they get criticism for no reason, criticism for following their Path of Sikhi. I’m 100% sure you have also faced criticism and ik I have too. We both know how that feels. Let’s not do the same onto others :)

God bless you brother, hope all you problems get better and may Guru Sahib give u the strength to go through them 🙏❤️",1733011231.0

Maybe in your opinion, but those two aren't the only bad songs. As well as the intro/outro concert background music detrimenting almost every song instead of the intended immersive concert experience.

In The Dark was butchered with an entire verse removed + the shitty background concert noises obscuring half the song, AGATS2 and Lace It are both stem edits that don't belong on TPNE, Condone It and Jeffrey were not mixed well, Adore You is great but doesn't fit TPNE, and Best Friend was another stem edit with Juice's voice soaked in autotune. 

That's 7 songs that are either trash or unfit for TPNE imo. That's worse than FD's tracklist, which is considered to be a bad album. So yes, TPNE is atrocious.",1733011232.0

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","Nah, tank water is just a giant tank/s that collects rain water. It connects to the houses inlet taps/toilet ect and works similar to mains water...  But it's a finite source. Without enough rain, the tank goes dry and you're out of water. 
Many people will pay for a truck to come and deliver water to fill a tank if needed but it can take weeks to deliver and is extremely expensive. 

We'd carry buckets of water from the local creek or a dam on the property to fill the toilet, water animals and garden. 

Wells are pretty uncommon here. They run dry easily and we don't have the best source of ground water in most places to make them feasible. I'm not sure where you are, but having an emergency source for clean water sounds like a good idea either way!

"Utah","t5_2qwed","Women do have the same right to bodily autonomy that men do, yes. At least on the moral level. Legally, banning abortion is restricting women’s bodily autonomy. Period. 

The right to life does not outweigh the right to autonomy. If it did, organ donation would be mandatory. If someone can’t use your organs after you’re dead unless you gave consent when you were alive, or your designated representative gives consent on your behalf, then no one gets to use your organs without your consent while you’re alive. Not even a fetus. 

Yes, women are in fact entitled to equal respect. Men do not deserve greater respect for being men. To believe they do is the core of sexism, and it’s bullshit. 

The pay gap has been proven to exist.

If women had equal access to opportunity, there would be an approximately equal number of women in high-power positions (and women’s athletics would be as prominent as men’s and paid commensurately, among other things).

"WeightLossAdvice","t5_31a4o","Getting enough sleep. Especially, if you binge at night, you are tired. That is your body trying to save you and it makes you crave simple carbs and sugar to have quick energy. When you are sleep deprived or tired, your body produces more of its hunger hormone ghrelin. Those cravings are a result of increased ghrelin caused by sleep deprivation.

Work on stress reduction. When you are stressed your body produces more cortisol, your stress hormone. Cortisol makes you crave fatty, comfort foods. It also makes you more likely to store fat from excess calories around your midsection and makes it harder to lose that fat. So, ways to reduce stress are getting enough sleep, being in nature, light exercise, laughter, deep breathing, yoga, meditation, a craft or hobby, or whatever works for you.

Not totally eliminating foods I really like. There are no good or bad foods. It is all just food. Have a serving. You can have more tomorrow. Three cookies does not ruin your diet, but if you think it does and then finish the bag because you think you ruined your diet, then you do ruin your diet, for that day. Tomorrow is another one. Unnecessary restrictions lead to cravings, binges, drama and despair. Free yourself from them. Learn to eat all foods in a slight calorie deficit. I find that if I think I can have it and I choose not to have it, then I do not crave it. I am in control. Also, I can have it, and it s just fine, so no guilt at all.

For example, he's a ski patroller at the local mountain. He's a visual artist with shows at the local gallery. Or even he is a really good cook who happens to be cheerful in all situations. Something like that. 

I also know some dual lawyer, dual professor and dual doctor couples who met in grad school. That shit seems miserable because it's pretty obvious which one is more successful and they're constantly serving as each other's professional sounding board or career coach. 

Where he is going through a career change, the dynamic sounds tough. He is going to feel pressure to be good at whatever he does to be a worthy partner to you, and with the change, he's going to be a beginner for a while.",1733011233.0

This idiotic myth that all cats are standoffs and cold and all dogs are happy and loyal is a ridiculous stereotype generally perpetuated by people who don't understand cats at all, don't respect their boundaries, don't take time to win their trust, don't communicate in ways that cats understand and simply expect them to be like dogs or otherwise write them off as ""assholes"" or disloyal. 

My street cat my family rescued slept on top of me and jumped on my shoulders. My family cat growing up used to carry my barbies around for pony rides and slept with me every night too. My cats all come to me during the day for attention and love. 

Anthropomorphizing dogs saying they are ""loyal"" because they are less reserved animals in general who engage with unbounded humans easily and benefit from behavior that has been studied more and is more widely understood by the general population.",1733011233.0

It snaps back up when I pull it upwards but there is zero pressure down to the floor.

I'm not really mechanically minded. Though this is the first car that I've learned how to do things like brake pads and other minor repairs on. What would be the smartest course of action from here?

Also, you have to learn to live with the inevitable emotional distress for those first few weeks after you finally cease all nicotine usage. It sucks, but it's something you have to go through in order to get to the other side.

There’s no evidence of her having a “mental breakdown” on set either - that’s all speculation and doesn’t seem true since she’s still close to the 2nd AD of OBX since season 1. If she’d been that disruptive the 2nd AD *would not* like her. Plus, she was in New Orleans shooting a different Netflix show during filming in 2023 (The Corps) - why would they hire her if she was that much of an issue?

- Dublin is in the middle of a severe housing shortage, so don't expect to be in a position to be too picky. Having said that, Dublin 6, Dublin 7 and Dublin 8 are popular with younger renters, and have good amenities within walking distance. Dublin is safer most US cities, but if you are especially safety conscious then you'll probably want to avoid living in the north inner city which is gritty in places.
- It is near impossible to find rental accommodation that will accept pets. Nevertheless, pet ownership is common and lots of businesses etc are dog friendly. Importing a pet to Ireland involves a tonne of red tape, and you'll need to get a dog licence as well.",1733011234.0

If you have enough karma from r/CrackheadCraigslist, have a verified email on your reddit account, and your account is at least 2 weeks old, you now have mod powers!

(Except from u/JohnMackYT, as that would be cheating)

The way it works is simple.

If you have at least 50 karma here, you can make a top-level comment starting with `!lock` to lock this submission.

Or, if you have at least 125 karma here, you can make a top-level comment starting with `!remove` to outright remove it.

Doing either of these will award you with your very own 'wannabe jannie' flair, and will cause the action in question to happen to the post.

But, what if you disagree with this action?

If you report the !lock or !remove comment at least 3 times, it shall be undone.

Democracy at work!

They knew each other in high school/briefly dated but reconnected when Josh started to get big on the Bills. Seemed sus to begin with. She buttered herself up at first but at some point Josh realized she was a gold digger. He seems much more genuine than her & probably wanted to settle down with someone different.. 

I’m sure he had fun with Brit, hence the 3some rumors that led to the breakup, but I don’t think he ever planned to spend his life with her",1733011235.0

"forestry","t5_2s5wq","A bit harder now days, but used to have cans of chili or soup. Cook it on the engine, often had some bailing wire off of the exhaust.

Frequently did two thermoses, one for coffee or cocoa, another for soup. Paired with what most now call charcuterie, but, it's ""eat like a toddler"" or ""adult lunchables"" with pepperoni, salami, jerky, cheeses, crackers. An apple or orange, or in the winter time, jams and jellies.

A real treat were pasties, or hand pies. Sweet, or savory, and already cooked, or just warmed over a small fire, oxy/acetylene torch, or foil wrapped on an engine.

Of course there's always a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a bag of chips, but it's not my go to.

I will say the crockpot was always a lifesaver. Get it going on low before leaving the house and coming home to a hot meal was nice. Pulled pork, refried beans, soups, pot roast, were my go to and made for leftovers that I can heat up with breakfast for the thermos. Pot roast makes a great beef stew, beans and tortillas can be cold and hot sauce will warm it up, or pulled pork sliders with pickle chips is fine cold out in the woods to fuel back up.

Some breakfast foods work alright. Crepes or swedish pancakes travel well, and can be eaten cold. I would make biscuits and gravy, then plan ahead like the pasties and make biscuits filled with sausage gravy. Heat them up on an engine or eat cold.

Hopefully these help or spark ideas which works well for you.",1733011236.0

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","Hi! How are you feeling?


Last October I broke up with my now ex. We dated for two years, it got harder towards the second. It was long distance relationship, we never met each other before. But we use to message everyday and call. Of couese some days we couldn't and it was understandable.


But one of my biggest mistakes was I couldn't communicate with him. I lacked communication skills, I never wanted him to feel guilty for hurting my feelings or the times I felt the loneliest in our relationship. 


Towards the end of our relationship, there was distance between me and him. We're all out conversation we're short, we hardly spoke to each other. I started to feel unhappy and everything was eating at me. Yet I didn't communicate nor asked for reassurance. I cried almost every other day, the lack of interest to answer my messages was getting to me. I didn't care if we weren't able to call. But all I wanted was simple updates of how he's doing, what's he up too (Since he lives in the UK but is now studying in France and I live in the usa). 


I use leave my time free for him, spending time with him. But everything changed once he got to France, he was a lot more busier, out messages became less frequent, to the point there were times he didn't message me to late afternoon my time, twice were I didn't hear from him. 


The day I called him to break things off, was the longest conversation we had in months, we spoke for three hours. Since then we haven't spoke. I understand the first week was hard but I was feeling better. But lately I catch myself bring him up in conversations, or something reminds me of him. 


I do miss him, but I do believe it was the best for us. Sometimes I do wonder if I didn't give up would things be different?  Lately I been wondering if I should reach out, he told me he was going to give me space when we broke up. He also asked if we could still watch movies and videos again sometimes. But I feel like I don't have the right to message him, I am the one who ended things.


I also don't want to message him after he's been healing or rebuilding himself. I feel I would be selfish if I did. I don't want to make things difficult so I been staying away. ",1733011236.0

Obviously I will because I need that insurance payout.

>Or when a family member of yours is murdered.

Ahh yes, why not throw out an example of an extreme situation and ask if the same rule applies as regular everyday crimes like burglary or assaults? You really seem like an intelligent, enlightened individual. The real answer is that random murders are way more sensationalist and put the police in the spotlight so they'd actually have to do their jobs for once and I might get an actual outcome. So yes, I would call police in this case. But in the more realistic cases you mentioned earlier of burglary and sexual assault. No, there's no point unless I need the police report for something. Maybe if I had a camera set up and already had a clear image of the person's face then I would bother going to the cops, if not then I'm just wasting their time and mine because I know they don't want to investigate it.

Have you ever had your house burgled? Literally the first thing the cops do after they ask which way the burglars came in and what they took is start talking to you about what you'll need for your insurance. Even THEY know what's up. Seriously what fucking world do you live in? Do you get all your information about cops from watching Columbo?",1733011236.0

Without port forwarding your set up is always going to be somewhat limited. It will never be high-performance, because there’s no way for the swarm to connect to you basically. You’ll be able to download without many issues though ie connect to them, but it will also be in the limited type of way so that might be where your problem is coming in at.

Ok, so, i’m trying to understand your set up. You have qBittorrent routed through Gluetun in the Docker Compose setup, all its network traffic is tunneled through Surfshark and not port forwarded? I feel like that should certainly have the orange flame icon for your connectable status and it doesn’t? Maybe there’s another variable somewhere or maybe I’m not thinking of something",1733011237.0

It’s really not unreasonable to judge the group by the content of its vastly predominant religion’s infallible scriptures .

"rpg_gamers","t5_2su0w","One lesser talked about game - Avatar Frontiers Of Pandora. If you’ve ever seen or played a Far Cry game post-FC3, it’s pretty much that… But on Pandora. Stunning visuals, incredible sound design, pretty “okay cool whatever” story, but it is indeed co-op and has a lot of “just mess around in a big open world and kill bad guys”. Not a lot of endgame, but like I said most of the fun is just running around killing baddies. Same would go for Far Cry 5 - big open world, has co-op, pretty good story, not a lot of endgame. 

I’ll also mention the Diablo games to represent ARPGs. They all play like a MMO, in my opinion, though D4 is the only one that’s ACTUALLY a MMO with other players around you and public dungeons and raid bosses and stuff. Diablo 3 is solo or co-op, not at all a MMO, and is still pretty great, but they improved a lot of things for D4 that make it kind of a “win some/lose some” kind of thing.",1733011237.0

"factorio","t5_2wabp","Low range isn't really a problem in space age? For big biters or small pentapods I used defenders and never really felt in danger, unless I have done really stupid things which would endanger me with anything (maybe spidertron has enough tankiness to really save you always).

Destroyers used to have a ""problem"" with range against huge waves of behemoth biters (50+ with 50+ spitters), but that was ""fixed"" by range buff. So I really don't know what you're talking about in practice - you (or your tank) will always need some shields when not doing turret creep. You always will be at risk when diving blindly into many big/behemoth worms without poisoning them first. Capsules don't change anything about that.

5k destroyers is ridiculous number, that's dozens of hours of clearing large late game nests. At that point in the game cost for such long term massive expansion does not matter as you have at least 200spm anyway, do the math how big % of the your output is the bot cost over that timespan, especially with space age productivity bonuses. You also won't have just one spidertron for clearing nests at that point . . . so the entire cost comparison is weird.",1733011238.0
"NextCloud","t5_3ev3e","If you do not trust the E2EE features from nextcloud then you should use the E2EE features of other programs like rclone which work fantastically.

Since you are security conscious though let me just give you some advice.

Go on eBay and buy a cheap 1U server. Doesn't really matter what it is. Then slap 4 3.5 inch hard drives in there @ 20TB/hdd. Then raid10 them. Congrats, you now have 40TB usable storage.

You can colocate these 1U servers (provided they only draw 2A power) for around $49/month here where I live.

Then you can either host nextcloud (or) use sftp/scp, which rclone conveniently supports.",1733011238.0

I understand they are working with Tucker’s players and a large number of transfers. But to get blown out by Rutgers at home in a must win game? That’s completely unacceptable. One of my biggest issues with Tucker was that we kept getting blown out in big games. That didn’t change at all this season; OSU, Oregon, Indiana, Illinois were ranked teams who demolished us. The difference is that now we are letting middle of the pack B10 opponents cook us too. 

A bowl game would have brought some much needed momentum into the program. I have no clue how guys like Hall, Marsh, Ramil, etc will stick around after this season.

Mais tu… as lu le livre ? ou vu le film ?

Tout le principe du livre, c’est que justement Ms Bennet ne l’admire pas du tout parce qu’elle trouve que c’est un vieux con prétentieux (je résume) mais qu’elle apprends à le connaître et voir derrière ses préjugés. Tu sais ce qu’indique le titre… Orgueil et Préjugés

Le reste des filles admirent Mr Darcy, non pas pour ces principes et sa noblesses, mais parce qu’il est trés riche et que c’est un bon parti (dans un monde où les femmes ne peuvent pas travailler et compte sur le mariage pour survivre).

Sérieusement, je te conseille de lire plus de Jane Austen et tu verra en quoi, non l’estime et l’admiration n’était pas du tout universelle. Et à quel point les personnes de la haute société et que beaucoup de monde admirait était aussi des petits égo insupportables.

They are also more likely to have higher education and be more intelligent., but elected representatives listening a little more to the educated than the uneducated doesn’t sound so bad.

The inflation chart doesn’t show wages which have also gone up faster than inflation so it doesn’t give a complete picture of affordability The biggest riser is healthcare which shows the failure of Obamacare, but also doesn’t account for improvements in quality. There are many new treatments, such as a cure for hep c, and hpv vaccine, metformin for diabetes, and ozempic for obesity.  Sticker prices for college have gone up dramatically but that is mostly for overcharging for international students, If you take inflation into account t the price of in state tuition actually paid by the average student has gone down 40% for public schools and 12% for private

The real issue here isn’t the question itself—it’s the audacity of Ahmadis to respond at all. For some critics, it seems that Ahmadis are expected to remain silent, regardless of the accusations leveled against them.

How dare Ahmadis speak up, clarify misconceptions, and challenge baseless narratives?

[https://imgur.com/9mPS40B](https://imgur.com/9mPS40B)     
Be sure that anyone claiming can prove ownership with their own pictures>  there shell sections /shapes, coloration defining lines, and coloration and section are like fingerprints, no two tortoises are the same.    Look at the shapes of each section( called a scute) and cross reference them to pictures provided to YOU, look at the shape, the coloration, the lines, the defects, they must match or its not the same animal.  
The markings on the head are also very individual and clear, compare those as well.  
  
Unfortunately you are going to have people try to claim this tortoise when it is NOT theirs.  
A trick they like to use is this plan:  
The say, ""hey can you send me some pictures so i can see if it is my tortoise?""  
Here is the scam, all they have to do is say , Yes that my tortoise, they hope you are trusting or naive and hand it over...and they are gone.  
I posted a 100 lb Sulcata Tortoise on local groups once and had 4 people try to claim it before the actual owner was able to provide definitive proof with pictures.

If someone asks YOU for pictures just say no im sorry i cant  , you must be able to prove to ME that you are the owner.  If you have and question do not release the tortoise.

I don't think you understand...I don't care what *her* reasons were for being out there with Harris.  I am, however, much more concerned with why Harris spent the last month of that campaign palling around with her.  It was to try and pull votes from the right.  And it failed....like spectacularly failed.

>It shouldn’t have mattered who was on the campaign trail in this case.

But it absolutely does.  Her father may be one of the most hated politicians of all times.  Her voting record was right in line with Trump.  No one that is left of center in this country would look at that and feel inspired to vote for the campaign that actively courted her endorsement....and that's exactly what we saw on election night.

>But as per usual the left looks for any and every reason to justify their lack of support. 

Votes are earned.  The Harris campaign and the consultants she had made it perfectly clear that they preferred the approach they took and they lost because of it.  And now like clockwork they are blaming left for the shitty job they did.",1733011241.0

In neutral, there's also this feeling of ""why him and not others?"", you know? In genocide, his anger pretty much stops at attemping to fight you as a last stand after Papyrus dies, though he does threaten you earlier. This also fits the lack of any impulsiveness he shows.

It also makes sense for Sans to keep this smile. The only time it even slightly changes is, for a very brief time, the moment he gets dealt the killing blow.

I'd understand him being upset, but certaintly not have any strong emotions take over him. If there's one thing about him that's shown through the entire game, it's that he never really lets his emotions take over.",1733011241.0

"HairTransplants","t5_33y6y","Hello, 

For anyone consider using this clinic, Heva, to book an appointment, as lots of people look through reviews to decide, I strongly recommend AGAINST this clinic as they lie to patients about who would be doing the procedure. 

First off, they have been caught operating a chain of accounts posting fake reviews, which admins have recently shut down

https://old.reddit.com/r/HairTransplants/comments/1fd0mxy/reddit_admins_suspended_a_ring_of_astroturfing/

Next, There are multiple cases of patients who were promised Dr Seda but they gave him a completely different person. 

Even with Dr Seda, I would recommend against this clinic anyway, as the Doctor does not own the clinic. In fact, on the clinic website, there is no direct link to the doctor. That is because they want the reputation to remain with the clinic as much as possible, instead of the doctor, which is evidence in how they lie to patients and swap out the doctor. But hair transplants aren't fast food, they are highly individual to the doctor. 

But one of the main points of the doctor is that doctor also has a team of technicians that they have personally scouted and trained. This is not the case with Heva clinic as it as a hair mill; they contract to whoever is available that day. This makes going to the clinic like playing Russian Roulette. 

I highly implore people to go to a surgeon who owns the clinic they work at, and have complete control over the scouting and training of the technicians, and that they work day-in and day-out everyday to the point where the techs can be described as like reading the Surgeon's mind. That the accountability and responsibility starts with and ends with the surgeons. 

Not only is it important to go to a clinic that's owned by the surgeons, but also that the surgeon has track record documented by full journey independent reviews. 

Here is a list of surgeons we have identified as having a high volume of reviews that you can scout out 

https://old.reddit.com/r/HairTransplants/comments/14cu4w4/draft_of_list_of_surgeons_you_can_scout_because/

It's not guaranteed to be comprehensive nor any guarantees about the quality of the surgeon, this is just a list of surgeons we noticed that have a high number of reviews for you to assess, and are generally in good standing with the hair transplant community though even that is hard to ascertain. 

However I feel it's the best starting list compared to the other widely known ones such as IAHRS, HairRestorationNetwork,Spex, and HairTransplantMentor, who all have surgeons with terrible standing with the hair transplant community because they get paid a monthly fee for putting them up there, even ones with a horrific stream of botches like what HairRestorationNetwork did with dr diep. 

In other cases, there are surgeons with little or no full journey independent reviews.

"Biohackers","t5_2vnoe","You are correct, it has a full spectrum of frequencies. Some are stimulating, such as the UV, Blue and green, and others are reparative, like the red and infra red. Based off the position of the sun, it could be used as a red light panel. Mid morning and afternoon work well for this. Nature is free. Other things to consider, being in a green area in the shade works well- the green reflects the red stuff. It’s like restorative red light treatment in nature. 

The panel just uncouples the light frequencies to allow it to be more restorative, less stimulating. Given the imbalance of blu light in the RGB LED lighting environment we have created, it can add a little more balance in our lives doing it a few days a week. 

Sun is king, as it is a perfect balance, powerful, and provides the signaling to sync our circadian clocks. Building a solar callous is important in fully utilizing it. The red panel is a good little extra.",1733011241.0

"TheFirstDescendant","t5_67nnu3","This sub does not appreciate nor they have the maturity to discuss these kind of conversations. Balancing in PVE games is always a tricky subject, however it's absolutely necessary for every game.

The future seems promising only to current/active players, nevertheless I have not seen or heard any strategies to recover lost players nor gain new ones. The game already has a dedicated playerbase but I really don't believe they bring enough to keep the money rolling, specially knowing how NEXON operates. 

If season 2 offers a lukewarm experience with less challenge thanks to the current meta, I foresee most of us ""veterans"" leaving for good, since we just got bored of using/seeing the same 2 characters.

I don't think I would be able to take a RR series seriously if all of the actors playing these characters are of average height and build.

Last time, moving to blue states protected you.  Last time, trans rights faltered but did not fall back (much).

That was then, this is now.  If the attacks on trans people laid out in Project 2025 and Agenda 47 come to fruition, it’ll be a disaster.  We’ll be stripped of our HRT, our ability to use public restrooms or, if we work for federal systems, the ability to use a restroom at work.  We’ll lose our passports.  We’ll lose our identities… and quite possibly our lives.  And while red states will be worse, some of this applies to blue states just as much.

If we flee now… we’ll be rejected for asylum, and we should be.  Our situation is bad, but there are options to make it better.

But that may change in the next six months.

I have five different plans to deal with this - options for “Status quo” plus four others, with the last plan being about a need to flee the country.",1733011242.0

I'm take the cables off the hub and use the SYS FANS on my motherboard to control them seperately. By using a different speed on each of the fans, you get rid of the whine when they all have the same speed. For control, i just use Fan control from github.

Points that are well documented and researched- rational and logical

The pay gap is a reality because women don’t do the dangerous dirty jobs that we all depend on/ farming, mining, engineering, and the various trades etc

And the poster is correct that in the most egalitarian feminist cultural  environments - (Sweden)women chose the most sex differentiated work - that’s what the data shows- the reason has been theorized that in a world where the culture is unisex- work is the only place people have to lean into natural masculine and feminine roles

But “feelings” - and the propaganda and indoctrination of feminists is hard to overcome

And the feminist go to - when confronted with rationality is ti always mock a man’s penis size and lack of success with women- 

Which is the whole point op is making - the women folk don’t argue logic or facts-  just ad hominem a man’s penis and lack of T and that’s their counter

Every time

I women wonder why they are increasingly disrespected by men for “feelings” thinking over logic

"JoeRogan","t5_2s4tv","Who do you think is the powder keg?

Russia is creating and fomenting extremism by perpetrating genocide on Ukraine and has off and on for a long time. Shocking that corruption and borderline enslavement by Russia would push people to idealize somebody that fought against them. 

It's like saying you shouldn't help a battered woman get away from her abusive husband because she might create drama for you. The Ukranian people have been through a ton of shit with a homicidal genocidal maniac living next door. Any problems they have are minor in comparison to Russian aggression. If unchecked it won't stop. And they need help to fix all their problems. 

Russia lives off of sowing chaos and disorder in their neighbors and swooping in to put their puppets in charge and take over. 

Nobody should pretend Ukraine doesn't have problems. But their biggest problem is a raping and pillaging mob state next door who's made it their business to disrupt the entire world through bots and other means. Give Russia what it wants and it'll keep going. And it won't stop with Ukraine.",1733011243.0

"arcane","t5_2re2c","I do see what you're saying here... I also hate 'fake-out' deaths but I dont think it bothers me that much here surprisngly. Like, sadly, it comes back to Jinx/Vi limited screentime in act3, because I think great concept of an ending is there, but it ends up weaker than it could have been because of time. So let me tell you why I think ending could have hit way stronger.

Even before S2 started, with Warwick showed in the trailers, I rly liked the idea of ""Jinx kills her father.. for the 3rd time... but **purposefully** this time"". And I think show was very well setup to make this work. In classic Arcane fashion giving us sweet reunion, ultimately cut short by a tragedy and 'death' of Vander in favour of the beast.

I also liked the main arc Jinx had across entire season, where she basically thinks that she deserves to die - like Jinx herself being the biggest believer of the jinx narrative, of her being a curse (what she tells Smeech in ep2). Then, simlarly to Warwick, act2 gives Jinx hope at beating this stigma, just to hammer it home with Isha's death.

So basically what those 2 things nicely lead up to is: Jinx saving Vi from Warwick and Jinx choosing to live, leaving the narrative of her being a curse to world, behind her. **And both of those things actually happen, so what gives?**

In my opinion... it's how the Vi/Jinx conflict with Warwick is manufactured. It's basically sidelined in the final episode and entire setup to Jinx 'sacrificing herself' feels so avoidable instead of imminent. Vi kind of just walks up to Warwick and Jinx has to save her.. If that entire conflict of 'Vander is gone' had slightly more time to breathe, or if the fight with Warwick in general had more time it would feel a lot more natural I think. Like all the pieces are there: Vander is dead, Jinx has killed her fathers before twice, for once it would be Jinx saving Vi, Jinx would like Vi to think she's dead as per their conversation in prison in ep8, Jinx choosing life would complete her character arc spanning entire season... **but it just feels like steps show took to get there are too artifical... too easily avoidable.** Thats my take on the topic at least.",1733011244.0

If City win, sure Liverpool are kept at only six points ahead of us, but City potentially snap themselves ouy of their funk and back into action, which would be bad for our title hopes, and let's not forget, their next two fixtures are home against Forest, and away to Palace; fairly doable fixtures regardless of how they've been.

If Liverpool win, sure City's slump continues, but Liverpool would move 9 points ahead of us and have some serious momentum behind them, but they might potentially expend a lot of energy against City, and their next two fixtures are both away to Newcastle and then the Everton hosted Mersyside Derby; not exactly straightforward, despite the strong form Liverpool have been in.

If they draw, then City will only be a point behind us, and Liverpool will be seven points ahead of us. This would continue to keep things close with us and City, and City would've ended their losing streak in the Prem, even if they extend their winless streak to 7, which could still be a step toward their psychological rebuild, and it wouldn't necessarily take much pep out of Liverpool's step.

"brisbane","t5_2qutz","In my experience (no air con) a ceiling fan on 2 (out of 3) with a window open is the best. I sleep naked with a thin sheet. Obviously in the peak of summer it's still a drag. But when it's unbearably hot I'll wet a tea towel and put it on my head / chest / back without the sheet. You'll end up taking off the towel cause you're cold from the evaporative cooling, and that's when you've got 30 ish minutes to get to sleep before your body is too hot again. 

If you're working warehouse / manual labor, my vote is super thick cotton pants so they tent around your legs rather than sitting on them. Same goes for your shirt but the good ones (hard yakka from bunnings) also have mesh under your arms and on your back to keep ventilation. 

Air flow under your clothes is gonna be better than clothes touching you, getting soaked then being non-breathable as they're wet.",1733011244.0

They should have made it clear it was a separate thing from the start or at most been referred to as “the successor to Yo-kai Watch” (which makes it clear that it is a new thing). And as for the AI in the footage, I’ve heard speculation that it was because they haven’t made enough of the game to show off, because they are juggling so many projects. To which I say - you shouldn’t push yourself to put out a trailer if the game isn’t ready to show off.

He couldn’t be understanding he always pushed me to just try harder, give more and showed me and even told me that work comes first. I wasn’t supposed to spend on my CC after we had paid it off.  But he just kept hurting my feelings and I was sooo sleep deprived I was sleeping only 1-4 hours averaging 2 hours per night for 7 months straight. I hated him because I felt snaked, I had no out he wouldn’t give until I would collapse, always using money for the reason. I wanted to hurt him too, nothing changed for him after the baby and he refused to see me. I took money from him just a little cash 100$ here and there went out with the baby bought myself food and ate at the park, I was happy it was worth the risk for me then because it gave me a fighting chance against my mental illness, then one day he went to count it, I panicked and pulled it from my credit card and put it back into his cash.

"birthcontrol","t5_2snsq","Hi! This is super common in the first couple months of BC. Just a piece of insight from a fellow acne-prone person that docs may not always tell you: the progestins in pills can have different effects on skin. I struggled a lot with acne on the first pill I was on, and the whole reason I was on the pill was to resolve it (lol). With some research, I found out that the progestin in my pill—called levonorgestrel, and coincidentally the same as in your pill—is androgenic, which means it is similar to testosterone in that it can contribute to acne & things like that. Androgenic doesn’t mean *bad*, and everyone’s body is different, but generally for people with hormonal acne, the less androgenic pills are the ones that are more helpful for skin. You could try one with a less androgenic progestin, like the pill Sprintec (also known as Estarylla and various other generic names). Sprintec was one I went on but there are many, many options. Any combo pill without levonorgestrel will be less androgenic. 

I’m not advocating that you switch—it’s your body! And also, these side effects don’t always last long. In fact, I’m back on a pill with levonorgestrel now years later and I haven’t experienced acne beyond the first couple months. It just depends on everyone’s unique hormones and how they respond to the medication. I wish someone had told me before that the progestin can affect skin, so if you find that the acne doesn’t resolve, at least you might have some new options to try that may work better :)

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","Not a massage therapist, but I’m a nurse and when I was earlier in my transition I had patients tell me they were comfortable with me but not with men, despite being early on t and post legal name change. Yeah it made me dysphoric, but at the end of the day I sort of just blocked it out and did my work to care for the person, as long as they were comfortable and cared for that’s all I can do. I didn’t deceive them, I still introduced myself as my name, and if they decided that they’re okay with me for whatever reason and not someone who looks more typically as a man then so be it. Meditating on the fact that I am a just as real as a man regardless of how others perceive me really helped me get through it. It’s not easy, but you are a man regardless and if at this point others feel safer with you because of their trauma with cis men, you are not deceiving anyone, you are just being you even if they perceive you incorrectly. It doesn’t make you less of a man.

Keep in mind the further you go along in your transition if you choose to do hrt, have a name change or have surgeries, the less this will happen and the more clients will treat you as a typical male. You’ll have clients who won’t be comfortable with you because of how you look and that’s okay. Eventually that happened to me in my work the longe I was on T. 

Also off topic, but as someone who does a lot of work on my feet I’d love to pay for a professional massage, but I’m terrified as a trans person. I’m scared of taking off most my clothes and being clocked, and would feel instantly safer if my massage therapist was trans or had a little trans pin.",1733011246.0

I was only in doubt about 2/3. I want to start saying I think ENHYPEN is *really* understimated. I'd say that, currently, they are the second most comercially successful 4th gen boygroup. After Stray Kids, they sell the best, have the best daily performance in streams and have the biggest touring numbers. Even their hits are among the biggest internationally. 

The reason why I placed them #3 instead of #2  despite of all I said is that, *for now*, TXT left a bigger impression on K-pop community and seems more influential on their generation. Not to mention, for a moment they could be placed #1 and were 'rivalizing' Stray Kids neck to neck in several metrics.",1733011246.0

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","Lords of Fortune are definitely less relevant, but when my background DOES come up I've enjoyed it! I think that Shadow Dragons makes the *most* sense for Rook imo. 

That said, my personal rankings (LOVING all of them to bits, but I do have my gripes):


1. Grey Wardens: Easily one of the most relevant factions. Evka and Antoine are pookies and honestly if I do more runs in the future I am seriously considering my GW Rook for my next one. I can only imagine how much more gutpunchy it'd be.

2. Shadow Dragons: I think that while they're the most *generic*, I find myself going ""Oh maybe my Rook should've been a SD"" often, despite how much I love him being a LOF. The only reason they're not #1 is becauase I wish Maevaris, Viper and Tarquin had more content to stand against Evka and Antoine.

3. Lords of Fortune: I'm biased since this is the faction I picked, but I just REALLY kinda vibe with them not giving a huge fuck about everything. They're the party faction and the game kinda treats them like it, despite Isabela literally being in the previous 3 games. I love that my Rook is a Lord, having been a slave and then trained as a mage and now using his expertise as a treasure hunter and relic retriever to lead the Veilguard. 

4. Antivan Crows: I really enjoyed their storyline. Teia and Viago need to kiss already!!!! I do feel like if you're a Crow, though, you do overlap with Lucanis in terms of expertise. 

5. Mourn Watch: Myrna and Vorgoth. That's pretty much it. And that's almost enough. The Haunting quests are fun but don't feel too connected to the PEOPLE of the faction. But I adore Vorgoth.

6. Veil Jumpers: Strangely the faction that is reading as most forgettable to me. I feel like we needed a lot more expansion of the elvhen peoples' relation to Solas, and the Veil Jumpers' expertise more often than not feels missing. I love Strife and Irelin, but they felt pretty irrelevant unless you're doing Bellara's quests or if Emmrich and Strife date, and even then it's kind of a one-off. IF I do enough playthroughs to do one of each faction, my VJ Rook will be the last one.

Ultimately my rankings really are biased by me playing as a Lord of Fortune and by what I personally look for in terms of side quests.",1733011247.0

I think it's a talking point some of them just repeat & don't even know what it means.

However, I have seen people say it forced on children & shoved down their throat to just mean representation. Our teachers, TV show characters and ect.

So I think it depends on the person. They could be deeply homophobic or just repeating random stuff they heard & didn't think deeply about.

S6 is easily my least favorite season but I have to say I feel like another big part of why SPN feels so different post-S5 is that Kim Manners directed a lot of the episodes in S4 and before. he was also an X-Files director and had a unique style that stands out and gave the show a lot of personality. unfortunately, he passed away in the middle of S4, but imo Kripke was kind of his protege in a way so he was able to carry on (no pun intended); Kripke frequently acknowledges Manners even in recent years. when Kripke left, it wasn't only him leaving, it was Manners' legacy as well. I feel like early seasons SPN actually owes more to Manners' style of filming than Kripke's writing",1733011247.0

Pokemon playground is a new feature rolling out in Pokemon go.

 This feature is the second half of the successor to the group buddy AR mode they had removed from the game in favor of the new self group ar mode they added several months to almost a year back. This new feature can be found currently in San Francisco and New York City for play testing and show up as little orbs around random gyms and pokestops. Keep an eye out for them. 

The feature allows players to play with their pokemon in AR mode and even leave A Pokemon at these areas for other people to take photos with and interact with. (Imagine a dog park setting but with Pokemon instead.) The feature allows your Pokemon to stay for 48 hours. After that it will return. 

These ""Pokemon playgrounds"" can be found literally ANYWHERE. They are not limited to parks or playgrounds, they are simply called that by Niantic. 

Pokemon playground has no curfew hours but can appear on curfew pokestops and gyms depending on where the game generates these areas. 

Pokemon playground will roll out everywhere else after the initial play testing in San Francisco and new York City.",1733011247.0

The info you are sharing is directly off the gtr sight. I call bs on it. Cannabis is cannabis. Been doing it paper tpwel and root plug for a vert long time. I grew a test of other seeds side by side and the test were great.  It was poor or old seeds.  I didnt harvest it because i was trying to get clones to root from the one plamt that grew. 0 out of 50 rooted. This is a very difficult plant for some reason.  Im now flowering it and treating it with sts spray to hopefully make some seeds. The seeds are way to high priced for their difficulty. If they dont clone they are not good for any production setup.  At 25$ a seed we arent going to grow each seed to maturity and harvest not getting any clones. That would not be economical.  There are so many great seeds and suppliers out there i just dont see a point in messing with the seeds i bought.  Maybe at $4-$10 a seed these seeds would be affordable enough to mess with.  In the time ive messed with one plant ive already had 2 harvests done.  Its just not worthwhile.  If you are going to give gtr a go id suggest contacting them and asking for a discount and in return give a grow journal.  Thcv isnt an adhd solution.  It stimulates but not in a way that helps with adhd.  There is a lot of discussion of this around.  I guess in ending dont always listen to the excuses seed companies use for their poor germination.  The seed has no way of knowing what medium they are in. They want heat and moisture. The medium means nothing.  Gtr did however replace the pack that failed.  I havent tried the new pack.  I was hoping the one survivor would save the day. It didnt. Hoping to get a good amount of seeds so that i can experiment more without losing so much money on it.",1733011248.0

“As for the Hanafis, they regard it permissible to get married without a guardian, but they stipulate that two witnesses must be present, who can hear the marriage contract from both parties. If two witnesses are not present, then the marriage is not valid according to them.”

“According to the Hanafi School of jurisprudence, if a free pubescent woman marries a man without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is valid whether she is a virgin or a previously married woman. If the husband is considered a suitable match for the woman, her guardians have no right to object to her marriage.“ https://www.islamweb.net/amp/en/fatwa/86348/

"yoga","t5_2qhq6","Yoga is one of the lifestyle changes that helped make my ADHD more manageable! 

Creating new habits with ADHD is really difficult so try to latch onto an existing habit/routine that doesn't cost you too much effort. Do you brush your teeth at the same time every night? Do 5 minutes of yin yoga right after. Do you drink tea every morning? Do a couple sun salutations while waiting for your kettle to boil. Once the habit has been ingrained you can expand on it. 

The post you mention really resonated with me as well. When I struggle to do things which I *know* would be good for me, I try to change my mind frame by telling myself I'm actually helping someone else - and the someone else is Future Me. ""Oh, I'll do a yoga session today to help Future Me, she'll be so grateful when she realises her back is less sore at the end of the day - all thanks to Present Me!"" 

Other things that I have found work well against ADHD freeze:

- gamifying chores. Follow a 30-day challenge with yoga with Adrienne, or challenge yourself to do one more minute everyday (so start with one minute and a month later you'll be doing 30minute routines)

- body doubling: do yoga with someone else, or even do yoga with someone while they work on something else entirely. ie, do yoga while your partner does the dishes. 

- having others hold you accountable for it. Ask a friend if you can call them in thirty minutes after you've done your yoga - this way you'll know they'll ask about it when you call, and you feel compelled to actually do it. Ask your partner to remind you to do your yoga.

- setting a reasonable timer. Like a previous commenter said, tell yourself ""I'm just going to do 10 minutes"" and set a timer for it. Your brain will be more likely to be motivated to do it if it has tangible proof that it won't take long and be too difficult. And once you've started... You might find you don't want to stop. (This one works very well with cleaning too, especially if you challenge yourself to do as much as you can during the set time)

- if you don't mind music while you're practicing, play some fun, stimulating music to help get your body moving. You can combine this tip with the one above by creating playlists of a specific duration. 

- sometimes I just take a long hard look at myself and tell myself ""just fucking do it"" and... It works. Only for the small things, mind. It doesn't make me magically do the huge chore that I've been putting off for weeks, but it can be enough to help myself snap out of the freeze.

Mensen die in complottheorieën geloven denken dat hun medemensen die in de overheid zitten alles weten en kunnen en bewust alles aansturen naar hun wil.

In any game Frank could change the emphasis and have the left sided player hug the touchline more, make Mbeumo more central, and all of a sudden he has three returns in a game potential.

If I sell Mbeumo I earn 0.3 less than buyback for him. He's on pens. The bad fixtures are overstated because Brentford consistently score against big teams.

The issue is we don't build enough housing. That's it. That is the cause of the housing crisis. 

But we can't just admit that because it means having an honest conversation about *why* we can't build enough housing fast enough in blue states and what specific policies *(rigorous environmental reviews, concerns of gentrification, complex requirements for enough units to be affordable housing, ""developers shouldn't make a profit"", protected historical sites, etc.)* prevent new housing from being built.",1733011249.0

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Simply put, it is cleaner this way.

Whilst all the Moffat era companions do end up living in some sort of manner, they all also die in a manner which is very clear on screen. The Doctor is also explicitly anguished by the exits - he goes into retirement after the Ponds depart, takes his actions in Hell Bent to save Clara and considers not regenerating in The Doctor Falls. Russell is not decontextualising the Moffat era companion exits as dramatic as he is merely building upon that.

The Chibnall era companions like the whole era in its entirety is a lot more confusing. All four companions depart alive and whilst you could argue some of the exits are traumatic, the show is not clear at portraying that. Not to mention the mindfield of having to address Yaz’s exit.

Toymaker: “Ad you kicked Yaz out for no reason""
Fourteen: “Mandip Gill’s contract was up!"" 

> The Flux was ultimately just a storyline. Yes, it was devastating in-universe, but it was never treated as something with emotional stakes in the Chibnall era. RTD tried to recontextualise this in both Wild Blue Yonder and The Giggle, showing that the Doctor was actually holding in a huge amount of guilt for the Flux. 

Russell had already worked in the Flux being emotionally sensitive for the Doctor in Wild Blue Yonder so referring it again reinforced this aspect. Having to bring in the Chibnall era companions to then contextualise them as failings is more work. 

> But it's still nowhere near as powerful as characters who the audience had a connection to.

That assumes the Chibnall era characters are people the audience has a connection too and I don’t agree that that assumption holds up under scrutiny. 

Consider the following. The ratings and reviews were much lower during the Chibnall era so fewer people saw it and fewer people were as connected as they were to previously eras. Then you have the issue that most of the Chibnall era companions departed willingly so bringing them up undermines the point of the scene but only mentioning say Yaz makes their absence all the more noticeable. If you do bring Yaz up, you have to recontextualise a recent show runners character and their exit story. Instead of doing all this, you could just refer to the Flux - which you have already addressed in your last script.",1733011249.0

"askpsychology","t5_2t0gc","I agree it should be accommodated just like physical disabilities should. However, under our current model of disability, autism will fall their for most people. Maybe mildly impairing in some cases to the point that others don’t notice but it takes more energy to keep up with neurotypical abilities.

Autism isn’t a trait, it’s a developmental issue where the brain diverges from its normal development and therefore there are gaps in abilities that are beyond normal variance and is impairing. And the reason it’s such a wide spectrum of presentation is that there is no autism brain blue print as there is in typical brain development, it’s brain development going wrong at certain points with no set pattern.

I urge you to look into neuroscience and brain development to better understand why this is the cause with autism as opposed to a personality trait and other typical variances. It’s important if you want to wrap your head around this. Abhorrent development is behind this. That does not mean we should not be an inclusive society or that there are not strengths that come out of it; but rather it’s despite the developmental issues and actually more to do with personality traits and resilience, which will vary in autistic individuals just like neurotypical individuals",1733011250.0

Take down the blinds and either patch the holes or scrub them clean and rehang. If the kitchen comes across as well kept, that will reassure buyers that you have loved and maintained your home.

1) you often double-stack merlin’s np, as you no every three turns,so it works out to be the same 10% charge per turn.

2) 20% party wide charge to help with insufficient charge due to bad card rng vs a single target 30%

3) panic button when the solemn defense charges somehow run out(protects any team member, not just merlin

4)the hero creation works as a burst heal.

4) the bonus stars help to have some nice crits to build no charge.

Dacă, ipotetic, Călin Georgescu ar fi un agent secret al Rusiei și ar încerca să candideze la președinția României, sloganurile sale ar putea avea scopul de a atrage segmente ale populației cu idei naționaliste, anti-occidentale sau nostalgice. Acestea ar putea fi formulate în așa fel încât să pară atrăgătoare și neutre, dar să servească indirect unor interese externe. Exemple ar putea include:

1. „România Suverană, Puternică, Liberă!”
(Accent pe independență față de influențele externe, dar vag în sensuri).


2. „Viitorul României este în mâinile noastre!”
(Un apel populist care să respingă implicarea străină).


3. „Pământul nostru, Bogăția noastră!”
(Mesaj axat pe resurse naturale, posibil legat de retorica împotriva multinaționalelor occidentale).


4. „Unirea Românilor, Refacerea Demnității!”
(Un apel la unitatea națională, sugerând o ruptură cu alianțele actuale).


5. „Cu România înainte, fără dictatul străinilor!”
(O aluzie anti-UE sau anti-NATO, mascată în retorică suveranistă).



Astfel de sloganuri ar încerca să capteze sentimente de nemulțumire față de direcția actuală a țării, dar ar evita formulările directe care ar putea dezvălui interesele externe.",1733011252.0

After all, automation... AI... offshoring... really, does the boss class even *need* the worker class any more?  sure, they need a small army of us as service workers, doing those asskissing jobs that are just not really satisfying to their egos unless a human can be coerced into doing them.  but that army is *small* as compared to the workforce today.

I mean we've had this perfect storm of intersecting trends over the last few decades.  Rising population, yet globalisation sucking jobs out of the country.  Automation sucking even more jobs out of the country, steadily encroaching on what once were boring but reliable paid positions.  Now AI brings that trend to the white collar worker, even to the creatives.  Layoffs ahead!  There are gonna be a lot of people the oligarchs just don't need, and most of the 1 percent are such stone sociopaths that ""culling the herd"" is *exactly* the way they would think about this.

So first you propagandize and bamboozle the herd into refusing lifesaving medicines;  make health care unaffordable so they can't get treatment;  get them fighting each other by stoking bigotry and hate;  push obscurantist religious drivel in schools so they have no understanding of science, tech, critical thinking, even literacy (have you looked at US literacy statistics lately?).  Criminalise more and more behaviours so there's an excuse to scoop the herd up into private for-profit prisons where they can be used as slave labour for whatever is cheaper to use slave labour for than to build robots.

Hey presto, a world that works perfectly well for the oligarchs and the ""house slaves"" who admire and support them.

[Roth 401k isn't often the best choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10qwnrx/why_you_should_almost_never_contribute_to_a_roth/)

You can read [Traditional vs Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth) on the wiki. Traditional 401k + Roth IRA is a good combination for a lot of people.

>I recently opened up a Roth IRA with Fidelity and maxed it out but have yet to invest

What's your 401k invested in? A Target Date fund (at fidelity, specifically the Fidelity Freedom *Index* Fund 2065:  [FFIJX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315796839), or your own [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)

>But I’d also like to soon open a brokerage account.

1. Traditional 401k up to employer match
2. HSA (if offered with your insurance) up to annual limit
3. Roth IRA up to annual limit
4. Traditional 401k up to annual limit
5. After-tax/post-tax (not Roth) 401k converted to Roth (this is the mega backdoor Roth process, but requires your 401k support it, not all do)

Otherwise what I do is wrap the persons arm in plastic wrap and mark out areas of the body like elbow, ditch, wrist and deltoid. Cut it off and draw from there. Remember that there are kind of 4-ish planes you’re working with for focal points (outer arm, inner arm, outer forearm, inner forearm.

Designing a sleeve that connects all the way around can be quite tricky if you’re not used to it. So make sure whatever you draw is easy to adjust for the artist.

As far as figuring out what your dad likes…are the sleeves supposed to be about him, or focus on representing his kids? What mood is he going for? Colour or black and grey?

Get him to make a Pinterest board (or similar) with tattoos that he likes. He sounds really picky though so good luck! You know him better than any internet stranger so maybe take him out and dig into his interests more",1733011254.0

Thank you for posting to our subreddit! As you read this, we’d like you to take some time to review some of the rules of our subreddit, just to make sure your post won’t have to be taken down by our moderation team. Daily we have to remove dozens of posts due to being random images with text in the title and/or body text. Absolutely none of our mod-team are full time Reddit moderators and absolutely none of us are paid in the slightest, so please help us out by double checking your post to make sure it generally follows the subreddit.

If you are confused as to what image you should make, start by simplifying what you would put into the body text, and put it over an anime, furry, or generally silly core style image! You can use mematic or any image editing software for this.

Thank you so much for reading, stay safe and stay silly <3

"singing","t5_2rlcx","Ears. Young singers who are labeled ""talented"" by their peers and teachers typically have really good ears. They can effortlessly sing in-tune. They pick up on things like style, phrasing conventions, and diction quickly because of their ability to hear and replicate these things in their own voice. They can probably imitate other singers very well. This leads to a very ""polished"" sound though they may have only been singing for a short time. Later in a singer's career, ears (and more broadly, music theory and aural skills) are what allows a singer to get a call on a Tuesday morning to fill in for a show on Friday night, with music they've never read or heard before. Good ears and theory allow you to learn music quickly.

Body awareness and control. Being able to do the same thing with your body over and over. Listening to your body. These skills can be taught and grown, but in my experience, there are also people who just have a knack for this over others. Stage presence fits in this description as well.

Lastly -- when talking about the upper echelons of singers, like the people who get brought up in GOAT conversations, certain individuals have sublime innate gifts that just cannot be taught. Not everyone can have high notes like Ariana Grande, David Phelps, or Lawrence Brownlee.",1733011255.0

u/samp4264 as Model F!

Yet another newcomer to the series! Like Model P, I don't have much to say for the Biometals in general, since they barely speak in ZX. For Model F, we went with a rough and tough voice to emphasize Fefnir's extravagant personality. I think he did a good job! That's about it, enjoy the scene!

Thanks for the request, u/JeriArt ! Man, this one was rough. Maybe as rough as yesterday's. I had to be very careful with how I used the overdrive. Since Model P isn't upgraded yet, he only has half a bar of WE. I decided to not use any Charge Attacks, and rely on base attacks, while activating and deactivating the Overdrive to deal damage efficiently. Now, here's something most people don't know: With Model P, you NEVER button mash. Instead, you HOLD down the button. This is because each Kunai has a different priority point. So, if you shoot, let's say, one single Kunai, and then shoot another one, you'll only deal one point of damage. But if you hold down the button, and shoot two Kunai, you'll deal two points of damage instead, because the second Kunai will have a higher priority hit point, allowing you to follow up the first one with it. With this in mind, you can chain them together to deal big loads of damage. You could also throw a Shuriken, but as I said, I didn't have enough ammo to include it in this. This boss heals quite a bit, specially in hard mode, so each usage of the overdrive matters. I purposely hit Fistleo in his weakpoint whenever he tried to heal, to deal some extra damage, and it helped quite a bit. I also used Phantom's Shadow Dash, that one foot chip from Z3 that gives you invul while you dash, to avoid damage at one moment. Most of my strategy revolved around keeping my eye on the boss, and reacting to him, or predicting what he was gonna do. I also never used any attacks in the air, because those would deal less damage for the same overdrive cost. That's about it. Model PX is cool, I don't care what anyone says. Enjoy!

I was in charge of thanksgiving this year, because I am in culinary school and wanted to put my skills to the test. I was handling the big dishes, like turkey and mashed potatoes, and delegated smaller things, like desserts and yams, to other family members.

My sister (23) called me (26) 2 days before thanksgiving and said that she assumed I was already planning on it, but wanted to make sure I was doing all the dishes vegan. She has recently become vegan, so this is the first thanksgiving she hasn’t eaten animal products.

I told her that no, I am not planning on changing ingredients in any of my dishes to make them vegan, but that there’s are already a lot of dishes that are vegan anyways, and she is welcome to bring anything vegan thing she wants if she’s worried about not being able to eat anything. 

She got really upset and said that I should change all the recipes to accommodate her, because it’s simple swaps like using vegan cheese in the mac. I told her since we have a lot of family coming, who are not vegan and not used to vegan swaps, they might not like the food and might think it tastes off, so it was better to make classic dishes. Plus, there’s no way to do things like turkey vegan. 

She got even more mad, and pointed out how no one cared when she served only vegan food at her birthday, and how a few years ago when my brothers celiac girlfriend came, we had gluten free mac and cheese. I told her that no one cared at her birthday because it was a day exclusively centered around her, so it made sense she got to pick the menu, and pointed out that my brothers girlfriend made her own mac to share, and that we had regular mac anyways, and repointed out how i was fine with her bringing whatever she wanted anyways. 

She then hung up the call, and said she would bring some of her own dishes and whatnot. i figured that was the end of that. 

Later that day, she went into our family’s shared note where everyone signed up to bring a dish, and privately texted all the family members saying I wanted her to let them know to make their dishes vegan. I only found out because my aunt texted me asking if it was fine to use honey in the rolls, and I asked why it wouldn’t be. She then showed me the text my sister had sent her about the rolls needing to be vegan. 

I angrily told my sister not to come to thanksgiving. She didn’t show up. 

Now, it’s a few days past, and I feel really bad. I feel like maybe I should’ve found a better compromise. A lot of my family is saying I should’ve just accommodated her,  so, AITAH?

And like, 23 years into this relationship and I just never even saw or understood it until the past few weeks. Like at all. I literally have to tell our housemates ""if you need him to do something, you need to tell him, because he doesn't respect me, he never listens to anything I say""


And when I say to him that he doesn't treat me like he loves me or respects me, he either points out the things he does do for me (and, like, it's a lot) or just kind of looks at me blankly and ignores what I'm saying because it's ""obviously not true"". And like, we're both on the spectrum, but he like uses that as his reasoning for not getting a job or why he gets so ornery when you ask him directly to do anything.


Sorry, this comment just really resonated with me, I'm 41 and have been in some variation of a relationship with him since I was 18, and just it amazes me how it could have been this long and I only just heard it today. And I'm typing all of this while I have some sort of food poisoning and he just made me rice because I'm hungry and can't keep anything down, so it's like how could I even think of him as abusive just because he doesn't respect me? He's providing me care when I really need it in this moment, but like, I guess that's how the cycle goes?


Anyway, thanks for your comment, I really needed to read it, maybe even save it to re-read from time to time.",1733011255.0

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Rob Lee retweeted this [thread about Syria](https://x.com/putintintin1/status/1862993373256118283):

“[Assad] regime will put up a fight in Hama because it prefers an urban area over an open base in the countryside. Opposition is not an army that can clear and move from a street to another while battling armored vehicles and tanks.”

“Russia doesn’t have the ability to send soldiers and officers, the RuAF in Syria can’t launch a lot of precise airstrikes against opposition armed convoys like it did between 2016-19. Regime airforce can cause a lot of damage but not a successful air campaign.”

“Syrian opposition know its limit in terms of power and won’t overplay its hand. The manpower will be needed to clear Idlib and attack/defend regime pocket in military bases south Aleppo city. SNA forces may be useful reinforcement in Aleppo.”

“So far it seems there’s a sort of deal between opposition and SDF in Aleppo; SDF allowed rebels into international airport and didn’t clash with them inside Aleppo and even withdrew from Zahraa in north Aleppo. However, one bullet could lead to tragic response.”

“Turkey doesn’t like SDF advancing but it wants to wait to see how this develops, maybe a deal reflects the atmosphere of peace process inside Turkey could be underway. But Turkey won’t strike SDF inside Aleppo because of RoE with Russian army.”

“Aleppo is trade center, it needs its factories working to feed the locals but this requires security and fuel. It also requires business elite that Turkey have been hosting  even when they were pro-regime (eg; Syrian Parliament expelled member for having TR citizenship).”

“Iranian response will be very difficult, sending support from east #Syria could trigger Israeli response, it’s also not as powerful as 2015-19 when Hezbollah was the backbone, Qaani is not Soleimani. But I doubt significant response from US forces in NE Syria.”

“All coup and clashes in Damascus rumours are not true. If anything happened we would’ve got more than sketchy low resolution video. Still nothing official or credible about Assad travelling to or from Russia.”

“Talbise in Homs, Zakyie in Damascus countryside and the entire province of Daraa have been clashing with the regime since 2018 for several reasons and none of them has anything to do with HTS, Turkey or rebels. Suwayda protests won’t lead to insurgency too.”",1733011256.0

I decided to do my first ever stealth netrunner playthrough, but keep respecing into a sandevistan build for more straightforward guns blazing action. Back and forth, all throughout the playthrough lol 

The stealth hacking system is a lot of fun now, mixing queues of hacks to disorient, distract, and knock out enemies with silenced pistol headshots... plus, with the new hacking mechanics, there are tons of hidden combos (you can now queue up to 4 hacks at the same time on a target, depending on your intelligence level, and use a new ability called overclock to use your health as RAM, with regen perks and quickhack properties that, if you study what they do, will allow you to create a near endless feedback loop of synapse burnouts on everyone).

Most quickhacks will have enemies start tracing you, except for covert ones like memory wipe and ping. Tracing is a new system that requires stealth hackers to race against the clock (or a filling bar that fills faster the more non-covert hacks you use) or be detected once it completes. If you queue memory wipe, reboot optics, then sonic shock on an enemy, it will not only reduce trace progress because of the memory wipe, but the three hacks queued together actually cause the same effect as system collapse: so it's instant non-lethal lights out for that enemy.

Then, because the system collapse quickhack itself gets cheaper each time you reduce trace progress, you can use the above combo a few times, then use system collapse on a skull-level elite enemy for an easy takedown. Or, even better, if the enemy netrunner starts directly tracing or hacking you, you can now hack them back through walls, and with the right perks, whatever you hit them with will spread to all enemies connected to their network.

So memory wipe>reboot optics>sonic shock a few enemies, get the netrunner to show themselves, and hit them with system collapse for only 4 RAM (it usually costs 28, which is close to all of your RAM in one hack, unless you use overclock), and watch as it spreads and knocks out every single enemy in the base you're infiltrating.

It's very satisfying and really gives the player an opportunity to feel like they're actually outsmarting the enemy.

The new netrunning perks, cyberware, and mechanics have been ridiculously fun to dig into, especially the new iconic cyberdeck you find if you take a certain specific path in Phantom Liberty. I won't spoil what it does, but let's just say it taps into the power of the blackwall in a way that turns V into an eldritch cyber god if you use it right.

Enough rambling from me, though, half the fun of most of this stuff is discovering how it works yourself. Have fun!",1733011257.0

I may not be the best person to ask as I've never been deeply religious. But, my opinion is definitely not actually kill people for leaving. We don't have fatwas.

That said, I can easily imagine deeply religious Jews mourning the deaths of their children who have left or married outside the faith. In fact, that happened to a second cousin of mine when he married outside the faith. His father and mother divorced when his father mourned his death and his mother refused to do the same.

That said, mourning someone's death and never speaking to them again is NOT the same as actually killing them.

---

To make the matter a bit more complicated, the Torah does specify that those who leave to worship other gods or suggest that other Jews follow them in worshiping other gods should be stoned to death. But, no one does that today. I'm not sure if they ever did.

It's almost amusing that the authors of the Torah never considered the possibility of atheism. It's one of the differences with Christianity and Islam. Both of those were conceived in a time when formal atheism existed. At the time the Torah was written, it did not. So, belief in some deity or deities was just assumed.",1733011257.0

"Invisalign","t5_2uslh","So. I have a few deep fillings, from childhood *and* recently from a medication. At one point I did think I had something wrong because I felt a pain where I'd had the majority of recent work done. I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from, but it felt like a deeper pain than a surface ping from a cavity. Turned out it was from clenching + how my teeth were sitting at the time (the pressure points) and it did resolve and all of my x-rays have been fine. I was worried starting with these fillings, but I haven't had any issues yet. I also have my wisdom teeth fully in and they're healthy, so they aren't doing anything under the surface that could result in a complication.


Sometimes I do have sensitivity, but I already had that going in and moving my teeth probably sometimes makes it worse, but at the most I just don't swish around really cold drinks and I'm fine. What I was warned about was heat and if I have prolonged sensitivity to hot drinks or food then it's time to make an appointment to see my dentist for x-rays.


I've also had braces as a kid, so lots of previous movement, but decades ago. Never any severe dental trauma, like falling and hitting my teeth.


I'm trying to hit anything that might lead to potential problems, which is why this is so long lol. If there's something specific you're worried about, make sure to be really frank with your doctor (and also make sure you've done your due diligence finding a good doctor).",1733011258.0

I had surgery on my left foot and was in a cast for 8 weeks. I couldn't go nearly anywhere for a summer break so had to settle for a shitty caravan holiday in Norfolk (Brits will know what I'm talking about).


Had nothing else to do so put on whatever was on TV and came across RHONJ Season 2. From this, I watched more and more and more episodes and more clips from other shows. From then on, I became hooked.

That stretch from 2014-2015 I was particularly hooked which tbf was a golden stretch for Housewives and is enough to get anyone into a show to a point where they don't look back.

RHOC Season 10

RHONY Season 7

RHOA Season 7

RHOBH Season 5

RHONJ didn't air during then and I didn't watch Season 6 (pretty glad I didn't see it as it aired tbh).",1733011259

This led to them not getting as much money in the check as they were expecting. Note, that all works out when you do your taxes at the end of the year. 

Anyway, my point is that you need to go over the breakdown of that final check and see if those 36 hours are in there or not. I had some difficulties getting copies of that breakdown for my employees, because they all had their checks auto deposited and the breakdowns were available on the company workday website, except since they were terminated they couldn’t access the website. Like I said, we got it worked out and they were able to see the hours they had worked in the last pay period, their severance and the breakdown of all the withholding.",1733011259

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","In fantasy worlds, battle tactics can vary widely depending on the presence of magic, creature types, and terrain, but some common strategies include: - flanking maneuvers (coming in from the side), 
- using terrain to advantage, 
- archer volleys, 
- magical area-of-effect spells, 
- ambushes, 
- utilizing specialized creature abilities,
- coordinating with powerful magical users to disrupt PCs formations, movement, and magic.

Basically the same stuff you do in real life Tactics and Strategy (which ***you can research***), except you have magic and monsters and living flame throwers and tanks that have long tongues instead of canons.

Magic-based tactics:
- Dedicated mages can cast spells to disrupt party formations and movement, provide defensive shields, or unleash powerful area-of-effect attacks.
- Counterspelling: Having mages capable of countering PCs spells is crucial in magical battles. 
- Terrain Alteration: changing the terrain to provide more cover, narrow paths, provide high ground.

• Creature-specific tactics:
- Fast, mounted creatures like horses or griffons can be used to overwhelm enemy from the sides.
- Aerial creatures like dragons or wyverns can provide aerial bombardment or scout positions.
- Large numbers of smaller creatures can be used to overwhelm and harass PCs.

Terrain utilization:
- Narrow passages: Ideal for ambushes or funneling enemies into a concentrated area. 
- High ground: Provides an advantage for archers and ranged attackers. 
- Obstacles: Utilizing natural features like rivers or cliffs can impede enemy movement. 

Some common tactics used include:

- “Hammer and Anvil” tactic: A combination of a frontal assault (the hammer) with a flanking maneuver (the anvil) to crush the PCs.
- “Hit and run” tactics: Utilizing fast, lightly armored units to harass the PCs from a distance, then quickly retreat. 
- “Archery barrage”: Deploying a large number of archers to bombard the PCs with arrows from a distance, softening them up before a melee engagement.
- “Magical siege”: Using powerful area-of-effect spells to bombard enemy fortifications or large groups of troops.
- “Creature distraction”: Sending in a large number of expendable creatures to distract the PCs while the main force attacks from another angle.  

When it comes to designing an encounter, you focus on the strategy for it first. A “strategy” is the overarching plan or long-term vision for achieving a goal, focusing on the “why” and “what,” while “tactics” are the specific actions and steps taken to execute that strategy, representing the “how” to achieve the goal on a day-to-day basis; essentially, strategy sets the big picture direction, and tactics are the detailed actions to implement that direction.

Strategy is why that encounter is happening now, Tactics is how they handle it. Most creatures have a handful of very simple tactics they use (much like PCs), and will retreat or pull away if they are unsuccessful or lose too many people (something determined by the strategy).

The Actions of each creature give you an idea of their tactics right away. That’s in the stat block. The reason for it all, the strategy, is based in your setting and adventure.",1733011260.0

Like someone else said in this thread - make Frieza close to the limit of what sheer power scale is, and make the other villains dangerous not because they are exponentially powerful but due to their specialities as well. And reintroduce super saiyan bit by bit. 

Androids were dangerous because they could absorb ki and had infinite stamina. Cell is dangerous because he can do everything the androids can, has the zenkai boost ability due to his saiyan cells, and knows all of the z fighter techniques. Buu is even more dangerous because he's the essence of the demon realm - he has majin ki, which lets him do absurd magic, and he has extreme regeneration to the point of atomization. 


The scaling of the fighters should go like this -> 

Goku gets a glimpse of Super Saiyan in the frieza saga, kills Frieza and loses it. 

Trunks never goes Super Saiyan during the king cold encounter- but his base strength is significantly higher. in fact, he came to the future specifically to know from goku how to achieve the super saiyan form. He asks goku to go super saiyan and goku turns SS momentarily but cannot hold the form. 

Android 19 and Dr. Zero are significantly weaker and goku only loses due to the heart attack. Vegeta cleans up without going SS. The Android 17 and 18 fights happen as before but the androids are weaker and no one can go Super Saiyan yet. 

Piccolo fuses with Kame and reaches the Android's level, he is now comparable to Base Goku and Vegeta. 

Goku finally manages to stabilize Super Saiyan during the training with Gohan before the cell games. he fights with cell and its a draw.  

Gohan finally unlocks super saiyan after 16 dies - since Gohans base is way larger than anyone, his super saiyan is way stronger. Gohan loses access to the form after cell throws up 18, and gokus sacrifice. When cell comes back, gohan cannot go into super saiyan again and struggles. Then the kamehameha moment happens and gohan hears Goku's spirit and goes into SS again to defeat cell. He loses access to the form after that since he hasn't managed to stabilize it. 

Trunks goes back to the future and unlocks SS finally due to Vegetas training and his newfound evidence that Super Saiyan form can be achieved, and defeats the andoids. 

Vegeta goes under Babidi's control specifically because Babidi promises to use magic to unlock Super Saiyan for him so that he can match goku. Vegeta goes Super Saiyyan for the first time, and fights with goku. 

Later instead of Goku going SS3 - it is revealed that Goku has perfected the SS Form so that it no longer drains stamina and thus he can finally use Kai-o-ken with it. He fights buus demonic ki, with his ""divine technique"" and as already established - Kai-o-ken has the same effect of making Goku's ressurection time shorter due to the strain. 

On Supreme Kai's planet Gohan's potential is unlocked - allowing him to finally stabilize SS and perfect it to Goku's level - which makes him much stronger than Goku since he has way better base stats. He fights with Buu. 

When buu absorbs Gohan - Vegeta and Goku fuse using the potara but cannot go super saiyan since vegeta has not perfected the form yet. but their bases multiplied are good enough to dominate buuhan. 

During kid buu, Vegeta manages to perfect SS and hold off Buu while Goku prepares the spirit bomb. 

at the end of the series, all 3 saiyans have a perfected super saiyan form.",1733011260.0

Si vos consideras que la carne local debe ser más barata que la carne nuestra exportada entonces le das la razón a los peronistas como los muchos que se están quejando del precio de la carne en este foro o del combustible cuando ponen una noticia.

¿Se entiende lo que planteo?. Yo estoy viendo que mucha gente hoy se queja de los precios pero estaría interesante saber de esos que se quejan a quien votaron, porque si votaron a un tipo que te decía que las cosas deberían valer lo mismo que afuera entonces se dieron un tiro en el pie al votar.

Contemporary is all us fools who came after and do variations and supplements to the core ideal. And I think Joe would approve, he was all about learning and growing, I don’t think he ever intended for it to be a static format. 

But we respect the legacy. We learn the core, Joe’s method. And then we continue his legacy with addition and variations as long as it’s all evidence based work! Nowadays Pilates and PT often work together so well, and it’s because of Joe’s ethos!",1733011261.0

We have this with trucks, you can do a Silverado, or a Sierra Denali and the swing on those two are a bit.  So if you crept up to the higher end vehicle, he may have wanted to go down a notch or two, which he really should have mentioned when you guys were getting these.  Now on the return of the money, there will be several things already mentioned here.  Maintenance will be higher, the vehicle may need tires soon, gas mileage will probably be worse, insurance may be different and finally, the trade in / end of life price and / or years expected will be substantially lower.  I agree with everyone here and say this should have been discussed before pulling the trigger.  But now that you are in a spot like this, maybe offer a one time $ 5k check and cite the items mentioned here as not justifying the full $ 15k but that maybe you can look at the total cost when the vehicle needs replacement.",1733011262.0

"fnaftheories","t5_36f29",">Everyone always dunks on FrightsParallels, and I... never really understood why? People call it ""cherry-picking"" even though even if you do think the Stitchline is canon, there are plenty of non-canon stories with clear parallels to the games. 

the issue with parallels aren't that they're parallels. it's that this version of parallels doesn't exist and is self-contradictory. thematic parallels exist but they are not what fnaf fans think they are

no, andrew isn't just a parallel to cassidy and therefore, not canon to the games. that's not how it works. yet many claim it IS how it works. or jake for instance being called a CC parallel just for dying by a head injury

the issue with these parallel theories is they focus on a single trait a character has similar to another and then claim they're just stand-ins of that character. jake for instance is more similar to charlie than he is to CC yet nobody says that? maybe it's because puppet shows up in frights so it'd be ridiculous to claim that jake is a stand-in to a character that already shows up

it's also contradictory cuz characters like william and susie show up as themselves, yet people still claim the other ""parallels"" are just stand-ins

>One of the biggest examples of this is Hudson. Unless you're part of the niche group that believes Hudson is the Fright guard (which even then doesn't make sense because Hudson dies in the book but you stay alive in the games), you know that Hudson is a parallel to Michael.

WWF is a retelling to FNAF 3 but it still keeps it's core traits. that being the location, the phantoms and springtrap. into the pit has the original frights story, a graphic novel adaptation, a game adaptation AND an interactive novel retelling. and all of these contradict certain things to each other. the game for instance has 5 nights even though the original story had less days take place. and the game is the only time oswald saves kids as he never did in the original story

but here's the thing, the core traits are still present. the location being jeff's pizza, formally a freddy's establishment, you still have the ballpit that takes you to 1985, the main antagonist is an agony creature taking the form of springbonnie and he still kidnaps oswald's dad and pretends to be him. hell, all versions even got the same ending too, where oswald saves his dad and the yellow rabbit strangles himself. despite the differences in the books and game, all still hold these same core traits. as they are **different versions** of the same story

so with this in mind, why would hudson be any different? why is he specifically just a michael parallel when we have clear proof that retellings only change certain things about the story but not the story itself? michael doesn't even show up in fnaf 3 and to this day he's only ""implied"" to be at fnaf 3 due to the logbook. but an implication is not confirmation. thing is, michael actually has little evidence of being at fnaf 3, we all just assumed he was because it makes sense. and while it makes sense, we are directly told the guard is hudson. and no, parallels don't apply here as WWF is straight up a story about **fnaf 3 the game**. furthermore, You're The Band has a security guard named mike. so tell me this, why would scott make a parallel to michael and not michael himself? when he's shown clearly that he would just add michael if he needed to? objectively speaking, there's only direct proof of the guard being hudson

also i just want to say something about this point real quick 

>(which even then doesn't make sense because Hudson dies in the book but you stay alive in the games)

it's actually possible the guard didn't survive fnaf 3. i mean, after night 5 we're only told that the place burned down. nothing about our character. help wanted 1 however, has an interesting implication. in fnaf 3's night 5 of that game, the place is burning while you're in it. hudson burned to death in frights. HW1 could be implying that the guard died in the fire. which is another thing to link with hudson

>Additionally, if the stories that are part of the Stitchline are canon, the parallels that are contained in them (such as Pete and Chuck clearly paralleling Michael and Dave) should absolutely not be ignored. I'm just very confused why people always seem to groan whenever parallels from the books are brought up, since I think they're a very interesting topic of discussion.

im just gonna reiterate in my first point that the issue is the parallels proposed by the community are not at all what thematic parallels are and stem from a misconstrued definition of ""parallels""",1733011262.0

"Hmong","t5_2smv0","So, this all started when my mom, my sister and I moved into our current house. I’ve always known this house was haunted, we moved in when I was 5 years old, I’m 16 now. The first night, I felt like I was being watched, I of course couldn’t find out what it was, but I just shook it off as my mind getting used to a new place. Then after about a week, I still had the feeling, stuff was also getting misplaced. I asked my sister if it was her that kept putting my stuff in other rooms, and she said no. (She was 3 at the time) I also asked my mom, but she just told me it was myself. I of course knew it wasn’t me, but as always I just shook it off as nothing. I was a sleepwalker after all, then about a year later I started hearing banging on my walls. That scared me, I remember the first time like it was yesterday. That kept on happening for about 3 years, then one day I saw a woman looking at me from the corner of my room (I was about 8 at the time) She was just standing there, I was creeped out, I called my mom. But it was as if she wasn’t there, also, I couldn’t do anything other than stare at the woman. I couldn’t move, I was paralyzed and the woman was tiptoeing towards me. After that night I slept with my mom, that helped a bit. I didn’t really witness anything until my 12th birthday, the night up towards my birthday, the woman appeared at the end of my bed. I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared, I was awoken at 2 am. I tried to shake it off and go back to bed, I tried to make the woman believe I didn’t see her, but I just couldn’t sleep.
That happened a few times, but 4 days ago, she appeared again, sitting on my loft looking down at me, drooling, I couldn’t move. I was so scared, she just sat there. I remember it clearly as day, I sat for what felt like days. When I could finally move I packed my stuff, and ran to my dads house (about 2 miles away) . I haven’t been back since. If I ever come back I am moving out, I’ve had a medium take a look at what it was, and she says my house is possessed. My house is on top of an old satanic “church” and she thinks that the woman is an old worshipper of satan. She also thought that the woman sacrificed herself in our basement, because she found stuff to perform a ritual.

"Nietzsche","t5_2qxbg","Part 4 of X (probably only a few more after this)

Only now do we get to the point that Nietzsche can say ""ought"". He says ""ought"" only from his own perspective, to his own perspective, for his own development of values that he himself never argues for or believes can be argued for. Amor Fati: it is something to be experienced and valued, not forced or moralized. That is Nietzsche's ultimate perspective in my hopefully humble interpretation. But this just tells us that he can say ""ought"" in some very weak and emaciated sense, it doesn't tell us his values. So let's look at how Amor Fati is applied. For this, I honestly think you just need to have an in depth reading of the first 8 parts of Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ, but we can pick out a couple sections to analyze:

>Twilight, Morality as Anti-Nature 1: All passions have a time when they are nothing but fatal, when they drag their victim down with the heaviness of their stupidity—and a later, much later time when they marry the spirit, they “spiritualize” themselves. It used to be that on account of the stupidity in passion, one made war against passion itself: one conspired to destroy it—all the old moral monsters are of one mind on this point, “il faut tuer les passions” \[“the passions must be killed”\]. The best-known formula for this is in the New Testament, in that Sermon on the Mount in which, by the way, things are not contemplated from a height at all. For instance, there it is said with reference to sexuality, “if your eye offends you, pluck it out.” Fortunately, no Christian acts according to this prescription. To destroy the passions and desires, merely in order to protect oneself against their stupidity and the disagreeable consequences of their stupidity, seems to us today to be itself an acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who pull out teeth so that they won’t hurt anymore . . . But on the other hand, it’s only fair to concede that on the soil from which Christianity grew, the concept of “spiritualizing the passions” was simply inconceivable. After all, the early Church fought, as is known, against the “intellectuals,” on behalf of those who were “poor in spirit”: how could one expect the Church to wage an intelligent war against passion?—The Church fights passion by cutting it out, in every sense; its practice, its “therapy” is castration. It never asks, “How does one spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire?”—its discipline has always emphasized eradication (eradication of sensuality, pride, the ambition to rule, covetousness, vengefulness).—But ripping out the passions by the root means ripping out life by the root; the practice of the Church is an enemy to life . . .

Here, we see the root of Nietzsche's perspective when it comes to values. An Amor Fati love which aims to only affirm must view spiritualization/sublimation/appropriation as its means to (every?) end. In this sense, the only thing that looks like a negation is actually just a Yes-Saying in another direction. Nietzsche views this as ""life-affirming"" while he views forms of denial in the sense of ""oh no, that sucks so let's moralize against it"" as the ""life-denying"" perspective. If you couldn't tell, I am getting tired. I have already been demoralized after a day of grading papers for a class. I'll leave the rest of this perspective to you to try and figure out so we can move onto the next parts of your responses. 

This allows us to address something else you said:

>On the other hand he *does* go from mere description to teleology in that he clearly prefers a certain kind of strength and wishes for it’s advent (or return).

I can now arrive at the rejection of this claim by bringing up how Amor Fati is phrased almost as the method of affirming the Eternal Return. The article I linked explains it somewhat well, so I will just give the conclusion: Nietzsche prefers the development of certain strengths, but he does not only wish for or even simply prefer those returns.",1733011264.0

Being jaded and shit speaks more to the individual and less to their age, maturity, etc. imo. Like the young men who are jaded now will still be jaded when they’re older, there’s young dudes your age who are happy and fun who’ll be the happy and fun guys once they’re older.",1733011265.0

After she had previously given him crap for, like you mentioned, not telling her everything. She drives me nuts, and Guy drives me MORE nuts. I hate that they felt the need to pair her with a partner. I would have enjoyed seeing Diane struggle more on her own, it’s more realistic in my opinion. It feels like she gave herself up to be with guy, there wasn't really any romance. She just sort of got on anti depressants, gained weight (which there is nothing wrong with, but she voiced that she was very worried about that side effect) and took the easy route. My biggest problem with Guy was he didn’t work with her to find other options when she voiced her concerns about antidepressants, he just pushed her to do it. I did not enjoy Diane the last season at all. ",1733011265.0

It's not just the weight, paying more now for the same product would be fine, you might even accept that it's a bit smaller now.

But far inferior quality with the weight reduction and price increase, plus the fact that they moved to plastic and by now the plastic is probably weighing more than the sweets themselves (will test if someone gives me a tub this chrostmas) is just going way too far.

Obviously guys like Burrow or Goff are doing very well but have limitations when breaking the pocket. I'm not saying they can't win obviously just that it's not as common. 


I don't think taking the super athletic guy over the clearly better thrower is the move either. Just that if two guys have pretty similar draft grades it might make sense to favor the guy with the bigger arm or better athleticism.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Quite a few of the ""illegal immigrants who are doing jobs Americans don't want"" are are making really good money.

There is a strawberry farm out in the middle of nowhere that needs to hire 45 people for 3 months. A field hand is NOT an unskilled job, it requires training and skill. This job pays $20 an hour and they will provide a place to stay and food to eat since you are 50 miles away from a city center. 

As luck would have it, that farmer who needs all those skilled workers for 3 months out of every year hires the same group of immigrants who are happy to travel to some remote location for a temp job, that was their plan A! And this strategy of hiring immigrants? It has been the same strategy for a century. LONG before all the partisan politics at the border.

Why won't Americans do these jobs? Do YOU want to learn a skill that is only useful for 1/4th of the year, pays ok but requires you to live in a dorm with 45 other people, not seeing your friends or your family, and not having a guaranteed job next season or a job for the other 9 months of the year?

How much would that farmer have to pay YOU (not hypothetical you, YOU you, whoever is reading this you)?   
  
back when I was working for $10 an hour and going to school, he would have to pay me a fuck ton to ditch my long term job for a temp job. All so I can come back and then have to hunt for ANOTHER job for the other 9 months of the year.  Plus, I would be stuck paying month to month rent for those 9 months or continue paying rent for the 3 months I was gone for. It just wouldn't have been worth it to hire me at the price I would need for the massive hassle the logistics would be.",1733011266.0

This is the weaponization of sex. This is indicative of so many things, and none of them are good. 
You should go see some sort of therapist.. but that costs money.. or you could get free advice from a random on reddit ? it's logical advice and easier to see for those who aren't in the situation..

1) She sees sex as a chore for her - Since she's trading chores for sex, it's thought of in the same vain. 
When anyone in a relationship wants and enjoys sex, they generally dont put up conditions like this. Men or women. 

2) Manipulative - Honestly, there's no saying if she was going to actually have sex with you if she only mentions it as a penalty. The result of her manipulation is to train you to always do what she wants or else you could be compromising some hypothetical sex. This seems transactional.  

Again, sex shouldn't be a choir.

*Disclaimer- This is only hinging on if she only tells you about the sex after you ""mess up"" and not before. Idk details like this.

There's potentially a lot more that's wrong with this,  or it could be depending on other things.. you may need an actual therapist or councilor of some sort in the future. Especially if you can't quell this behavior sooner than later. 
Problems seem to always get more extreme over time in relationships.

"vedicastrology","t5_2qp1r","Guidelines which will help in getting the right answers:
* G1: Please state a very specific question or topic in your posts title e.g M28, what are the prospects of a PhD education? **Posts about relationships need age and gender included.** Posts must have a question in the title or they will be removed. Don’t ask what we think of your chart, or what is interesting, or anything general or vague or asking to ask. **Do not ask for a general reading, only specific questions.** no one word posts.
* G2: Banned topics: nsfw topics, questions about past lives, fame, sexuality, longevity, exam results, gambling, depression, mental illnesses, death or abuse. Do not ask for Synastry(includes divorce) since they are too time consuming and this is not a matrimonial forum.
* G3: For drawing charts use the pinned links in the sticky post or sidebar rule 4. Jhora screenshots will be preferred. Do not post tropical charts or western circular charts. Random site charts can have errors, missing information or issues of readability. **All charts should have the planet degree positions displayed on the chart.** Post full charts, not lists of placements.
* G4: Don't use incorrect terminology such as houses in vargas. e.g - a house in vedic astrology spans 30 degrees in the D1 chart and there are 12 houses, each house in turn contains 9 divisions spanning 3 degrees and 20 mins so we get 12 x 9 = 108 such divisions which are called navamsas. The navamsa chart shows this collection of 108 navamsas and not 12 houses. So statements such as the following are **incorrect** e.g my 7th house in my navamsa chart has venus in it. **A 30 degree portion cannot be inside a 3 degree portion**. Your post will be removed for this.
* G5: general question about placements or yourself or hypothetical stuff require your chart too. Please don't post charts on behalf of other people like your exes or crushes etc. Don't make posts asking for chart reader recommendations or service reviews.
* G6: If your post does not meet these conditions, please delete it and repost. Otherwise it may be removed. [The subreddit rules are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vedicastrology/about/rules)

Low power charging is very easy to estimate. It's a function of time because the power curve is pretty much flat for the whole charging session. 

But it relies on trust. So you have to be in a setting where you know the owner of the outlet and the owner knows you and you both trust each other.

So it really doesn't defend against anything because it assumes trust. It just does its best with what information it has. And in our tests with level 2 stations, the accuracy is quite remarkable.

Building owners can spend a lot of money on complex systems or they can rely on trust and use our app for basically free. It turns out trust can save them a lot of money and a lot of time.

"arknights","t5_3ptom","Not a huge impact, but it does have impact. Some of the bosses/enemies have carefully crafted ATK stat that a few points of DEF/HP can make your operators live a little longer, an attack or two. Same goes for your extra stats you gain from max level/mod3, with certain multipliers you do just enough damage to require a hit or two less, which can sometimes be the difference you are looking for.

If you use general squads and always go somewhere with a full roster, then you probably don't *need* level 90. Maybe if you want to facetank something that hits like a truck, so you would invest into your defender to have enough stats to be healable and not oneshottable. 

But if you play without healers and try to low-op a stage then sometimes you would need just those extra levels, especially if there is damage going on and you have squishy operators like snipers.

Personally, I just invest into operators I like using, so they are at max, the rest are fine at E2L60. I am playing the game for a really long time now so I can spend a little resources on that, but if you're fighting for resources and still have high value operators to raise, then it's probably not a great idea to go all the way right now.",1733011267.0

That and production's probably going to have a really quick turnaround seeing as how it'll definitely be less effects-heavy than any of the aforementioned projects, the scripts are presumably near-done, and most of the cast was likely already decided from the onset seeing as how we already know it largely involves many returning Peacemaker characters. 

If they're going the Janus Directive/setting up Checkmate route they also already have Sasha Bordeaux in Peacemaker, Rick Flag's probably going to be involved in some way, Peacemaker was also on Checkmate during Janus Directive from what I remember, and then the remaining castings will likely be for other A.R.G.U.S agents, maybe even some known Checkmate members like Arsenal, Phil Kramer, Grace Guinness etc. to round out the recurring cast?",1733011268.0

While sheltered Redditors in pretending to work at home on their laptops might believe that electricity comes out of the socket, water comes out of the faucet, and deliveries arrive at their front door by magic, in reality, none of those things happen without millions upon millions of people going to work *in person*. 

Millions and millions of in-person workers operated power plants, factories, warehouses, and stores, drove trucks, repaired equipment, packaged and delivered goods, and kept society running just so that a privileged few could sit at home and post on Facebook about baking bread and act like they were doing something meaningful. 

There is no “staying home” in any meaningful way without society coming to a screeching halt. It’s not about selfishness, it’s about understanding how the real world works. Covid lockdowns and restrictions were theater to let politicians act like they were doing something, nothing more, regardless of all the disastrous secondary consequences, just so some people could sit at home and do the equivalent of a Ralph Wiggum “I’m helping!” meme. ",1733011269.0

In my headcanon, Sky Marshal Dienes resigned because he knew that if he continued in the role, he would be resigned *forcefully* ... and that would not exactly go well for him. 

There's also zero diplomatic process. No elections. Dienes 'resigns,' and Tehat Meru takes over his role immediately, which implies a scary hierarchy of leadership.

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","About 25 years ago I used to work in construction and I was on I-10 westbound in my truck heading toward Pensacola at around 11PM. The stretch of road between 231 (Panama City) and Pensacola is dead and at that time there was virtually no lighting. It’s lonely. I got passed by a panel van like I was standing still. I remember seeing the sign in the side said something about a baptist college and I thought ‘they better pray they make it driving like that’. About 5 mins later the CB started going apeshit and I saw nothing but brake lights way up ahead in the distance. As I got closer, both lanes were dead stopped with trucks and that van was lying on its side in the middle of the highway. I got out of my truck and was walking up the highway and started talking to one of the truckers. He said they blew by him too and went into the median. The driver over compensated the wheel when he went into the median and the front tire caught the side of the road and flipped over. Apparently only the driver had his seatbelt on and there were piles of clothes all over the highway. Turns out those were people and they were dead. I remember it took forever for emergency services to get there because we were literally in the middle of nowhere. I got some rain ponchos and one of the truckers started cutting up a tarp to put over the bodies. It was absolutely surreal. We didn’t get out of there until the sun started coming up.

Your business is your livelihood, so you charge your shop rate and sell parts at a lower markup than a dealership, whereas I’m not in the mechanic business day to day any longer.  I’m a mechanical engineer by day and I’ve amassed a clientele that can keep me as busy as I want to be on evenings and weekends. For me, it’s all about saving my clients money. They buy parts at my cost, they pick them up at my jobber and pay me cash to install them. I don’t sell parts. I think it’s unfair for shops to markup parts, just because their jobber gives them a volume discount.  I mean, why not extend the savings to your customer, and become more competitive?  
I’m not a unicorn either. There’s someone in every town doing the same thing.  My jobber tells me so. I’ve been doing business with them since 1989, 
I don’t need to tell you the importance of that relationship.

Personally I find listening easy so I learned most by watching dramas, movies, anime, listening to podcasts and so on. Admittedly I also did a Japanese degree at uni.
Some people find output easy so they just go out and meet people, take lessons or write.  Finding a language partner might be a good idea. I actually struggle with output due to shyness, but speaking with other, a bit more advanced Japanese learners, helped to kickstart speaking and gain some confidence/ knowledge.

Recently, adopted a cat which stowed away in my wife's engine compartment.    Decided I would give it a shot and just avoid her, take meds, etc.

When you notice unusual patterns, like an increase in irrelevant or misleading posts, it can be a clue that something important is being hidden or distracted from. They thrive on your doubts and hesitations, hoping you won't see the true value in what's genuine. By focusing on understanding and observing these patterns, you take back control and empower yourself with valuable insights. This proactive approach not only strengthens your resilience but also transforms these challenges into opportunities for knowledge and growth. You become stronger and more informed, ready to rise above negativity and confusion.

"arcane","t5_2re2c",">Vi is the only one who can make Jinx believe she can change, and who can make Cait see what's to be done. 

Funny thing about that, Vi explicitly fails to influence Jinx, its Isha and the Ekko that fill that roll, and with Cait, well she has already pretty much flipped back after her montage, I had this idea as well, but it and like 4 other possible arcs she was on all were undercooked and never paid off. 

There is also the superficial aspect, and while I don't think its intentional on the writers part a very infesting pattern ended up forming when it comes to Vi, she fails, more then any other major charachter she fails, the best we can ascribe to her is providing a temporary stay of execution for a couple of charachter and wining a couple fights that end up pretty meaningless, and then they create a golden timeline where the point of divergence is Vi dying young, that was an unfortunate choice. Another funny thing to think about, for being a protector, her one remaining loved one is only there because someone else ended up protecting them. 

You follow that up with what was probably the worst showing in the final, seriously all that misery and being beaten down for her big moments to be a very temporary distraction of Warwick and then falling to far and getting hurt so Jinx would have to sacrifice herself? It is superficial, but when everyone else is trying to do something cool, Vi is failing to save the blue haired girl, Loris and failing to hold a door shut against mooks. Ya its superficial, but what is the point of a crazy over the top battle if all your main characters don't get there spotlight moment before the show ends?",1733011270.0

It fucking sucked and I cried non-stop for days. But at some point it no longer becomes about your feelings or the struggle of dealing with it, but about their quality of life like you said. When they were sick and I was taking care of them, I didn't care about the mess, I didn't care about the lack of sleep, it just made me sad looking at them knowing I'd probably have to say goodbye soon, but it made me even sadder thinking about how they're in pain, uncomfortable, and just ready to go. I would've taken care of them for as long as it took if it meant they would get better, but at some point, I knew it was only going to get worse. We had taken them to the vet, but the only option was surgery and because they were so old (one of them 20 years) it would've been too hard on them and the risks were too high, so I had to make the decision to let them go. 

If you've tried everything you could do and nothing will work, at some point you just have to let go. As much as it sucked, I'd had rather have them pass at the vet when I was with them before they suffered too much, than have them wander off to the basement and die alone suffering.",1733011272.0

The bar at Saint Peter 

Pina - I think the best cafe food I’ve ever had and fantastic coffee too (primary around the corner is also a must visit for good coffee)

AP Bakery - fantastic bakery and fun morning spot. 

Ante - fantastic Japanese inspired sake bar with food that is so clever. 

Cafe Paci - tasty as hell food that’s got such creative combinations. 

Aalia - I’ve never had a bad dish. 

Palazzo Salato - great pastas and snacks

10 William St - Sydney is very good for natural wine and this is one of the best places to drink it. The food is good. The pretzel with whipped anchovy is an iconic Sydney dish. 

Bar copains - same as above (but without the pretzel)

I think the distinction between affirming one perceived gender and the dysphoria itself is largely semantics. The same turn of phrase could just as easily be used to justify much more heinous things like lobotomies or voluntary castration (again, I'm not comparing the severity of the two: merely the potential effects of the train of thought being applied elsewhere).

The cause of my ""being alive dysphoria"" (if you will) is not being alive, but depression. Could not one argue that the cause of discomfort with one's body is not the body, but gender dysphoria? In the same way that body dysmorphia ought not be treated with rapid weight loss, perhaps there are other avenues to explore for trans individuals. That being said, I think at the moment the care we have is the best available, but I hope to see continued conversation and research in the field.

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:


* **0** Learn kana (hiragana and katakana) before anything else.


* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Yasashii Kotoba News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on ChatGPT, DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

Useful Japanese teaching symbols:

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","> Both of these statements are not factually false. I specifically said my only counterplay.

Yes, they are. You can play one of the several deck I listed which are neither aggro nor armor stack. That's your counterplay.

> With the second statement, I should have added my elo for context because Asteroid Shamans at my D3 elo are worse than handbuff Pala players.

Which does not support your argument in any way. One deck having worse performance than another deck does not prove its players are worse, as another explanation is simply that the deck is bad. If Asteroid Shaman was broken and simply held back by bad players, it would be better at top legend, it's not. QED.

> I honestly don't see how Asteroid Shaman is less toxic than Quasar Rogue.

I do. Quasar Rogue exclusively wins through the OTK. It does nothing else. Asteroid Shaman is a tempo deck with burn. Nothing very new here. It's a playstyle that has been extremely common and we've seen multiple time in Hunter and Mage. It just get flamed because it's popular at Plat and Dia.

> Also Zarimi Priest is being bitched about ever since it's inception and got nerfed multiple times.

Please. No one cares about Zarimi. You can search it in the sidebar, and all you'll see are some people posting their list they got legend with and Control Priest players complaining that they want good control cards for Priest and not Zarimi even if it's good. I dare you to find me a post that has half the comments and upvote of this thread on Zarimi.",1733011273.0

as for ""practices"" beyond that, its really just been a *lot* of experimentation and paying close attention to how i feel when i vocalize. ive been training off and on for a bit over a year. 

i did take a couple months of lessons with seattlevoicelabs which sped things up ENORMOUSLY when it comes to understanding and controlling various components of voice. it could easily have taken me longer to get here if not for doing that early on. i will say they did not get me to my goal since my goal is fairly extreme compared to most, i was on my own for the majority of this figuring things out. but they set me on the path. so if you can ever afford professional coaching from a reputable coach even for just 6-8 sessions i highly recommend it.",1733011274.0

Cinder city is 40% dmg buff for at least 2 elements and her passive is ~15%+ dmg% buff on average for the on fielder with the bare minimum stacks, which means ~55%+ dmg% buff for the main dps vs 40-75% buff Furina gives depending on who is your healer and both have good personal damage. Both also have a team building restriction (both funnily enough want Xilonen as their best team mate too lol).


Obviously Furina buffs the entire team and works with anyone but she also has major energy needs and her buff needs to build up, while Mavuika is heavily frontloaded and has no energy needs.

>These men by these means framed the ancient weapon called the Halberd, out of the which, men of our age have derived and made another kind of Halberd and Bill. And these bearing also respect to someone profitable thing or other, did maintain the defense, and increase the hurting or offense. The respect was, that as they discoursed and pondered with themselves, at length they very warily perceived that a man with his weapon in his hand, might make size motions, that is to say, one towards the head, one towards the feet, one towards the right side, one towards the left, one forwards and towards the enemy, the other backward and toward himself. of all the which, five of them might very well strike, and the last might neither strike nor defend. Therefore, providing that this last motion also should not be idle and unprofitable, they added a hook with the point turned towards the handle, with the which one might very easily tear armor, and draw perforce men from their horses. Those who framed the middle or mean Halberd, would that the same hook should be placed in the safe or back edge. And those that devised the Bill, would have it on the right edge, leaving the edge so long that the hook might not altogether hinder the low of the edge, but rather (to the end the edge might make the greater effect) they would that the hook should bear and edge and be cutting in every part thereof. Where I gather, that the Bill is the most perfect weapon of all others, because it strikes and hurts in every of these six motions, and his defenses both cut and prick: which the new kind of Halberd does not perform, because framed after the said fashion, and rather for lightness aptness and bravery, then for that it carries any great profit with it: for the edge is not so apt to strike, and the point thereof is so weak, that hitting any hard thing, either it bows or breaks: neither is it much regarded in the wars, the Harquebus and the Pike being now adays the strength of all armies.



>**Of bill against bill, halberd against halberd, or halberd against bill**

>Forasmuch, as the Bill and Halberd, have the selfsame offense and defense, and be of one length: I thought it not good to make two Treatises thereof, because I should be forced to repeat the selfsame thing in both, the which, being superfluous, would breed loathsomeness. I say therefore, that whosoever would handle the Bill or Halberd, which being all one, I will name indifferently, by the name of the Halberd, I say, to him that would use them, and strike as well with the point, as with the edge, which blows at these weapons are mighty and forcible, it is necessary, that he consider the difficulty in striking with the point, and the danger in striking with the edge. That it is difficult to strike with the point, it is most clear, because the full course of the point, may very easily be hindered and tied, by means of so many hooks and forks which are in the Halberd.

So basically he believes that they are used the same but some minute differences arrises from their difference, and according to him basically the only difference is where the hook is placed and he believes bills hook placement is superior to halberds but their usage is still the same.",1733011275.0

"HouseOfTheDragon","t5_27hnjr","I mean her mother died when she was young. She had a nanny that dressed and arranged for her to be fed as a child. Then she moved to Kings Landing and was living in the Hand’s Tower with her father where she had a pack of servants, possibly her nanny still, and likely a Septa to make sure the clothes and food arrived on time. Then she was the king’s child bride and if GRRM has it set up like medieval Europe (which he does) that means she’s running an entire household which includes people who’s entire job is to make sure her clothes, grooming, and food are taken care of with her choosing her outfit for the day and approving menus with her making requests of the cooks for things in particular she wants. 

Many kings in Europe had a guy to wipe his ass after he took a shit. It was a desirable position as it usually meant you were alone and up close to the king so you could chat privately and create a relationship. 

That she even knows how to sew clothes is questionable. She likely is skilled in embroidery and might be able to figure out how to apply that to dressmaking, but how to cut the pieces to achieve a good fit would probably be something she’s never even thought of before even though she’s likely had dresses draped on her dozens of times.

My husband had open heart surgery. His hospital stay was $1950.  That’s still less than the cost of a year on Medigap in our state, but by the time you add in the extra cardiologist and surgeon visits ($45/each) plus rehab ($35/each, probably at least 20 sessions, so $700), plus the other specialists he sees at his age (urologist, dermatologist) it’s a bit more for the year. Plus the 20 hours in the ER for a subsequent afib attack (common for his surgery), makes it more. 

Financially, he’s still ahead, because he’s had 3 years with nothing besides about 4 specialist visits per year until this year. And because we’re in Massachusetts, we can switch to Medigap without underwriting at specific times during the year. But we’re quite aware of the difference in pricing. 

And all that is before getting into the other aspects that concern people. Advantage plans have a network. Our plan is a PPO, so we can go out of the network, and the major (world class hospitals in our area all take our plan, but not everyone has those options. 

Plus Advantage plans require pre-approvals far more often than traditional Medicare.  My last pre-approval for an MRI only took 2 hours turnaround time, so it wasn’t a big deal, plus ours doesn’t seem to made the bad reputation of denying necessary procedures that some other plans have.

"custommagic","t5_2sbcz","""Enchantment Name: Omniscient Grasp
Mana Cost: {5}{W}{U}{B}
Type: Legendary Enchantment
Effect:
At the beginning of your upkeep, gain control of target nonland permanent for as long as Omniscient Grasp is on the battlefield.

Whenever a permanent you control but don’t own is put into a graveyard, exile it instead. Then create a token that’s a copy of that permanent, except it’s a Spirit in addition to its other types.

Permanents you control but don’t own have indestructible and can’t be sacrificed.

Flavor Text: ""All that was, all that is, and all that will be—it belongs to me now.""

Power Level Explanation:

Universal Control: You can take any nonland permanent every upkeep, not limited by mana value. This makes the enchantment game-warping.

Token Creation: Turning stolen permanents into resilient Spirit tokens upon death ensures you retain long-term value, even if opponents find a way to interact with the stolen permanents.

Protection: Making all ""borrowed"" permanents indestructible and unsacrificable means opponents have to deal with Omniscient Grasp directly to regain control of their board.

High Mana Cost: While it's a late-game powerhouse at {5}{W}{U}{B}, its effect can swing the game immediately, making it feel worth the investment.

Would you like to tweak this for balance or add additional flavor elements?""",1733011276.0

"Philippines","t5_2qjov","As some commenters already said in this thread, malakas na rin talaga si Marcos since filing ng COC nung 2021 at bumababa si SWOH sa mga survey.

And this is based from what? The last Pulse Asia survey ([September 2021](https://pulseasia.ph/updates/september-2021-nationwide-survey-on-the-may-2022-elections/)) before the COC filing showed Duterte leading , with 20% for Duterte, 15% Marcos, 13% Isko, 12% Pacquiao. So Marcos, Isko, and Pacquiao were virtually tied. The survey was also made when the others have yet to formally declare their intention to run for president, with Duterte was saying she is not running for president. Sara's rating declined from 28% in the [June 2021](https://pulseasia.ph/updates/june-2021-nationwide-survey-on-the-may-2022-elections/), but the others had marginal movement, except for Pacquiao who shot up from 8% to 12%.

Sara Duterte was not in the surveys for president by October, except for one unverified and unreleased image posted in this sub, purportedly from SWS, that shows Marcos leading the survey overwhelmingly over Sara Duterte (likely fake and edited). The one actually released by SWS and Stratbase ADR for [October 2021](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/11/15/21/marcos-tops-sws-poll-for-president-rivals-unbothered) showed that Sara Duterte was not in the list of options for president and was included in the list for VP instead. What was clearly trending upwards, especially after the formal announcement of presidential candidacies, was Robredo's rating.

The mainstream view is that Uniteam is **for** Marcos's benefit more that Duterte's. 

> MANILA, Nov 16 ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/after-dust-settles-son-late-philippine-dictator-emerges-presidential-frontrunner-2021-11-16/)) - The son of late Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos has emerged as the person to beat in the 2022 presidential race, after President Rodrigo Duterte's popular daughter decided not to contest the country's top job.

> Ferdinand Marcos Jr. likely benefited the most from Davao city mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio's move to run for vice president, against the wishes of her supporters, despite leading polls for preferred presidential contenders all throughout the year.",1733011277.0

I had to have a hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction after a very traumatic delivery. 

A year after surgery, I was still incontinent. My surgeon (urogynecologist) wanted to do additional surgery. I asked for time to see if pelvic floor therapy would bring me some relief.

She was amazing. She was willing to start the PT without an internal exam if I was not comfortable.

I opted to start out with an internal exam just for thoroughness of the evaluation.

She designed a treatment plan that involved internal checks from her very rarely to measure progress. Otherwise, she encouraged me to “listen” to my body as a way to measure progress.

Skin blemishes, some symmetry issues in chin nose and eyes, long middle third or perhaps short lower third, with your bangs it’s hard to tell if your upper and middle third are actually balanced with one another or not. Your center fifth is a bit wide but your inner three fifths are all pretty balanced although that long cat eye makeup gives the illusion of them being very imbalanced.

Other ratios and symmetry are fine.  FWHR from what I can tell is actually pretty good, I used the photo of you on that deck to measure because the others your head is at an angle.  

Your piercings below your eyebrows (third eyes?) are actually helping create the illusion that your middle third isn’t as long as it is BUT your septum piercing then does the opposite making it just look like your middle third is still long and unnaturally shifted down more than it should be and shortens your already shorter lower third and the nasal labial studs then draw more attention to the imbalance and make the width look wider which also creates more imbalance.  The combination of your piercings between your eyebrows and septum also gives the impression that your nose is an exaggerated triangular shape as well.

Your bangs make it impossible to measure your upper third and also emphasize the length of your middle third by making your upper third seem smaller than it likely is.

Looking at some other raters who are giving you very low scores I think it’s because your piercings and eye make up kind of work against your ratios while your hair color makes the red in your skin pop because green is its complementary color.  I’m sure you know that if you dyed your hair your natural color got sweeping bangs instead of regular bangs put on more conventional eye makeup and removed all your piercings then the perception by others of your natural ratios would improve and your “average person” would view you as more attractive. 

All that said, the hair color was prolly much cooler (maybe it was blue or a solid green?) before it faded and the piercings are unique and interesting.  I like your style and no matter what they may do to the illusion of your facial ratios they make you look like a fun and interesting  human.",1733011277.0

See I'm just a chill NEETizen stranded in another universe but I cannot comprehend anyone loving Priscilla as mentally capable of doing anything, doing anything for themselves or others that are worth doing as a man.

However Rem and Theresia is the correct choice. Theresia with her powers or not is the correct choice, as a person who is all powerful and prefers flowers is what true beauty is.

Rem may be a demon but we can forgive her cuz she kills to protect those she loves in her heart, also her big booba- i mean she's a diligent worker and very soothing voice.

"HistoryMemes","t5_2v2cd","That’s not the point. The point of the Senate and the EC is to ensure the majority don’t infringe upon the rights of the minority. The Founders were not as concerned with who rules the nation as they are with who is capable of infringing upon the rights of others. The larger states, by nature, can resist attempts by the small states to infringe upon their rights, but the small states cannot resist attempts by larger states to infringe upon their rights. Hence, the Founders designed a system to disproportionately overrepresent the small states because that is their only defense against tyranny of the majority.

The purpose of the system is not to impose the popular will, but to ensure that everyone’s natural rights (rights that are inherent) such as speech, life, and property are respected. These are inherent rights a human being possesses. It is their right to not be subjected by the action of another. In a stateless society, it is easy for the majority to deprive the minority of their natural rights, and consequently the purpose of the government IS to protect the natural rights of the minority against the tyranny of the majority - even if the minority is overrepresented in government. 

Everyone loves the tyranny of the majority when they’re in the majority, and decries checks and balances as undemocratic. But it is these checks and balances that is protecting us from descending into tyranny. It is to ensure the majority doesn’t always get their way by overrepresenting the minority. America is not a system that always exercises the agenda of the majority, but it is a system designed to protect the most basic rights of everyone.",1733011278.0

"SnowbreakOfficial","t5_6yjphg","The best interpretation I can think of is they also wanted to show her treating the Demiurges (Manifestation failures) as disposable tools too (though it was better established in 2.0 Chapter 12 when she killed a Demiurge for failing to seduce Adjutant).

She also mentioned a strangely specific line about the man wanting a “replacement” for the girlfriend that was used and killed in a previous operation. This could be anyone, but one example specifically mentioned was Kim Ah-Yeon/Nascent Woden from Chapter 12 who sacrificed her life to keep Pi and her boyfriend (the man she cared about) safe. So this might be trying to show she sacrificed her life for nothing for a scumbag.

It could also be the boyfriend of the seducing Demiurge though, so the man would be used to women using this for manipulation and think nothing of her loss.

We can try to argue it is to manipulate Adjutant further to become enraged and to think humans are scum and don’t deserve to rule compared to Manifestations, but Adjutant isn’t there and isn’t aware of any of these actions.

Also, would Rozan really allow such a bad ally? He was irrationally yelling about losing the girlfriend and getting a replacement, showing a real lack of loyalty and competence. He is yelling at Rozan’s faction, that emphasize rule by fear and strength. An idiot like that undermining her authority with such disrespect (and for such a bad reason) would have gotten made an example of by her subordinates.

This also kind of ruins some of Rozan’s characterization, since in Chapter 12 it is shown we can’t be sure what is her real character. She says and acts like an extremely violent insane dictator who doesn’t value anyone, but there are very obvious breaks in that persona where suddenly all her rage and violent intention would disappear to show her disappointment in manipulating Adjutant. Implying even this personality might also be a manipulation and she is even more methodical and emotionless inside in her actions.

If she was supposed to be written with such ambiguity in the future, this scene would have ruined that and made it even harder for the writers to write around. She is methodical, but would she do cruel actions for such little gain?",1733011278.0

Sure, she said, ""don't touch me"" but she said it with the bitter resentment of someone who's assuming he doesn't want to rub her back. I think his cuddles were his attempt to tell her does want to rub her back. When she told him her breasts hurt, he apologized and explained that he forgot. Then she told him to sleep on the couch. 

His ""I could hurt you"" comment was terrifying and yes, she shouldn't stay with someone who would say that. And maybe that first touch was, indeed, hostile. But she's got her own issues with communication that she needs to solve for her future relationships.",1733011278.0

"DecodingTheGurus","t5_400gsf","I agree with you that Hasan is a fragile, hypocrite and a terrible debater. What I don’t agree with you on or have ever agreed with you on is your position on cracker.  You’re right context is important. The n word has tons of baggage especially coming from a white guy. Cracker has none of that. None of that at all. They’re completely different words and have been and are currently used in completely different ways. Yes even when Hasan calls a white person a cracker he’s not using it the same way a racist white person uses the n word. In fact even when a black person (because again Hasan is white) uses cracker it’s not the same. Like you’ll admit cracker isn’t as offensive but then in the same breath equivocate the word saying well it’s basically the same thing. Which whilst technically true is not in any meaningful sense true at all. Which you fucking know because you literally said it yourself. You know no hwhite person takes offense to cracker and still act like calling a white person Cracker is the exact same as the n word and it’s the height of hypocrisy if someone thinks it’s bad to use the n word but uses the word Cracker. 

Also why do you keep calling it an identity crisis? Having multiple identities isn’t a crisis. As you mentioned for some people like yourself it’s a difficult thing to grapple with ( by the way I’m glad you’ve dealt with it) but for other people it really isn’t. I’m both Indian and South African I can be both at the same time it’s never been a problem for me. I don’t believe in god and front practice but I grew up in a Hindu household and still do Hindu festivals. I call myself culturally Hindu agnostic, secular an atheist. They’re all accurate and they’re not contradictory. I know tons of friends have really struggled with their crisis of faith but others including myself really didn’t. It’s not an identity crisis to have multiple identities it’s just human 

And again, have you heard about code switching? It’s fine that you hate it when people emphasize or deemphazize parts of your identity to gain an advantage but thousands of people do it every single day. Is a sales person who adopts a generic accent and reduces their use of slang “a bad faith actor”. What about when they’re trying to sell to a member of their community and lean into their heritage? Like come on… this is something literally everybody has done to some extent and when you’re in a media job it’s pretty much par for the course. Every major media figure including Destiny has done it to some extent before. Once again going back to something I brought up earlier that you ignored, Trump made the identical attacks against Harris, when he was saying she doesn’t know if she’s black or Indian. They showed videos of her speeches to black audiences and white audiences to accuse her of “pretending to be black”. Was she a “deliberate bad actor”? 



Now let’s completely ignore the fact that non white cops have absolutely committed police brutality and are often times just as bad as white cops, in many cases worse alla Eric Adams. But I don’t particularly care if you chose the best way to do a bad thing. Destiny still chose to donate to an organization that actively brutalizes minorities to spite a black person he disliked. That’s shitty and shows he doesn’t care about racism, or cares more about scoring a cheap point than about racism. In fact I think his position on the n word falls into a similar pattern. He honestly doesn’t care to or choose  actually grapple with racism or how it actually affects real people and rather views racism as an intangible concept he can use to win a point in a  debate with or get under the skin of over sensitive pussies like me. Pretty scummy, hypocritical behavior if you ask me.",1733011278.0

This is making a few assumptions, that 30k wasn't all profit , or that she puts some money into retirement, or that she pays for child care.

"RenPy","t5_2w2ef","I can reproduce the issue on both ""fresh"" and ""used"" browsers (chrome normal and chrome in a new incognito window)

1. Start a new game
2. In preferences, enable all the skip options
3. Play and make the decisions ""Johnny"", ""He/him"", ""Engineering"", and ""Yeah, I just moved in!""
   1. The exact name, pronouns, and major probably don't matter, these are just what I used
4. After making the fourth decision, hold skip until you reach the next decision. 

This method triggers the glitch 9/10 of the time or more. I was also able to trigger it by rolling back very quickly through that same dialogue, though that was less consistent.

It looks like it just happens when you switch the music too fast on the browser. I'm not sure the best solution, but I don't think the progressive downloading is the issue here. As a stopgap, perhaps identify where it tends to cut and put an if statement, ie `if not renpy.is_skipping(): play music hypertheme` or something similar. Then for the line after, make sure to add the `if_changed` setting to prevent it from restarting the music.

For example, lines 181-189 in your script.rpy could look like:

    a ""...""
    if not (renpy.is_skipping() and renpy.variant('web')):
        play music hypertheme
    show addy excited talk
    a "" What are you studying? How old are you? I'm 18, but I'm a junior cause I started college early. I'm a chemsitry major, also!""
    show addy startled
    a ""!""
    play music main_menu_theme if_changed
    show addy awkward

>According to sources, Trump and his team conveyed that they plan to balance their federal budget through tariffs, and then strike exemption side deals on a country-by-country basis.

What a joke. Trump is going to crash the US economy and most other major economies while blowing a hole through US tax revenues again. Just like he did last time. Trump started trade wars with Canada, Mexico, China and the EU last time causing costs to rise. Remember the tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber that caused housing costs to skyrocket? The price of lumber more than doubled! 

Then he mismanaged the pandemic and let China infect the world through their joint incompetence. This destroyed supply lines and crashed the economy so they released trillions of dollars in inflationary liquidity into the market. Trump also cut taxes and added more debt in 4 years then any other president has added in 8. Trump was a financial disaster for the US. This time, he's going even harder on tariffs.

For proactively learning new things, I'd recommend keyhole for first two layers (honestly a great intermediate step before transitioning to f2l which has a very steep learning curve, wish more people did it) and perhaps 4 look last layer if you're up for learning a few algorithms.

"opiniaoimpopular","t5_50qq3m","Mas você de certa forma cotas raciais, como questão de reparação histórica, me dão um grande incomodo também: Se é justamente a população negra que mais sofre com problemas financeiros, visto a completa falta de assistência pós fim da escravidão e preconceito para se inserir na sociedade, as cotas por renda não beneficariam justamente a população mais pobre, que é marjoritariamente preta, por esses fatores?

Além disso, vender as cotas como justiça coletiva não é justo. Ok, digamos que 100% das vagas sejam para pessoas pretas e que isso seja justo: qual o tamanho do impacto disso em uma comunidade com 200 mil pessoas, como ocorre no rio? Quantas dessas pessoas vão conseguir empregos de alta exigência técnica dentro dessas comunidades? Eng de computação, medicina, eng civil.. etc. Quantas dessas pessoas vão estar gastando o bom salario que estarão gahando dentro da comunidade? Quantas vão gerar empregos lá (que também vão exigir alguma qualificação tecnica)? Essas pessoas vão sair da comunidade e irem para bairros de classe média alta. Não tem infraestrutura, não tem educação, não tem segurança, não tem o que consumir lá. É como querer corrigir com uma loteria apenas para negros. O vencedor do prêmio leva para casa um salário vitálício de 10 mil, por exemplo. E correm 100 sorteios por ano.

Isso sem levar em conta a deficiência basica na educação publica primária. Uma coisa é tu botar o maluco lá dentro, outra é ele concluir. Não só por problemas no aprendizado, mas por necessidade de transporte, custo do curso (mesmo sendo público, cursos como odontologia e medicina são caríssimos), necessidade de se sustentar (qualquer engenharia em uma federal que preste é quase sempre integral, e sem aulas a noite, como trabalha assim), falta de contato e contatos com a área (ou você é um aluno muito bom, ou se tu for pobre em geral, tu não vai ter ninguém para te apresentar pro primeiro estágio... e ae amigo, se tu for timido, tá muito fudido, mas mesmo sem pensar no ""QI"", pensa em conhecimendo da área. Hoje pelo menos tem internet, tu ainda consegue aprender, mas a mentalidade de quem realmente entra no curso sabendo o que quer... tu é doido). 

Repare que em nenhum momento eu me posiciono contra as cotas raciais. Só acho problemático chamar isso de ""reparação histórica"". Mas a quem não sequer pondere esses argumentos.",1733011280.0

"TravelHacks","t5_30zyl","I went from the US to Europe for 3 weeks in 2010 with only a backpack, which was my carryon. I was 5 ft tall and weighed 120 lbs, so clothes were easy to fit in. (Not that size now!)

I did have to layer clothes to keep warm. I brought a few merino wool tops, which is a lightweight fabric and not scratchy and yet is warm. They rolled up easily into my backpack, and I used compression packing cubes. I layered them under a couple of button shirts and often wore a jacket (which I wore in-flight but balled up and put it behind my back eventually). 

I brought a pair of nice dark jeans and 2 pairs of soft knit loose black leggings (they didn't fit like tights) and wore one on the plane. I also wore a thick knit, longer boat neck sweater (not a cardigan) on the plane over my knit pants as  it was too thick for the suitcase and took up too much room, so it was always my flight sweater. I also had 1 pair of nicer dark grey lightweight slacks for going to a restaurant or nice cathedral. They matched my 3 merino wool sweaters in different colors (black, gray, royal). Everything mixed and matched. I brought a neutral scarf. I had 1 pair of casual but attractive low-cut black boots (worn on plane) and a pair of black sneakers. I brought a variety of socks. 1 pair of pajamas and undies/2 bras, makeup and toiletries and a flat iron.

I also brought a pair of gloves, no hat. I was still cold however, outdoors like on walking tours, so I needed more under layers sometimes and didn't bring enough. I am always cold, though. The jacket I brought was a P-coat style with pockets, so it would look dressier and longer than a poufy ski or hiking type jacket. It was a synthetic wool and black.

It all depends on your style. The jeans were impossible to wash, so I spot cleaned them. The merino wool sweaters washed in the bathroom sink and hung dry overnight. Basically, anything ""big"" to pack I wore on the plane, but I did want the comfy knit pants on the plane.

Compression cubes are everything in these situations. In Switzerland, I ended up buying a thick hoodie because I was cold plus souvenirs and a zipper type tote bag for those and had to check my backpack coming home. I put the new tote in the overhead bin.

Sorry this is so long!

"vancouvercanada","t5_34m57","I’m not lnowledable or affiliated with the justice system but I believe Antic and St Cloud were the Supreme Court cases named to Bill C75 and 77 ??  Antic was an Ontarioan who spent most of his time peddling drugs and guns in Michigan.  He was denied bail originally presumably due to his legit flight risk (even though he posted a monetary bond).   It went through two rounds of retrial before going to the Supreme Court. 

In 2016 when C75 came in, the justice bail system hadn’t been renewed since the 70’s. The remanding centres were overflowing and cases were being released due to unreasonable wait periods.  This ruling sent the message to district and provincial courts to ‘catch and release’ based on potential threat to reoffend citing Constitutional rights of offenders.  New Zealand went through the same process. 

Amazing how far the system has swung to a complete ‘catch and release’ debacle.  Seemingly utterly unmanaged The entire emphasis is placed on those district judges to gauge the future and foretell whether an offender is likely to reoffend.  (Which is problematic and next to impossible in its own right) .  

But SURELY …. A judge with common sense can look at a guy who’s knifed someone randomly and without cause and move to protect the citizenry a little better than this.  This and SO MANY MORE cases of violent repeat offenders who are released and who ignore the parole system and immediately reoffend.   Remember Tori Dunn the young woman killed by the repeat offenders.  It’s maddening but I don’t envy the prosecutors or the judges who have to make these calls.",1733011280.0

I needed something to feed him in a pinch tonight, and didn’t have time to cook up some ground beef and rice (usually he eats Cesar wet food but ground beef/rice is my go-to replacement) so l grabbed a can of chunk lite (cause nobody eats chunk lite in my house) and gave him that.
I already knew that tuna fish should be given only occasionally because of mercury levels, and that’s what we usually do — occasionally (maybe once or twice a week) he’ll get a couple bits of Chunk White.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","> It's a big deal because of the lack of options.

Exactly. Not just in the US. I'm from Malaysia where meat is relatively more expensive and less abundant compared to the US, and still we have meat and/or animal products in almost everything, to enhance the dish. Unless you're adhering to religious restrictions, rice is always eaten with meat as sides (or the bare minimum, eggs), or you might have ground anchovies in sambal, or bones/stock in soups/sauces. It is difficult to have vegan food unless you explicitly requested it. But when we requested it, people see it as vegans declaring it as a ""badge of honour"".

Sure some small minority of vegans would declare that even when not ordering a meal. It's not a problem actually, except for those who are trying to perpetuate the stereotype of ""annoying vegans"".

"AmIOverreacting","t5_4uoy2u","I did this once. Some guy I dated in college and I didn’t work out after like two dates. One was a group date. OVER TEN YEARS later my friend was googling names as he was bored and googled mine and found some hate blog that this guy had created. Literally ten years later he posted this crap and we found it maybe 5 years after that. 

The guy was creepy. I kept finding him outside my window of my ground level apartment. I didn’t know it was him at first. One night he called me for a ride back to campus as I was 15 minutes away and I guess there were no busses. I asked him why he was out this way as the only thing other than my apartment building was a mall and a Walmart. He said he would rather not tell me why he was out there. I refused and lo and behold, the next night when I heard someone walking in the rocks I turned on music and went to the bathroom. The apartment was circular so you could access the bathroom from the living room/kitchen and bathroom. Went to the living room window and there he is bundled up but clearly him, we were both in architecture school so we were at the studio all the time and knew his jackets. And it was literally 20 degrees out and windy. 

Anyways I forgot about him and moved on with life and like 15 years later I’m told of the post.
I read it and it was super obvious it was him from his user name.

So I called his mom, told her everything and that I’d go further with police and restraining order if it wasn’t gone in 24 hours. 

And 24 hours later it was gone. And I’m still baffled how me, a chubby band nerd had such a hold on the literally most popular guy in his school (both from the same area but didn’t know each other prior because again jock and nerd). He was prom king and homecoming king every year he was eligible. I still don’t get it.

And sadly I have other stories where I’ve called the mothers. One time a friend stole a crap ton of money from me and also lied to ask me to pay for baby shower with the promise that her mother hadn’t given her the money yet. It was all a lie and I went to her mom’s work (a hair salon supply store) told her what happened and said I needed a check right then or I was going to police. 

The others were similar to the first story. Also just as confusing.",1733011284.0

With 'per block' UTXO commitments you only need a single 'honest' actor observing at the time when some miner collusion occured.

They can then demonstrate to the whole world that either the block at that time is not in consensus or that the subsequent commitment does not follow from the previous commitment + block in between.

Not so very far removed from trusting that there is at least one 'honest' & dev who understands the code well enough to spot malfeasance **and will blow the whistle**


In both cases **no news is good news** but the bar for the former is probably lower.


----------------------------------


More to the point **what does anyone actually care about?**


1. **No debasement** -  21 million schedule is intact

2. **No counterfeiting** - received coins are accepted by the whole network and hence spendable in the future


Both points are covered by UTXO commitments, no greater trust is necessary.


In a non p2p cash world you probably do care about the history of your coins, as when you want to spend them the gatekeepers (on/off ramps) likely will be 'interested' in there history in order to decide whether or not to allow you the privilege.",1733011285.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Well firstly, thank you! It’s a lovely compliment to be told that I have expressed myself well. You have made my evening.

Truth be told, I don’t give my Reddit comments as much care as they might warrant. Typically it’s a single draft and which is posted and then mildly edited to correct and typos caused by me typing too quickly. 

Reading back on my response, I can see where I would better structure and delineate the different points of argumentation for more coherence, but I think I sufficiently got across my thoughts for the purpose of the CMV.

But to your question, my writing was honed during my original undergraduate studies, as I initially studied a humanities subject which had me reading academic texts and journal articles for upwards of 30 hours per week in the University library. A fair amount of how to structure effective argumentation can be picked up by osmosis that way. 

But I think the greatest impact was had in the philosophy modules that I took as part of that initial degree. 

In other subjects like Politics, Sociology and History, it can be easy (and tempting) to dance around a question by going into a lot contextual information, so you may end up writing a lot of paragraphs that don’t really get to the heart of the argument. 

In a History essay, for example, a certain amount of contextual information about the events in question would be expected, and a student less confident in their argumentation might lean more on bulking out the work with context to the point that it becomes load bearing within the piece. 

But in Philosophy you don’t really have that luxury. When writing a Philosophy essay, you have little recourse but to directly engage with the argument the question is asking you to address. 

When I wrote essays that went into tangents, or didn’t critical assess the philosophical arguments related to the question, my tutors would directly call this out. I found there to be no hiding or evasion in the subject, and it forced me to develop my critical thinking skills in a much more direct way than subjects like History or Politics (though of course those subjects absolutely promote critical thinking). 

As for how you might gain these benefits without paying tuition, I think there’s a lot of very high quality Philosophy content on YouTube, that lays out high quality Philosophical discussion in a more approachable manner than a traditional textbook. 

I’d recommend Alex O’Connor’s channel as a starting point, I find he is able to explain complex Philosophical arguments in a way that is approachable for the layman. 

Being able to understand and appreciate how those arguments are formed is a great first step in refining your own thought process. And from that, your ability to structure and develop argumentation in writing will grow. 

I do hope that helps at least somewhat. If there’s anything else I can answer for you, please feel free to ask.",1733011285.0

I didn't expected to have diapers again. well, whatever, I already have (xx amount of) kids. We know the drill.""

And so, my back then 14 year old husband and my back then16 year old brother in law were surprised by the annoucement at a family gathering.

around 10ish years into the relationship, my MIL and FIL were standing at a family gatherin and I didn't pay a lot of thoughts about it, since they are running around, hosting and serving cake and coffee. any, MIl start with ""IWe have an annoucement to make-"" and gets interrupted by BIL. ""Are you pregnant?""

I was sipping my tea and just stopped, thinking: What?

And MIL was like: no? Why do you think that?

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b",">If trans is such an infinitesimal population then why are we restructuring society around their delusional and contradictory notions of gender and sex?

We're not. They existed for a long time and as I said have been competing in sports for decades. You're the one who wants to restructure in order to exclude them.

>There are vastly more schizophrenic individuals but we're not entertaining their delusions and providing them with lead-lined houses and tinfoil hats. 

If those with expertise around schizophrenia said that allowing people to have tinfoil hats and lead lined walls was the best way to help them then I wouldn't be against it. It doesn't help them though so we don't do that. Allowing trans people to transition does help them though, and so far is the only treatment for gender dysphoria that the medical community has come up with.

>it's baseline absurd that we're even entertaining the notion that ""man"" and ""woman"" are interchangeable pronouns based off of the internal reality of a confused individual.

Again, even if you believe they are all just mentally ""confused"", the experts have all come to the conclusion that the best way for them to live a healthy and fulfilling life is transitioning. You thinking it's absurd doesn't change that fact.

>Lastly, trans athletes in sports is a philosophical issue, as a trans individual's claim to ""being the opposite sex"" is strengthened in a permissive environment where there is no opposition to the individual participating in gender-segregated activities as the opposite sex. It behooves non-delusional people to oppose such activities.

That's a long winded way of saying you feel it's your responsibility to stop trans people from participating in sports even though your knowledge on trans people and on their history in sports is obviously incredibly limited? Maybe leave it to people with actual knowledge on the subject rather than just going off of how it makes you feel.

>I wish all trans people the best in their mental health journey.

No, you don't. That's a flat out lie, because if you actually gave a shit you wouldn't be so vehemently opposed to the one treatment that is known to help them, which is just basic acceptance of their chosen identity.",1733011286.0

"worldofpvp","t5_2wbvb","I remember during shadowlands, pvp wasnt this dead. In shadowlands pvp was the only thing that got me through the content drought. It was fun. It was lively. But the gearing system gave people advantages. 




The new gearing system they introduced in dragonflight made things more fair. Basically made pvp more about skill than gear. Theres no advantages to be had in terms of gear.




But heres the issue with that:


People with low skill and fully geared are stuck in the low brackets. Makes it harder for people on fresh toons to learn to pvp. 




As a result particpation is lower because new players cant enjoy pvp, because they cant learn by fighting fully geared teams halfway through season. But thats only part of the reason particpation is lower. There is of course others issues like the mmr being capped at 1900 at start of season. ",1733011287.0

Stalin and Lennon persecuted Jews and Christians and Catholics alike and Stalin killed millions. It wasn't over or between Christians and Jews that people died. It was those that hated God and any reference to him who killed those that tried to believe in God those are the major deaths and the major conflicts not between  people whose interpretations of the Bible are in conflict. Though yes Muslims have killed Jews and Christians because they think that their godAllah is the only correct one even though it came 700 years after the crucifixion of Christ and at least 2,000 if not more years of Judaism. 
And yes Catholic killed Protestants and Catholics did do purges and inquisitions but it wasn't millions and in Spain it was because of the Muslim hordes that invaded and tried to kill Catholics Christians and Jews alike.
And no I don't believe you copied anything out of your own brain Your brain may have lodged certain information or you may have found what you thought was a logical and clever rebuttal but it isn't it wasn't and it's not original to you. It is blind belief in something that doesn't exist You're a tax on Christianity and Jesus If he isn't for real if he isn't who he says he is and who I believe is who he says he is then he's a liar and why should I be like a liar and who are you to tell me that I should be like somebody you think is a liar or just some fool.

Canelo fought Miguel Vasquez in his 3rd fight for the first time. Pretty sure he rematched him before his 20th fight. I can wait for you to Boxrec him...


Vasquez is one of the most technical boxers to ever come out of Mexico. Dude is tall, lanky and can fight at range really well. He fights alot like a Cuban, if we are being honest. A style that is kryptonite to Canelo. It's why Canelo rematched him. Because the first fight was very close with people saying Vasquez could have gotten the W. 


Vasquez is the main reason Canelo's resume at 140 can be taken serious. It literally legitimizes any accusations of fighting cans, like you are doing.

I would suggest maybe for the purpose of learning value drawing with charcoal or getting her a complete graphite drawing set it would include soft leads and hard leads and blending tools. Also a decent sketchbook. Canson paper has been a reliable brand and imo the mixed media sketchbook is great for a wide variety of mediums and it's affordable (9x12 or 8x10 is what I would suggest for size).

"OtonariNoTenshiSama","t5_11xoew","""I’ve already heard that the anime skipped a lot of scenes, which is why I decided to start at Volume 1 instead of jumping straight to Volume 5. I had a similar experience when reading the manga for *The Dusk Maiden of Amnesia*. The anime skipped many important scenes that I really wished had been included,not just because they were plot-relevant, but because they also made my heart flutter a bit. Unfortunately, this is common with anime, as they often end on a cliffhanger or, in romance series, build up to a confession. As you mentioned, this is often why anime don’t live up to their source material.

Since I already enjoyed the anime, I’m really eager to see how the story unfolds further. Your phrasing has me even more excited about what the anime left out and what’s still to come.

Her eyesight was bad enough she couldn't read anymore, so at her request we ordered an audio version of the Bible on CD from the distribution center for her, King James version of course. 

She was convinced that we had given her some modified version of the Bible and would accuse us of changing verses when we visited. One time she said there was a place called Philadelphia in the passages she had listened to and said she was pretty sure the current city of Philadelphia hadn't existed during biblical times. We suggested that Philadelphia, PA was probably named after the biblical location. It was a big lightbulb moment for her. She insisted we write down any verses we read to her so she could have her home health aid read them to her from her own Bible and catch us in changing the Bible. 

Looking back it was probably good for her to have regular visitors even though the visits were weird and often frustrating.",1733011290.0

We have recently added the useful feature of Title Flair! You can set this manually by clicking Flair under your post once you have submitted your post, but if you missed it in the rules there is a much better way that will automatically flair your post!   

To do this simply add what your post is about in brackets before your title. For example for a Build Log you can type [Build Log] before your post so that it looks like this; [Build Log]My new awesome build!, and the bot will automatically set your flair to Build Log! This works for Build Log, Build Showcase, News, Hardware News, Hardware Release, Discussion, and Miscellaneous!

Also remember that this is a place for discussing and sharing our love of Gaming Computers! This is NOT the place for help building or determining what parts you should buy, that is better suited for /r/buildapc.  Troubleshooting questions should be directed to /r/techsupport. Thank you again!

You just need a [Recover Tactical GR26 rail](https://recovertactical.com/product/gr26-rail-adapter-for-the-glock-26-27-and-33/) ; I'd recommend getting the new TLR7 HL-X Sub, as it's higher lumens and rechargable, and is compatible with all the 'TLR7 Sub' holsters. (NOTE- you specifically need [Model 69505](https://battlehawkarmory.com/product/streamlight-69505-tlr-7-hl-x-sub-usb-multi-fuel-high-lumen-rail-mounted-weapon-light-for-short-rail-1913) , which is the ""1913 rail"" variant). MIE Productions makes a[HOLSTER](https://www.mieproductions.com/glock-26-rectac-javelin) for that setup that's fairly affordable, too (Make sure to select the ""TLR-7 SUB (1913s): REC TAC \[GR26\] w/ CUSTOM KEY"" option, as it comes with the bottom key for your light that is needed for the holster).

  
hope this helps!",1733011290.0

"entp","t5_2qoy3","The truth behind this is much deeper than ""gendering."" Toy selection studies confirm that men and women have different ingrained interests. Infant boys prefer traditionally masculine toys like soldiers, trucks, action figures, legos, etc. Girls prefer dolls of babies and couples, cooking sets, houses, and other traditionally feminine things. This is VERY well established and long standing knowledgeable of human behavior.

Also, you can go as far back as our early ancestors to find the roots of these differences. Men were driven to hunt, craft tools and go to war. Women predominantly stayed behind in the villages and grew crops, prepared medines, and tended to homes. 

Peoples inability to make the most basic observations is astonishing to me. Society didn't dictate norms, the norms have dictated society. That's how these trends arose in the first place. We didn't choose our biology.",1733011290.0

Several teams are hot garbage, the Jets, Giants, Panthers etc.

But the Cowboys owner and GM said they are all in.

The Cowboys have the worst GM in the game and they have for the last 30 years.

Years ago Jerry said that he'd fire a GM with his results... but since he's the GM, he won't.

He flat out admitted if someone else was the GM with his record they'd be gone and what does he do?

He stays on as the teams GM running things into the ground.

Easy to Google, but I'll copy and paste for you.

He said this back in 2012.

# Jerry Jones: I would've fired me as Dallas Cowboys' GM

Published: Nov 04, 2012 at 12:43 PM

**2012 interview**Jones said he would have fired a general manager if he had the discretion, but he doesn't fire himself because he thinks he's the best man for the job. He also said that he's always worked for himself, and you can't do that.

  
So, even Jerry KNOWS that the job he's doing isn't good enough as he'd fire someone else with HIS results. 

But that is OK with Jerry.

He is happy to keep producing crappy results because it's his team.

That is an admission that he does not care about winning because he knows the job he is doing is worthy of being fired and he would fire someone else with his results. 

The Cowboys are and have been a complete joke due to Jerry.",1733011291.0

Annie however holds none of the same sympathies, it’s not that she did the bad things it’s that she has no remorse while doing them and after doing them which is why the meme is saying she deserved a lot worse.",1733011291.0

Look at what happened to Russia during the war: their forex and currency reserves were frozen, exposing the West as unreliable partners. This only highlights the urgency for us to reduce reliance on them sooner rather than later.

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","If that was the primary cause of the change in mood, it would happen within a few minutes. This is not how SSRIs actually work in practise, everyone knows they take weeks to show benefits. 

My understanding of how researchers think it might work is that somehow the drug forces some epigenetic change in gene expression that in turn results in changes to serotonin production or use that results in a change in mood. Apparently this would take enough time to explain the long delay before reuptake inhibitors work.

This is the most recent explanation that I've heard from a qualified neuroscientist. This was on an episode of Adam Ragusea's youtube channel where he interviewed his brother, a neuroscientist, about SSRIs and why they are such a pain in the ass. It was a couple years ago now.

If I've gotten something wrong, then that's on me, I'm not a scientist.

But the fact remains, the reuptake inhibition story is easy to understand and is true, but that inhibition of reuptake doesn't seem to be what actually changes people's mood in the long term. Again, if that was the case it would happen in minutes.",1733011293.0

However, this passive exposure also means people that are actively unreceptive to negative feedback are getting exposed, and then reacting, and their reactions also have more reach than they would otherwise . Social media amplifies engagement good and bad, and these opposing voices feed each others reach in their hostility, which evokes more positive and negative engagement on both fronts in a cyclical process.

To add to this, the consolidation of wealth and monopolization of business has made this mechanism I just discussed an easy to abuse means of getting anti-corporate/anti-trust legislation that would otherwise be popular from getting the support they need.

This was my anecdotal experience. In your case, maybe she really is interested. I wouldn't know, she is sending mixed signals. She seems interested, maybe she really is busy with exams.

I am always a proponent of taking a stroll around the shelter first, but at the same time, there are so many reasons to seek out a breeder, and everything you have said is what makes them reputable. But I want to reiterate this point because THIS IS THE BIGGEST STANDOUT:

As it turns out, he was mistaken, a lot of controversy was stirred up, and that’s ultimately his fault, as he didn’t have to make the compromise in the first place.",1733011295.0

"AskCanada","t5_2s8em","It’s very tough here because sometimes even saying you have an issue with it draws calls of racism but that is not always the case. Yes there are a lot of people who are simply racist and don’t like seeing their way of life change or their cultural identity disrespected or what have you. But there are real actual issues with immigration from India to Canada that are not racist at all they’re simply facts, facts that our highest leaders have admitted they messed up on. Essentially as other people have been saying, Canada is just importing all of India’s problems, a lot of the Indian immigrants coming over are young men who bring along cultural attitudes from India who has made it dangerous for women in some cases, I have seen many Indian men have melt downs in grocery stores because they feel disrespected by a worker or another customer, and then there’s the caste system that most still adhere to and believe in once they come to Canada and it has had a very negative affect on the job market in some low level sectors because one person may get into a managerial position and then only hire relatives or friends of relatives or people of their specific religious or cultural beliefs. I think the biggest issue is that there is no give on either side, no one wants to adapt and that’s because of how sudden and sizeable the influx from India was under the policies of a government that has now admitted they misjudged and made mistakes; Canadians want their culture respected and most newly arrived Indians don’t want to assimilate into Canadian culture. And I’m not saying this is a bad thing, they by no means should abandon their culture, but I also think that to an extent there needs to be an understanding that you’re not in a different culture and society, and the same the other way, Canadians need to realize we’re a deeply multi-cultural country so the old cultural values we had as a nation are changing. It’s also very negatively affected those who had immigrated a decade or more ago who worked hard to build reputations in their community just to have them ruined by a growing dissent towards all Indians and even more so affected loads of students who deservedly should be allowed to study here but have now been shut out until the immigration influx problem is fixed. It’s horrible to watch happen, it’s like a train wreck in slow motion.",1733011295.0

I saw your at 169lbs - At 5'4 around 130-135lbs is in the ballpark for good ""athletic form"" and is easy to maintain with an active & healthy lifestyle once you get there. Don't limit yourself to only the gym - check out hot yoga, maybe running, biking, hiking, kayaking, going on walks etc. Rock climbing is a super fun sport with a good social element, there are indoor climbing gyms everywhere it gets you in amazing shape and its fun & social. BJJ is another good one maybe more intimidating for women but ends up being super cool when you get into it. You'll start getting really hot the closer you get that athletic form and other ""flaws"" start kinda melting away. I highly recommend hot yoga too they hit you with ultra positivity mentality every time you go - i did it for 2 years straight almost every day it go me in super good shape, feeling better/healthier/agile, but also super self accepting/self love kind of feeling it was cool.

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","Negative gearing isn't really the problem. Losses offsetting other income is something we already do for business owners. The only difference is that this is on passive and capital assets. They're still losing money on an income basis

The bigger problem is that while they're making income losses, their equity and capital is increasing. If they don't sell that asset, their equity and wealth increases tax free. If they hold the asset for more than 12 months, the CGT discount halves the impact on their income, effectively ducking 50% of their taxes. That person does, inheritance comes into play and you duck even more. They can also use those properties as security on loans, etc.

This makes property really attractive, making rich folks hoard them. This creates an artificial shortage for home owners, making the remaining buildings skyrocket in price since everyone's paying through the nose to get what's left and only increases the gains existing property owners stand to get. 

Don't even get me started on the incentive it gives to property developers. Attack the CGT discount, even if it's just for property, and find other ways to disincentivize rental ownership",1733011296.0

"dubairealestate","t5_39l9q","investing in Dubai is pretty great opportunity . 
The areas you already mentioned is high in ROI rates for people who invested on these places earlier. Dubai is expanding and you would really prefer to go somewhere habitable. 
Off-plans are better of course than ready and handed over projects. Probably because you can earn some side profits just by increasing the value of the property over the time of construction. I had bought a property in the past that was worth 520K the time I bought it now it values nothing less than 635K easy cash . Never the less , this property is being placed for rent and it brings back home a range of 12.2% net ROI .

Monthly payment can go less than 1% or even up to 4K a month depending on the property type . so cash flow is a no problem with that.


If you would like , I can recommend and help you with the fetch of the property you wish to put your money into it. I can share my WhatsApp :)

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","This is an awesome thought experiment!

Okay, so first off, I am picking a U-wing. I always see people rank it low on lists for Star Wars Dropships, but no one talks about how it is seemingly the only dropship with A HYPER-DRIVE! And a Class-1 at that! I could be decked out with something with more guns, or stronger shields, or better maneuvering, but at some point, you will run into a ship that out does you in every category. And at that point, the U-Wing just jumps out of the system. Also, large enough space to more people, more supplies, and more of anything else I could want!

For my first blaster, I may be cheating a little bit, but I am picking the A280-CFE convertible heavy blaster pistol. Yes, another thing introduced in Rogue One, but come on. It itself is 3 blaster in one. For those who don't know, it was Andor's gun that could be used as a pistol, a rifle, and a sniper.

Next up, the Jawa Ion Blaster. It deactivates Droids and other electronics and can be used to stun organic creatures as well. It is an amazing choice for giving non-lethal solutions to a lot of problems. Could even use it to shoot an electronic door to ensure that thing stays open or closed!

Lastly, I chose the Blurrg-1120 holdout blaster. I knew I wanted a Hold-out blaster for the sake of having an easy to conceal side arm, and whilst the Blurrg is a bit on the bulky side for blasters of this type, the customization and options of it I think makes it worth it. Multiple firing modes, a counter showing how many shots you have left on any given mode, and it could be fitted to fire exploding bolts. So an easy to hide, lightweight, one-handed blaster that can shoot explosions. I think I made the right choice.",1733011296.0

**Title**: The Owl King, The Indivisible, Sovereign of Will, Keeper of Secrets

**Domains**:

* **Authority**: Embodies unyielding power to rule, not through sheer force but through vision and the ability to inspire loyalty.
* **Secrets**: Gathers and hoards hidden truths to consolidate power and outmaneuver opponents.
* **Fate**: Manipulates the threads of life and events to impose order according to his will.

# The Mystery of His Name

The Owl King is unique among gods, as no one knows his true name. It is said he sacrificed it in an ancient ritual to gain ultimate control over secrets. His name is not lost—it is safeguarded deep within his own essence, hidden from all, just like the secrets he hoards.

He is known only by his title, for to know his true name would grant unimaginable power over him.

# Owls as Emissaries and Symbols

Owls are his sacred creatures, each an extension of his will. They glide silently through the night, unseen, to observe all and hear every secret. These beings are not only spies but ominous harbingers for those who defy the Owl King's authority.

Owls often appear as guardians in his shrines, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly light and their wings resembling the shadows themselves. His high priests wear owl-shaped masks to honor his eternal vigilance.",1733011297.0

Also just checked and individual premiums averaged $193 a month in 2013. Not sure how this accounts for different plans and differences between policies and what not. So, that could be misleading as well.

I have watched their whole catalog but usually find myself only watching stuff no older than 2023.

I prefer vlogs. I would say their Munchkins car video from January this year is probably my favorite. 

However, the Therapy video ( a month ago) to the latest video just posted. Those videos are some of my most watched of theirs this year. 

I like Nick, Matt, Chris as people and their personalities ( for the most part) and yes they have flaws and aren't perfect as this page likes to highlight but I expect most feel this way if they are fan. 

I 100% believe it has to do with their moods, and if they are having a good time and the videos this month, they are more in harmony than ever before, imo. The videos feel more organic and real, for me, it has less to do with the lighting and production value but that they are enjoying what they are creating.",1733011299.0

Please make it clear where you are located and what is your budget when posting ISOs.
Please also PROVIDE PROOF OF OWNERSHIP when posting pets for sale/trade. This is typically a slip of paper with your name/username and the date. Proof of ownership photos MUST BE updated monthly.
Make sure to select a flair for your post or state where you are selling/trading from and where you can sell/trade. 
When selling/trading please state if an LPS is fake as some people only collect authentic pets. If you are unsure of a pet’s authenticity then please post to r/littlestpetshopfakes and update your post. If a mod tells you that your LPS that you are selling is fake, the comment will be pinned so people know what they are potentially buying.

"Tunisia","t5_2qs6i","I can give you examples of countries that sticks out like a sore thumb in it’s cultural region in terms of development as you say : 
1- Chile , historically South American neighbors were poor and politically unstable like peru and bolivia (chile has 5 times gdp per calita than tunisia)
2- Rwanda surrounded by democratic republic of congo and burundi with high conflicts and economic instability 
3- Botswana surrounded by Zimbabwe and zambia  (botswana had double gdp per capita than tunisia)
4- Again south korea surrounded by north korea and underdeveloped china . 


For your last point the lack of trust in fiat currencies is not a strong argument for adopting Bitcoin as a national currency. The U.S. dollar still dominates global markets, and Bitcoin is more comparable to digital gold—a store of value rather than a practical medium for everyday transactions. Adopting Bitcoin as a national currency is like using gold coins for daily commerce, this wo undermines economic flexibility. Bitcoin can serve as part of a nation’s reserves, it is unsuitable for the core of a monetary system because governments cannot control its supply or adjust it to respond to economic needs. Even El Salvador, which officially adopted Bitcoin, primarily uses it as a reserve and not as the primary currency for transactions. Venezuela’s failure with its digital currency experiment illustrates the risks of adopting such an inflexible monetary approach, people literally lost trust in the crypto Venezuela launched and tanked its value basically the same as a fiat currency .",1733011300.0

Since then, I have basically searched and played all of the souls likes available, usually in reverse chronological order based on release dates.

I am trying to get you to see that you are weighing the quality and the viability of this relationship, just like she is. I am trying to get you to see that it isn't your job to make this relationship work at all costs. 

If you are deeply unhappy with the fundamental nature of your relationship, you should advocate for what you want, but if you get no traction, there isn't a cheat code that will make someone care enough to hear you. 

You obviously want to spend more time together. You want a balanced relationship that isn't based entirely on her terms. You want to be a priority in your own relationship.

All of these things are perfectly reasonable. Again, you should advocate for these things, but you also must be willing to walk away if she is unwilling or unable to be the kind of partner you are looking for.

Ultimately, you are the only one who knows where that line is. Just don't stay too long. Don't fall into the trap of believing that you can change another person by changing your approach or by expressing yourself in the perfect way.

Those things don't work, and someone who truly cares about your emotional life wouldn't need a perfectly crafted set of words to give a shit about how you feel.",1733011301.0

In the past some manufacturers like Comgraf manufactured fixed magazine lowers such that the magazine release hardware could not be physically installed without additional machining.

"warno","t5_5i3o06",">I prefer playing defensively

Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. If you let the enemy make all the moves, that's the same as letting them dictate what happens and when. Defense is often a good strategy but if your strategy is overly reliant on holding specific points then artillery will be the hard counter to that. That is not a bug, but a feature. 

If you're in a situation where you have to or want to play defensive, definitely spread your people out more. Try and consider where, if you were the enemy, you might artillery *even if you had no sight of the enemy during an attack*. Make sure you don't have all your guys concentrated in those places. 

Killing recon is also huge. Prioritize taking out the enemy's eyes if you can.",1733011301.0

"LagottoRomagnolo","t5_xprbd","Hi, we have had the same experience with our dog. 

Sometimes soft stool: have you tested for giradia? 

Eating: Lagotti are smart dogs and this behaviour only exists because you have teached your dog that if he doesn’t eat, maybe something better will come. 

Only way to get rid of it: Teach your dog if he doesn’t want to eat, he doesn’t get anything. Wait some hours before you try again. No snacks or treats in between - at least if it’s the same environment. Dog school is a different context and you can of course give treats there. 

Use the bowl for kibble and only for kibble. Never give him kibble with some extra topping, except you always give the topping. For some days give him little less food. He will soon like his food again. 

We have had the same situation- our dog stopped eating her kibbles - sometimes ate nothing for 30h… now she is very happy when we give her kibbles.",1733011301.0

The weight you are in your teens-20s is not a good lifetime goal weights while I don’t have your chart in front of me you look healthy fit & strong 

At my clinic we encourage women to strength train and do more body weight exercises (yoga, pilates, spin/cycle for cardio) to build the type of body you have causes less problems once you reach menopause! Less muscles& bone density leads to osteoporosis and a slew of problems that leads to immobility as you age. Especially given you have PCOS which indicates hormonal imbalance I wouldn’t suggest you lose muscle and would refer you to a DEXA scan so you can see just how healthy your body is! Please get a more rounded care team, I am very disappointed in your doc

"hvacadvice","t5_3bonx","There are numerous different types, but not all are well suited for oil.  But, you'll still have to decide what you're more interested in - the exact level, or just if it's above or below a certain level, or levels.  The unfortunate part is that most tanks need to be prebuilt for adding a level sensing device, a second port essentially, unless they are above ground and have a sight-glass and fittings available.  If you use the one port that's available for filling, you'd have to remove your sensor every time you need to fill it.  So, you're sort of limited on the type of device you can use.  If you have a sight-glass, you can use a pressure type, but they get rather expensive for oil compatibility.

We used to prefer ultrasonic sensors for exact level, as there was nothing in the fluid to go bad.  The ultrasonics are much more accurate and reliable than capacitive rods, or float type rods, but also more expensive, much too so for residential.  

For above/below a certain level indication, a level ""switch"" is suitable and there are optical ones that would work well.  If well maintained and clean, an optical should work reliably, and would be easy to remove for filling on a single port tank.  Just so you can review the basics, here's a link to Dwyer Instruments optical sensors, and they have lots of displays and other accessories on other pages.  They are not the cheapest on the market either, but they give you a good idea for comparison, as well as good technical papers on their site.  ( The one goofy thing about their site, to get to the actual literature PDF, scroll down, click on the ""Support Library"" tab, then click the ""Catalog Pages"" link down below. )  [https://dwyer-inst.com/en/products/level/level-switches/optical.html](https://dwyer-inst.com/en/products/level/level-switches/optical.html)

If you decide you really want a true transmitter, and don't mind the hassle of removing every time you fill, you can review various brands and types at Kele, a multi-vendor rep out of TN.  Use the filters on the left to narrow them down.  But, I don't think you'll find anything under $500, just for the transmitter, no remote display.  And, they are a pain to calibrate and maintain.

Medicare Advantage is better than Medicare because it tends to offer more coverage, like dental and vision, which is one reason why people choose it over traditional Medicare.

Insurance companies don’t dictate the cost of covering the Member/Patient.   The insurance company is reimbursed exactly whatever Medicare pays.  

Insurance companies are incentivized to sign up sick people.   This is literally what you all wanted because fairness and equity and whatnot.   So they sign up sick people and Medicare pays them a bonus so they can cover those people.

In reality it costs less to provide care for these people, because *the patients are receiving better care and are having better health outcomes, which lowers the cost of care in the long term*

Literally, this is exactly what everybody wanted except those who believe taxpayers shouldn’t foot the bill for healthcare.  More people are covered, their health conditions are better-documented, their health outcomes are better overall because they are receiving more proactive-care as opposed to the completely reactive and un-empathetic nature of Medicare.  

This entire article is bullshit.   If you want to argue over how much profit should be kept from the cost savings, that’s fair game.   The article says the insurance companies are kicking back 50-60% of those cost savings in the form of additional coverage, lower prescription costs, etc.",1733011302.0

Ah, the eternal debate among MechWarrior enthusiasts! If I had to pick the best 'Mech from this illustrious lineup, I'd go with the Dire Wolf. Here's why:  


1. Beefy Armor: The Dire Wolf is heavily armored, which means it can take a beating and keep on fighting. It's like the Hulk of 'Mechs, but without the anger management issues.
2. Weapon Loadout: It's loaded with a variety of weapons, including the fearsome Ultra AC/20 and Large Pulse Lasers. It's like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight... and winning.
3. Heat Management: Despite its heavy armament, the Dire Wolf has decent heat sinks, allowing you to fire those big guns without turning into a walking sauna.
4. Intimidation Factor: Just look at it! It's got the kind of presence that makes other pilots think twice before engaging. It's the 'Mech equivalent of a bouncer at a bar.
5. Versatility: With its mix of long-range and close-quarters weapons, it can adapt to various combat scenarios. Whether you're sniping from afar or brawling up close, the Dire Wolf has got you covered.

So, if you want a 'Mech that's as tough as nails, packs a punch like a heavyweight boxer, and looks like it could star in its own action movie, the Dire Wolf is your go-to 'Mech. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... and possibly a lot of explosions.",1733011302.0

You can always keep a good bow and try it on an upgraded violin later. One thing I learned recently regards the balance point of the bow. Once you narrow down preferences empirically, measure the balance point to assign a number for what feels right to you. To measure: unscrew the button to advance the frog all the way forward. The hair will be slack. Measure from the balance point to the end of the wood (not the button). It will be somewhere between 9 and 10 inches. Lighter feels better to me, so I found I likes +/- 9.25”.

I said and you acknowledged that my alchemist comment was a bit much. 

For the record and fuck me I've said this before I am not insulting or disregarding the profession of therapy. I am saying due to things I have written before there is a lot of therapist who can get away with being incompetent much more so than another profession such as being a doctor.

All the stuff you are saying about me not wanting to listen or hear you out is you not me. I have changed my mind and conceded several things during this conversation, you haven't. 

The way you sign it with the alchemist at the end shows you're angry and not thinking straight. 

I'll say it one more time. I am not insulting the practice of therapy when it is done properly. However I do think there are a lot more frauds working as therapists due to the reasons stated previously. 

Since you're going for personal attacks again, even though the stuff you are saying had been previously addressed...

I was watching a skate vid once and saw a pro kinda Ollie then flip when he had some height. I worked on this a lot and found I could change it up and do that. So yeah, I stopped essentially doing the KF all at once, but instead would sort of Ollie for some height and flip.

Tariffs can help protect domestic industries and encourage businesses to bring jobs back home. Yes, there may be some short-term challenges, just like sore muscles after a workout. But in the long run, they can strengthen our economy, support local workers, and reduce reliance on foreign goods.

It’s not about instant gratification; it’s about building something stronger and more sustainable. Sometimes, what’s best for the long-term health of a nation requires a little patience and resilience but you guys wouldn't understand that because what I said is too logical.",1733011305.0

PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH!

If you are asking whether something is a scam, or whether a message you received is legitimate, please see this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/15ng6bm/a_guide_to_scam_attempts_on_etsy/

PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS!  We are getting multiple posts a day about scammers messaging newer sellers on Etsy.  Please read the scam guide for full details, but do take note of the following:

Any message asking for your email address is a scam attempt - whether from a buyer or from someone pretending to be Etsy support.  

Messages pretending to be Etsy support and asking you to click a link or scan a QR code to verify something or provide information are scam attempts.  

Buyers pretending they can't check out from your shop are scam attempts.  

IS IT LEGIT?  If you have any actual open or processing orders, they will appear in your shop dashboard in your open orders section. Any message that is legitimately from Etsy will appear in a special ""From Etsy"" section of your messages on the desktop site.  

Etsy has also begun putting a special ""this message is from a buyer account"" notice over these fake support messages.  You may need to check on the desktop site to see this.  

NOTE:  If you accidentally clicked ""accept"" on the message, the blue banner warning you will go away.  Doesn't mean it's not a scam attempt.  Check the From Etsy folder on the desktop site... or better yet, just be aware that Etsy isn't messaging you to verify anything and you don't need to check because it's a scam attempt.

**TLDR:**  Etsy will NEVER ask you for personal information in a message, nor will they ask you to click a link to verify or give information, or scan a QR code.  If you receive a message like this, **IT IS NOT FROM ETSY AND IS A SCAM ATTEMPT.**  

NOTE:  Weird messages that are just a link to one of your listings, or say a single word like ""Hello"", or say ""Are you available"" with no other details are preludes to scam attempts.  The scammer is trying to evade filters by not putting the scam in the first message.  Just mark these as spam and ignore them, they are not legitimate.  

NOTE TWO:  The latest version of this scam is scammers attaching a photo image to their message which contains a QR code or a link.  This is just another variant of the same.  The scammers are putting it in an image so it is harder for scam filters to detect.  IGNORE any message like this and mark as spam.  Do not click ""accept.""

If you are looking for contact information for Etsy support, see this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/15nfvd7/how_do_i_contact_customer_support/

**NOTE IF THE SCAM GUIDE ISN'T RELEVANT TO YOUR QUESTION:** Sometimes this automod removes posts that were not actually about a scam attempt covered by the scam guide.  

If this happened, **please be patient** - we check and manually approve posts throughout the day. There is no need to reach out - we will see your post in mod queue!

You trust her, you’re aware of hormones during all this so I’d personally just give her some space and enjoy the extra time with some hobbies, games etc 😅

Because at some point it’s going to be all hands on deck to raise this child, be that months before to support her when she’s ready or from labour onwards. Having a baby is so much fun but so much work so embrace the time for some self indulgence while you can is all I mean.

Obviously that is me disregarding the semantics because no one can really know the ins and outs of your relationship and it’s up to you to trust your gut. I would say though, you’re both young and relationships can hit hurdles that early on just generally. Me and my partner had our issues at 3 years or so, I can’t imagine how adding a baby to that would impact things. The hurdles are there to make or break you and couples that make it come out stronger for it 🙏",1733011306.0

"fnv","t5_2rzr5","Without the DLC the progression feels very un-natural and sudden. With the DLC however, when paced properly and especially with Lonesome Road and Ulysses' philisophy on whichever faction you are most allied to it makes your characters presence and involvement feel true, as though it is personal and your character is truly caring what is at stake with the Mojave.

It also wraps up all the themes with the DLC. Fallout is a shadow of a world that once was. Every DLC is related to the idea of ""letting go"" - Dead Money is greed, power and revenge. Honest Hearts is acceptance, change, and growth. Old World Blues is letting go of the past and moving forward from old ways of life. Lonesome Road wraps it all up with letting go of old places and ending grudges. Each DLC you tackle these themes and in one way or another, conquer these issues. The main story itself is a quest of revenge, only after to be put on the spotlight of making a big decision that could shift a fragile balance of power. Each faction is representive of an old world idea and way of life except for the independant route.

It then becomes up to the player to make the decision of what is the right way of living based on all the decisions made in the DLC's and which lessons that either you - the player had learned, or whichever lesson you believed that your character had learned.

With all this considered it then makes the second half of the main story mean so much more. It adds layers of nuance to each faction and their ideologies and morals of which they represent.

With New Vegas, it feels like sometimes it is up to you to truly give your story a meaning. It's not as though you need to be imaginative, but rather consistent of what your character believes. For some, it is easier to place themselves in the shoes of their characters and make decisions that one would make themselves. This is generally the route for the first playthroughs.

Tldr: The DLC's give the much needed nuance and backgrounds of big political decisions made in the second half of the story.",1733011306.0

If during a claim something pops up with any prior damage then the policy has provisions to exclude this.

An insurer is not going to spend time and money rechecking a vehicle is structurally sound to insure it unless it’s a high value vehicle in which case they definitely may have more interest.

Para el perfil agresivo, puedes poner el 100% en acciones (ojo que esto si conlleva estudiar a las empresas) o para hacerlo sencillo un ETF que siga el S&P500 como el SPYG que es de mayor riesgo que el VOO pero podria tener mayor rentabilidad.

Para perfil moderadamente agresivo y moderado, tu portafolio tendria un % en renta variable (acciones, etf o criptomonedas) y un % en renta fija (bonos).

Te comparto una calculadora para que puedas hacer tu proyección en base al capital inicial que tengas, cuanto podrias aportar mensualmente y que rentabilidas esperas (lo normal seria 10%).
https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/calculadora-de-interes-compuesto

Para Perú, los brokers que tienen mas opciones para fondear la cuenta son eToro y XTB ya que permiten usar tarjetas ademas de transferencias. eToro ahora cobra $1 por operación de compra de acciones y $0 para ETFs, permite invertir en la bolsa de NYSE y algunas otras bolsas. XTB no cobra por operaciones con acciones y ETFs permite invertir en la bolsa europea y no tiene tantos ETFs de EEUU como eToro.

7) Getting Armour level 4 from the Waystation North of Mountain Knot makes fighting MULEs and Terrorists much easier.",1733011308.0

If you are looking for a bar where there are not that many people unless its some kind of event, you should go to czudner or serum ( if it comes to gdansks old town if you go either to blocks left/right from main street there will be less places but they will usually have less people with some exceptions, and places over motława from długi targ can be pretty calm and nice, czudner is a great example). I have to also metion spatif and awangarda in sopot as they have amazing vibe and great people. If you change your mind about pub/bar being lowkey you should go to student bar mechaniczna pomarańcza or ygrek, sztos in sopot for some afordable beer and piwnica rajcow in gdansk old town for some good beer and food. Some og places, at least for me, that are the opposite of lowkey are pijalnia wodki i i piwa or tabaka.

And I’ll see a chiropractor for like $50 a session to make sure my pelvis is looked after ahead of labour. My midwife is free, scans are like $30 each, and blood tests are free.

It sounds like you’ll be completely fine, and they’ll be able to do all the tests and checks and stuff in your second trimester.

"AmazonDSPDrivers","t5_1a9kw0","but to answer your question about whether you should quit or not....let's look at what we know, shall we?

 Working for Amazon as a driver means dealing with all sorts of crazy weather - imagine trudging through snow or sweating in the summer heat while delivering packages. That's tough work.

The new job looks promising! I mean, you got a guaranteed 40 hours per week, you're also getting home by 6 PM every day, and full benefits.   
  
Sure, you're taking a $5 pay cut per hour, but let's be real - stability is worth something.   
  
Those guaranteed hours mean no more wondering if you'll make enough cash each week. Plus, getting off at a consistent time? That's gold when you're trying to plan your life.

Think about it - less stress from unpredictable routes, no more battling the elements, and a more stable paycheck. The benefits could easily make up for that $5 difference. Health insurance alone can be a huge financial relief.

(ex: I'm paying over $200/month for Med/Den at my current DSP, which is $80+/- MORE than what I was paying at my previous DSP! Imagine if it was the other way around! :-)

Your biggest question should be is What skills can this new job teach you? I know you're only 22, but IMHO, you want a job that helps you grow, not just pays the bills. Can this opportunity lead to something bigger down the road?

My advice? The predictability and potential for growth sound like they might outweigh the slightly lower hourly rate. Sometimes, peace of mind is worth more than a few extra dollars.

But, this is just an opinion and like gas mileage, yours may vary! :-)",1733011309.0

I remember when I had a close friend I had to beg at some point to tell me to piss off if I spend more than 6 hours talking to them. All things failed until I decided to put a timer, it helped a little but wasn’t good enough to fix my sense of time with them. So I just decided to tell them I will be back in a (days, or weeks) And it seems to be the only solution that worked, reseted me back to normal every time and what’s good is when you come back you start to get the hang of it and cut them off from your day easily. But honestly it feels like the boss fight is feeling sad how they might take it when you leave first every time, it’s a recurring problem when I get attached to someone like when I talk to my teacher in their office, hard to leave first if I’m enjoying their company. Sounds more wholesome than being a problem but I guess it sucks when it makes you less productive and in bad health.",1733011309.0

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","Definitely, also maybe consider upping your aftercare routine. It could be helpful for him to spend some time and attention caring for you, allowing him to remind himself that the fantasy doesn't have to determine his reality. 

Also, he might need some aftercare too. Sometimes after a particularly intense scene, my sub will be able to tell I need some reassurance and just cuddle me and tell me that she knows how much I love her and that I'd never want to really hurt her, and that I'm not a monster etc.

Also while I'm here, I'll expand on the subject. I often see folks posting on this subreddit with questions about feeling guilty or conflicted about their kinky stuff. This is the cut and paste ""speech"" I give them. 

Hopefully it can be helpful for you both. 
...

[Almost all of us in the kink community deal with some manner of this same issue. We worry about what it ""means"" or ""says"" about us that we're turned on by certain things that social norms would determine to be wrong or bad. 

But the simple truth is that there is NO reason for ANYONE to feel wrong, or bad, or guilty about their kinks for one key reason.

WE DON'T CHOOSE THEM. We have no more control over what turns us on sexually than we do over whether or not we like mustard, or what music we prefer, or our favorite color, or any of the infinite aspects of our personalities that are based on the countless intangible facets of our psyche. 

What we have control over is our actions. Humiliating someone is wrong, having a humiliation kink is just something that's HAPPENING to you. The difference is consent. 

You wouldn't go smacking anyone across the face, but if your partner makes it clear it's something they want and you both consent to it then that's just healthy support of each other's wants and needs. 

So, as long as you're making sure to only exercise your kinks in a safe way with consenting adult partners, then there's nothing to feel guilty about. It's all just different flavors of enjoying each other.]",1733011309.0

"photocritique","t5_2qymy","That was my huge mistake on my first shoot. The other day I looked back at those photos after my 5th shoot, which I did in the same studio with similar lighting. I couldn’t believe that I set the ISO so low (100-400). Clearly I was overly afraid of grain. For shoot 3 I had met with a photographer friend who had no inhibitions about setting the camera to high ISOs. He had casually said two things to me that I completely undervalued: “Grainy isn’t necessarily bad. Nice photos can be grainy” and also “Just use  de-noise in Lightroom.” For his first comment I think it depends on what kind of photography. If you’re doing a product shoot, grainy wouldn’t be good. For cars I think it’s not as rigid but I think the answer is at a minimum you should be able to see details that car nuts care about like being able to tell how deep dish the rims are, that little running light that shows you its “the good model year”, or the ornate pattern of the grille. As for Lightroom, yeah I didn’t understand that he meant that the de noise is now AI powered and you must absolutely upgrade to newer adobe products because it’s a game changer.”

Anyway ever since that shoot I’ve at least considered 2000-2400 and have a preference for 1600 ISO if I’m in a low light situation. My photos are much better for it, plus the de noise saving it if it’s  2000 or higher.",1733011309.0

"AskElectricians","t5_2xtq0","Most likely, in this case, the screw colors are trustworthy (copper colored screws being the common terminal on both switches). Looks like the white wire on copper screw is the ""switch leg"" (attached to the light fixture) and the black wire on the copper screw on the other switch is the hot. 

Using a white wire for that purpose was likely a code violation even back in the day when it was done... It ""maybe"" could have been used as one of the travelers, IF it was re-identified (covered by tape, etc. so that it does not appear white) at both the switch and at the light fixture, but not all electricians would agree with that; here's a very geeky discussion on that topic that's 20 years old:

https://forums.mikeholt.com/threads/using-neutral-as-a-traveller-on-3way-switch.14503/

If all you're doing is changing switches, make sure the power is off, verify it's off with a multimeter (and don't rely on a non-contact tester), and after you've removed the old switches, spiral wrap that white wire with electrical tape that is any color other than green or white so that the white insulation of the wire doesn't show. Reconnect the wires to the new switches, wrap one layer of electrical tape around the switches to cover the exposed screw terminals, and if there are no kids or other dangerous people around, turn the power back on before you put the switches back in the wall. 

Pick a switch, and switch it to its opposite position. The light fixture should change from what ever state it's in to the opposite state (from off to on, or on to off). Now go to the other 3-way switch, switch its position, and the light should again change state. Repeat that sequence.  If the light changes state each time you throw a switch in that pattern I've described, then the three-way functionality is confirmed to be correct. Turn the power off again, mount the new switches in the boxes, restore power, and you're good to go.",1733011310.0

I will raise you your spooky post-hysterectomy with the details involved when one must fight endometrial cancer. 

Treatment:

* Google up the images of brachytherapy. Those are the rods that administer the Tx to the uterus through the vagina.
* Make sure those images show you the vaginal cuff. It gets sewn to the entire labia. The rods go through the various holes of the cuff up the canal into the uterus.
* The patient must be given meds to stop her from defecating for the entire week that she is on her back receiving that treatment. 

Post-treatment issues:

* Research those instances of burning out the colon where the patient may survive her treatment but winds up needing 1-3 bags because her bladder and/or colon burns in that treatment. 

A post-menopausal woman lives a much more successful life when she has a hysterectomy after age 40. How do I know this? I see that data in my work as a healthcare underwriter.

While they are highly aromatic, typically, in cooking, the word refers to the vegetables and herbs you sweat prior to building your dish, be it mirepoix or whatever other combination of onions, garlic, carrots, celery, etc... But that's not important. 

Here's a tip for spices. The majority of flavor compounds in spices are fat-soluble. Always grind fresh when possible, and fry your spices in a bit of fat to truly bring out their flavor. This is common in Mexican and Indian cuisine.

Also, that which is fat soluble tends to be alcohol soluble. A bit of vodka can quickly draw out a lot of flavor, especially with safron, then pour it in. 

One more, never use prepeeled or pre-minced garlic. It's awful.",1733011310.0

The fact LE can access them makes me believe it isn’t just used for sentencing (LE is not in control of sentencing, the court is; the court weighs all factors at sentencing and LE just provides their opinion of the case).

If I say ""don't think about a pink elephant"", you think about a pink elephant. That's how powerful names are.

Det var vel en boom av enkelte merker, og jeg ser overraskende mange fra polestar, hongqi, nio, byd og mg, men topplistene for bilmodeller kan vel ikke sies at overskylles med kinesiske biler - langt derifra.

Det er jo ikke sånn at de _gir bort_ bilene. Folk må fortsatt kjøpe de. Så det at de ikke topper salgslistene motsier ikke at Kina prøver å knekke markedet med sterkt subsidierte biler.

>Faren er at EU og USA havner på hver sin side, og Kina en tredje side. Dét gagner ingen.

Det har allerede skjedd - selv før Trump ble valgt inn på nytt. USA er totalt gjennomkorrupt, og deres konglomerater - spesielt innen tech - herjer fritt i samfunnet vårt ved å bryte alle lover, unndra skatt, ulovlig samarbeid mellom hverandre & ulovlig monopolpraksiser, og alt dette mens den amerikanske staten gir dem full støtte og beskyttelse.",1733011311.0

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I’m not going to pretend like I know what it’s like being a man. But then you can’t tell me how women are thinking about masculinity. Have women used toxic masculinity improperly? Duh. But that doesn’t mean the term is false. It very much exists, and it’s used correctly in many contexts. I would be in favor of dissecting the term when it comes up so that it isn’t used so much as a blanket term for whatever toxic trait the listener comes up with in their own mind. 

There are many aspects to positive masculinity: cultivating friendship with other men, standing up for other people, loving your own body and taking care of it, not being afraid of being perceived as gay, supporting your community, being respectful towards those around you… I could go on. 

Ultimately, it’s up to you and other men to define how to be men in a way that is a positive force in this world. Oftentimes toxically masculine traits take the harmless parts of masculinity to the extreme and to the detriment of others. If you can find that moderation, you can be whatever type of man you want to be. 

Lastly, toxic masculinity is the extreme",1733011311.0

With so much hype and to-do about ""movies!!"" from every corner of humanity, it opened for me a nice window to real hope for my sensibility.

*Looker (1981)* HearMeOut! AT THE TIME played on the very real simmering paranoia that by the day was increasing about the onslaught of awkward, unfriendly, and inhuman technology that was thrust in our every day surroundings.

Sadly, despite its topnotch concept and potential of storyline, due to limits of those days in a myriad collective, poor Cromichton was forced to be at the mercy of wrapping up something which otherwise could've developed into a lasting monster, rather than the crushing disappointment it ended up as, now a ""mere cult film"" for me and about 39 others on the planet.

*What's Up, Doc? (1972), Midnight Run (1987)*, and *Arthur (1981)* for sweet, satirical, and steeped in human character.  

Admittedly, *Se7en, The Usual Suspects (1995 both),* and *The Game (1997)*are to credit for my curiosity in thinking man's badassery.

To answer him, yeah feminism is currently in what is called a period of [feminist backlash](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/03/07/global-backlash-against-womens-rights) that has happened historically a little time after each major advancement in women's rights. Nothing new.

But either because u/freeblackfish is an idiot, an misogynist, or both, he uses it as an argument meant to suggest that women aren't actually oppressed and that backlash is the natural response to this unnecessary noise.

**Is this post from a sextortion scammer?**

Sextortion scammers often visit personal request subreddits like this one and coerce victims into sending sexual images of themselves, then threaten to share these images unless you comply with their demands. Below are some signs this poster may be a sextortion scammer. Please report any post you come across that breaks our rules!

1. This poster wants to communicate on Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, Kik, Telegram or any other app where you may inadvertently give out personal details about yourself, family, friends, school, employer or any other entity that may be used against you in a blackmail attempt.

2. This poster wants you to send them compromising images of yourself. A sextortion scammer will likely threaten to send these photos to your relatives, friend group, crush, and/or employer unless you obey their demands.  

3. This post contains references to ""Friends With Benefits"" and/or ""Long-Term Relationships"". The false impression that a deepened relationship is possible may lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

4. This post is targeted towards readers from a specific city, state or country. Knowing your location helps sextortion scammers narrow down their search of your personal information. The false hope that an in-person hookup is possible may also lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

5. Sextortion scammers often use default, randomly generated Reddit usernames along the lines of ""Adjective_Noun_1234"" instead of thoughtful usernames. Since these accounts are reported and banned so frequently, scammers often do not take the extra time to create a meaningful username.

6. A common theme amongst suspected sextortion posts in this community is the inclusion of various kinks in the original post. If you read a post where the OP says something along the lines of, ""Here are my kinks:"", proceed with caution.

What I miss is the following: for previous DA games, you had structural conflicts that did not define good and evil in a clear cut way, forcing the player to take a side. Most prominently is the treatment of mages, but the role of religion, the treatment of elves, etc. are inherent, and that is exposed through deeply troubled characters going against each other. 

In DAV, there are personal bickering between companions, but never structural conflict where the Rook has to take a value-based choice.

Everything is just ""those are the bad guys, we're the good guys"". That makes the characters so boring.",1733011313.0

"MeetNewPeopleHere","t5_3kpir","""Hi there! It's great that you're looking to meet new people and make connections online. However, it's important to prioritize your safety while doing so. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:

Don't share personal information: Avoid sharing any sensitive or personal information with people you meet online. This includes your full name, phone number, address, school name, or any other identifying information.

Use a separate email: Consider using a separate email account that doesn't have any personal information attached to it. This way, you can keep your personal information private while communicating with new people.

Meet in public: If you do decide to meet up with someone you've met online, make sure to meet in a public place with other people around. Bring a friend along with you if possible, and let someone else know where you're going and who you're meeting.

Trust your instincts: If someone makes you feel uncomfortable or asks you to do something that you're not comfortable with, trust your instincts and end the conversation. Don't feel pressured to continue talking to someone if you don't feel safe.

Remember, the internet can be a great place to meet new people and make connections, but it's important to prioritize your safety. Take the necessary precautions to protect yourself, and enjoy meeting new people online in a safe and responsible way.

Stay safe and have fun!

Best,

I already had a few spare AC Ground Loop isolator for travelling with amplifiers and such, so it was no extra cost to me. Funnily, I had USB-C power adapters that support 3/5/12/20V, but just didn't have one that supported 9V. The fun world of USB-PD.",1733011313.0

"Yogscast","t5_2sg86","Lewis here, this has been a recurring question in every Minecraft series I've done and the short answer is yes. The long answer is yes: if it's something needlessly awkward, fiddly, tedious or frustrating. There's nothing worth than continually getting your progress blocked by a chain of niche resources that you've previously painstakingly collected - but now have run out because you accidentally made them into a stack of fancy doors.

Same goes for builds: we're always gonna try and build stuff legit but we want to keep a lively pace and focus on fun. If a thing is half-built at the end of an episode and it's obvious how it should be finished, I'll usually do that after the session is over. Otherwise, it'll remain half-finished forever or I'll forget what I was doing with it or I'll spend the next entire session talking about it again and bore everyone to death.

Lastly all three of us are really passionate for the series but have busy schedules. We can't always get together to record  or don't have the energy/mood to record, even for members. So there are times when a couple of us will hang out, chat about what to do next and pootle about on the server tidying things up and absent-mindedly finish off something that looks cool.",1733011313.0

I’ve had 3 4x4 trucks and truly have never put any of them in 4wd besides to make sure it works before bought them. And I live in snowy Wisconsin. I also sold cars for a long time. I was confident in the deal I got. And 2wd trucks don’t depreciate any faster than 4x4. They’re always about 2-3k cheaper if everything else matches up. And you get 2-4mpg better. So you end up saving thousands over the life of the vehicle. 

I’ve sold used trucks that still had a sticker on the 4x4 knob that wasn’t removed during pre delivery inspection when it was sold new. Most people aren’t using 4wd.

I did end up switching to the x264 CLI (downloaded from the VLC site), because Handbrake was indeed encoding an mp4 regardless of the file extension.

Here's the flags I'm using: --crf 12 --preset slow --tune grain --bluray-compat --fps 24 --vbv-maxrate 40000 --vbv-bufsize 30000 --level 4.1 --keyint 24 --open-gop --slices 4 --colorprim ""bt709"" --transfer ""bt709"" --colormatrix ""bt709"" --sar 1:1

The problem is that it seems to be speeding up the video to get the framerate from 18 to 24, instead of duplicating frames. I can't find documentation for the correct flag to use.

I had originally chosen the ""stop at all costs"" option, but my Inquisitor still had a high-approval friendship with Solas at the time, so the whole ""can he be reasoned with"" approach rung true for me.  The thing that didn't ring true was when Solas called my Inquisitor nothing more than ""useful.""  Pissed me off so bad, like we were friends, dude!

I don't understand why the relationship/approval standing wasn't carried over to this game separately.  Seems it would have been relevant and, I hope, a small thing to include an attitude range in the two scenes or so where the Inquisitor discusses Solas.

OP, you’re human, and you momentarily got distracted. I don’t know about how things are in California, but a few thoughts:
1) Don’t self-incriminate yourself. You are under no legal obligation to be so outwardly transparent and honest that you willfully give evidence that hurts your case. 
2) You’re being too hard on yourself. There is a reasonable amount of “Oh shit. Yeah not a good idea. Won’t do that again.” that exists here. It was a bad decision, but not “terrible.” Have some nuance and accountability, but flogging yourself isn’t going to help.
3) If it’s anything like where I am, this probably won’t go anywhere. If there’s a formal complaint, they’ll ask you about it. It’s your word against theirs. They have no formal evidence, which means they have no way of knowing if the client is dysfunctional and just made it up. They can’t take your license away based on that.

"OptimistsUnite","t5_7yen7e","But what kind of life do you think these people led? Most women who didn't work for a salary lived on farms. They helped around the farm, not just taking care of kids and washing clothes, but doing other things like making clothes, taking care of animals, etc.

All these things had economic value. Making and mending clothes saved money vs buying them. Making meals saved money vs restaurants (which they could not afford, unlike you). Raising kids saved money vs childcare, and it was an investment that made money (future help on the farm). Taking care of animals also made money for the farm, it just wasn't a defined ""job"" on the census that drew a salary. But it definitely contributed to the bottom line for family finances. 

These women worked harder than you. I think you don't understand this. They worked longer hours, with more physical toil, and they lived in greater poverty.

There is this infatuation with America in the immediate post war years (1946-1965, roughly) when America was the only major industrial power not decimated by the war. It was by far the richest nation on Earth. We led in technology and industry, exporting to the world. We could afford, for a brief time, to remove many of the economic responsibilities from women. There is this myth that it was union power, but it was American economic dominance over a wrecked global economy trying to get back on its feet. 

Now the global competition is fierce so wages are closer to other developed nations, and expectations in standards of living have grown (houses are twice as big), and feminism has changed women's expectations for independence. Those are three major reasons why women ""need"" to work.",1733011318.0

Even if we do assume some level of meat consumption improves health outcomes it's still not a great argument against *reducing* meat consumption, just against complete veganism. Surely there's some point in a human diet where consuming additional meat has no health benefits. And morally it doesn't automatically pan out either. If consuming human meat was shown to dramatically improve health outcomes no one would argue we should factory farm people, they'd still decry it as wrong. How many animals is an extra year of one human life worth? Your average American eats >9000 pounds of meat in their lifetime, which is dozens of cows or thousands of chickens. Is torturing a thousand chickens worth living 2% longer? 

I'm not saying you need to quit eating meat, I still consume fish/eggs/dairy (which are also horrendous systems), but that these are not good *moral* arguments for meat consumption. I just think once you get down to it there's no logically consistent argument for modern meat consumption that doesn't involve the lives and suffering of animals having essentially no moral worth, but effectively no one holds that belief either. That isn't to say that eating meat is wrong in *all* cases, but the industrial scale of factory farming and the commensurate suffering of animals seems nakedly unjustifiable unless we assume the above, that animal suffering is not a moral concern to begin with.",1733011319.0

I had absolutely no idea any children lived in those home especially 4 kids in one of them. We see their back and front yard, we have never witnessed these kids playing outside. 

My daughter’s best friend in kindergarten lives the next street over we found out and have for many years. We’ve walked and drove by their house more times than I can count. Never seen either child outside. Another kid from her class lives on the road behind us, two boys her age. Never seen those children outside.",1733011320.0

My point was, trying to silence the current ex-livers because ""it'll harm the people still inside"" is a dumb take when we still have fresh examples of things still being shitty in the company. Vivi is the most recent case and she felt so tired and defeated.

Every single time an ex-liver makes a comparison, you can easily take that as more evidence of how shitty things were in niji and not pointing that out only helps niji and the sisters.

I mean, MrShadowHero (the person I was replying to) was literally victim-blaming Michi on another post simply for saying she's better, happier. and healing because her words could be used against the company and current livers. Like what.

"1200isplenty","t5_2xk5e","This is going to depend highly on how you are defining ""satiety"".  I'm going to assume you mean feelings of fullness/lack of appetite or hunger pains that last for a long time relative to how many calories you consumed, although I think technically that word does not necessarily indicate anything about how long the sated feeling lasts.

Since you asked about foods, I'll start there. It's recommended to eat a balance of protein, healthy fats, and fiber in each meal when possible. These 3 work together to control hunger.  Fiber physically fills the digestive tract with a lot of zero or at least very low calorie bulk, thus providing literal feelings of fullness that last a long time since it largely is not digestible by humans.  Protein is slow to digest which also goes a long way towards feelings of fullness that last a long time. Fats (I believe any fats but of course you want to target the healthy ones) interact with our hormones in some way which helps to regulate hunger.  I understand this third one less well but it's documented science, just don't ask me to explain the details!

One of the reasons why low carb diets work is because it's very hard to overeat if the only carbs you consume are fiber (which doesn't count for tracking low carbs).  You're left with protein, fats, and fiber, so you feel full. You may still have cravings for sweets or other carb laden foods, but at least hunger is out of the way.

Some other things that can suppress appetite are caffeine (this is why people are saying coffee is filling) and other stimulants, and also exercise.  Exercise can be a mixed bag because if you're burning more calories your body will want more calories. I believe most find it to overall be beneficial, though, even before you consider the other health benefits. It will tend to suppress appetite for at least a few hours after any moderate or higher workout.  A lot of people find they can eat breakfast, have a brisk walk or other workout for lunch, and not be hungry until dinner.  It's a lot easier to stick to 1200 if you're only eating 2 meals/day and don't feel hungry!",1733011320.0

Alternatively, if you air dry your hair now, an easy way to get some lift at the roots is to blow dry them while hanging your head upside down. You seem to have a lot of layers though so unless you want the 90s flips at the end I suggest just doing the roots or investing in a good boar bristle round brush to smooth out the bangs/ends if you do this technique 

Agree with comment that suggested good support bras. They’re lifesavers for us busty gals. 

If you feel comfortable trying makeup, I’d suggest a brow pencil to fill them in a little but, mascara, a simple powder compact to touch up your nose and chin if you tend to oily spots, and like a balm to start. 

You have good skin (and freckles/moles are super cute!) so doing a lot of makeup, especially when you’re not used to it, would do more harm than good.",1733011320.0

I am someone with a severe anxiety disorder so, needless to say, I was freaking out. But I was also in so much discomfort and pain 24/7 from the fibroid at this point that I knew this had to happen. Maybe your symptoms have not gotten that bad yet but trust me when I say you don’t want to wait til they do. 

Before the surgery they had me put on a gown and I was waiting around in a bed for 2 hours and the best thing ever was they had this tube of heated air inserted into my gown. Ahhh, every girl’s dream. Right before surgery they injected me the “the good stuff” and all my anxiety disappeared so that was great.

I’ll be honest, my recovery was rough as hell that first day waking up out of surgery but now I’m on day 5 and starting to feel so much better (you can go to my profile and read my post on this if you want). 

Just like you, I also suddenly had huge blood clots in my period and that’s how I found out about the fibroid. I knew I had to get this done no matter what and I’m happy I just pushed forward to make things move as fast as possible because now I’m on the other side! The hardest part is done! And best of all, I won’t have any more complications with fibroids, periods, or cervical cancer in my future 😀

Just two scenes after the encounter on the trial (after he gets sprayed by the skunk and then watches the news report about Sevence death) he reads the zine and the viewer is informed about the owls kiss, explaining what that was on the trail (except I think most of us missed that).

Also its more than just oral that you can do to make a girl orgasm, you can literally use toys on them, foreplay, talk dirty to them, you can do so much in making them orgasm and cum before you even put your dick inside them, its literally what I always, I try to find out or ask them what they are into, depending if they are shy or not sure or want to explore, and if they like that I make sure I keep pushing that button until they orgasm before I even put my dick in because they become more sensitive after they've cum once or twice

All your thinking about is shoving your dick and giving oral and think thats all, when later down in line they'll just get bored of you because your just boring as hell in bed, plus I've had girl friends literally rave about getting fuck by 4 or 5 inches before but thats because their partners or whoever they are fucking ask what their turn ons are and do a lot of shit before they put their dick in, and if your wondering why they tell me this its because they feel comfortable talking to me about this because I'm not bashing them constantly, but its not all about just the dick its more than just that, its more about what you do before you put it in",1733011322.0

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Hi - just another person chiming in but I wanted to tell you that what you’re feeling is normal. It’s okay for us to grieve what we once had. I was similiar - small, petite, curvy and got a lot of attention. I gained mostly during the pandemic and during my abusive relationship. In fact, my ex-boyfriend encouraged me to overeat so that I’d become less desirable to other men (he was terrified I’d leave someday - guess what I did anyways lol). On the flip side, I was getting fed up with constant cat-calling, creepy men following me, etc. when I was smaller.. That just doesn’t happen anymore. I have an amazing partner now and he loves me for ME, but he does agree that I looked best at my lowest weight (128-135 lbs ish vs 180 lbs at 5’2)… for me, it was a form of self-soothing through food mostly that led me to keep going and gaining. 

I’m also tired of being the fat friend and I want to go back to how I was before. Idk about you, but you sound young like me. We have time to reverse it. A year from now we could be in a completely different boat. We didn’t gain it overnight so we won’t lose it overnight either, but it’s absolutely possible. I’ve been starting off with small changes - trying to go for walks with my friends/bf/family, eating more protein so I fill up quicker, and ordering smaller iced coffees (I swear I would drink 400 cals every morning and spike my blood sugar to the moon).

I think it’s important that we love our bodies no matter what they look like because of what they do for us. They keep us alive and love us. So we ought to do the same. The thought of Type-2 diabetes has scared me especially since I suffer with insulin resistance from PCOS, so I’m really trying to make lifestyle changes. Even if it’s 1 lb a week, that could be 52 in a year. We got this.",1733011322.0

I don't know what it's like in Russia but let me try to help. Some priorities I would have would be: food, safety, medicine. If you don't think you could provide those for yourself in Russia, you should probably explore your way to get out of the country. 

If you can't get out of the country, I guess I have more questions. It sounds like you have a job but you're concerned for your safety and aren't sure your medications will be there for longer. 

What meds do you take? Which ones are you afraid of losing access to? Do you take pills or injections for estradiol? Do you take a testosterone blocker? I can see if there are ways to do it yourself, a woman from Poland used to send compounding ingredients to make your own injectable estradiol.

Як ви в очі хоч одній такій людині подивитись і скажете про Зеленського, вам між очі плюнуть, майте якусь совість таке говорити.

Зеленський виконував свої базові функції, вийшов на робоче місце і продовжив працювати. Це той мінімум яким будь який працівник (!президент) мав виконати, а не те за що його зелені величають, верховного лідера сучасного Наполеона БоНеВтіка.

if I'm to give any advice, it'd only be to be smart with the resources you are lucky enough to have.  you now have a freedom of choice many people don't given your potential for stability without having to constantly work your butt off for it.   

I've designed my life to have minimal financial obligations, I've been successful in being able to do the things I value and have wanted to / found meaningful, but those things have not brought financial success.  Despite that, I am self employed now and can go for a long time with little incoming finances during slow periods due to my minimal expenses.   this allows me time to explore my hobbies and interests.

Take a bone in leg of lamb and debone it and butterfly it.

Then mix:

* 2/3 cup olive oil
* 1/3 cup lemon juice
* 2 tbs salt
* 2 tbs smokey paprika
* 2 tsp ground cardamon
* heaps of garlic (i use like 12 cloves or more)
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp ground ginger
* 2 tsp turmeric.

Mix all together and throw into a ziplock bag with the lamb and leave it over night.

Ideally now you want to cook over coals if you can.  Get your grill hot and cook the lamb fat side down until it's nicely marked.  Usually about 10-12 minutes.  Now change to indirect heat, with a target of around 170c and grill the lamb fat side up until the internal temp is 52c.  Now for the next 20 - 30 minutes baste the lamb every 5 minutes with the left over marinade until your internal temp is 57c.  Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 10 mins.

(not talking about a weight\_ed\_ belt or vest BTW)

The flags that make up the UK are not directly linked to monarchy, which has its own flags that are rarely flown in Britain, let alone their other kingdoms. The flags of the UK being in the other kingdoms' flags are there to show unity/kinship, not dominance.

Besides, historically, at least, these flags have actually symbolised the *separateness* of the Commonwealth from the UK. Separate but connected. Loyal but free. Commonwealth family. That is the idea, at least.

Canada only got rid of it because of Pierre Trudeau, and the Quebecois always throwing hissy fits. Unless the Aussie and Kiwi flags decide to try and incorporate a mix of both Britishness and indigenousness into their potential new flags, I see no reason why they should change it. Heck, at that point, why not have a co-king system? Isn't there a big indigenous monarchist movement in New Zealand or something? Make the Maori monarch official if they want it.",1733011326.0

My hunch is that they might have already seen the shit humans do to themselves, each other, and our home (Earth) first hand and want no part of us. Or maybe they've seen us and think we're easy pickings and the calvary is inbound.

If the electrical is the only major issue with the property, I probably wouldn't consider a deal breaker unless you have other choices that are sufficiently well vetted and whatever the trade-off is is more tolerable. 

I want to approach this from the perspective that the buyer makes no concession because they're selling as is and there's no material defect, the seller is selling an old house and you as the buyer are buying an old house. 

You're on the right path, to assume that some electrical upgrades are going to be needed on a near-term or immediate basis. 

Counting the number of receptacles in the rooms as the basis for getting a price for redoing things is not correct. If the rooms are going to be rewired, they need to be brought up to current code, that means the number of receptacles based on the dimensions and details of the floor plan is the correct way to do it as a code minimum, never mind adding a few more for optimized layout and convenience. 

A bit of wisdom, if this is a two-story structure, usually the first floor lighting is tied in with second floor receptacles, make the assumption that there's more work to be done then what meets the eye. 

**ADVICE:**  
The minimum scope of work that I would recommend: 

1. New 15 amp circuit to the attic, for lighting in the attic, second floor rooms. Get the new attic lights installed now, facilitate seeing more easily what one is working on up in the attic. 
2. If the house does not already have a hardwired smoke alarm circuit, add one. 14/3 needs to be ran from a smoke alarm in the basement up to the attic, to cover the smoke alarms on the second floor. 
3. One new 20A receptacle circuit per bedroom and per bathroom. Also one for the hallway. (The reason for having the hallway receptacles on another circuit separate from the bedrooms is because of the window air conditioners).
4. Each room to have one or two receptacles installed on the new circuit. (At your discretion, budget permitting, and scope of work in terms of cosmetics etc ... Determines whether you're simply having a new circuit pulled up to each room with one maybe two new receptacles versus you're having the full room rewired and brought up the current specifications. If budget is a constraint, then maybe you take a more conservative approach for the time being, and if you have renovations in mind for a future date, that would be the time that you address the more invasive work of having the full room rewired and complete compliment of receptacles installed, lighting rewired, etc. 
5. If there are any rooms that you wish to have a ceiling fan installed, plan to have new wiring installed for it, on the lighting circuit. 
6. I advise against trying to do much work with the existing knob and tube wiring so far as eradicating it unless you are sufficiently prepared budgetary and scope of work wise to have the house torn up pulling out and replacing all the knob and tube wiring and bringing everything up to par. It's going to be a big undertaking, and if you're already at the top of your budget, that's probably not a reality at the moment.

Personally I hate spending time in and around the CBD and much prefer exploring the rest of the state, it might be worthwhile spending a day or two in the city but you won't need any more time than that if you're not overly interested in exploring the CBD. The benefit of staying in the CBD is that Melbourne is pretty centrally located relative to the rest of the state so that it's easier to drive to all corners of the state.

Just a general list of natural attractions and interesting places: Great Ocean Road/Otways, Great Alpine Road/Alpine National Park, Grampians, Wilsons Prom, Walhalla, Dandenong Ranges, Yarra Ranges, Phillip Island. There's plenty of other amazing places around the state but hopefully it's a good starting point to see which areas you're most interested in",1733011327.0

"ADHD_Programmers","t5_2w9w4","My advice is don’t start from the beginning, start from the end. For example, say you’re making a movie start with you just saw the movie and you’re telling somebody what you just saw. What was the most exciting part? Why should this person see it or if it’s a project different than a movie? What is the Takeaway? What do you want people to be left with after consuming the results of your project? 

From here, I progressively refine they already completed project. Again as a movie, I might add more detail to my explanation of the movie. I just saw with a clear beginning middle and end then I might add a scene that introduces a character. Eventually, I get to a level of detail that I’m describing shots in an edit maybe just with white text over black background initial initially. Title cards.

The point is, at any given moment in time I’m always working with a finished product that just lacks detail. If I fail to do as much work as I had hoped, I will still have a finished product just a little less resolved.

Working backwards to front is more interesting I think for people with ADHD. It gives you a guide for what to do next because it will be obvious from a supposedly finished thing what is missing.

* **[Mounjaro.com](https://www.mounjaro.com/).** Many common questions can be answered straight from the source. These include questions about how/where to administer injections, proper storage instructions, traveling with your pens, most answers to “Is this normal?” questions, and how the manufacturer savings card program works.

* **Past threads.** r/Mounjaro has tons of discussion threads that are likely to have answers to many questions. There's a [handy search function](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/search?&restrict_sr=on), and you can also use Google to search this Reddit by typing ""site:reddit.com” after your search topic.

* **Your health care provider.** Remember that you should NEVER rely on strangers on the internet for medical advice. If you want to understand if Mounjaro is right for you, or if the side effect you're feeling is cause for alarm, talk to your doctor, not Reddit!

I wouldn't power level straight to 100, your first time reaching the max. If you want to powerlevel to grow the skill as far as the next perk, I don't see harm in that.

Two handed and Conjuration grow well together. Summon Frost/Storm Atronach. Summon Bound Axe. (Mystic Binding perk) Each swing to the summon gives 2 handed experience. 4 hits to the summon gives Conjuration XP for both the conjured axe and Atronach. Repeat to keep growing the skills.

From previous experience with new cars, I knew to get mudflaps, paint protection film, & tint. I put the mudflaps (Mabett) on in the dealer lot because I had to drive 25 miles home, hah. I also got the SAS flairs instead of keeping the stock non SAS width ones. I prefer the look and they protect better with the more aggressive tires on the Badlands.

I did full body PPF ($$$), but I would recommend at least getting the front end (including lights) and the lower half of the doors done -- that will be a lot cheaper.

I made sure my insurance covers windshield, because these windshields being so flat and upright makes them prime targets for rock chips and breaks and they are \~1,000 to replace due to all the electronic crap these days.",1733011329.0

"LesbianGamers","t5_2rhx6","Sexuality is never truly a clear cut thing, especially in a world where people are actively working to deconstruct mainstream gender roles/presentation. Some people put a lot of work into understanding themselves and what they’re attracted to, while others don’t take the time to understand and define their attractions. For some people, it’s all about the parts, others, the presentation, and others, the personality.

I’m a transmasc individual (unable to medically transition due to health problems, but naturally appear very androgynous, and occasionally masculine if I put the effort in) engaged to a cis”het” man. Similarly to your partner, he says I’m the only man he’d date. He grew up in a very homophobic environment and never got the opportunity to explore his sexuality, so he still thinks of himself as straight despite feeling attraction towards male/androgynous characteristics. He finds feminine men and fluid nonbinary/intersex people attractive, but doesn’t feel comfortable labelling himself as anything other than straight. His lack of defined attraction to certain sexes/genders has no real impact on our relationship because he’s attracted to me, and understands that I’m not female, as his sexuality label would imply.

Attraction is a very personal thing, and how your partner feels attraction is personal to your relationship. Whether your partner is homocurious, bisexual, demisexual, questioning, or something else, it’s entirely between you two to discuss what impact it will have on your relationship. I would suggest having a serious conversation with her about her feelings towards you in comparison to how she feels about her usual attractions (men).",1733011330.0

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","So I have fairly upsetting motion sickness. First thing to know is, not everyone is the same. What works for some won't work for another. However, I will tell you what works for me.

No headbobbing. I simply cannot.

No wobbling screen. If a game makes the screen warp or wobble, no can do. I can go through and ender portal on Minecraft if I look away as it is happening, though I recently learned you can turn that off which is awesome. I cannot play Amnesia the Dark Descent because the ""sanity"" effect kills me.

No motion blur for me, thanks. If I'm speedy for some reason and you have to show that by blurring things, I can't play.

Same for extending the field of view. Leave it as it is and don't adjust it please. My Minecraft FOV was very carefully chosen, and I have fears if it is ever adjusted at all I may never be able to fix it, and then might not ever be able to play again.

Also, no adjusting the screen size while I'm playing. That'll kick me off. I really only had that happen once with a game in early access, which has now released a full game and no longer does that, so I don't think it is much of a problem, but it was one I was kind of surprised by when it happened. 

I also mostly play windowed with some screen around the window visible, if that can be an option at all. I don't know why it helps, I just know it does. I can play full screen dedicated games, but for shorter time periods. With a windowed screen, I can play longer before it bothers me.

I also have to have my mouse settings turned all the way down, like to the point where if you turned it down further your mouse wouldn't work. It makes movement slow and ponderous, but also feels very intentional, and I think it is the intentionality that works for me here. Feeling like I am turning a very heavily loaded tank makes me really focus on turning, and my brain has time to keep up. Yes my arm moves very far when I play Minecraft and I have to turn. But it is either that, or not play at all. So it is what it is.",1733011331.0

Generally there is a lot of companies paying big money whether they are visible or not (there is a lot of talk about faang where market makers pay a looooot more) and you can strike big in startups. 

But most of the time the pay of the swe is on par with any other eng or any other office job just because it doesnt require any supernatural skills despite what job postings would tell you.

The oversaturation is felt because most of the people aim very high and it feels that its common to be overqualified for many job postings. It may stem from that many people in CS are very ambitious. But there is still a demand for a lower paying jobs - no one seems to care (and it's totally fine).

To be fair, I’m kind of a Lizardmen main, so it shouldn’t be that surprising to hear that my favorite is a Scaley Boi, but straight up Nakai is just a good time. You don’t have to worry about the proper pace of growth, or building settlements, or complicated diplomacy; just recruit a bunch of giant, angry crocodiles with mauls for fists and go punch stuff really hard. And if that doesn’t do the trick, punch it harder.

Also, and genuinely this is my favorite part: he gives Kroxigors oodles of missile resistance, 10% ward save AoE effect, and 5% ward save through his faction effects, so with an Engine of the Gods it’s entirely reasonable to have your entire stack wade into the fight with 20% ward save, stupid high magical melee attacks, and tons of missile resistance, so that with a decent Skink Oracle your army is nigh on invincible. I’ve taken on 4 full stacks of late game chaos with just Nakai, a couple of heroes, and his wall of thumpers and chompers, and come out of it losing maybe one or two MODELS total.

So yeah, highly recommend Nakai.",1733011331.0

"ChatGPT","t5_7hqomg","Legal Analysis Updated - OpenAI/Altman vs. Musk Litigation with Expanded Political Context:

Despite concerns about political contributions and connections, I assess a 70-75% probability of fair proceedings based on these factors:

1. Institutional Safeguards
- Federal judicial system's structural independence
- Multiple levels of appellate review
- Strong precedent in corporate law cases
- Public and media scrutiny serving as external checks

2. Case-Specific Strengths
- Well-documented business transactions
- Clear contractual paper trails
- Strong evidentiary standards
- Multiple jurisdiction options

""While political donations and connections (like Musk's contributions to various campaigns and Pam Bondi's ties) might raise eyebrows, major corporate litigation typically operates within strict legal guardrails. The case will likely focus on documented evidence, contractual obligations, and established business law principles. Multiple appeals courts, mandatory judicial ethics rules, and intense public scrutiny provide significant protection against bias. Even in cases where trial judges have shown potential favoritism, higher courts have consistently demonstrated willingness to overturn problematic rulings.

The high-profile nature of this case, involving leading AI technology and substantial public interest, means proceedings will face unprecedented scrutiny from legal experts, media, and the tech community. This transparency, combined with OpenAI's substantial legal resources and access to top corporate law expertise, creates strong systemic pressure for adherence to established legal standards regardless of political affiliations.""",1733011332.0
"UCD","t5_2sp9z","I study actuary , Financial Maths is most certainly not better.  Please don’t be fooled by the idea that you have to do the exams after and work as an actuary . Anything you can do with a financial maths degree you can do with BAFS , this is not the case the other way around. As much as I hate the idea of prestige , BAFS is better regarded and the 6 month Intra internship in 3rd is huge and financial maths doesn’t have this. ( For reference you don’t have to do this placement as an actuary ). Also we do a good few of our modules with the year of financial maths ahead of us .

"toronto","t5_2qi63","Simple rule.. Legally speaking if you are making a turn across traffic or to merge into traffic you're responsible and liable for any faults, unless you can show the other party did something that is against the HTA..  
  
As described in the link with data: left, right and close passes are all liability of the driver. 

Making a right at an intersection make the driver at fault for failing to make sure they're clear to merge.

Making a left across traffic make the driver liable to make sure the coast is clear as thru traffic has the right of way. 

Failing to maintain a safe distance (close passes) are the liability of the driver over taking to ensure they can safely do so.

There really isn't much ambiguity in that, same pattern emerges when you look at the pedestrian data. And yes both pedestrians and cyclists have a higher percentage of ""at fault"" red light running causing fatality than the drivers. And that needs to be addressed. But driver are by a much much much wider margin reasonable for fatalities at intersections with their dangerous maneuvers.",1733011332.0

"FollowJesusObeyTorah","t5_7xydj0","I celebrate Christmas, but I do have a menorah up for Hanukkah. The thing is a lot of HR or Messianics will go into this whole spiel about it all being pagan. If everything is pagan then nothing is. 

Also, some say the Star of David is the star of Remphan mentioned in Amos & Acts. If that is true (we don’t know 100% either way), then Hanukkah could be linked to Saturnalia. Look at the 1119 episode about the Star of David. Hanukkah fits the timeframe as well for matching Saturnalia whereas Christmas actually does not. 

Lastly, Deuteronomy is about temple worship (ties to Saturnalia pagan temple & Hanukkah the biblical temple). However, Christmas is not about that at all. 

In the end, I think everyone needs to calm down. Everyone has to work out their salvation with fear and trembling.",1733011333.0

"opiniaoimpopular","t5_50qq3m","O senso comum tende a simplificar a vida das pessoas e oferecer uma sensação de pertencimento. As pessoas em geral, preferem consumir ideias, produtos ou entretenimento que sejam acessíveis e amplamente aceitos, porque isso os faz sentir parte de algo maior. A busca por validação social é um comportamento humano básico, profundamente enraizado no desejo de aceitação e medo da rejeição. Ser diferente, ter opiniões e gostos originais, exige ir contra o que é socialmente imposto como ""normal"". E isso não é fácil.

Ser autêntico requer autoconfiança e uma baixa necessidade de validação (não se importar com o que os outros pensam). Mas a grande parte das pessoas é insegura e prefere evitar o risco de serem rejeitadas, ou vistas como diferentes, justamente por medo da opinião alheia. A religião, por exemplo, muitas vezes se estrutura em torno desse mesmo princípio: oferece uma narrativa comum, regras claras e pertencimento comunitário, simplificando as incertezas da vida, e dando um sentido para algo que pode simplesmente não ter nenhum sentido, mas isso seria ""assustador"" demais.

No entretenimento, o padrão não é diferente. Filmes e produtos culturais que exigem reflexão ou promovem um engrandecimento intelectual tendem a ser menos consumidos porque podem gerar desconforto. Quando algo é complexo demais, há o risco de a pessoa não entender e se sentir inferior, o que desafia seu senso de autoestima e a validação dos seus hábitos. Então, a preferência por conteúdos leves e superficiais reflete um ciclo onde a distração rasa é mais reconfortante do que o esforço de confrontar ideias que poderiam colocar seu estilo de vida em xeque e te obrigar a se aceitar como diferentes dos demais. Isso funciona pra tudo, musica, cinema, moda, política, religião...",1733011333.0

"InternationalStudents","t5_3ft4q","Hello. I work at a university in the UK and I would really recommend that you go to your university's Student Services department and explain your financial concerns. They will want to do everything possible to help you, as they will want to avoid students dropping out due to financial problems. So I would recommend you go to Student Services / Student Support (it's called different things at different unis), and they should definitely give you some advice.

Secondly - your university should also have a Careers/Placements department, and perhaps even a 'Job Shop' for advertising part time work. I would book an appointment with the Careers team and ask for their help in finding part time work.

Another option is to reach out to the University's international office / marketing department. As an international student there will be lots of ways you could offer to work for them, e.g providing testimonials, speaking to other international applicants. Does your university have Unibuddy or The Ambassador Platform on their website? This is a great way of making extra money because if you can ask your university to make you a Unibuddy ambassador, the work involves replying to applicant messages via an app and getting paid for it. So you should definitely ask your international / marketing team about this.

Finally - does your university have a ""Student Projects Office"" - some universities have these, where students work helping departments across the university with various projects. (If you're not sure if your uni has this, then you could ask your personal tutor?) Good luck to you!! I'm sure you'll work something out.",1733011333.0

"NameCheap","t5_2wl37","Hello, I would ask that you contact PayPal and find out what is happening. This does not sound like a matter under our control if PayPal is refusing to accept your money.

There have been hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of domains sold on our marketplace. If this issue is was ubitquous as you claim, there would be a lot of posts about it. I've been at Namecheap for 15 years and I've never seen a single complaint, which means there may be a specific issue that is specific to your account. Rather than assuming we do not pay out, please investigate the matter more thoroughy with your bank and/or follow the guidance provided by support. We are not legally allowed to hold money that isn't ours. 

Closing comments, as this is false claim and a specific customer issue. You can and should continue to work with support. I also ask that you please refer to rules #4 and #6. I am sorry for the issues that are occurring, but this is not the right venue for making claims that are due to an account matter and saying that it applies to all accounts. In the last 24 hours, this post has had been replied to by me and nearly 500 views (yes, as a moderator, I can see that), which I assume means anyone using our marketplace has been appropriately paid as they have nothing else to add.",1733011333.0

Had they signed an additional high quality big to play next to Vooch instead of playing 4-guards and us being undersized for years, we would’ve seen a much better stretch for Zach under Billy Donovan. 

I think AKME has failed in that regard and waited a year too long to move Demar. I love Demar btw, just never felt he was a good fit with Zach although he did make the roster more talented.",1733011334.0

"larrystylinson","t5_2uptu","In a nut shell, if they're bound by certain 360 contract restrictions for a set number of years, or, heaven forbid, in perpetuity, coming out could mean losing a ton of money for both of them. Those contracts, and we saw a peek at them when SC was starting his new find a boy band show. They literally state they own your public image (in part created), whether it be photos, merchandise, clothing lines you represent, jewelry, etc, etc. To break contracts would end royalties and penalties, possibly requiring them to reimburse Syco. So many entertainers have come out against them because it's their music, their voice, their face yet they're working the front half of their contacts to pay back touring, recording, advertising, etc and so on. In instances when they do come out, they've not been in the public eye much, so the income stream has pretty much dried up, and they've been released or fulfilled their contractual obligations. Not so with Louis and Harry. I believe they are together (but at times, I admit I question my sanity), living a private quie life surrounded by family and friends who are very protective of them. Obviously, if one came out, then what? The media would speculate relationship after relationship, like they do with Harry. Note - Louis may have been released since Freddie (that's another story), as he's not been linked with a gf in a long time. While Harry gets 12 to 24 month relationships. Some seem genuinely fun, friendly, and even affectionate, unlike the last with TR, which  seemed to me (no offense to anyone) seemed awkward and strained 90% of the time. (Like when Timotee C and Kendall J were supposed to be this hot item. It was WAY too forced.)

Okay, though, if you don't like the number of 100 million killed, that's fine. The exact number isn't even important. 

The reason why capitalism absolutely shattered communism on the global stage is what it has given humanity, not what it has taken away. 

Communism offers no rewards for innovation, which is why those countries always got left in the dust. Nowhere is this more clear than in north and south Korea. It was an incredible experiment. A simple line on a map divided two different ideologies. On one side of the map you have tyranny, repression, forced labour, an almost non existent economy that has lead to starvation, and economic stagnancy. On the other side you have democracy and capitalism, one of the premier innovate countries on the planet. Very wealthy and purposeful. A great aide to the development of mankind. One country you have to build walls to keep people out, and the other, walls to keep people in. 

I'll say again, most people on this earth would not be alive without the green and industrial revolution, which are undoubtedly the byproducts of innovations created in capitalist countries. 

What has communism contributed to easing the suffering of mankind? Why did formerly communist countries all collapse? Why does nobody want to do communism anymore? Can you give me one example of communism working in the real world?",1733011334.0

"beatles","t5_2qt7l","The restoration generally looks good; although you can see some AI upscaling going on, they managed to keep it natural enough by not removing the grain detail like they did for “Get Back”. Especially the live performances all sounded and looked great. I liked the alternate angles and some behind the scenes to classic New York photo shoots. I just love to see previously unreleased footage of the band, it’s clear that the reason it’s been kept unreleased is that most of it is quite dull, but I don’t care. The more, the better. 

But that’s about as far as my pros list goes. All in all, I’m very disappointed with this documentary. Way too many of the stories featured in the talking heads have nothing at all to do with the band’s invasion of America. Random clips are often thrown in without explanation, like late interviews where the members talk about unrelated subjects, or that moment towards the end where they suddenly cut to Leonard Bernstein analysing “She Said She Said” (??). Jack Douglas causing commotion in Liverpool in 1965, and the payoff of the story being that he became John’s engineer years later, is completely out of place here. Yet he’s given so much talking time, I mean, it’s an interesting story but not in this context. 

I’m mainly confused about what’s really being documented in this documentary. Very little context is presented at all. Had they done like “Get Back”, where they make it clear what date it is and what the band is set to do, it would’ve made the purpose much clearer. The way they made it, it’s just a collection of seemingly random clips of varying entertainment quality. 

Another matter of complaint is that whoever cut the footage doesn’t seem to have any connection to the fandom whatsoever. The clips we already know and love are time and time again cut off when the fan favourite part is about to come. “We ain’t written no poetry”, Ringo dancing to the radio, Ringo and Paul abruptly resolving their fight about who should be on camera etc. 

The original documentary covered it the best, with Ron Howard’s “Eight Days A Week” as a good complement. This feels superfluous; like an attempt at riding on the success of “Get Back”. Did we really need to see Paul retell the exact same anecdotes for the trillionth time, especially when we know a restored version of the Anthology series is coming soon enough? Nice to see Ringo being unusually sharp and clear in his memories though, and seeing his collection of the original 60’s outfits was a blast.",1733011335.0

如果你仅仅是想锻炼阅读和写作，可以考虑去Steam加一个看上去像是女生的人的好友，因为女生一般不会坏心眼教你错误的词语，同时大概率她们更喜欢交流学习，那样的话你有什么不懂的可以直接询问对方，能够得到更准确一些的回答。
至于Discord，大部分不会用VPN的中国人无法使用，他们更常用QQ和WeChat，日常还可以用WeChat进行购物支付，我和我的外国友人就是用Discord进行日常聊天，不过有的时候这个软件可能会吞掉消息。之所以最终决定用Discord是因为我和对方都把其他软件尽量尝试了一下，但是韦恩图的交集真的很小，只有Steam、Discord和发送email可以普通注册然后交流，其他的软件要么对方无法通过验证注册，要么我因为中国大陆的手机号而无法注册……",1733011335.0

A lot I think has to do with the lack of sleep and what my body and mind are going through. 

I will say I have an amazing therapist and I’m also in a women’s group Zoom therapy once per week. It’s not cancer related. I come here for that. But the mental health therapy and meds have been a huge part of my treatment. (I had those issues before this anyways)

Sometimes it’s just reminding myself that I will outlive this and that worrying is only going to make my stress worse and the cancer worse. I’ve taken to watching Hallmark movies a lot. Try to do anything but allow myself to Google or allow the “worst case scenarios” into my head. But also giving myself grace to cry when I need to and mourn what I’ve already lost and will lose. 

Feel free to dm if you need anything. Here for you, you’re not going through this alone. And I even almost cried when my chemo ended because it is one step closer to the unknown of being done with treatment. 🥴

A common stereotype of UCSD is that it’s antisocial. I don’t go there (hopefully I will get in) so I’m not sure how antisocial it is. But like any school, it all depends on your friend circle. 

UCSB is often thought of is the opposite: it’s a party school. It’s on the beach, great weather, lots of concerts and raves, Greek life etc. But it still depends on your friend circle. Are they more lowkey? do they party? do they ever leave their rooms?

"PetDoves","t5_2wwhl","They are very non aggressive.

It is very, very rare they ever do any of these to me. And it is usually only the males I see doing this, the females are even more docile.

Actually, another natural defense is to sit very still. In nature, this would be to hopefully go unnoticed by a predator until they pass by. Kinda the exact opposite of the other things. Realistically they couldn't hurt you even if they wanted, and I assure you they don't.

Transgender people have been treated since the 50's.  Christians only noticed it recently while they were looking for another angle to the culture wars that they are waging against the world.

"Bumble","t5_3531l","I did. We met up and shopped for aquarium supplies then he took me to a restaurant for dinner. I didn’t visit his house. 

It was nice. Conversation was okay. I told him straight away about the lying not being cool and he was very apologetic. He talked about being rejected in the past for his circumstances but promised to never lie again. 

While it was nice of him to buy dinner and the meeting went alright I don’t know if I’m interested in being friends or anything more, I think he’s a bit clingy for so early on. He overthinks more than me as well and I overthink a lot. He sort of rambles in texts and I get overwhelmed by the amount of text there is to read.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Here's where I'm at:

The shtick with wanting to plant your flag on the opponent's 50 yard line? I don't think you should expect the home team to allow you to do that. It's the type of celebration that is specifically trying to cross that line of just celebrating that you won into rubbing it in your opponents face.

So no, I don't think the visiting team has some sort of inalienable right to go deface their opponent's logo. I think it's absolutely expected - and warranted - for the home team to go put an end to it. They're not in their own stadium - they don't get to make the rules as to what they want to do with the field.

If that escalates into a fight, it is what it is - Michigan knew what it was doing by planting the flag. It was not an innocuous act of celebration, it's literally ""we're planting our flag on your logo"". Both sides are wrong, and both sides bear responsibility in what happened.

This whole ""they should have had that fight during the game"" argument? Nonsense. By that logic if you lose the football game and the other team comes to insult you, you should just say ""oh man, you're right - good game, we'll try better next time"".

my point is how you feed your baby doesn’t determine how much you love your baby. it is okay to be selfish in motherhood, sometimes it makes you a better mother. you knew that mentally it would’ve been so hard to breastfeed and you wanted to be as back to normal as you could so you could be the best mom possible and that’s all that matters. your child is fed, loved, and safe. in 5 years, they won’t care how you fed them as baby, they’ll care if you’re making chicken nuggets or speghetti for dinner.",1733011340.0

My suggestion is that the app switcher should only show apps that are actually active or have been recently used. 

No one is using the app switcher to go and find an app they were using 8 days ago. 

My point is that perhaps Apple should rethink the role and design of the app switcher.

Do not assume others do not have higher level learning skills than yourself.

astounding assumption.

I have done it for 5 programming languages and never once got overwhelmed , and I am very average, (no I don't actively program, or have ever been anywhere near expert, in any language), but found it quite a revelation to discover all the functions available as a newbie during the first language learning process, and repeated the same process with each language I dabbled with over the years, for uni, or work, or a personal project.

As you go through mark the functions that make sense or are of interest or that you believe will help.

But if you never know, you will never know.

"GreatnessOfWrestling","t5_4cindo","I think the issue is more a bit of growing pains, as the characters go from being unrealistic caricatures to more humanized roles.  Developing connections that way takes more time, but tend to be deeper, which translates into deeper, long-term fans that drive most of a promotion’s revenue.

That said, my favorite wrestlers have been the ones that have been driven by more realistic motives (Zayn’s evolution from the mistakes made with selling out to the Bloodline, Owens’ flawed logic that rationalizes his selfishness as selflessness, Ciampa’s cyclical corruption).  Hell, even the SpOoOOpy Wyatt Sucks’ foundational motivation is a shared experience of alienation from being different, which is something to which all of us wrestle-weirdos can relate!",1733011340.0

I myself am a marginalized person.  I'm blind.  I have literally had a woman tell me that she would not rent to me because all she had were second story units and blind people can't safely walk up and down a flight of stairs.

Even so, I wouldn't dare to compare my struggle to the struggle of black people like Dr. King.  Because there just ain't no comparison between ""some idiot won't rent to me, but a bunch of other people sure will"" and ""police might well murder me.""

And from where I'm sitting, as a guy who knows history and has faced discrimination over the years himself, I see transgender people arguing about pronouns and bathrooms and the right of ""transgender"" children to permanently alter their bodies, and I'm like ""I can't even.""  Someone called you the wrong pronoun?  Try being refused a roof over your head.

Oh and the bathroom thing?  I was assaulted in a boy's bathroom by another boy when I was 8.  I don't call it sexual assault, because there damned sure wasn't anything sexual about it.  I don't care whether I'm in a bathroom labeled ""men's"" or a bathroom labeled ""women's.""  I want to be in a single-occupancy bathroom where I can do my business in privacy.

And let's talk about women.  There was a time that they couldn't even have bank accounts.  And now, they're being told that they have to accept biologically male folks -- even ones with external male reproductive organs -- into their women's only spaces?  Some of them are pissed, and I don't blame them for it.

"halo","t5_2qixk","Ok first off: your argument that the UNSC is the grounded part versus the insanity that the rest brings is a good one. It separates the ridiculousness of the rest of Halo from the UNSC. Somewhat.

Halo is pretty consistently inconsistent. Like Flood vulnerabilities, the way things are retconned constantly (see for example John's fight against ODST's or first contact), the size of ships, the power amd capabilities of species, the capabilities of weapons, people and aliens, how nukes work and the power they have, how those Jackal shields work* etc.

The Flood used to make sense, they literally did! They would kill prey, gather bodies, attach popcorn to it which had the means to take control of the vitals of the body and repair it, then control the body. Then it would take time to learn how to control it so at first it's shambling and as it learns more it becomes more adept at moving and will be able to operate items using the remaining knowledge of the host until eventually it is fully capable and grown. Because during this time the popcorn grows attached more and more until it's literally melded into the body. Also some of the bodies were consumed in the process as these alterations cost a ton of biomass.

Now however a single spore can infect you and turn you into Flood in seconds, download all the knowledge it needs to identify who's who and what needs to be done telepathically and get to it. Just the ability to change a body so fast requires your blood to be pumped faster than a bullet, you'd use a few hundred kilo's worth of biomass energy in that time which would mostly be converted into heat, enough heat in such a short time to be called a detonation. Ignoring those physics, since they can alter a body so fast into what they want it to be they should also be able to heal at that rate. A bulletwound would already have healed the entrywound by the time the bullet exits the body.


And yes I am arguing for weapon prototypes at the beginning of the war. Prototypes for Spartans and MJOLNIR were on the table and those are far more advanced and expensive tech than making decent enough prototypes for field testing of railgun weapons would. And no I'm not arguing that the UNSC would do this with shielding in mind. Railgun =/= superpowerful weapon. If you can make a handheld railgun, or in this case a mounted anti-materiel rifle, you have the capacity to make a smaller portable version that fires shots at AR power.   Hey the advantages of a railgun, but the firepower of an AR. I don't need to argue that they were designing for shields, they can and would design these for regular human combat as well. Considering it was out of prototype phase, it would have been childsplay compared to the MJOLNIR program to make effective weapons out of them that simply fired existing rounds at their regular velocities.

*this is so weird. One of the reasons why the UNSC does not use them is apparently because there's spots in the shields that if you look at blind you to what's beyond. *the entire MO of the shield is to look through it by a species with the most sensitive eyes*. Besides that Spartan III's are taught and encouraged to find and use these things ASAP.",1733011340.0

If you are spinning, this probably means you haven't quite mastered the car/track combo well enough and therefore are driving too close to your limit on each lap. The problem with driving too close to your limit is that you have nothing spare in your back pocket to pull out when you need to avoid an incident.

My advice is to 1. Stop having the odd spin. Learn the car/track combo better so that spins simply don't happen. 2. Drive within yourself. You can't treat each lap as a qualifying lap. It's too risky. Be more content with driving slower if doing so means you can keep the car on the track and avoid other people's incidents more.",1733011341.0

OP is likely going to go on Tret, and I will not be name-calling over it or saying anything to be rude to them ... but I don't feel comfortable participating in what I strongly feel is BDD.  I see it as feeding someone's disease.   
  
I am still waiting to see actual marionette lines on a 26 yo (who didn't have a specific skin condition causing it). Every person who posted pictures of fine lines in their 20s didn't have fine lines and needed more moisture or hydration.  I wish that OP would have said ''OK.  I'll try this, and if it doesn't work, I'm going to Tret.  I don't see the point in using the nuclear option when something without adverse effects could fix the issue. I think OP knows deep down that they are not marionette lines (they likely had these all their lives or lost/gained weight, which can change facial fat distribution) because I don't see how intrusive it is to send me a picture where everything but the marionette lines are blurred.  I get thousands of images each year from people who don't block a thing after chatting with me for a while and realizing that I wouldn't ever betray them.   So many of them have accepted that the human body isn't perfectly symmetrical.  That fat distribution is never going to be 100% perfect.  We need some skin folds to show emotions, or our faces will crack/rip open.

This is my first time saying ''I'm not going to help'' to someone in this sub, and I explained my reasons why.  I received two types of messages since a) people backing me up but preferring not to speak up and b) people who think I'm an a-hole.  If I wanted to be an a-hole, I wouldn't have offered other solutions or apologized to OP for using a term I shouldn't have used (I didn't mean it negatively, but it was infantilizing, and I recognized it and apologized!).  I wouldn't have offered the best retinol OTC to prep OP's skin for when they are 30 and when it's a bit saner to start Tret for well-ageing.  I'm not too fond of the term anti-ageing because none of us will ever achieve that.  Ask Bryan Johnson.  I do not regret anything else other than the use of ''sweetheart'', which I used to show care, but soon realized that it would never pass as care, and I do deeply apologize for that one and will not be doing it again.",1733011341.0

Having said that, I do know that groceries and food in Thailand are very affordable - you can get decent meals for just a couple of dollars.

The same goes for accommodation, especially if you’re staying at a gym. Many gyms offer accommodation that’s significantly cheaper than hotels.

I’m far from reaching the level required for a fight, but I’ve heard from other foreigners that the earnings from a fight typically range between $50 and $200. However, others with more experience would be more qualified to speak on this topic.

As for the duration of your stay in Thailand, it really depends on your passport. With mine, I was allowed to stay for two months.

In a nutshell, it’s very affordable compared to most other countries and a great experience!",1733011342.0

"therealworld","t5_2rkm3","So kind of you to ask! After some thought i would go:

1.	⁠Heather: Seems like a genuinely nice girl (almost to a fault) who stays out of drama, is very supportive of everyone at their lowest (gives Adam a disappointed Mom lecture when he’s sleeping on the job after punching through the wall, tells Dustin she’ll always support him as a friend after he lied to her, seems like a very good friend to Naomi especially when she has a pregnancy scare etc), and consistently adds some positivity to a pretty bleak season.

2.	⁠Naomi: She would be my number one if she hadn’t tried to pull that trick a** b**** Cookie outside but she’s a real bright spot of this season. She’s hilarious and I think would easily be the most fun hang of anyone on the cast. She’s also a really good friend to Heather and Nany and when she fu**s with mike he never has any comeback because she is so good at it.

3.	⁠Mike: I get the Mike hate but think he’s a lot of fun a lot of times, he doesn’t put up with the wreckless nonsense the rest of the house seems cool with, it’s nice to see someone in a city that takes down everyone largely arrive normal and stay normal, and his bromance with Leroy is top shelf. I went to Catholic school my entire life and he does remind me of a lot of kids and parents I was around though in that he’ll have a performatively large negative reactions to some things (Dustin lying about being in p•rn) but then not just turn a blind eye but be encouraging to Leroy’s kind of gross womanizing. It seems like a lot of his moral stance is just tied to a bruised ego or Dustin not trying hard enough to be his friend.

4.	⁠Leroy: A mixed bag. He’s so likable he can get away with a lot sometimes, like the aforementioned womanizing, but he’s also got some really strong moments like when he tells Dustin he’s going to be less homophobic when he gets back home because his friend was in gay p•rn. The breaking glasses for no reason thing and especially how he treated Naomi when she thought she might be pregnant dropped him a notch for me though.

5.	⁠Dustin: Numbers 4-8 are kind of who bothers me the least, and it’s not easy. Dustin, for all of his faults, is always good tv and he breaks up two of the bigger multiple man/woman fights in real world history like an absolute pro. The only reason i rewatched this season and the biggest part of the reason I consider it to be the only good season after 2004 (and seven years later for that matter) is because of the insane circumstances and behavior he comes with.

6.	⁠Adam: Also at the very least good television. Emotionally abusive? Sure. Violent? Sure. Fabricated some portion of his past? Sure? An alcoholic? Potentially. With all of that said, at least I’ll give him credit for being a jerk who knows he’s a jerk as opposed to…

7.	⁠Nany: …a jerk who doesn’t know she is a jerk. Treats her boyfriend back home like trash and rotates between gaslighting him and getting some sort of sick joy out of telling him how the “cutest guy in the house” wants her. Dumb enough to fall for Adam’s 3rd grade schoolyard flirtation techniques, doesn’t listen to anyone’s advice, doesn’t care in the least bit about his girlfriend, forgives him for bringing home a girl in zebra print, lying about it and making Mike kick her out when she proved to not be DTF, has the nerve to tell Heather she should never talk to Dustin again after what he’s done despite holding Adam on a pedestal, treats Cooke terribly because she’s misguided enough to think she stole Adam’s spot in the house, and still sees herself as the good guy.

8.	⁠Cooke: After only two episodes she’s just bad television. Clearly playing a character mugging for screen time, doesn’t seem to have any interest in being there beyond chasing Dustin, brings down every scene she’s in so far.",1733011343.0

Internet, ISP are required to log all sites you go to, they can access your net records already, they know where you go online. Social medical, mobile phone locations all can be accessed if the gov wants it. If you’re an Aussie dev and make some security software with encryption? You’re required to put in a back door at the request of the gov. This isn’t to 90’s anymore, you’re tracked, get over it.

When I create a great life for myself, if I ever feel like I don't deserve it, I'll remember that I did for her as much as I did it for me.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Well....we don't know the exact math. 

What we DO know is this:

-The odds of triggering Capturing Radiance on a 50/50 loss increases for every 50/50 loss you don't trigger it.

-You can lose the 50/50 a maximum of 3 times. After your 3rd loss, you are pulling the limited 5-star on your next 50/50 no matter what.",1733011344.0
"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","Have a few things I need help on… any advice would be appreciated. 

first off baker mayfield or Jayden Daniels to start? Baker seems like he’s got a chance to score big but Daniels tore it up at the end of the game against Dallas 

Next: start Mike evans over Kupp? I have puka and Evans at wr rn with Bucky, Jonathan Taylor, d Henry and Chuba at rb/flex. Debating benching Taylor for Kupp too. Not sure 

Lastly (in my other league): Kupp over Justin Jefferson? Seems crazy but he hasn’t been producing lately. I also have Pickens and Aaron jones on my bench with breece, jahmyr (disappointing), puka, cook and bucky in.

"StarWarsBattlefront","t5_2u9wz","It’s fun, but sadly hasn’t been fixed yet. The old games didn’t have these bugs.  I truly truly hope there will be another Update and Update 4 can fix things. That would make the game an all in one Console like for like replacement for the originals in 4K. 
Some key ones in the Classic Collection (that work fine in the original) include:

SWBF1 (Battlefront 1)

Super Battle Droid - Reduction in Wrist Rockets and No Explosive Damage
Explosive Hit Detection is still not working in Battlefront 1 in the Classic Collection either offline or online including after Update 3. 

If firing a Wrist Rocket (Droid faction) as a Super Battle Droid, when the wrist rocket hits a target (either an enemy unit, or the floor near a group of troops), there is currently zero explosive damage. -  This lack of explosive/splash damage also applies when firing the EMP weapon as a Republic Jet Trooper, or firing a rocket launcher as a Heavy Trooper (any faction),
2. Minimap/Radar does not always work when moving - You do not always get an accurate location for your position on the map when using the mini-map/radar at the bottom left of the screen or using the larger Radar version of the map. (The larger map is accessed by pressing the Back button on Xbox consoles as an example. The arrow marking your own position is sometimes inaccurate for some reason)

3. Droideka controls on the right thumbstick do not work for some reason - Universal Infantry controls are not being applied to this single Unit.

4. Republic Jet Trooper jet fuel lower on Kamino

5. Bespin Platforms Turrets have been made all powerful Death Stars

6. Hoth mountain range graphics appear a blurry purple until you approach them.

SWBF2 (Battlefront 2)

Controller Sensitivity issues
If everyone can keep raising Tickets, then hopefully Aspyr will listen and fix things. Hope springs eternal. 
The original two games both work properly (upscaled to HD) on newer Xbox consoles. ",1733011344.0

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8",">  Instead, all “gods” we see are in truth just very powerful and influential beings who are revered by “lesser” beings. 

This is literally the definition of a god.    It comes from an Anglo-Saxon word *ǵʰaw,  which means ""to call""  or ""to invoke"".   IE:   To call something and worship it. 

This is how Gods were seen and defined for most of history in almost every culture.

The ""omniscient and all powerful"" thing is a conceit  that was claimed with the rise of the Abrahamic monotheistic religions.     It's not the norm.      

Even then, the actual word for ""god"" in religious text is Elohim, which just means"" the might ones"".  

So, again, we're back to a god just being something more powerful than you, which is supplicated or worshipped. 

That's it.      That's how it's always been.

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","> Just seems like a lot of extra effort to save a few centimeters.

Depends which few centimeters.

- Being able to hit backspace and enter with the thumb, instead of having to move the hands / stretch pinkies: this is clearly useful, with practically no downside.

- Home Row Modifier keys: being able to use these without having to move the hands from home row: this is useful for cases where you've got two hands on the keyboard. Worth considering if you're using a keyboard-based program that's got shortcuts.

- Nav keys: hjkl is a pattern that comse from Vim. WASD or IJKL might be more intuitive for others. Though, I like that home/pgdn/pgup/end can match the same ""left/down/up/right"" pattern. -- On a standard keyboard, I'd look at the keyboard to hit these keys.

- Symbols: I'd group it into ""numbers"" and ""the other symbols"". I'd expect you'd know that Shift+2 is @, etc.; arranging numbers in a numpad is easy to remember. Miryoku's arrangement (as shown in the video) of symbols isn't too bad, but I did arrange in a way I found it easier to remember.

I wouldn't argue ""everyone should be using a 40%"", sure.

I would argue all keyboards would benefit from thumb keys.

I'd also argue that for two-hands-on-keyboard tasks (especially keyboard-oriented editors like vim/emacs/helix), using techniques like the above makes good use of the keyboard. -- With such a keyboard, the keyboard is small because it doesn't need to be bigger; whereas, for example, laptop keyboards use a Fn key to compensate for the lack of physical space.",1733011345.0

 His rhetoric, not just charisma, is a huge part of his appeal. He simplifies issues into soundbites that resonate with people. That's an advantage in modern politics, where attention spans are short and voters want someone who speaks their language.

And the age argument is laughable when Biden is sitting in the White House and no one's batting an eye. If age were a disqualifier, this conversation wouldn't even be happening.

You want to have people around you? Check in on people. Ask how they are doing. Keep tabs on people. Be a good friend. Granted, not everyone does the same in return, and these efforts do not automatically mean that you gain a friend, but those people are on the path to be alone, so it’s not your problem.

I try to remember to do a sell to cover any additional I don't have in my Core (SPAXX) but I either a) forget or b) fidelity beats me to it. It's a 3-business day process (sell day 1 (goes to cash), initiate xfr day 2 (pending debit), xfr complete and acct is debited day 3. Day 3 is the date I have set for the xfr. Of course, any weekend/holidays get inserted in the duration ahead of my date so sometimes I have to back up \~7 days to beat them to it. 

Do be aware that your Core position disappears when it goes to zero balance (which is what happens if you auto liquidate FDLXX). It comes right back when cash shows up.

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","I am unfamiliar with your work. However, prepping is something I have thought of often of late as I think our food systems could face catastrophic failures soon. In that case, I think the only prepping that will matter is growing your own food I think. And probably living in a secluded place where people won't come to steal/loot. That comes with a lot of baggage though. Do you have info relevant to this type of scenario that I could read about? Definitely something I'd be interested in reading more about. Also, would love to know about good places where you could get a homestead to grow your own food and stuff. Where will the best places in the world be in the next 10-20 years? Have you thought about possible political conflict that could compromise certain locations? Do you take scientific literature into consideration when trying to predict the best places for growing food in the future? A lot of places will be unusable for growing food for a variety of reasons in the future (flooding, sea level rise, drought, soil fertility, heat waves, etc.). 

Thank you for the AMA and sorry if I'm asking a lot of stuff you have already answered. I don't even need a response, so much as a pointer to previous work if you have it. Glad to be seeing stuff like this because it's all we can do in the face of climate change really.",1733011346.0

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I agree men are **part** of the problem. The term ""toxic masculinity"" is so broadly applied these days, it's practically meaningless, but there is some truth to it, or at least to what it used to mean. Men shouldn't allow themselves to fall into unhealthy feedback loops of insecurity and overcompensation for the sake of attaining some impossible standard of masculinity. They should be given the space to pursue what brings them happiness, even if it's not as macho as what the Chad next door does. There are men abusing steroids that harm their health long term, surgically lengthening their legs to increase their height, falling into despair and depression because they're told they're failures for not getting laid.

But again, women perpetuate that stuff too. They refuse to date men who are shorter, or make less money than they do, use the word ""incel"" as a derogatory insult associating male virginity with male failure. They're just as much to blame for enforcing toxic gender roles as men are.

Meanwhile, when they say they want to dismantle the patriarchy, they're not criticizing their fellow women. They portray themselves as innocent victims, blaming men, and men alone, for all of society's ills. As a man, if you accept the label of ""Patriarchy"" you give women a free pass for their transgressions, and accept blame for problems you did not create, and that you are not responsible to fix.",1733011346.0

"ReoMaori","t5_2z3wz","A good example of why te reo ought not to be universally used in signage intended to be used on public roads. Far too many opportunities for drivers to become confused or unnecessarily distracted.  All one need to is recall the confusion and ire that follows the various spellings and pronunciations of Wanganui and Whangarei to realise that while long standing European bastardisations are merely problematic, they are generally simplified and comprehensive, to the majority of kiwis (not so much the tourists). But, they are not nearly as incomprehensible and incommunicative as full blown Māori place names, or Service signage. Because when Māori can not agree on spelling or pronunciation, and one adds European bastardisation if 17 syllable place names that a not readable at a glance at 100kph such signage is less than useful and often dangerous. At best the poor driver could end up in Makatea rattan than Maketea (I made those names up as an example of how even simple names can be easily misread).  

The only people in the country who have wholly maintained the right to name the places in their district in te reo are Tuhoe. Mostly because they have never adopted Europeanisations. 
While it may make sense for some railway stations in Auckland to properly correct Europeanised designations of place (as in the station for K’road) this is not universally the case elsewhere. And the k’road example is more of a spelling correction rather than a displacement, and thus might even be comprehensible to tourists especially as in colloquial usage both the place and the station will remain refered to in the speaker word as “k’ road”!",1733011347.0

"Veeam","t5_2ut1c","Instant Recovery mounts the workload directly from the backup repository and makes it available in your target hypervisor. This process can usually be accomplished quite quickly, meaning that you can get workloads up and running quickly.

Restore Entire VM, on the other hand copies your data from your backup repository back to production. For example, if your DC in question in that screenshot is 500 GB, the entire disk(s) would need to be copied from your repository, to your production storage, and after that is complete, powered on. Until all that data is copied, your workload will be offline.

A few points to consider for Instant VM Recovery:
Performance can be an issue - if your backup repository is slow or a dedupe appliance, then your VM may not be very responsive. As part of the recovery for Instant VM recovery, you also need to ensure you migrate your VM back to production to avoid having it run indefinitely on your repository, as well as to prevent the backup from being locked.",1733011347.0

Apart from human capital Georgia provides a strategic interest for Europe in the Caucuses, as it is an important transit point for Azeri oil particularly in a post-Russia Europe (there's also Georgian natural gas and Black Sea Security interests). Georgia also has a rather high birth rate for an Eastern European country so Europe could benefit from immigrants.

tell me, are we in an ice age now or not? if so is it ramping up or winding down? if we arent then when is the next one and how long will it take to happen and how long will it last? how and when will the poles shift? will that affect global weather? how is weather at latitudes farther from the equator affected by global temperature increase? is it the affects as within the tropical zones? how does the cycle of solar activity affect the global climate? can you predict solar activity cycles? why is the sun so ""inactive"" lately? why was it so ""active"" in previous times? why is the earth now experiencing an EXPLOSION in global plant growth? how will all this extra ""carbon filtering"" affect global weather? if we have a spike in major volcanic activity how will that affect the global climate????

i could go on, but do you see how many factors are involved here and how fucking dumb it is to get even the slightest worked up over ""climate change"".

**DMs are PROHIBITED.** Click [here](https://reddit.com/r/Doppleganger/w/faq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for detailed info on how to handle unwanted DMs. This should go without saying, but messaging minors is also not okay.

Please **REPORT** comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise inappropriate. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. Also, refrain from making accusations about the authenticity of a post in the comments section - report or contact modmail. We do take action when comments/posts are reported...give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.

"beauty","t5_2qlac","Your post/comment has been removed for being low quality and/or off topic. 

Only high quality on-topic posts are allowed on /r/beauty.

A high quality on-topic post would have a specific beauty-related question be addressed, or solve a specific beauty-related problem. 

For example, ""How can I draw winged eyeliner more consistently on each eye"" would be a high-quality post because it asks a specific question. In contrast, ""EYE MAKEUP HELP"" makes it harder for users to give their beauty tips because it's too vague.

Other low quality/off-topic posts include, but are not limited to the following:

- Overly-trending topics
- Glow ups requests
- Color analysis requests
- Face feature analysis
- Vaguely titled posts
- General all-encompassing requests
- Abstract ideals of beauty
- Rage bait
- Surveys
- Filtered/overly edited images
- Sympathy farming
- Attention seeking
- Diagnosis requests
- Controversial topics
- Expressing insecurities
- Drama

"MadeInAbyss","t5_3k4lt","The timeline discrepancy for the Ganja Corps in Made in Abyss arises from the Abyss' time dilation effects.

From their perspective: Belaf mentions that 150 years have passed for the Ganja Corps. This represents their subjective experience of time in the Sixth Layer, where time flows slower than on the surfacr.

From the surface world: Over 2,000 years have elapsed since the Ganja Corps began their expedition into the Abyss. This reflects the surface's relative time progression.


Their Inquisition-era attire and culture reflect the time period they left the surface, which matches the 2,000-year figure in surface terms. So, both interpretations are correct:

150 years reflects their lived time in the Abyss.

2,000 years corresponds to surface-world time.

Some brown addons are famtastic and others do practically nothing, and some iridescent addons are game-changingly powerful and others actively hinder the killer to the point that they would be better off running no addons at all. If they wanted to go down the route of accounting for addon rarity in matchmaking, they'd have to do a major rebalancing to ensure that the usefulness of each addon matches its rarity, and based on BHVR's recent track record when it comes to balancing I don't trust them to be able to do that without homogenizing out all the uniqueness that curently exists in the addon system",1733011351.0
"worldofpvp","t5_2wbvb","Well if 1 person does not belong in the rating, that means no-one other than person should have their ratings changed imo but that would enable lots of griefing. You also have to understand that when a DPS goes 6-0 other DPS are punished with negative rating but when DPS goes 0-6 other DPS are rewards. We, on the other hand, are never punished with MMR in those scenarios.

I mean I hate going 3-3 as much as everyone else but we need to be compensated for it differently, not with MMR gains, especially not above starting MMR (1.8k) and possibly few hunderd after. Higher rating games are much less random and much more consistent anyway, 3-3 is not as common as its on lower rating.",1733011351.0

Here he fucking inserts himself in a conversation he wasn't a part of, to interrupt Mike Tyson, in order to insult him and about a topic he isn't an expert on. Like holy shit. A normal human being would either say nothing or at least give their after Tyson, and if they were to interrupt, surely the only statement that wouldn't be crazy disrespectful would be something like ""Oh come you know Mike's the goat"" or something.

"singing","t5_2rlcx","[Head anatomy](https://www.staceyjanevocals.com/blog/tag/vocal+cords)

To use your instrument—your voice—you can't change the position of your fingers as you do to learn guitar. The adjustments you need to make are internal. This means you’ll need to visualize a lot to move your muscles and organs or to direct the air to ""strike"" certain areas.

For your soft palate, I’ll include an anatomical link. In this diagram, you’ll also see your nasal cavities. The goal is to let the air flow freely inside and make it ""hit"" the right spots. When you sing through your nose, you're mostly using the front of your nasal passages. Singing with your soft palate involves visualizing the back of the nasal passages to make full use of the available space.

You can try an exercise: sing ""through your nose"" and then sing ""through your soft palate."" The sound will be different. Don't forget. It's just visualization. Imagine that the air hit the soft palace. Once you’ve mastered this, and depending on what you need to achieve with your voice, you’ll be able to move the air in one direction or another to create different sounds.

If you want to experiment with resonances and feel their physical effects, place your hands on your face and explore it while you sing. Feel the vibrations in your nose, cheeks, forehead, neck, sternum. At first, the sensations will be subtle, but as you get used to it, you can practice directing the vibrations.

If you don't have any vocal theory, I highly recommend reading a lot and watching videos, especially until you can work with a teacher. Power singing is incredibly demanding.

But keep in mind that even with a teacher, you'll only get the basics. Very few are able to take you into rock or metal registers (though perhaps that's more common in an Anglo-Saxon context). Here in France, for example, it's pretty tough. Either way, you'll have to do a lot of personal exploration.

So, first and foremost:
- Learn to understand how your body works, get to know your instrument.
- Learn to recognize your limits so you don't injure yourself (it would be a shame).",1733011352.0

The ending comes as a shock to the viewer. It certainly unsettled me. Made me think, after my first WTF?reaction. First thing I realized was that the revelation comes as a shock to Magne too.

We see everything the way Magne sees it. He “knows” he can throw that hammer half a mile, and it will come back to him. He knows he’s Thor. And we believe right along with him. Then, at his high school graduation, it all falls apart. He experiences two incompatible realities, and we see both too. One of these is the battle of the gods, carnage and mayhem; the other reality is the graduation ceremony going on as normal. They can’t both be happening, yet they are.

This is when Magne is forced to realize he has been experiencing delusions. He really is schizophrenic, as he has been diagnosed. We in the audience have the same realization. Or we should.

That, really, is all it takes to understand *Ragnarok*. At that point, it’s possible to review everything that has happened before, and *it all makes sense.*  I thought it was great.",1733011352.0
