Like someone else mentioned, I‚Äôd see if you can make your schedule work around the Metra schedule. Maybe drive down the first day, then at the end of the day, drive to the nearest CTA station (Midway I assume) and take that down to Union Station, and take the Metra from there. You could take a bus to Midway as well if you don‚Äôt want to drive at all.

"GMEJungle","t5_48nz4l","I think you mostly nailed it in last paragraph. You are correct in that they cannot issue a recall on their own. That is the general rule. But there are exceptions. 

A corporation can attempt to force a recall by proxy. This would entail an effort to force every party that has lent shares to recall them. A potential strategy to accomplish this would be to tell every lender of shares they have two choices. Recall the shares. Or pay the consequences of GME electing to do what Cohen hinted at in the annual report...ultimately moving the entire GME trading activity to a different ‚Äúplatform.‚Äù [Totally undefined.]. Obviously very difficult to get every lender to agree to recall shares, but it is an option. 

There are also provisions in the law and regulations whereby a corporation whose stock is being heavily manipulated through what appears to be illegal activity, and that activity is placing the firm under extreme financial pressure, which absent the illegal activity would not exist, to call for an Emergency SH meeting and trigger a forced recall. I‚Äôm not familiar with the law, I have not read it, but I know it exists. I think the intent is likely where shorts have a firm near BR the firm is given a chance to call the shorts bluff. Cuban tweeted about this a while back re: AMC but I don‚Äôt recall exactly what he said and I don‚Äôt have Twitter. 

But GME has numerous other arrows in their quiver. 
Even something as simple as an actual acknowledgement that they know what is happening and they are working on a solution. A shot across the bow and a reassurance to SH. They have not even done that. 

I know most don‚Äôt like AA from popcorn. But he has not been shy about calling out the evil doers. That has not ended the manipulation. But at least SH know he knows. And if he knows I guess one would assume they are working on a plan to end it.",1633046400

"ActualPublicFreakouts","t5_27mtyi","How the hell was I simpering? You were the one who made a creepy assumption about me purely based on my hobbies. I mean, you seriously had to look through my profile before you responded? Is that not pathetic? And as I explained above, you seem to be unaware that people can be into cutesy or 'weird' things and still be strong.

Not to mention I repeatedly stated that I am small and weak, and could not be the hero I want others to be. If I was able to carry a pistol, sure, I would use to try to defend myself and others, but outside of that, there is not much I can do bar calling the police. I mentioned people who are CAPABLE of doing so but instead run away. Since I cannot do that, lifting weights will just have to hopefully work.

How do you think most victims feel when they see people, who are perfectly capable of helping, to just run away, film or do nothing. Would you really ignore a person screaming in terror and/or pain as they are attacked or dragged off?

I never said anything about people being women or men. I simply stated that, scared or not, whimpering and pleasing are going to do bloody nothing to change the situation. Hell, they might even make it worse. Saying ""Please stop!"", ""Don't hurt me!"", ""Don't do this!"", etc, is not gong to make the attacker magically change their mind. You scream loud and you scream clear that you need help, that you are in danger.

I know people tend to not be in full control of themselves in a frightening situation, but it still does not erase the pointlessness of the act. The victim in the video was not pointlessly begging and pleading (then again, that could be shock).

And what, pray tell, is your response to the thing I said about COVID?

I am not 'selfish' or a cunt for judging heartless twats who would have a victim witness them run away or do nothing to help them, when they are clearly physically capable, perhaps mentally capable, of doing so. Again, this is also why I advocate for the right to bare arms in all countries, then, almost anyone can help in those situations. On that note, if you do have a gun, you have even less of a excuse to not help the person when you have the advantage or equal footing that it brings.

It sure is lovely to know that you would run away and not help a tiny, disabled person being attacked, never mind those with greater physicality who can still be victimized. It is lovely to know that you would and think it is ok for a physically capable person to run away from, or not help a person being put in pain, violated or being robbed.",1633046402

Research was carried out on a large scale, collection of smut spores after field cultivations, estimated losses that might be expected from the use of pathogens and defensive measures.

Hello Accomplished_Weird55,

If you are having a generic Linux or networking issue (configuring adapters, booting, VMs, using various tools, etc.)
you'll have better luck asking a question in one of the following subreddits:

- r/linuxquestions
- r/linux4noobs
- r/techsupport

Check the sidebar for more information. Before posting a question in these subreddits, see if you can make any progress
by Googling the *precise* issues and/or errors you are having. 

**Please consider removing your submission if you believe it better belongs in another subreddit. Thank you!**

Kali Linux isn't the best choice for learning the basics of GNU/Linux. Other distros are far more beginner friendly
like Pop!_OS (r/pop_os), Linux Mint (r/linuxmint), and Ubuntu (r/Ubuntu). GNU/Linux is useful for far more than just ""hacking"",
check out r/linux_gaming and r/linuxmasterrace to meet fellow Linux users. Looking forward to seeing you there! :)

"boston","t5_2qh3r","There's 3 currently in the area - one track goes to the Grand Junction bridge to Cambridge over the Charles. Historically that bridge (and right of way) had 2 tracks. 

Currently that line is lightly used but for pretty important purposes - it's the only way to move MBTA/Amtrak equipment between the North and South sides of the system without taking a slow &gt;100 mile detour through Worcester-Ayer. And with the major maintenance facility on one side of the system, that has to happen often. (It also hosts some freight rail that goes thru to Chelsea + the New England Produce Center - which is how much of the region's produce is supplied).

For some of the various proposals of what should happen at ""West Station"", that line would potentially start serving passenger transit use and need the 4th track, so that's what's in the plans.

(Also - CSX owns those freight rights on the Grand Junction line and it's basically impossible to eminent domain them. The state would have to buy them out if they ever want to shut down the line, rebuilding the Grand Junction is not optional. There's certainly a price they *would* sell for, but it's probably a lot higher than the cost to just rebuild it).",1633046405

Overall my feelings on this episode is mixed as rather barely anything got explained also how rush certain things felt such as Satoko &amp; Rika easily resolving after throwing some punches even though Satoko kept killing their friends the previous loop even resorting to spawn camping Rika...

Other than that same can be said for Eua vs Hanyuu, was hoping for a long drawn out fight but it ended in like less than three minutes.

My positives being the artwork is so beautiful especially when showing Hinamizawa. So breathtaking. The outfits on the older casts were nice too. Also great to see everyone having a shot at the end of the episode too.

Here's hoping we get a movie or an OVA as I doubt a season 3 will happen.

When NASA said the technology doesn't exist anymore, they didn't mean the entire field of knowledge. They were referring to the specific components. You know what else doesn't exist anymore? Replacement parts for the IBM 5150.

That doesn't mean we've lost the ability to make something comparable, better, or similar. It just means we don't make *that* anymore.

In the case of NASA, they lost most of the ability to make Saturn V parts because they didn't need them, and they were specially crafted. We *could* design and fabricate something new/similar/comparable if we needed to.",1633046406

Thesis na lang ang kulang ko to graduate. But I'm having a hard time processing my documents para matanggap ulit ako sa school (I'm extending my maximum residency sa univ, btw). Nagkaroon ako ng flu last month and di ko nagawa ang mga dapat kong gawin dahil I was too weak at that time to even think. 

Kaya ako namomroblema ngayon kasi it's almost a month since nag-start ang classes and eto ako ngayon, di pa sure kung matatanggap pa ba ako sa univ.  

I am thinking of quitting school and focus na lang on increasing my income sa freelancing. Right now I am working as an audio editor and I want to focus my free time on upskilling or re-learn my skill in programming (I'm taking up BS CS, but almost nakalimutan ko na ang mga tinuro sa akin sa univ).

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","I don't care for the epilogue.  Granted, I read the books, as they came out, in my 20s, so I have a bit of a different perspective of them.  

I didn't care for the choices she made of who died in the final battle, as some just didn't make sense.  But we won't go into that.  

The epilogue felt like something written out of a teen romance.  They met in school, fell in love and got married... all of them.  There's not one that didn't end up with someone from a different House, that I noticed.  Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, all from Gryffindor. George and Angela... Gryffindor.  I think Malfoy married a Slytherin.  There was no intermingling of the Houses, which would make more sense.  They all married their school sweethearts.  Not one of those characters I named waited until they got out of school, went on their own, met new people, and fell in love with someone out in the Wizarding World.  Bill married Fleur, from a different school, but he met her at Hogwarts because of Voldemort.  It's not like he ran into her going about her business in London or France or somewhere else.  It's all very insular.  

No, I don't agree with the name ""Albus Severus"", also, why is Harry calling his child both his  names?  Why can't he just be ""Albus"" or go by ""A.S""? Does Harry call all his other children by both their names?  Why single that one out?  Oh yeah, so we can see that he named the kid after both people.  That's the only reason.  

Like others have stated, 19 years is too far.  We needed maybe 5-10 years tops.  Heck, give us 6 months.  Give us an epilogue of one of the weddings.  It would be short enough for us to see how they're still learning to cope and try to get things back to normal, but far enough away where we can see there is a future ahead.  

The Cursed Child is a whooole other can of worms that I don't agree with, but again, not going there in this thread.",1633046407

1. Uneven extrusion. Drag on the filament or spool.  
2. Slipping extruder gear. Loose or not enough tension.  
3. Z axis is sloppy when moving up or down. Grease you screw once every 2 months. IF you have a lot of time on it with out lub, its probably shot. Get a anti-backlash nut and grease it up.  
4. Z binding. You should be able to easily turn the coupling on the stepper to the Z screw from bed height to the top.  
5. Bad quality filament that changes diameter abruptly. Had this problem once. It caused very uneven layers.  
6. Clean the rollers. junk build up will shift their locations.  
7. The printer gods are angry.. Walk away for an hour, have a beer or 3 and things might start working again. Sometimes, I just can't get it to work and put it a side to clear my mind and start debugging again after a break.

Dumb as it is ridiculous. You're on a shitposting sub, I know you may not want to see this as this will be my longest one posted here. I understand, I advise you block me, you won't anything. I take no offense. Totally get it.** 

**Don't worry, I have a strict grass touching quota I follow religiously. My neighbors and their lawn hate it. This is a first drafts, has some typos. I apologize for that, but I write these on the fly. This one is a big If you do read it, I hope you enjoy it.** 

A good friend growing up. He's serious, humble, and shy immigrant from Russia. Let's call himSovie. He was a quiet kid. Well mannered. RESERVED. He almost never smiled or showed excitement. To an absurd degree. Sometimes we would be drawing at the park, if Sovie didn't color inside the lines well enough he would just say **""shtopat""** in the most polite tone. Start over from scratch. **Like bro, WE ARE COLORING SHIT. CRAYONS. His crayons though, so it is what is. He loved to share though. Super generous with snacks, games, or toys.** 

So yeah, even drawing a little outside the lines was unacceptable. So many trees died for Sovie's quest for perfection. Ya boy, I was free balling it. I didn't just color outside the lines, I punished them for having the sheer audacity to try to keep me behind an imaginary border. **My creativity doesn't think outside the box, it wraps the box in its throbbing muscular fingers and crushes the box for thinking my imagination would stay inside such a pitiful cage.**

**I drew Wonderwoman with a giant throbbing penis that had a top hat on the head, spiderman with the words ""I wish I wasn't Poor"" instead of the spider symbol on his suit, and made Batman have bunny ears for instance. You think lines will stop me? I am making the best version of the Justice League. Fuck staying in lines, each character looks like they are spontaneously combusting  in flames with a random color.  Sovie's drawings looked much better than mine, but that clearly is coincidence. Just different art stytles...** yeah..  we also just end up playing Nintendo Wii after anyway. Resident Evil 4 and Mario Kart all day baby. 

However, our dynamic went far beyond this. We met training at the same dojo together since we were kids. This wasn't no McDojo (not a chain), got into some pretty serious training. We had multiple senseis, junior senseis, professors, and pre-masters. Other than the typical hand to hand sparring, we also did bo staff sparring. You had to get your green bel &amp; pass a bo staff exam. **There was a rowdy crew of us that were in there every day after school, we did the summer camps, many stories of mischief that went down. It was a crew of about 8 of us troublemakers, Sovie was of course one of the crew, even if he was the 2nd most quiet.** 

**Quiet guys are necessary in any squad to balance out the shitheads like me, and I wasn't even the loudest one.**  We all wanted to do some bo staff sparring because it looked wicked. We trained with our sensei after classes and did chores in the dojo. Sovie's dad would always be there watching him like a hawk, taking swigs of obviously vodka just poured into a Sunny D bottle. Mean mugging the shit out of his son. Never took his eyes off of him. **This dude never struck me as nice. When finished he rushed Sovie back to the car. It always seemed very uncomfortable. I even waved once to the dude. He looked as pleased as a Grand Wizard from the KKK being stuck at a Soul Food Restaurant being served collard greens.** 

Private sessions I whooped the shit out of Sovie. 5-0 or 5-1 usually, sometimes 5-3 at best. I knocked him on his ass more times than I could count, which is at least higher than 9 (double digits are tough ok).  He was a good sport, asked me never to hold back. One thing to mention, you use both hands if you got them when striking with a bo staff usually. Your dominant hand depending on the strike leads from the back or front, but is the driving force. Usually that's where you are going to be putting your critical movements into so you connect. Sovie &amp; I were both right handed. This lead to some predictable exchanges. **My VICIOUS UNSTOPPABLE diagonal downright always got him.**

**We learned all the fancy spinning shit you see in Jackie Chan flicks, but practically speaking you aren't ever going to use that shit. Maybe to like dazzle and confuse someone super inexperienced, but if someone is ever doing that spinning bo staff like a helicopter shit to you, just wait till their elbows are center during the side switch and rush them. Or if you got a gun, shooting them works too I hear. That shit is for show or ceremony.** Spinning like that is a party trick, or impress a date. Bamboo staffs are great, but not for actual competition.  

Fast forward 2 years, we get our green belts after a grueling 8 hour test. We didn't even need to do the bo exam. Ready to swing bb. Sovie's dad still was scowling, but his mom was there and she seemed nice. Talked to people. Basic shit. 

**I saved up my allowance to get a competitive standard bo staff that was beautiful. Royal Blue, yellow fractals across. I called her Deepest Blue,  yes that's a reference to maybe what you are thinking of.  If it's hentai or loli shit, then no. The fucking chess computer, dipshit.**

**We get picked up by one of our coaches in the classic washed out champagne colored Chevy van that looks like it fell out of 1988. Filled up with rowdy martial artists kids and seniors. Headed off for a day of  socially acceptable blood sport.** I also traded my friend a Machoke in Fire Red so he could get a Machamp. Very fitting, fun car ride. We got to the tournament. A huge dome shaped gym that was packed with vans full of other dojos/studios pouring out. 

I checked in with my sensei, Sovie did with the other group. We met up/ warmed up in the back. Wished each other luck. It was one of those enormous gyms where the white ceilings seem to stretch on forever in this infinite curve, with the retracted bleachers, that were starting to be slid out. Rings were scattered through out with judging tables nearby. Stacked high with towers of paper. Digital scoreboard like from Ash in the Johto league battles. 

**Full audience packed the now set bleachers. Cheering from multiple schools, flags waving, LOTS OF GATORADE. We absolutely shredded. the early rounds. Our ladies team was killing it, so were our teachers that were competing. Sovie and I were doing the same. I can't tell you how fun whacking someone with a stick while screaming your heart out. Shake hands, repeat.**

**Eazy Peezy lemon beezy**

5-1'd my first two matches no sweat, **the third guy was good/ HUUUUGE. I hadn't had my growth spurt really yet, although I wasn't short. This dude lumbered over me, his reach was just unbelievable. Like that stretchy arm guy from Street Fighter, help me out here fighting game nerds. H**e kept doing these massive vertical downward heaven shattering blows completely without fineness. Fast tho! He was such a fucking unit and so much reach it just plowed through you. I got bonked in the head four times with that same move. 

Score was 1-4. Until I caught that mf with a a back spin that circled around his vertical downward strike, and got him in the ribs. **KA-CHOW!** I noticed he was sweating more than peele in a cartoon network skit. My mans was gassed. So I just waited for that big lumber hammer-slam, spun and rib shot. 5-4. Great match! I beybladed myself to the dub.  Levi Ackerman would be proud. That was close though. 

Trick me once. Shame on you. Trick me four times with the same move... I am not a quick learner. Great match. We shook hands and even shot the shit for a bit afterwards. This moved me into the quarterfinals. Some of our other competitors in different events had already won (quicker events), been eliminated, only few left still competing. 

**My rounds happened alongside all of Sovie's, so I didn't get to see him but when I saw the scoreboard, my BOY was at 5-0, 5-1, 5-0. I couldn't believe my bloodlusted eyes.** The same Sovie I whooped for two years?? That must just mean I am soooo goooooddd. After down time with some pointers from one of my senseis, the pairings for the quarter finals came out, me and Sovie were facing off.  We smiled, said this would be fun. We gave privacy to practice on our own. The other rowdy boys in our squad were screaming bloody murder for us. Lovely. 

**We square up. Ref says ""blue, good?"" ""red, good?"" (referring to our protective gear colors). We tap staffs out of respect, ref yells ""HAJIME"" and it begins.** I come in with left horizontal swing, he parries, I pivot on my right inside his guard, and then hit him with the good ol' diagonal right. Got his shoulder making that **crash 'WHACK!' echoing across the gym. 1-0.

His face looks serious but this time... calculating. He spins his bo, shifting his left hand to the bottom of the staff, and crossing his right over. He grips his bo staff so tightly the veins on the back of his hands rise up pushing against his skin like fivers during an earthquake. This grip was so tight the air that stood between us in this ring felt like it was being choked of its life. The ref called out **""HAJIME!!""**",1633046408

If they charge him in relation to the homicide then no. because presumably he knew it was against the law when he did it and he still left so it‚Äôs irrelevant that he didn‚Äôt know they were looking for him now. When you commit a crime and then cross state lines it‚Äôs considered *unlawful flight to avoid prosecution* even if you were never ‚Äúaware‚Äù there was a warrant out for your arrest. UFAP exists as a federal charge mostly so a manhunt can be escalated to the federal level and taken over by the FBI or US Marshalls. You‚Äôll notice basically everyone on the FBI most wanted list has been charged with UFAP. 

UFAP wasn‚Äôt necessary here because BL committed a federal crime with the cards which allowed them to escalate to a federal level. I don‚Äôt think they will really care what he has to say about ‚Äúnot knowing there was a warrant‚Äù and thereby not turning himself in.

Also, I've been meaning to ask you about how you position your L7i on the GT500.  In the photo above, you have it towards the back of the GT500.  But I place it more towards the front up against the retaining tabs  inserted into the slots closest to the front of the GT500.  I figured that would ensure that the intake vent holes on the bottom of the laptop wouldn't be obscured at all by the foam material, while placing them in a better position relative to the GT500's blower.  Does that make sense?

If not and there's strict input based matchmaking, then again, why not have it available on consoles?

If you're going to segregate controllers from m/kb then it doesn't hurt anything to have it.  If you're not going to segregate during crossplay than consoles should have access too.

If these features aren't worth the price to you, then I'm sorry, but you bought it with those features listed. 

Of course, future features are also promised as part of the FSD package, but that's obviously highly speculative, and you admitted that you knew that when you bought it. Any advanced technology development like this has highly uncertain timelines, and things often slip. You know this, I know this, everyone knows this. 

You did receive the features you paid for. They are listed right on the order page. You say you didn't know the difference between basic AP and FSD, but the additional features of FSD were literally listed on the order page, so that doesn't make sense to me. And yes, believe it or not, car salesmen might not always give you the clearest answers or list everything explicitly. That's true for any car company. But you can see what features FSD gives you right next to the buy button, so that's not really an excuse. Who would pay thousands of dollars without knowing what it gets them? 

I'll never understand how people can admit they knew that future features are uncertain and still complain it's taking longer than expected. You literally knew when you chose to buy it! lol",1633046411

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I desire to understand what emotions are, what is their ontology, perhaps their underlying algorithms (in case if we think in the paradigm of functionalisms).

On the one hand I see why we need something like that. A philosopher can sit and think about different factors of his present situation and how they uniquely affect the situation and how they shall be applied to different object. He travels multiple paths inside his thoughts, tracking each cause and each effect, because he has enough time for that. A typical living thing doesn't. As living beings we shall respond to the world here and now and inside here and now we can travel only through one path. So we need some dominant strategy of behaviour that agregates the most important factors of our current state, disregards all others and constructs all other behaviour in relation to the chosen general line. 

Emotions, being the most general strategies of behaviour, kinda need that competetive exclussiveness, because you can't just avarage strategies. You either follow one of them, or none of them, that's what makes a strategy a strategy. They also have to have different levels of intensivity so that secondary factors could gradually switch them and take over, but like not to fast, otherwise the chosen strategy wouldn't have enough time to make any imoact on reality.

Given that it is strange to realise both that 1) we can choose exclusive strategies of behaviour without feeling emotions on top of that (like when you are preparing several meals simultaneously, but you still can do only one task at a time, like cutting vegetables or stiring the food on a pan); 2) that emotions sometimes are very unrelated to what we currently do or think. Like when you are deep inside a depressive state, but someone enters your room and you have to act like you are totally fine and everything is OK until they go out. (P.S. I am not feeling like that now, it's an experience from long time ago.) Yes, they can influence what we are thinking or doing, but sometimes their influence is amazingly weak compared to other times.

Recently I experience falling in love into a comedian actress for 15 minutes. It was very strange, because I kept the ability to rationally analize all what is happening. I felt a strong desire to find her account and somehow attract her attention, write to her (well, I did the first, but resisted from the second, then I just went to smoke and enjoy the feeling while it hasn't gone). I felt happy like an idiot, but at the same time my thoughts were very ironic about all that, because I realised that I know litteraly nothing about her, that her life, goals and values most likely are completely alien to mines and that all that catched me was just her image on scene, defenitely unrelated to her as a real person. Moreover I knew that this feeling couldn't survive for long without rational justification (just as happened).

But still I was surprised about how unrelated and mutually independant can be my emotions, my thoughts and my actions. Because during those 15 minutes the feeling continued in parallel to all my thoughts and my critical attitude (sure, it's a skill + experience + some luck + my natural tendency towards self-reflection, but the mere possibility of that shall tell us at least something).

So my question is: if feeling is some kind of process, but is not thinking nor behaviour, then what does that process do? Any process supposes that something changes, but at a short period a feeling feels ""constant"", yet it defenetely ""happens"". It can dominate behaviour unless there is a strong rational reason to refrain from that or pretend that it doesn't, at least for some moment. But even refraining you do not stop feeling.

It's like registering something that exists only in subjuntive, something that should have happened to you if you wouldn't stop it and dio something else. But we do something instead something else all the time, yet often we do not ""feel"" that. Moreover feeling is not a model of some concrete action that shall be performed in the outer world. A feeling can offer you a lot of such concrete actions like ""kiss her"", ""tell him how stupid he is"", ""run away"", but the same feeling can be a cause of very different actions being applied to different situations. There are thousands of things that can be done sadly, expressing the same emotion. Feeling sad is not just simulating in your imagination one of them, yet it is being ready to perform any of them on the fly. Yet you continue to feel even if you are doing nothing, thus you have nothing to choose from, nothing to prepare for. It's like an unending search of means for self-expression without a hope to find something final, because none act of self-expression will stop thr fweling immideately.

What's interesting is that feelings may lead us to the most abrupt changes in our lives. Yet it doesn't seem for a feeling to be obligatory to resolve in some decision or a solution. Moreoften the only ""result"" of a feeling is the time spent inside of it. It may be shortened or prolonged due to external influence, yet it always final. Even for chronical feelings like love or depression it's more common to have a lot of in- and-out points, rather tgen remaining 100% if the time in the same condition (unless it's a really severe case). Maybe creating those in-points and out-points is the real process behind feelings. Any feeling tries to control not only how you respond right now, but also when shall you enter this state again and under which conditions shall you gradually exit. Moreover the more time you are inside, the more exit-points your brain will try to create, because you can't just stay in one state forever (sometimes you do, but it's a pathology).

Your emotions are your investment into your future decisions without being too specific about those decisions (what makes it different from planning). You are sort of ""planning"" your long-term relations with the outer world, your sensitivity to different stimuli, your level of trust and level of dogmatism on your chosen paths, your triggers and manners of responding. But you are aware only that some changes are happening inside of you and that they are pointing to a certain direction (everything is bad / good / ambiguous / boring etc.)",1633046412

I don't disagree that Vader should win against Han in a straight 1v1 unless they really mess things up, but I don't see him as a free kill, and I'm not sure how anyone can see him as regen.  No damn way I'm making it out against a max Han without roughly 50% health drain.  Any Han worth their salt is going to survive long enough for two detonites and two shoulder charges, plus at least a shot or two (post detonite at least), no matter how well you play it.  

Maybe you're a god at this game, but I know I'm extremely good with Vader and Han, and I would confidently say I'm top 10% of players with both of them.  I've only met a handful of each in the last year or so that I would say are equal to or better than me.  

Chewie is absolutely better against Vader than Han on average.  Imo, he's the best player in the game against Vader.  But in a straight 1v1 in tight-medium quarters, he's still only going to get \~75% damage on average.  In wide open maps (e.g., Crait), he can definitely win the battle.  

Leia, on the other hand. . .  Now, that's a free regen, no matter how good they are.  I'm disappointed if I ever die to Leia in a 1v1, even if I start it with 100 health.",1633046413

Khalifa's purpose is spiritual upbringing of the community that is why we all non Ahmadis and Ahmadis, both say that God chooses Khalifa and he is  the one with the most direct connection with God.

4 rightly guided Khulafas after Muhammad saw were political ruler because they inherited a state after him. But they didn't stop doing their duty as a spiritual guide.

Ahmadiyya Khilafat doesn't have a state because Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as was not a political ruler. This, Ahmadiyya khilafat is a spiritual khilafat until an Ahmadi state is created in the future. 

**This Khilafat is NOT a continuation of Khilafat e Rashida but Khilafat that ALL Muslims are awaiting. A khilafat that will be formed after the Messiah arrives as per the prophecy in Musnad Ahmad hadith.**

At normal prices, first come first serve will wipe out the inventory...and with things like water, it might be better to pay 3X what it would normally cost than to not have access to it at all, not even the choice to pay an outrageous price.

"college","t5_2qh3z","If your instructor has a pH.D., the correct form of address is ""Doctor"".  It is a lot of work to earn a Ph.D. and academics take the title of ""Doctor"" very seriously.

If you're uncertain if they have a Ph.D., then ""Professor"" is an acceptable title.

You may have some classes that are taught by graduate students and they will usually tell you how to address them (often, they say to just call them by their first name).

But there's a big problem with calling female instructors Miss, Mrs., or Ms.  And the problem is that male instructors are almost never called ""Mr."".  Students have an inherent bias in referring to a male instructor as ""Doctor"" when they aren't certain but calling a female instructor ""Miss, Mrs. Ms."" when they aren't certain.  It's basically sexist.

Short answer is that it's always better to err by calling an instructor ""Doctor"" if they don't have a Ph.D. than to offend a doctor by calling them ""Ms."".

(On the other hand, in industry, it's uncommon for people with a Ph.D. to use the title ""Doctor"" at work.  Basically, someone who works in say engineering who insists that coworkers call the ""Doctor"" is probably an ass.)",1633046414

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Rebate? I'm not a Verizon store, ain't no rebates to be had, sorry. 

 I don't really feel like debating what you said. You honestly don't understand the Bible enough to be able to debate it; moreover, you obviously don't understand context to what it says. With the Bible you accept it for what it is and understand why the things were said in the context of the time they were said.

 There are two different parts of the Bible: Old Testament and New Testament. Most people cannot grasp this concept whenever they trash the Bible. It's Old Law v.s. New Law. It's rules for different moments in humanities' life. One's for a sinful/hardly redeemable world; whereas, the next is for a world that is still sinful but ultimately forgiven/redeemed through Christ. 

 If you want to ""debate"" then start quoting scripture and let's go, but until then how about you actually figure out what the religion says and teaches ok? And don't go by ""denominational teachings""/what your hear from others, but go by what the actual words say. Read it for yourself. View the Old Testament as mostly history, and the New testament as the religious law. You might have a better time parsing through it. This comes from an Ex-Athiest of 20 years.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Languages aren‚Äôt invented, they develop. Early man would have communicated in many of the same ways that other primates did. You would have ‚Äúcalls‚Äù for basic concepts like ‚Äúdanger‚Äù or ‚Äúfood‚Äù or ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù that existed before those words existed. Most needs based. But over time those calls would become standardized among a user group (your tribe would do it one way, another tribe another).  As we became more advanced our ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù of calls would become more abs more complex. But as humans we are able to teach these complex ideas more quickly and effectively to subsequent generations. And different tribes would encounter other tribes and new things, they would find they needed new calls to be made and much like now someone would just decide based on what they found, often because they perceived it as similar to another thing. Over time the ability to pass in this information became evolutionarily sound. So the more advanced you could get with your calls and the more effective and precise they became the better odds of you surviving. And this process just refines itself over and over and over until it becomes rudimentary speech. And eventually that becomes language but primarily in retrospect. At some point we are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough to go‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs a system of rules here that we all follow or what everyone to follow. And so there becomes grammar. And then you get to writing and reading and you get alphabets and more advanced forms of communication and language evolves and grows and spreads and sometimes dies. Then cultures exchange, trade and other things come along to add loan words and the ebb and flow of time create dialects and and observe word in and out. Technology advances and new words become needed. Languages begin to get bogged down with rules and slang and simplified version come along. Creative folks began to use language in unexpected ways and language grows and changes even more. 

Ultimately, language is a (metaphorically) living and evolving thing that has never really existed in a ‚Äúfirst‚Äù form in that it is a path of communication development that has made our species evolutionarily viable.",1633046415

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I was homeschooled until grade 5 because my (highly educated) mother wanted me to have a better education than a public school could give.  When I finally entered school in grade 6, I was assessed to have 11th grade math skills, already knew a lot of what we were learning in science and history, and could write almost as well as the average adult.  What did this do for me?  In addition to the obvious - I was able to succeed academically -  I honestly think having more knowledge as a teenager helped me mature more quickly.  Understanding a fair amount about the world while I was going through my teenage identity crisis allowed me to better understand how to develop myself into a successful person.  Plus, it allowed me to participate in some cool hobbies, many of which blossomed into productive activities as I grew older.

But who's to say none of this would have happened if I was in public school?  There are a lot of variables and no control, so I can't really draw an accurate conclusion.

However, one thing I'm almost certain of is that homeschooling helped me grow up happier.  I've heard a lot of stories about kids being bullied in grade school, and some of the grade-school kids I've met seem... hard.  Considering that I'm autistic and would certainly have been a primary target for bullies, I'm pretty glad that I was kept safe from that as a kid.  In my homeschool group, I made friends who didn't mind that I was different, and sometimes, I even felt like I belonged.  In fact, I don't think I actually experienced true cruelty until middle school.  Because of this, my self-esteem remained high until around grade 9, when the bullies *really* started to go in for the kill.

(Disclaimer: my parents had the right personality and background to homeschool, and they fully understood their knowledge limitations - that's why I was sent to school when I was older.  Please don't try to homeschool your kids unless you have time, patience, humility, and the knowledge to effectively cover every subject.)",1633046415

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Redraw swaps a card you already have for a different one.

Sleeve Draw pulls you a whole new card, like Draw, but on a separate cooldown and with a guarantee not to duplicate seals you already have.

With proper planning and timing, you get use Sleeve Draw to (almost) guarantee a perfect Divination within the first few seconds of combat. Here's how:

* Draw immediately when you first load in. It'll usually take at least 30 seconds for people to get organized and ready to pull, so this lets you start combat with one card drawn and another Draw ready to go.  
* When combat starts, DOT the enemy and play your first card.  
* Draw the next card. If the seal is a match, redraw until it isn't.  
* Play that card. Now you have two different seals and you're only 3-4 GCDs into the fight.  
* Sleeve Draw a third card and play it. Now you have 3 different seals and your Divination is ready to go.",1633046417

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt;""Stop and identify"" laws in different states that appear to be nearly identical may be different in effect because of interpretations by state courts. For example, California ""stop and identify"" law, Penal Code ¬ß647(e) had wording[35][36][37] similar to the Nevada law upheld in Hiibel, but a California appellate court, in People v. Solomon (1973), 33 Cal.App.3d 429 construed the law to require ""credible and reliable"" identification that carries a ""reasonable assurance"" of its authenticity. Using this construction, the U.S. Supreme Court held the law to be void for vagueness in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 (1983).[38]

&gt;[...]

&gt;It is not universally agreed that, absent a ""stop and identify law"", there is no obligation for a detainee to identify themself. For example, as the U.S. Supreme Court noted in Hiibel, California ""stop and identify"" statute was voided in Kolender v. Lawson. But in People v. Long,[48] decided four years after Kolender, a California appellate court found no constitutional impropriety in a police officer's demand for written identification from a detainee whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime. The issue before the Long court was a request for suppression of evidence uncovered in a search of the defendant's wallet, so the issue of refusal to present identification was not directly addressed; however, the author of the Long opinion had apparently concluded in a 1980 case that failure to identify oneself did not provide a basis for arrest.[49] Nonetheless, some cite Long in maintaining that refusal to present written identification constitutes obstructing an officer.[50] Others disagree, and maintain that persons detained by police in California cannot be compelled to identify themselves.[51]

‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes)

So, it's nowhere near settled, and especially in CA where this video was shot, it's a huge mess in the courts. The best they can do is charge you with obstruction, which is such a bullshit catch-all that you can be charged with obstruction for basically any interaction with a cop who wants to charge you with something.

23 other states have better-defined stop-and-identify laws, but they are all subject to judicial challenge and they vary wildly between states. My home state is not one of them. In California and in my home state, I am not compelled by law to identify myself to police unless I am under arrest. I certainly ***can't*** be arrested for simply not identifying myself.",1633046418

My(31f) husband (32M) is in the mood all the time. Like ALL the time. When our relationship started six years ago, I was too. For five years I was down to do it every day. In the past year I have been in a deep depression due to a combination of adjusting to a new job in a field I am not totally familiar with, unintentional and severe weight loss (I went from 135 to 100lbs at 5 foot 6 from the recent stress), and the general state of the world. My husband has been supportive, but last night we had a huge blowout because I just have not been able to do the things married couples do. I have no desire to be touched or to initiate being touched.I have tried to explain that it has nothing to do with him, but he is too sexually frustrated to hear it 
He basically told me that because I keep rejecting him, he is not attracted to me anymore, and even went to the extent of saying how well he would do on tinder if he made an account. He is nice, supportive, and understanding about everything else so this really caught me off guard and I didn't sleep all night. I feel like I failed him because I was not able to manage my own struggle and let it hurt our relationship instead of seeking help. So AITA here?

"cookingforbeginners","t5_32u9b","Your local library may have a decent selection of cookbooks. You can pick a few up and spend some time reading them to get comfortable with recipes and instructions and think through how you would meal plan and buy groceries in the most efficient way.

For example, if you see a recipe you like for chicken soup and you need to buy celery. But you'll probably end up with 3 times as much celery as you actually need for soup. So it would be good to pick another recipe that also uses celery, like pot roast.

Reading through cookbooks helps me, anyway.

I would also Google some lists of best cookbooks for beginners, or cookbooks that teach, and see if your library has some of those. They make some pretty decent ones with really helpful content, some from a more artsy angle and others from a super scientific angle. You're the best judge about which will help you most.

Some local libraries even have cooking classes, so that's another thing to look into.

If the cookbooks at your local library are no good you can check bookstores, but I suggest going to your local thrift stores if you want to actually purchase the books. Cookbooks are really expensive new (all those color pictures cost!) but you can get them for only a few bucks at the thrift store.

I do not have any YouTube channels to recommend specifically, but I suspect there are some decent cooking classes there.

My suggestion for where to start is to start small. Don't go trying recipes like slow braised lamb or pot pie with home made pie crust. Start with things like spaghetti, chili, stir fry, etc. And don't feel like you need to start with **everything** from scratch. Get your pasta sauce from a jar for that spaghetti. Use canned beans for that chili. Buy a bag of frozen veggies for that stir fry. Maybe one day you'll feel like making your own spaghetti sauce, but starting there is kind of aggressive if you're truly a novice in the kitchen. Get yourself comfortable just being at the stove first.",1633046420

Honestly you can just get them fucked over and get with your 1SG to go in there rip them apart. That‚Äôll most likely get their gears moving (obviously go through the chain of command first before going there).

DA 200 your paperwork to them so that you have proof that they have received it and have lost it or not done anything with it. 

Alternatively you can just take it to the finance office yourself, they can just process your bonus EASILY. Literally the fastest option. Now there‚Äôs 2 things that can happen: 

1. They take your bonus packet with a smile and you get paid. Good, best outcome. 

2. They ask why the hell you‚Äôre bringing it to them and not S1. 

With outcome 2 you then explain that your S1 SUCKS ASS and that you have tried multiple times to get your packet processed. IT. IS. VERY. EASY. TO. PROCESS. 

Finance can then get on S1‚Äôs ass about how they are failing their soldiers because a soldier is jumping over S1 and going straight to finance. Granted it doesn‚Äôt look great on you so I suggest brining an NCO with you. Important to make clear that your S1 has been of no help to you at all. 

You could always talk to the S1 NCOIC and tell them that their finance clerk is fucking up hard with your bonus packet (best to have a DA 200 with you to back you up, but if you don‚Äôt then word of mouth it is). 

I hope I‚Äôve been able to provide some ideas you can use.

While this may very well be the case, and there are definitely plenty of fussy, impossible to please women out there, there are just as many, or more men who haven't the slightest clue how to please a woman for ONE reason, and it is not inexperience.  It's lack of sensitivity.  You can't sense what she is feeling if you have closed your self off in the name of manliness or machismo or just plain fear of being seen as soft.  This is a rampant, may I say, epidemic trait in American/Western men.  They think all they have to do is bring the hammer and nail a women with their irresistible man plowing and the woman will melt and worship their cock.  Bzzzzzt!  Wrong.  ALWAYS wrong.  The language of love is not about being able to touch and feel well according to some level of technical expertise, it is about opening up and exposing yourself to her so completely that you can FEEL what she is feeling.  Every breath or slight reaction is a revelation, understood in its entirety.  No words necessary.  This comes naturally to the ""poets"" and rock stars and musicians (well, some of them... Some are egotistical dickheads still), and so they are famous for it, but it can come naturally to any man who knows himself and is STRONG enough to be vulnerable.  That's the key, my friend.  Let go of the ""manly"" ego.  Stop whining about not being at fault, and look deep inside.  Only there will you find the man with the magic hands.  Peace ‚òÆÔ∏è",1633046422

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Not an expert but Shia allow tattoos and smoking while fasting, they also have temporary marriages and I thought of it as a more liberal version of Islam. In terms of extreme it varies by country for example Tunis and UAE are Muslim and so are Pakistan/Afghanistan yet the interpretations of Islam are different and the laws are as well. Same with any Muslim country they are different in terms of if converting is illegal, if being gay is punishable by death, legal rights for divorce etc. vary by country regardless of Shia/Sunni. In my opinion culture and politics plays a bigger role than religion in terms of extremism. Egypt/Saudi Arabia/Qatar/Kuwait/Bahrain/Lebanon/Iran/Bangladesh/China all have Muslims that are different in their interoperations, be it clothing, laws, or extremism. Azerbaijan is also Muslim with Shia and yet you wouldn't guess it.

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","I‚Äôve worked in the service industry for about a decade, and feel like I‚Äôm pretty prepared for most basic situations. I spent a lot of time walking myself solo with a pocket full of cash to my car, that could be 15-20 minutes away, at anywhere from 12-6 AM. Hopefully something I‚Äôve picked up along the way can prove helpful. 

Effective tasers are $20 on Amazon. Sometimes, you can find a taser and pepper spray combo for an affordable price too. The taser I purchased also has a flashlight in it, and has a wrist strap that plugs in to the device so if it‚Äôs taken from you and comes unplugged, it no longer works.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to find a pocket knife at the mall or head shops if that‚Äôs something you feel safe carrying. I kept one in the door of my car, and I know you said you‚Äôre just walking, but you could carry it in your pocket, backpack, etc. Learn how it functions, use it to open boxes as work so you can get used to opening and handling it. I keep mine as a last resort because it‚Äôs not on my person, but still good to have. 

There are multiple apps for personal safety as well, the one I use is called Noonlight, that will alert your emergency contacts and the police in certain circumstances. I don‚Äôt know if Android phones have the feature, but make sure your emergency SOS is active on your cell phone if it‚Äôs available. 

Safety jewelry is also increasing in popularity, and although it‚Äôs expensive, it may be worth saving up for if you feel as though you need it. From what I understand, they function like the phone app, just instead is a piece of jewelry that‚Äôs easier to access in an emergency. 

NEVER be afraid to yell ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police‚Äù to anyone that you think is following you, then actually do it. It‚Äôs not always 100% effective, but is great at deterring non-confident petty thieves or drunks, and it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry. The dispatcher isn‚Äôt going to get mad at you for calling because you‚Äôre nervous. Save your local non-emergency number to your favorites. I always opt for 911 if I‚Äôm feeling personally threatened, but it‚Äôs good to have on hand. 

Lastly, if you‚Äôre leaving at the same time as other coworkers, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for a ride. I will always opt to ferry my friends and coworkers home because I would rather go out of my way to make sure they‚Äôre home safe than go straight to my house and worry about them. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who feels that way. 

Someone else mentioned this earlier, but I‚Äôll also reiterate since I‚Äôm here- get your own bank account. Preferably at a location that your parents don‚Äôt use, even better if it‚Äôs a company with national branches and a banking app, so you always have access to your money no matter where you end up, and can monitor it easily. Chime is a super popular, online-only bank that I highly recommend if you can get direct deposit from your work. They‚Äôre pretty quick to offer a credit builder card if you use their checking and savings system, which is a great way to start building your credit at a young age without as much responsibility.

Sorry this ended up being pretty long. Please, at the end of the day, follow your gut and keep yourself safe. You don‚Äôt need to be polite to anyone on your way home, and your safety is #1 priority. I‚Äôm sure you have to be careful with what you bring in to your house because of your living situation, but hopefully you can find something that makes you feel confident and safe during your commute. I hope that getting this job is the first step to becoming independent and truly being able to live your life out from someone else‚Äôs thumb. Best of luck, love.",1633046423

"PhilosophyExchange","t5_53uded","&gt;I still don‚Äôt see where the obligation, nor legitimacy, comes from. Is it really in virtue of being old? Oldness triumphs over consent of the governed, but why?

It has nothing to do with the age of the tradition *per se,* but in how that tradition serves to protect and distribute some good onto a group.

One basic background assumption in my argument (and Chesterton‚Äôs) is that most mutations are actually just cancers that kill the body, and so the presumption in favor of what we are already doing is the most prudent one. Age only plays a role in how it confirms that the traits we already have work we enough, and this is what I think Chesterton means by democracy of the dead: that the tradition worked enough that people were able to pass it down.

The ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù of a tradition, meanwhile, comes from the fact that the tradition protects and distributes a good to others. Authorities are simply those responsible for others‚Äô good.

Authorities, in my view, are of two kinds: ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are those who are responsible for leading people towards a new good or a new way to that good, while ‚Äúministers‚Äù are those who are responsible for protecting, maintaining, and/or distributing goods or means towards goods already established.

A tradition, meanwhile, is just some order, whether it be a ritual, an object, a procedure, etc. that is passed down. Leaders then are those who start a tradition, while ministers are those who maintain a tradition. The latter receive their authority from the former, and the former receive their authority from the purpose the tradition fulfills.

So, to answer your question: you are right that traditions might need to change given new circumstances, but the presumption should be in favor of the tradition until proven inadequate, and that the person changing the tradition must be someone who has already achieved the goal of the old tradition.

I‚Äôm in the beginning of exploring and articulating these ideas, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I miss something in my theorizing.

&gt;G.K Chesterton has an interesting argument in Orthodoxy where he said that the greatest democracy is one that accounts for our ancestors, because contemporary democracy only takes into account current living generations. A ‚Äútrue‚Äù democracy, presumably, includes past and future generations as well. I find this argument much more convincing. It at least rests on a common intuition that all people are equal, and this everyone‚Äôs concerns are to be equally considered. His argument doesn‚Äôt rest on oldness, but on equality. 

To take Chesterton‚Äôs intuition further, democracy works by resolving controversial matters through common agreement, and that common agreement is usually directly rooted in a tradition common to the group.

I‚Äôm very, very, very skeptical of any uses of the term equality, becases it just means ‚Äúthe same,‚Äù and people (and things) are actually quite different, and if and when these differences clash, we are forced to rank them and sacrifice one for another, treating them as unequal and one as better. Different goods force us to recognize a hierarchy of goods, which is as far from equality in most political senses as you can get, and yet a hierarchy of goods is also at the very heart of politics.",1633046424

- 2 are having feasibility studies done

- 6 are in the design phase

- 29 are currently under construction

Just be chill, smoke a J and don't worry about it.

There's no point in ""panik"" now. Stay low and don't do sussy calls on that sim number, because Cybercell will be actively monitoring your call to further track down the link. Whenever you go to somewhere to maybe buy some shit? Just turn your phone off because they can exactly locate you on Google map.

I was talking to this girl who was older than me for like 4 months. We used to talk like 2-5 hours a day and my parents were suspicious about it. My pops went to see the ACP or some higher up to check the number. My sim was registered under his name, so he pulled out the girl's number even without my phone. Later that day, he came home and exactly told me her house location as if he had checked it on Google Maps like exactly. Although she was so far away from my place and there's no way he could know it.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","1: slowly waning interest and losing enjoyment over the years:

1a: partly due to not feeling that connected to various guilds I belonged to over the years , of which each just fizzled out due to various scenarios of weakening or abandonment of leadership, and feeling a sort of ""diminishing return"" of putting effort into "" trying to be the best and most helpful guildie version of me "" with new guilds I'd join, whether I attempted to "" take the reigns"" or not , and having my efforts be in vain.

1b: partly due to coming to the realization that, whether it was a simple 5-man run or a raid setting, I was losing enjoyment in the gameplay by focusing a steadily increasing amount of my attention not on myself , but on other people, with or without a guild being involved... And realizing that me having to depend on unreliable people was blocking my progression. 

In other words, I could have the most stable internet connection, the most stable DPS or healing or tanking rotation, and be hitting the highest performance numbers on a team on meters, but despite all that ... through no fault of my own, have to slam my head into a brick wall time and time again due to the mistakes of *other* people (there are only so many ""learning attempts"" a person can go through over expansions and years before you really come to your own intuition about how much of a percentage of your time is being used by other people in your group to practice trial and error).

So, eventually, as much as I truly wanted to stick to the gains I had built up (see: ""sunken cost fallacy""), and the comfort of being so used to the game and universe and lore, (seeing as I started out with Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 capturing my interest back in the day and was captured by the story arcs like the Lich King and all the other stuff in my formative early teen years), I came to the conclusion that either MMOs in general, or the overall style of MMO which WoW had been built upon specifically, is no longer my cup of tea anymore.

(After all, my love of playing videogames from a very baseline level as a young kid had always been foundationed on having fun, starting with NES Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, etc. .  If I wasn't enjoying playing a videogame... What's the point of doing it otherwise?)

I might have been more magnetically attached to WoW in the event that I had had any IRL buddies on it, come to think of it 

1c: partly due to toxic attitudes expressed by a loud ( perhaps the so-called ""vocal minority"") part of the playerbase, both on the official forums and elsewhere.  I especially didn't like all the bashing of the newbie players that I saw often.( I see sh+tting on new players in an MMO setting as ""shooting oneself in one's foot"".) I felt weird being in that muddy environment that seemed to worsen with time.

1d: partly due to me having stuck with the OG Blizzard company for a significant amount of time, and purchasing many of their in-house titles up to that point,  .. . and ... yet me ""seeing the writing on the wall""  in the direction the company was heading since its acquisition by Activision (ugh gross), and the firing or retirements.  or other types of departures of,  some of the original founding or senior members of the team within a couple of years before the launch of Battle of Azeroth ... And this was even before the whole fiasco of the whole ""don't you guys have cellphones"" P.R. turd they dropped.

2: I went through a major change in my living situation and my new roommates made me feel very uncomfortable if I chose to spend more than 20 minutes sitting down on my desktop computer which I had been using during that time for WoW, and was also positioned very poorly in my new condo which just made it awkward to use

3:. My job had changed , and I was working longer hours , which just inherently prevented me from having as much leisure time as I would have liked anyway during that time frame and leading up to when Battle of Azeroth was launching

4: Truly, despite all of the above, the big nail in the coffin that most significantly lead to my decision to quit WoW cold turkey was that one of my former foolish roommates managed to destroy my motherboard and other significant PC components with sprayed water, and it took about a month of waiting and other interdicting factors before I finally got my PC operational again (which, back at the time, was the only feasible way for me to play WoW). I had spent so many weeks away from WoW that all of a sudden I had a feeling of ""I've fallen so far behind now "" 

Fry's Electronics had delays... Yadda yadda yadda. Life happened.

 In that intervening time that I was waiting for my PC to get fixed, I had been madly hankering to get back on WoW, a true addiction, at one point even having a couple of WoW-related dreams like I was in the game (can't remember what the dreams were about at all).

But, similar to other addictions, based on podcasts I've listened to since then, some therapists out there identify having that ""break"",... that intervening time and\or space wedged in-between the addict and their addiction, as a key methodology of intervention to break the strong hold a thing can have over someone.  

For a while I got a little bit into hearthstone on an alternative platform, and some other games, to fill the void. I dropped HS after about a year .

 I still play other games today, but I cannot in good faith go back to give WoW another try.

(Also, to get real nerdy for a sec,  I also kind of felt like from a storyline POV, all the major compelling tales had already been told.  There had been a lot of resolution at the end of the Legion story arcs, for better or worse.)

The wanderlust, wonderment, spirit of adventure, the kind of Lord-of-the-Rings-esque magic had all faded away for me since my 2006 start. A lot of the forms of mystery had been replaced by forms of knowledge.

I have not tried another MMO since. I can very easily slip into the trap of indulging my overly obsessive, driven, perfectionist side of my personality, which can easily slip into addiction, in which it starts taking precedence over larger and larger chunks of your life.

I might try another MMO someday.  But I'm not sure if anything really catches my interest right now. I tried Fallout 76 (lmao) for a few months but pretty quickly left that in the dust... Way too many glitches. These days I just prefer offline Fallout 4 from time to time.

Make a list of the ones you have tried and once you find the one thar works for you, you can tell immediately.   For me, it was Allergy that was like magic, and one of the last I had tried. 

Make a list of the name of the antihistamines,  then buy some small generic versions from Walgreens or somewhere and over time,  start testing and using them a week or so at a time to see if it works for you.   Don't go by market name, but look on the box and see which antihistamine it's actually using. Many different brands will have the same antihistamines. 

Here are some common ones 

OTC antihistamines include:

Brompheniramine¬†(Dimetane)

Cetirizine¬†(Zyrtec)

Chlorpheniramine¬†(Chlor-Trimeton)

"Barca","t5_2s561","Some assessments of Pirlo from Juve fans in an [r/soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/pyoxne/javi_miguel_pirlo_is_going_to_replace_koeman/) thread:

&gt;To be fair, Pirlo was not good for us because he didn't have the players to play his kind of football. He is attack oriented and said multiple times he'd rather lose by playing well than win by only defending. Not sure if it fits, but he seems pretty close to Barca's mentality. In him there's a good manager, the problem is he lacks experience and it shows, otherwise it would have been a perfect match imo.


&gt;There is a decent manager somewhere in there. He can read a game, but lacks the confidence for bold subs. He is very pro possession. I think he has trouble communicating because the team seemed always a bit off coming back for the 2nd half. All in all he is not as bad as it might seen, but he ain't ready for elite coaching yet.

&gt;for what it's worth he achieved CL when all the odds were against him. Sure he put is in the spot first but he had to beat Conte's Inter, and before someone says it, if you think Conte or Inter would go easy on us after winning Serie A you're damn mistaken, we won against the best team in Italy and those points were crucial for us.
&gt;We saw brilliance under him, but Juve was not the best team for him to succeed, I definitely think he's better suited for the current Barca, where he can afford to play as agressive as possible and just score a ton of goals.
&gt;Now this is to say he's potentially a good pick for Barca, but right now Barca dont need potentially good, they need guaranteed good/potentially excellent. That's the thing.

&gt;I think you have a better team for his style than what he had at Juventus. Barca midfield has the technical quality that is needed for him. Our biggest problem last year was the lack of creativity and with Dybala out for the whole year it was really bad. Also if you look at table we were only 1 point of 2nd place. We lost to Porto because individual errors and the away goal rule so he was unlucky too.

&gt;He has Barca DNA in his philosophy and the way he approaches the game. I think he will be a good manager down the line, but he is way too raw right now. He'll definitely have some good moments where he'll give you hope in some games, but it won't last. I don't think he'll succeed with Barcelona, but it wouldn't be the craziest thing if he finds some success.

&gt;He's not as bad as people here say. He is flexible in his approach. There were glimpses of some decent football and occasionally, he'll outclass managers much more experienced than him. But my opinion is that he needs to grow as a manager at a not so big club. He'll get you top 4 but winning the league, that's a tall order.",1633046427

2) MIQ for every positive test - few tests, higher percentage of positives as asymptomatic people don't bother getting tested, ""just in case"".

So today could be a repeat of last time, instead being that the song released, rather than just being teased

Also consider this: songs release on fridays always. Em has always followed this rule, releasing Thursday nights once midnight hits. HOWEVER that did not occur for this most recent Venom song. Was that song just supposed to wet our appetite? I sure hope so",1633046428

"TwinCities","t5_2r7ar","It was autumn, and the Native Americans on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Native Americans Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ""The Native Americans are collecting wood like crazy.""

&gt;It is simply my opinion that people do not appear to be happy, though I see them often claim it, all indications to the contrary.

If you could hang out with me outside of reddit, and even if on reddit when a post about mormonism doesn't hit close to home or touch on a subject that I'm passionate about, you'd see a very different me, one that enjoys astronomy, photography, trying to learn the cello, one that enjoys family relationships, being out in nature, etc., and it would be far more obvious that how I appear in some of my reddit responses isn't representative of how I am the other 99% of the time.

That's it right there. That line dictates every GPS watch decision and why there's no ""best watch"" for everybody out there.

Coros has great bang and battery for your buck. Garmin has a zillion features on every model. Suunto has amazing build quality. Polar has superb health tracking. Etc. Etc. Etc.

But if, like me, you don't want phone/text notifications, that makes that kind of feature 100% irrelevant. I loved the idea of Garmin Pay on my old watch, but I used it exactly zero times over the span of two years. Those are just two quick examples.

Find what works for you -- in terms of your training and the watch's durability, features and price. Sometimes it's the high-end model of the biggest brand, sometimes it may be that you find a gem from some unexpected smaller brand. In the end, I hope that everyone is happy with the choice they make.",1633046429

Normally I come to new CDF with an update on how my week was, but not today. Today I come asking if anyone would like me to make a wallpaper for them for Christmas, just like I did last year! I know Christmas isn't for another several month, but I need to have time to prepare for these. This is open to anyone I already made a wallpaper for last year, by the way!

The rules for this are: 1) tell me what character you want the wallpaper of and 2) provide me something I can use as a base image (this can be anything from screenshot to official art to even a figurine tbh, I'm pretty good at this). Can be a character from a game instead of anime, too, as long as there's a base image for me.

Will Americans relate to a gujju businessman entering his diamond shop after he gets out of his Mercedes? No.

2. Things I will not change despite receiving feedback.
3. Things I need more clarification on it things I need your help with.

**Legislation approved by a House committee would also offer intelligence officials medical scans before transfer overseas to better diagnose Havana syndrome injuries.**

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The House Intelligence Committee approved a bipartisan proposal on Thursday to provide additional resources to help find the cause of Havana syndrome illnesses and take steps to review the C.I.A.‚Äôs handling of the mysterious episodes that have injured more than 200 government officials.

The measure would overhaul the agency‚Äôs office of medical services and create a voluntary system where C.I.A. officers assigned overseas could first receive brain scans and lab work that would help doctors determine the extent of their injures should they later exhibit symptoms consistent with Havana syndrome or report being victims of a health episode.

The measure comes as some intelligence officers have expressed reticence about accepting foreign posts, or bringing their family members on tours in countries where the episodes have taken place, current and former officials said.

‚ÄúI think as long as these incidents are recurring, with what seems to be increasing frequency, without the identification of a perpetrator and without the ability to stop them, I think those concerns are going to continue,‚Äù said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

A U.S. official said C.I.A. officers had volunteered in large numbers to work on the issue of the health episodes, eager to find answers.

Since 2016, diplomats, intelligence officers and military personnel in Asia, Europe and the Americas have reported hearing strange sounds, feeling unexplained heat or experiencing pressure and then suffering headaches, nausea, vertigo or other symptoms. In many cases, the symptoms have gone on for months or years.

While some government officials are convinced that a hostile intelligence service using an eavesdropping device or a directed-energy weapon is responsible for the injuries, C.I.A. analysts have not reached a conclusion about what is causing the episodes or if a hostile power is responsible.

While the agency‚Äôs director, William J. Burns, has been praised for the attention and resources he has put toward victims of Havana syndrome, Congress has been critical of how the C.I.A. and the larger U.S. government handled the cases before this year.

The Intelligence Committee is doing its own investigation, and the bill approved on Thursday mandates an inspector general review of the performance of the C.I.A.‚Äôs medical division, and sets up an outside advisory board to examine its work.

‚ÄúWe want accountability,‚Äù Mr. Schiff said. ‚ÄúIt took too long to get to where we are. Too many people were suffering, not getting the help that they needed and not being believed. So, we‚Äôre still making up for lost ground.‚Äù

Marc E. Polymeropoulos, a senior C.I.A. officer at the time, was injured in Moscow in 2017 but did not receive effective treatment until after he retired and began seeing doctors this year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

‚ÄúThe bottom line is that traumatic brain injury does not get better over time, so I and others suffered unnecessarily,‚Äù Mr. Polymeropoulos said. ‚ÄúWe made a pact with the C.I.A.: When we would do tough things and get jammed up, they would have our back.‚Äù

Doug Wise, a former top intelligence official who has been critical of the C.I.A.‚Äôs handling of the health episodes during the Trump administration, said it was important for reviews to look at how top C.I.A. officials handled the episodes, and why officers‚Äô reports were not initially taken seriously.

‚ÄúI think it is an important thing for the committee to mandate a review. For whatever reason the agency is incapable of doing their own look because they are unwilling to hold their own leaders accountable,‚Äù Mr. Wise said. ‚ÄúThe only thing the victims asked for was respect, compassion and medical treatment.‚Äù

This year, Mr. Burns removed the head of the office of medical services, replacing him with a doctor focused on patient care. Former intelligence officials have said the office is more focused on victim care since that change.

The House measure is aimed at further improving care for intelligence officers by raising pay for the agency‚Äôs doctors, mandating outside clinical training and creating an advisory board appointed by Congress and the director of national intelligence.

The Senate version of the bill does not have the precise provisions of the House measure, but the Senate Intelligence Committee is likely to support the measure, congressional officials said.

Asked about the House measure, a C.I.A. spokeswoman said the agency recognized the committee‚Äôs work, and looked forward to seeing the final provisions.

This month, Congress overwhelmingly passed a measure drafted by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, to provide additional resources for victims of Havana syndrome, a sign of the broad bipartisan support for bills addressing the issue. Still, House and Senate leaders will need to find a legislative vehicle in which to include a final intelligence authorization bill by the end of the year.

At least 100 C.I.A. officers have been injured and suffered symptoms consistent with Havana syndrome since 2016, when diplomats and intelligence officers in Cuba reported hearing strange sounds or sensing pressure before experiencing headaches, nausea and other symptoms.

Those episodes were followed by others in China and elsewhere in the world.

In many cases, doctors treating people exhibiting symptoms of Havana syndrome have struggled to identify the extent of the injuries because they lack brain scans from before the episodes as points of comparison.

Getting a brain scan or doing medical lab work before deploying overseas would be voluntary under the measure approved by the House committee. Collecting such before-and-after information could be critical to both improving treatments and identifying the cause, Mr. Schiff said.

‚ÄúThe absence of knowing the baseline impairs the diagnosis,‚Äù Mr. Schiff said. ‚ÄúPeople have different baselines and it would be useful to know what those look like, to see how things have changed.‚Äù",1633046432

Games are marketed as something you can own, and if you ask the vast majority of people what they think they are buying then they'll say they are buying a copy of the game.

In truth, you are buying the data and also a key to unlock it. This used to be more obvious as you would have a ""CD Key"" that you would be told not to share, and this will constitute your individual, one user only, license to the software.

When you buy a game through a games-as-service model you're actually buying a subscription to a service, but the subscription doesn't tell you how long you will have access for, it doesn't tell you what will happen when you lose access and it doesn't have any requirement for telling you why your subscription may be ended. Effectively, games as service can remove access to their service at any point, for any reason, and not even tell you why.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","I'm certain this comment will bother you and I'm sure it will invite plenty of downvotes, but your comment kinda belies exactly the issue OP is talking about. 

Let's start with some context:

&gt;They are branches of the same religion.

Reform Judaism is relatively new. The Haskala only started in the late 1770s and the Hamburg disputes happened in the early 1810s (iirc). So it's about 200-240 years old. Judaism has been around for 2000+ years. For perspective, it took about 300-350 years from the death of Jesus for Christianity to be seen distinct and separate from its Jewish roots (around the First Council of Nicene) - more on that later. 

So, yes, they are acknowledged as branches of the same religion. But the sectarianism we know today is fairly new. These are not two branches that sprouted from the same root. One of them deliberately and decidedly forked away from the other. Granted, secular or non-traditionally-practicing Jews are not a new concept at all. But for the vast majority of the history of Judaism there wasn't an effort to theologically justify secularism. 

Which brings us to the next point that needs context:

&gt; Disagreement is inherent to Judaism

This phrase is littered around this post, but it's deeply misleading. It's true that disagreement is rife across the history of Judaism. Most people will point to the talmud. But there's one \*significant\* difference you're leaving out... that for about 1500 years all of that disagreement was disagreeing on reasoning or method but rarely (if ever) practice. For instance there is significant section debating Channukah candles. How should they be lit? In what order? At what time? But no one says ""we shouldn't light channukah candles"". There is much debate on why mixing meat and milk is impermissible, how much of a volume counts as mixing, whether or not chicken counts, etc.... but no one says ""hey just mix them"". 

Certainly there was differing practice and customs, but these were minor (such as eating or not eating kitniyot on passover, or the text of given prayers, or how to wrap the tefillin) but no one really disagreed on the core theological components.

Reform Judaism changed that. Reform Judaism was an outright rejection of fundamental theological tenants of Judaism. The concept of progressive revelation (that the Torah and scripture is something to be constantly reinterpreted) undermines the concept of Torah M'sinai. The idea of subjective revelation is at odds with the traditional concepts around objective practice. The approach reform Judaism has to the future of Judaism/messianisim severs the link between Jews and Israel, the Temple, and more. For a long time this connection was retained within Reform Judaism via the enlightenment era ideas of peoplehood and nationhood (culminating in the secularly-led Zionism movement)... but if social media is any indicator that connection is starting to fade as well. One of the popular anti-zionist ""Jewish"" groups (I think it was JVP) released a statement renouncing the connection between the Jewish people and the Temple Mount. That is anathema to Orthodox and traditional Judaism. But if you adopt a subjective, progressive, revelatory belief... Who is to say they are wrong? 

And this matters because... 

&gt;We're looking into the same cup, but from different angles.

You don't understand Orthodox and traditional Judaism then. For Orthodox Jews if you ""feel"" Jewish is pretty irrelevant. The rules, the practice, \*is\* the whole thing. Shabbat, Kosher, what to wear an when to wash your hands \*is\* the cup. If you think those things don't matter, or more accurately that they are an archaic practice developed by human beings in a time that was culturally different and now its our job to update that practice for something new.... then you're looking at a different cup.

Now, I promised to return to the Council of Nicene.  

The whole Jesus revelation was predicated around a New Testament and a new Prophet. It took Jesus, made him the messiah, and basically said... ""all those old practices aren't important anymore"". Do you think all of a sudden after the death of Jesus they up and went ""we are Christian now!"" No. It was a slow evolution. Some of the earliest Christian groups were strict halachik practitioners. They simply thought they were enlightened Jews. Some of Paul's letters (himself a anti-Christian Jew until he ""converted"") were concerned with how and if non-Jews are included in the New Covenant (the answer was ""yes"" and active conversion began). It took until the Council of Nicene for them to formalize the Church and turn Christianity into something that was fundamentally separate and distinct from their origins. Then they spent the next 1400 years demonizing Jews to confirm that split. 

The Reformers didn't go as far as that, didn't claim there was a messianic age, but the theological shift they advocated for was, I would argue, as dramatic. Now make no mistake. I'm not calling Reform Jews ""Christians"" But I am saying that if you think Reform and Orthodox Jews are staring into the same cup from different angles... Are Christians and Jews doing the same?

Is there a kinship among Orthodox and Reform Jews? Sure. But make no mistake Reform Judaism is quite often in fundamental theological opposition to Orthodoxy. Do people see them as the same? Sometimes, sure. Will it always be like this? History tells us it's too soon to tell.",1633046436

"StarWarsLeaks","t5_2vflj","So I get wanting to not abandon what made Mando (S1) special and all, but I honestly have been expecting the evolution of his career to lead to him being without his helmet. It seemed pretty clear that groundwork was being laid by the other Mando's and their informing him he's basically in a cult. Now that I imagine his mission in S3 is teaming up with Bo Katan and his crew (the other two Mandalorians) on the Light Cruiser and either searching the galaxy for other Mandalorian outposts or going to Mandalore because he is The Mandalore and he needs to bring his people together, get their planet back and rebuild their society. That means he'd be interacting with Mandalorians non stop and every time they'd be like Bo and all the others we've seen (on Mando, Clone Wars &amp; Rebels) who don't wear helmets. 

So I'll be surprised honestly if after the breakthrough we had in the finale with him taking off his helmet infront of the room of people for Grogu that we're back to 'Mando in his helmet all the time' mode. I get the appeal of the badass gunslinger aways in his helmet but I like character growth/evolution more. Not to mention it's not like you've got a stuntman under that helmet playing Din. You got freaking Pedro Pascal. Utilize that handsome face and good acting talent.",1633046437

That's an element that might be used to give the empty space a little depth and/or volume. 

In a side note.... The credits,when they start to roll. Way slow. As much as I hate to say it and hear it oh, it's a fact that maybe 5% of the people playing the game, if we're lucky, we'll hang around long enough to see the credits. With them crawling slowly like they are now, the first couple names would probably be seen and then people would bail. You can probably double the speed of those credits and if somebody is looking for something in particular... Like the game designer for the person who did the musical scoring for the game...

In fact in Japanese simple adjectives have a verb implication, so really there is no distinction , e.g. the word for ""red"" can be considered an adjectival clause ""is red"".

*And That's Made the U.S. Less Secure*  

Like many of the virus‚Äôs hardest hit victims, the United States went into the COVID-19 pandemic wracked by preexisting conditions. A fraying public health infrastructure, inadequate medical supplies, an employer-based health insurance system perversely unsuited to the moment‚Äîthese and other afflictions are surely contributing to the death toll. But in addressing the causes and consequences of this pandemic‚Äîand its cruelly uneven impact‚Äîthe elephant in the room is extreme income inequality.  

How big is this elephant? A staggering $50 trillion. That is how much the upward redistribution of income has cost American workers over the past several decades.  
....  
Around 1975, the extraordinary era of broadly shared prosperity came to an end. Since then, the wealthiest Americans, particularly those in the top 1 percent and 0.1 percent, have managed to capture an ever-larger share of our nation‚Äôs economic growth‚Äîin fact, almost all of it‚Äîtheir real incomes skyrocketing as the vast majority of Americans saw little if any gains.  
...  
Had the more equitable income distributions of the three decades following World War II (1945 through 1974) merely held steady, the aggregate annual income of Americans earning below the 90th percentile would have been $2.5 trillion higher in the year 2018 alone. That is an amount equal to nearly 12 percent of GDP‚Äîenough to more than double median income‚Äî**enough to pay every single working American in the bottom nine deciles an additional $1,144 a month. Every month. Every single year**.",1633046437

"diabetes_t1","t5_2vzrv","I think maybe initially it did? I wasn‚Äôt checking my blood sugars at all really I was kind of ignoring the whole thing.  I remember that my A1C went from a 12% down to a 9%, but then wouldn‚Äôt move and that‚Äôs when med changed started happening. I was pretty quickly moved from one pill to four pills with nothing making a difference. And then added on Glimepiride where I quickly moved up to the highest dose again with no impact. 

It was almost like I hadn‚Äôt had any insulin therapy and because I got a little it was helpful but it wasn‚Äôt enough or the right kind so it didn‚Äôt do the job. I am now on Omnipod and my insulin needs are the same as any other T1D. I would say it definitely develops into something more and not the other way around. 

I would be especially cautious because it doesn‚Äôt sound like you are overweight. These things don‚Äôt usually come up in younger adults who are not overweight and so to me it seems like a sign that there‚Äôs more to come it just may come slowly. 

Part of what was complicated for my situation was that I was overweight and people thought I was just doing a really good job of exercising and eating right. But I have never in my life lost that much weight that quickly. I think that the misconception of weight and T1D can have people assume that you are type 2 regardless of what other symptoms you might be experiencing if you are overweight.",1633046438

"nonmonogamy","t5_2rc24","It's not 100% reliable to go on gut instinct, but I feel like you can tell most of the time when people are hiding something. I guess it depends on the type of relationship you're starting. If it's super casual, then red flags might not be as evident as if you're really getting to know them, but at the same time, if it's more casual, I feel like it would be easier to wipe your hands of it all and not feel misplaced guilt if it turns out they're lying to you.

I recently started seeing someone on a regular basis, and before we even met in person we had added each other on facebook, had each others phone numbers and addresses, etc. When I go to her house, I will openly answer a call from my partner. Just in general, I'm not acting like I have anything to hide, because I don't. I don't think it's ever occurred to her that I might be lying, because it's so obvious I'm not.

Like I said, it's going to depend on how casual this is, and even if it's longer term, people can have other reasons to put up walls. In general though, I would consider any behaviour that seems secretive to be a red flag, but I would not consider saying they have an agreement with their partner to be a red (or yellow) flag, in and of itself.",1633046438

Sure having experience in management, finance, and other business curriculum is useful but at the same time, it takes away from IS as a focus of study.  MIS is a solid major but in my opinion, you need certs/projects/experience or a solid minor (CS or cybersecurity) to get the most out of the degree right out of college.

Oh, I can wrap my head around it. I live in it and work through it. 

I just also happen to know that all the empirical evidence at hand suggests you're mistaken -- wildly mistaken -- about what 'ideology' is behind these intrusions into academic freedom. It's noteworthy, for example, that you're rather glossing over the fact that you're responding to my comment pointing out that a single university has caved twice to political pressure on personnel decisions in a single year. If you're unfamiliar with these cases, let's be crystal clear: neither one occurred because rabid ""SJWs"" were coming for someone's head, but because Trumpists were. If you pay even an ounce of attention to this issue -- that is to say, if you don't selectively jerk yourself off to the handful of cases that fit your preconceived narrative over the last decade -- you'll notice that these two examples are far, *far* more representative of  the norm in academia.

Since I'm quite sure you'll misinterpret this, for some additional clarity I'll add that I'm not suggesting universities are captured by right wing ideology, either. The reality is that the root issue here has nothing in particular to do with left-right divides or this season's culture war issues, but is rather a product of instrumentalizing education and turning universities into a customer service industry. To the extent that the academy has been captured by any ideology, it *would* be properly identified as 'neoliberalism' -- at least if that term hadn't been wildly abused and distorted by internet discourse.",1633046439

""Try a De Buyer from France. Fuck the Argentinians. It's built like a tank. And you'll be happy to support a european company instead of a company who's country actively protected high ranking Nazi Refugees after the war. ""

&amp;#x200B;

/ now in all seriousness. Im neither a hater of darto or a lover of de buyer. I have defended darto in the past (even just yesterday lol). 

But debuyer pans are just as bomb proof, and to a degree just as thick ( they tend to vary in thickness, usually 3-3,5mm in my own experience, but also from reviews online ). While darto states on their website that 3,00mm is the perfect thickness and everything above or under is therefore inferior. De buyer states their pans are 3,00mm aswell, but are usually measured a bit thicker in reality. 

Now what I really dislike about darto pans is the shape of it, it's incredible inconvenient if you want to slide something out of it and a bit harder to clean in the curvature. 

About de buyer I dislike the rivets and that they only advertise their mineral b pans, which they sell at a premium compared to their superior carbone plus models. 

Please be more factual in your next review, many customers base their decision on posts and comments that people write here. Opinions and experiences are great to share, but what you said didn't make much sense.

As for the overthinking/low self esteem thing ive struggled with that a lot in the past, honestly its a vicious cycle, the two feed eachother. Ive found that for overthinking the most effective strat is to try to recognize when youre putting to much thought into something and remind yourself that other peeps arent overanalyzing as much as you. As for the low self esteem personally I cant offer much advice, Ive needed people around me to drag me out of that.

"fiaustralia","t5_39zkf","If you do it pre tax, you get the tax benefit now. If you do it post tax, you get the tax benefit when you claim. 

My approach to this would be as follows:
1. Number of pay cycles between now and say 31 May (give yourself and the super fund some breathing room to allocate etc)
2. Divide total unused by that many pay cycles to identify how much per pay you would need to contribute each pay to make up the total unused
3. Set up auto BPAY to meet that total amount over the remaining FY
4. Be sure to lodge a notice of intent to claim on those contributions so that the super fund treats them as concessional
5. Lodge your FY21 tax return claiming the deduction for the after tax payments. 

Notes:
1. Pay cycle cashflow will be higher if you did it pre tax
2. Have more control over doing it post tax (can cancel BOAY much easier than pay roll doing pre tax) 
3. You could essentially achieve the same thing by directing your employer to pay that same amount to your super each pay cycle if you did want to do it pre tax
4. Making the payment each pay cycle will assist in DCA purchase of the units in your super, if making one large lump sum is of concern (although over the wrong run it won‚Äôt matter)

Hope that helps. I‚Äôm sure others will have different ideas. Just how I would tackle this scenario and is currently what I am doing now myself.",1633046444

 &gt;In political science, a reactionary or reactionist is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics that are absent from contemporary society.

In July, the company announced 83% Q3 comparable store sales increase in the US.  I just like coffee, have roasted and ground my own at home, drink it black.  

I just think we have the populace hooked on sugar with a little bit of caffeine. It's as if the pseudo Italian terms and the foams and the drizzles and the tiniest amounts of espresso legitimizes what is a liquid dessert that Americans quaff with abandon every day.  I do recognize the customers who cut back on the ""pumps"" (that's the flavored syrups.) But they are the exception.  And it's so expensive.  Mothers regularly spend $15 to $20 on something for themselves and the kids after school.  Sometimes $9 for one beverage.  If you follow the subs, this heavy, relentless, insatiable demand is pretty much everywhere.  They are closing stores that do not have a drive through windows in favor of those that do.  We get orders in 3 channels at my store, Drive through, Cafe (someone walks in) and Mobile (sending orders in through the app.)  We are lucky not to have delivery orders.  Maybe some day Sbux will be thought to be like another Phillip Morris, contributing to the bad health of its customers.  

I enjoy my job because of great coworkers and we are lucky to have a good manager.  But I'm old enough to know all that can change very quickly.  I am never bored.  Ever.  And I'm the type that bores easily. We have fun conversations on our headsets.  We laugh at customers, again on the headsets.  I recommend them in a busy work place",1633046446

He‚Äôs clearly an abuser and the more you engage, frankly the more likely he is to eventually follow through on the threat. 

The only way to deal with scum like this is to give him no access to you. NO access whatsoever. Block and destroy. Treat him as dead to you. Double over backwards to close any channels of communication. Change your email address if you have to. Add his email to the block list. 
Go nuclear on the ghosting. He can‚Äôt make threats if he can‚Äôt reach you. And he‚Äôs not gonna follow through on a threat like that unless he knows he has you hooked back on him already because he knows he‚Äôd be sabotaging his own attempt to get you back if he did that without having you on the hook. So go nuclear with the ghosting. Give him no way to incite you or grab your attention. ALL communication. Not a lick of access to you. Do not kept the door open even a crack.

And as others have said save your recorded conversations as photos. but don‚Äôt preserve accounts for the evidence, just snap photos and then delete and block. 
Police usually don‚Äôt help until the crime has already been committed. 
If you can file a restraining order, consider doing it, because then the police CAN go after him for merely messaging you.

If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, ‚ÄòI love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.‚Äô  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

or

&gt; When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl‚Äôs owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.

I wish the FCC would get on it more. I don't want to get into a lot of other politics this is one of the few things I did like on Trump's administration. At one time, Ajit Pai (one of the few times I haven't called him Ashit Pie) got tired enough of this crap to actually enforce one of the new laws against this stuff. We have laws but if they're not being enforced they're worthless.

He sent an ultimatum to a couple of the big operators of this crap threatening the fines (which are massive, per call) for violations like this, and they got their house together really damn quick. My mother and I had our spam texts and calls dramatically shrink for a month or two after this hit the news.... then it all came back again...

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","1 m^(2) surface is a huge backpack but round numbers are nice.  At 1000K (727C) it can radiate 56 kilowatt. The electric power supply is lower. 

Plutonium 238 radiates at 570 W/kg.  Plutonium melts at 913K and has density 16.6 kg/liter at the melting point.  So 6 liters which easily fits in a backpack.  

You probably want that plutonium suspended in something that does not melt and does have a neutron poison(s). 100 kg of pure plutonium can generate its own fission reaction which will add to the  alpha decay energy.  

Strontium 90 is 2.37 kg/L at melting (1050K) and radiates 460 W/kg.  We need 51.4 liters of Strontium.  Strontium as a metal is a bit of a pain in the backside. Probably use something like strontium fluoride instead because it is denser and less reactive.  

You cannot allow an RTG to get insulated.  It will keep ramping up temperature and boil.  Running at 1000K is not very practical.  The radiator transfers heat proportional to absolute temperature (degrees K) to fourth power.  At 500K(227C) it is 1/16th the power.  On Earth you get a bit less because environment radiates heat in too (at 250 K the ""radiator"" absorbs heat instead).  On Earth you could air cool the RTG and get a lot more power.",1633046450

There is a townhouse subassociation HOA. Townhome residents pay into their own HOA (roof replacement, landscaping, etc) and into the master hoa (which contains amenities). Prior to my arrival, the two board members on the master HOA (townhome residents) moved the irrigation bill from the townhome HOA name to the master's name, then ran the water 8 hours nightly 6 days a week. Our landscaper told them repeatedly it was being over watered. I only know this because I was finally able to speak with him. They created a single point of contact system and put themselves as the only contacts for all vendors, then did not pass on any information to me. I had to dig to learn, and not without drama.

"AJelqForYou","t5_3nmia","Hey bro. First of all I think this is honestly out of the league of everyone in the sub including myself. I‚Äôm sure you are just trying to find help anywhere but this is not something you want random Reddit advice for in my opinion

I think there are a couple serious issues going on personally and I think you might need to get a new doctor if they aren‚Äôt helping you 

You need to get blood tested for every single STD there is. Including herpes one and two. Infections with those can present with neurologic symptoms which can account for some of the neurologic changes you‚Äôre having in that area

It does sound like in my opinion you had a STD or urethritis that has gradually progressed and potentially invaded your prostate and I agree into your bladder. A common symptom of pyelonephritis is in fact back pain. That coupled with the fact that you were having urinary changes is extremely concerning in my opinion. You might even need to get a cystoscopy so they can visualize the area. 

Sounds like you could potentially have an abscess somewhere which is basically a pocket of infected fluid that is hard to get to with a poor blood supply. That explains why your infection does get better with antibiotics but never completely goes away. You could even have a prostate abscess which is why you‚Äôre having a urinary changes, the pain with ejaculation, and The discharge. If I were you I would try to get imaging with either a cystoscopy or at least a CT scan to check for an abscess

You could have a chronic STD that you keep passing back-and-forth between your girlfriend and yourself which is why it gets better with antibiotics but then keeps coming back. She absolutely needs to get tested for every single STD in the book. And absolutely not just a urine test do you need blood tests. There are a lot of online STDs check websites that you can use where you can sign up and order all of the labs without actually going to a doctors office and then you can go to somewhere like a lab corps and show them your email confirmation and they can get it ordered. It‚Äôs relatively cheap as well. A complete panel is only like $100. In my opinion this is an absolute must for both you and your girlfriend and yes this includes HIV. 

You could also have a mixed picture in the sense that you have pelvic instability which is causing compression of your pudendal nerve leading to your hard flaccid like symptoms in addition to a chronic infection in a prostate abscess or something like that. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs one picture of that necessarily accounts for all of the symptoms that you are having. 

Hope this helps man. I hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to attack you or anything just trying to provide information based on what I know. But once again please go get help and get more testing done. This is not normal and any doctor that tells you there‚Äôs not something bad going on should not be trusted

You also need to have a urinalysis and culture so they can not only test your urine to see if you have an infection but also run a culture of the potential pathogen so they can know the specific antibiotic to use for it. You could have one of those rare antibiotic resistant infections.

Regardless bro I know you have done your diligence and I‚Äôm not saying you did anything wrong but I do think that there are some things that you are missing and this is serious especially with the symptoms that I am reading. Please go see a doctor again as soon as possible.

"JeremyDewitte","t5_2ks21s","&gt;As if any LEO that knows Jeremy is just going to spot him and think ""Hey, that's -37 SORT Commander-Cringe, ahh.. he carries a Paintball gun so let's just ignore him"".   

It never fails to crack me the fuck up when Jeremy says to a LEO shit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you know who I am‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all about me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Insert-Agency-Here‚Äôs most wanted Whatever‚Äù and they‚Äôre like ‚Äú‚Ä¶Uh, OK.‚Äù He‚Äôs always in shock and disbelief when people (LEO especially) have no idea who the hell he is. 

One of my favorite instances of this is when Jeremy bum-rushed a cop at Starbucks into going to his ~~storage unit~~ office to evict that Randahl dude. Alec‚Äôs putting clothes on after Jeremy and the cop wake him up and the cop and Alec are talking and the cop‚Äôs like ‚ÄúHe couldn‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt know who he was, he says he‚Äôs been arrested 15 times.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ",1633046451

But she knew that if her family found out that she was pregnant they would force her to keep me. She she came to America got a job to bring some money back home. But gave birth to me here in the US so I could live a better life than she could offer me. She went back home after me. Got adopted by 2 amazing white parents. Gave me the best life I could ever ask for.

The deal with Diluc is. I'm f2p and he is C1, and I only have Skyward Pride as my only 5 star weapon. I'd like to ditch him for Xiangling but she's C0, and I also like Yanfei who is C4 but all of them can't realistically reach his level soon so it will be wise to continue investing in him until I can 36-star Abyss, which I'm not sure if I can do at all with how the difficulty rises... I can't really afford investing in other characters unfortunately.

What I take from this, yes I can swap Kazuha and Sucrose, because Kazuha was only there while Diluc was in glad, now that he has CW he is kinda okay. So he was on that team because it was my weakest team. And CC from Kazuha will probably help Ayaka a lot, while Diluc is AOE enough on his own and Kazuha is mostly a sub-DPS in there. Idk about XQ though. And about Diona too, but this is food for thought and experimenting. Diona on her own can apply cryo but I'm not sure if it's that consistent for melt.",1633046451

"googlecloud","t5_2zgfk","&gt; For example, I could understand if Cloud DNS put a red checkbox next to a record or setting that isn't being managed in Cloud DNS but it working properly somewhere else.

Let's use some visual examples here and see if we can clear this up. In the Google Cloud console, I created a zone for my brand new domain, `ajunkdomain.co`, and this is what I see:

https://imgur.com/a/ALkERHt

Now, let's add an A record manually:

https://imgur.com/a/rtxXaxf

I'll hit create and now I see:

https://imgur.com/a/2lfqihj

Notice that I've added the A record, so www.ajunkdomain.co points to some web server somewhere...

...except none of this will work! Right now, this is basically just a dead end, and nothing I do here matters because it's not ""live"" insofar as that, the system that actually runs the physical name ajunkdomain.co, doesn't know about this record I just created. So, now we fix that:

https://imgur.com/a/s6tcLu6

In Google domains, I have selected ""Custom name servers"" and have changed the four servers **to the same four servers in the first screenshot I posted**. This now ""activates"" Cloud DNS so that it is the authority on what everything points to. **From now on, the only thing that matters is what is in Cloud DNS. Anything else in WHM, Google Domains (except for what we just set), or anywhere else is completely irrelevant and does not affect the domain in any way.**

It makes sense if you stop and think about it for a second: you need some way to tell the internet ""here, this is the system that contains how this domain works.""

Now, if your domain is registered through, say, Godaddy, you would set your custom domain name servers in Godaddy to point to Cloud DNS and now Cloud DNS manages the records for that domain.

DNS is... complex. It's not an easy system to understand, even for experienced engineers.

**tl;dr Unless you've explicitly configure a hierarchy (which is unlikely, given the complexity), only one set of name servers controls your domain at any given moment in time. It's up to you to decide who you want to manage your domain records by setting the ""name server"" or ""NS"" setting with your registrar (Google Domains, Godaddy, etc)**",1633046452

Only issue with this board is i don't see a BIOS flashing button so if it comes without having proper BIOS to support a 5000 series CPU, you'll need to get it flashed.

I spent about 10 minutes  the other day going through a list of passwords in my brain trying to log into an account because I didn't couldn't remember what the password requirements were. Of course, the reality of the situation is that you're right: password length matters way more than any of those other things.

If you only use lowercase letters in your 1 letter password, there are 26 possible letters that could be the password. If you change it to upper and lowercase, you double it. Now it's 1 of 52. 

But just by adding another character, you've created an exponential growth in its complexity. Now the odds of randomly guessing the password go from 1 in 26 to 1 in 676. So making an 11 character password with only lowercase letters is unfathomably more secure than a 7 character password with a few extra upper/lower/numbers/symbols.

"sixers","t5_2scmr","I said BOTH trading for Jimmy AND Tobias at the same time was a bad move.  It was an all-in move that would build a great roster(albeit with little time to develop chemistry) for one year, then make us weaker when either Jimmy or Tobias left.

But beside that, EITHER Tobias or Jimmy wasn't a great move, because neither shoot enough 3 pointers for what we need out of our third star.

People say Joel and Simmons can't maximize their potential with each other.  They have a point.  But it can still work if you have them surrounded by 3 other guys who can shoot volume 3's.

With Jimmy OR Tobias, you're not going to have that.

And of your 3 best players, 0/3 will be volume 3 point shooters, REGARDLESS of whether we kept jimmy or tobias.  So, it all comes down to 2 guys who will be relatively low salary to shoot almost 100% of the team's 3's.  

I just think the priority should have been to get a guy who can shoot volume 3's as our third star, even if we had to wait.  Jimmy and Tobias may be stellar players, but neither fits with the VERY ODD combination of Joel/Simmons.  Embiid and Simmons need a very specific roster to counteract the fact that both need the paint to be effective.  Jimmy or Tobias don't fit that(in fact, to an extent both of those guys ALSO require the paint to be their most effective).

If you want Jimmy or Tobias as a part of your team with EITHER Embiid or Simmons, that can work.  The problem is when you combine your 2 best stars who can't shoot volume 3's with a third star who can't shoot volume 3's, it isn't a very efficient roster.",1633046453

Art direction side, we aimed to match each shot with a look from a similarly themed movie, from the lighting through to the grade.

For the mountain scene that meant a slightly hard light with bleak colours, especially in the shadows. The underwater scene was very low key, trying to get as much of the rays and rolled in camera. For the plane scene we wanted a rich, filmic look that almost felt like colourised wartime footage.

Equipment used was Sigma Art lenses on BMD Ursa Mini 4.6k with Arri fresnels in various states of diffusion. Any thoughts or feedback would be really appreciated.",1633046454

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","First of all, Glass Cannon is ""amplifier"", so its a standalone multiplier of your damage. The ""increased total weapon damage"" talents are additive to each other, like Obliterate, Vigilance, or FI/Overwatch groupwide bonus. 

Before 1-hit protection introduced, most of GC players finished downed many times, now it protects them and allow to heal back. This was big ""nerf"" to glass cannon backdraw, and big advantage for the players.

If you think of extreme damage like a sniper 1-hit you, you are right. But if you play from cover, enemies need 40% less bullet to do the same damage. While normally I still have some armor bars in a full red/yellow build, with Glass Cannon my healt already in the lowest segment. Healing back to full health to be able to use the 1-hit protection takes more time, because this is a requirement for 1-hit protection. If I get surprised from behind, no way to survive it. A red mob on heroic with a short series from AR and I'm already dead. 

I use Glass Cannon only when I sure I can avoid generic bullet damage or only lethal enemy on the field. Like at the stairs on Iron Horse control room, a purple and a chunga comes out periodically. I can melee the purple with Sweet Dreams, or 1 shot with it (FI bonus + GC + Vigilance in full red build), but if the chunga hit me with grenade launcher, not counts I have GC or not, it takes my all armor and health, demo spec ignore one shot, so I can kill him even without destroying his ammo bag with GC easily without damage.

On other hand, I prefer weapon handling too. More accuracy, more stability and less reload speed give advantage without drawback. Passively raise average damage by decreasing reload time, especially on long reload weapons like LMGs or some shotguns. Also raise damage by more bullet/pellet hit the target and recoil reduced, can land headshots faster.",1633046454
"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","Encouraging developers to build more on the land they have is a positive *if* it makes housing available, but as we can clearly see from places like London, where there is massive development of almost exclusively ""luxury"" housing which is immediately bought up as investment properties and then sits empty, *that is not what results*. The housing shortage is *artificial*, because it doesn't derive from a scarcity of homes but from the unwillingness of owners to let or sell at an affordable rate. Rent-seekers will rent-seek, as they always do, and taxing the land won't stop them; taxing unoccupied housing (make it only kick in after some number of months without an occupier who's been present for some similar minimum amount of time, so people can sell or find tenants without undue burden) is at least as simple and discourages this particular failure mode, still without requiring a complex edifice of laws, and while being an actively *progressive* scheme in that the tax burden falls on those who can most afford to pay.

After all, you've just *acknowledged* that in oryto benefit everyone, taxing land requires the introduction of a second failure point in the form of a programme to which that tax revenue would have to be channelled, and which could therefore be attacked *independently* of the proposed taxation scheme.",1633046454

Assuming all of them were vaccinated, you would think that at least some of them would have a decent degree of immunity to avoid testing positive for covid.

Some Conjectures: (No proof, so obvious it is just conjecture)

1. The standard RT-PCR tests over-amplify the swab, to the point that anyone with a negligible &amp; functionally zero amount of covid will turn up positive, as long as they've been around them.
2. Chinese vaccines have lower efficacy. (Sinovac)

I'm normally absolutely HORRID at math (made a terrible score on the math section of the SAT, failed multiple math classes in high school and college, etc) because I can't focus on it. Like it is extremely boring to me and I loathe it. But, ironically, I found myself switching to being a physics major. I discovered I have a love for physics and working towards the goal of having a job I love makes it a lot easier to get things done and focus on the material. Starting meds and therapy also helped me a lot with it as well. I attempted to be a nurse initially because I wanted to make a good living and I did enjoy helping people, but it wasn't something I was cut out for. The classes were a major struggle for me to get through focus wise, even just basic math ones because I wasn't looking forward to the end goal.",1633046455

&gt; Anchorage police say four people were arrested at an Anchorage Assembly meeting on Wednesday night, including one man who was armed, during heated testimony over a proposed mask ordinance.

&gt; The ordinance, similar to a mandate that was in place in Anchorage for much of the pandemic, would mandate that people wear masks in public places and at large outdoor gatherings.

&gt; &amp;quot;Did you know that if you don&amp;#039;t pass this ordinance, people that want to wear masks can still wear masks? But if you do pass it, the people that can&amp;#039;t or won&amp;#039;t wear masks will be cut off from goods and services, buying food and clothing, cut off from their jobs, maybe even their friends and family,&amp;quot; she said.

It was initially designed as a torture facility for first years, as they would devour the food, expecting it to have some palpable taste. They were fools. Cadboro Commons instead gave us cold, tasteless food. The only acceptable food was the chicken caesar wrap and the chicken strips and fries. Upon learning this, the students rebelled in a joint effort, and President Jamie Cassels had to resign, this was known as the Boston Tea Party. In the aftermath of the rebellion, Cadboro Commons was demolished and a makeshift temporary unit was made, the Modular Dining Facility or in short, MOD. The MOD continues the harsh traditions of its predecessor and there are no signs of it coming to an end.

"britishproblems","t5_2sumw","good suggestion let me try that.

edit: Ok yeah so that was interesting. So I figured I'd compare the same sources right. bbc vs teenvogue.

When looking for articles of the same content it became quickly apparent that the journalism differed greatly.

TeenVogue obviously has a very different target audience. Young, American , primarily female and based on the types of articles they right clearly left leaning. Also a ton of fashion and other celeb, popular crap . It really is a magazine. That made it hard to find articles to compare and I gave up.

So I change my opinion. I would say that the original article I posted seemed well written. Overall clearly they both have their target audience and agenda. 

I think that's just the point and the conclusion i've drawn before and fallen into the trap of many times. You really have to read from a broad range of sources ones you like / don't like , good and bad. That way you're getting a more realistic view of what is being written about in the papers and perhaps the viewpoints that some readers of those papers/sources hold. Or that at least the editors feel gets them reading whether the views are what actual people think or not. 

In short you can't have an unbiased paper I guess you have to read both sides.

edit edit: I still stand by my kind of original point though is that the BBC is shit and getting shittier and is tending towards being more and more like tabloid journalism.",1633046457

In the civil rights movement, they did sit-ins in restaurants and buses that inconvenienced people. They blocked streets and endured a lot of police brutality. The Stonewall Riots were a part of what led to LGBT rights. Hell, the Pride parade is held on the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots every year. Massive amounts of people blocked roads during the Suffrage movement. And this was a massive feat because this happened in the 1910s. If you believe this doesn't work, then you are wrong.

Too long have most people become accustomed to understanding that no matter how much of an asshole they are, there is no threat of violence looming over them as there once used to be in every society that has come before. 

Introducing the One Slap a Day Society. Every single person in Regular society over the age of 18 has a single slap to use in a 24 hour period. The slaps do not accumulate, you simply get one slap. You can use the slap on anyone else that is over 18. If you can reach them, you are allowed to slap them. Retail scene would be completely different. An employee at a store is allowed to slap a customer if they become too much to handle. We can collectively line up and slap politicians, using our one a day slap, in order for them to change laws. 

Of course this brings its own problems such as the SlapPolice to maintain a one a day slap policy. Also a SlapMafia may arise, wherein you hire a group of thugs to use one slap each to legally slap someone to death. I admit there are issues here, however the benefits are astronomical. Boss being asshole, slap. Neighbor complaining about being loud, slap. The list goes on.",1633046457

I do have a question. I'm only on day 4, and right now i'm kind of in a honeymoon phase. I've been high so long that being sober is almost its own high, if that makes sense. But I know that's going to end.. so I'm wondering did you have a phase like that? And when it inevitably ends, how did you stay strong?

I went through this once before 2 years ago, and lasted about 4 weeks before ""i deserve a bowl"" turned into 2 more years of being high... I'm worried that might happen again if I'm not prepared",1633046458

"heathenry","t5_2rb5n","i'll just answer that here and hope they see it (actually im gonna be annoying and tag them ( u/Nacht_Blackwell ) so they see it):

to me it's rewarding pretty much all the time. i'm a happier person than i used to be because my outlook on life is different and better than it used to be, the new perspectives gained has helped me a lot with deep anxieties around life and death, but also daily interactions with those around me and those in my community. i'm still transitioning into this religion but i'm now starting to see the gods in the daily life around me, as well as land wights, house wights and general animism. so even while not actively partaking in religious ritual or activities it is still rewarding.

and of course it is rewarding during religious ritual and activities too, and i think thats a more obvious answer and i dont think i need to write much about those in particular. i simply enjoy giving offerings and performing the rituals to give them in - especially considering i have written every single word and action of my own rituals from start to finish. that in itself is rewarding too - the development of my rituals and practice as i learn more and adapt my rituals &amp; practice accordingly. i can look back to when i started and didnt know what i know now, and see how everything has developed and changed as i learned more. as for activities, even just maintaining my altar, keeping it clean and changing the decor with the seasons, occasionally adding a new god to honour, changing the general decor of the altar to represent different gods as they are added and removed from my practice, as well as simple aesthetic changes. celebrating the holidays with those closest to me is rewarding too. i havent gone to a full heathen group meet/event yet but i have had small celebrations at home, and they have been wonderful.

so my answer is just... pretty much all the time!",1633046459

En Mexico las vemos como una ‚Äúsoluci√≥n‚Äù porque no tiene la misma cantidad de consecuencias a largo plazo, por eso tenemos las tasas de inter√©s tan altas en las tarjetas, la gente no le tiene miedo a estar mal en bur√≥, claro que pagar√° por a√±os o d√©cadas el haber quedado mal en bur√≥ porque est√° sujeta a cr√©ditos con tasas de inter√©s mucho m√°s altas o limitado acceso a otras posibilidades crediticias lo cual genera mayor brecha econ√≥mica.

Para que tengas una idea de que me refiero: una persona con buen bur√≥ ahorita puede financiar un Mercedes Benz 2022 a 18 meses sin intereses, alguien con bur√≥ regular puede comprar digamos un versa y va a pagar como 90 mil pesos de intereses, de ah√≠ la importancia de tratar de evitar las quitas.",1633046459

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","They arent oppressive though. Government has ALWAYS had the right and duty to implement measures to insure public safety. How is this different than the 1000 other laws and regulations society already follows? Other than this one is being highly politicized for no reason. For hundreds, thousands of years, governments have made laws to protect safety and restricting ""personal freedoms"" for the common good, but somehow THIS is oppression and tyranny? Okay...

""*The defendant insists that his liberty is invaded when the state subjects him to fine or imprisonment for neglecting or refusing to submit to vaccination; that a compulsory vaccination law is unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive, and, therefore, hostile to the inherent right of every freeman to care for his own body and health in such way as to him seems best; and that the execution of such a law against one who objects to vaccination, no matter for what reason, is nothing short of an assault upon his person.* ***But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.*** *There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis, organized society could not exist with safety to its members. Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy.*""

and...

""***Real liberty for all could not exist*** *under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others*.""

This was from over a hundred years ago. I understand it is from the US Supreme Court, and not universal, but the principle is the same. They had to spell it out for people who dont understand what law and government and society mean.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; Some left voluntarily, instructed by Arab leaders who claimed that the land would be taken

That is transparent, self serving false propaganda disproven even by blindly patriotic ultranationalist zionist historians.

&gt;But the takeaway is that there were about 760.000 refugees.

That was in 1948.  Since then the number has grown ten fold.

&gt;Now, you've probably never heard of Arab League resolution 1547, passed in 1959. This decree forbids any Arab country from naturalizing Palestinian refugees

Palestinian refugees have been naturalized in many countries, Jordan most obviously, it doesn't change their refugee status, or the fact that Palestine is their homeland, or their rightful claims on their privately owned land and homes illegally stolen from them by the european zionist entity.

&gt;Their fellow Arabs hated Israel more than they cared about those refugees, and wanted to ensure that they'll forever remain pawns against Israel.

This seems to be a racist dog whistle and false propaganda you accepted without any thought.

&gt;The Palestinians are the only refugee group in the world, whose descendants are given refugee status as well.

More false propaganda, so far everything you've said has been regurgitating false propaganda and indoctrination.

Is The Transfer Of Refugee Status To Descendants Unique To UNRWA?
37866
No. Under international law and the principle of family unity, the children of refugees and their descendants are also considered refugees until a durable solution is found. As stated by the United Nations, this principle applies to all refugees and both UNRWA and UNHCR have recognized descendants as refugees on this basis.

In line with this, the UN General Assembly annual resolutions on UNRWA operations continue since the 1950s to require the Agency to deliver its services for the protection and assistance of Palestine refugees, including descendants.

&gt;In 1948, approximately 800.000 Jewish people were kicked out of Arab countries.

More lies and false propaganda.  In fact, those countries actually made it illegal for Jewish citizens to emigrate to Palestine on account of Palestine being violently conquered by european zionist terrorist immigrants.

Also, as part of the european zionist ""one million"" program to bring one million jewish immigrants to Palestine, the mizrahi Jews that moved to Palestine illegally chose to do so willingly.  Often with the help of the zionist entitiy including being given houses the zionist entity illegally stole from native Palestinians both native Palestinian citizens of the zionist entity, and native Palestinian refugees.  Because, you know, racism.  It was core from almost the beginning of zionism

&gt;In short, who is to blame for the current Palestinian refugee crisis?

The european zionist terrorist immigrants.

&gt;The Arab League and UNWRA.

Both false.

Remind me who's living in the native Palestinians stolen houses and on their stolen land?  The UNRWA?

&gt;In 1948, approximately 800.000 Jewish people were kicked out of Arab countries. the vast majority resettled in Israel.

I have no idea where you got that laughably false information.  Most native Palestinian refugees, roughly 40%, live in Jordan.

Roughly ~2M native Palestinian refugees live in various parts of Palestine, including Gaza, the Palestinian West Bank, as well as other parts of Palestine.

This is slightly smaller than the ~2.1M native Palestinian refugees in Jordan, there are ~500k native Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, and so on.

&gt;Israel is not just going to let 7 Million people in who hate their guts, that's just not realistic.

Then israel is not realistic, not that israel has any right to exist in the first place, a nation of european immigrant terrorists.  They certainly have no rights in this matter.  Not to mention, of course, they were the cause of the refugee crisis, you know, their violent terrorism and their violent ethnic cleansing?

Your idea seems to be ""What happens with these refugees from that violent ethnic cleansing?"" ""Let's ask the people that carried out the violent ethnic cleansing, because I'm sure they have a reasonable idea""...

Maybe you need a nap, a shower, something like that.  I'm sure you can do better.

&gt;You know as well as I do, that that's much more realistic and doable than to ask Israel to take in 7 Million people who would love nothing more than to destroy the state.

You've got it the wrong way around.  Palestine is the homeland of the native Palestinians.  It's their land.  Figuratively, but also literally.  As in they privately own large parts of it.  

The right of native Palestinians to return to Palestine, their homeland, is literally unquestionable.

The rights of violent european zionist terrorists though...

The only question there is who in the world would take such people?  I suspect the only reasonable outcome would be to move those zionist war criminals into the refugee camps.

&gt;Something many people don't talk about is that many homes were not ""owned"" but rented. The owners (who were previously Ottoman) sold their homes and land to Jews.

Something zionists don't talk about for some reason is the widespread ottoman land registry fraud, and the zionist land fraud that continues to this day.  And how most illegal israeli state sponsored outposts are build on fraudulent land transfers.  A proud zionist tradition of over a century.

But you don't seem interested in talking about the law, after law, after law, after law the israeli ""government"" passed illegally stealing privately owned native Palestinian land from it's private land owners with no compensation, and, often, transferring it to the openly racist Jewish National Fund.

&gt;there was an exchange of populations.

Again, lies and false propaganda.

&gt;The 800.000 Jews who were kicked out of Arab countries also lost everything

More lies and false propaganda.

&gt;You don't hear Jews asking for their properties back in those countries, because they recognize that it's the past (and that there was an exchange of populations).

I do actually hear Jews asking for exactly that.  Even in cases when there was no ""lost"" land or property...  It's so crazy I just can't understand it.

Mizrahi Jews, or people who claim to represent them, who moved, sometimes illegally, sometimes legally to Palestine, for the purpose of willingly and deliberatly participating in the violent ethnic cleansing of native Palestinians, for the purpose of using their family as a weapon of ethnic cleansing for the israeli ""government"" who didn't lose any money or property, demanding false ""compensation"" for money they didn't lose and property they didn't lose when they willingly, with the help of the israeli ""government"", emigrated to Palestine, where they received land and housing the israeli ""government"" illegally stole from both native Palestinian refugees and from native Palestinian israeli citizens, as well as tax money paid by, among others, native Palestinian israeli citizens and probably other native Palestinians.

&gt;See my first answer (hint: The Arab League + UNRWA). They can't seek naturalization in any of the Arab countries, as per Arab League resolution 1547.

Again, false, Jordan alone has ~2 million naturalized Palestinian refugees...  This makes things like working, and receiving government services, and education and so on easier for them, but they are still native Palestinian refugees.  Palestine is still their homeland.  And they still have every legal right to all their Land, Homes, and property that the violent european zionist terrorists stole from them.

&gt;See answer to question number 2.

Zionist war criminals.

&gt;I hope that this clears things up a bit. Happy to answer any other questions you may have.

Almost everything you said was a lie, false propaganda, or both.

\*1v lsd ist der nachfolger von 1cp lsd was vor einigen monaten verboten wurde. 1v lsd ist legal und kann man online kaufen.

das allerwichtigste: mach es am beste nie alleine, vorallem nicht am anfang.

"billsimmons","t5_2yb1h","&gt; Nice but the argument is really why should someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs contracted covid, has the covid antibodies, be forced to take the vaccine.

I think the data is still a bit murky on this, but there are some studies showing that the vaccine is more protective than prior infection.  It also is more likely to protect from variants.

This study says unvaccinated previous infected is 2.3 times more likely to get reinfected than fully vaccinated.

"Truckers","t5_2t90b","Upshifting is easy. Listen to the engine. When it starts to scream, (usually around 1500 rpms), it‚Äôs time to shift. The easy way to shift is to remember the tag line from Little Caesar:

**Pizza! Pizza!**

‚ÄúPee‚Äù - Clutch in. 

‚ÄúZah‚Äù - Take the truck out of gear, clutch out. 

‚ÄúPee‚Äù - Clutch in. 

‚ÄúZah‚Äù - Put the truck into gear, clutch out.

When you clutch, you‚Äôre not pushing to the floor, either. Once you get a feel of where the clutch engages, it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúTap. Tap.‚Äù You‚Äôre pushing in *maybe* 1-3 inches. It‚Äôs not deep at all. 

Downshifting, it‚Äôs a little more complicated, but not really. Every truck is a little different, so you might have the same experience as I did, or it might be slightly different. Anyways, here‚Äôs the stuff:

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard military marching cadences, right? The ‚ÄúLeft‚Ä¶left‚Ä¶left right left‚Ä¶‚Äù? That‚Äôs the motion downshifting uses. You can practice it anywhere, even sitting on the crapper. It goes:

Left - Clutch in, take out of gear, clutch out. 

Right - Rev the engine. 

Left - Clutch in, put in gear, clutch out. 

The key point to remember is know you‚Äôre RPMs. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre starting in 8th gear, going to 5th. Look at the rpms. You‚Äôre at 1400. Take your foot off the gas, and brake down to 1000. Clutch in, take out of gear, clutch out. Rev the engine to 1500. Clutch in, put in 7th, clutch out. Look at the rpms. Brake to 1000. Clutch in, take out of gear, clutch out. Rev to 1500. Clutch in, put in 6th, clutch out. Put your selector switch down. Look at rpms. Brake to 1000. Clutch in, take out of gear, clutch out. Rev to 1500. Clutch in, put in 5th, clutch out. 

If you miss a downshift gear, (or it‚Äôs grinding), just stay calm. Clutch out, rev, clutch in, and try again. In the trucks I was in, I had to clutch in **farther** when going to 5. Every other gear was a tap like upshifting, but 5th was about half-way in. 

Just stay calm, don‚Äôt freak out, and practice. Once you get the feel for it, you won‚Äôt need to muscle it in gear because it‚Äôll just go. Just take your time, practice, and practice some more. You‚Äôll get it.",1633046462
"JamesBond","t5_2rsg9","They build it up from early on in the film. Bond is always looking over his shoulder, he can't rest when with Madeline because of his past. He then gets infected with something that can inadvertently spread to the people he cares for. He was shot twice already and had to go back to the base to ensure it could all be destroyed. 

He didn't die as a ""wuss"" at all and they didn't neuter him in the film either. Given the absolute mess they were left with from Spectre I think they did a good job once they decided Craig was coming back. Nice homages throughout, everyone was treated equally, Bond wasn't neutered and if anything was portrayed in a good light given that the ""new"" 007 recognised he was still James Fucking Bond and gave him his number back. She didn't come saving Bond at any moment and she wasn't the focus of the film. 

A lot of people spout ""snowflakes"" but are the first to cry ""but muh James Bond died I'm not watching wahhhh"" 

His death was consistent with the story they told and he died a bad ass, literally staring at the missiles as they blow him up. 

The film wasn't without fault (pacing mainly and Rami's villain was underutilised and underexplained) but it was a good end to Craig's run. Quantum of Solace and Spectre can get in the bin though.",1633046462

[https://ia801307.us.archive.org/20/items/JimGarrisonPlayboyInterview/Jim-Garrison-Playboy-Interview.pdf](https://ia801307.us.archive.org/20/items/JimGarrisonPlayboyInterview/Jim-Garrison-Playboy-Interview.pdf)  


""I was with the artillery supporting the division that took Dachau; I arrived there the day after it was taken, when bulldozers were making pyramids of human bodies outside the camp. What I saw there has haunted me ever since. Because the law is my profession, I've always wondered about the judges throughout Germany who sentenced men to jail for picking pockets at a time when their own government was jerking gold from the teeth of men murdered in gas chambers. I'm concerned about all of this because it isn't a German phenomenon; it's a human phenomenon. It can happen here, because there has been no change and there has been no progress and there has been no increase of understanding on the part of men for their fellow man.  

  
What worries me deeply, and I have seen it exemplified in this case, is that we in America are in great danger of slowly evolving into a proto-fascist state. It will be a different kind of fascist state from the one of the Germans evolved; theirs grew out of depression and promised bread and work, while ours, curiously enough, seems to be emerging from prosperity. But in the final analysis, it's based on power and on the inability to put human goals and human conscience above the dictates of the state. Its origins can be traced in the tremendous war machine we've built since 1945, the ""military-industrial complex"" that Eisenhower vainly warned us about, which now dominates every aspect of our life. The power of the states and Congress has gradually been abandoned to the Executive Department, because of war conditions; and we've seen the creation of an arrogant, swollen bureaucratic complex totally unfettered by the checks and balances of the Constitution.  

  
In a very real and terrifying sense, our Government is the CIA and the Pentagon, with Congress reduced to a debating society. Of course, you can't spot this trend to fascism by casually looking around. You can't look for such familiar signs as the swastika, because they won't be there. We won't build Dachaus and Auschwitzes; the clever manipulation of the mass media is creating a concentration camp of the mind that promises to be far more effective in keeping the populace in line. We're not going to wake up one morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms goose-stepping off to work. But this isn't the test. The test is: What happens to the individual who dissents? In Nazi Germany, he was physically destroyed; here, the process is more subtle, but the end results can be the same.  
I've learned enough about the machinations of the CIA in the past year to know that this is no longer the dreamworld America I once believed in. The imperatives of the population explosion, which almost inevitably will lessen our belief in the sanctity of the individual human life, combined with the awesome power of the CIA and the defense establishment, seem destined to seal the fate of the America I knew as a child and bring us into a new Orwellian world where the citizen exists for the state and where raw power justifies any and every immoral act. I've always had a kind of knee-jerk trust in my Government's basic integrity, whatever political blunders it may make. But I've come to realize that in Washington, deceiving and manipulating the public are viewed by some as the natural prerogatives of office. Huey Long once said, ""Fascism will come to America in the name of anti-fascism."" I'm afraid, based on my own experience, that fascism will come to America in the name of national security."" \~ Jim Garrison, 1967",1633046464

Parts Shortages

If you have tried to browse through some parts already or read any recent articles on PC building, you have probably seen that there is a massive worldwide shortage of GPUs (video cards) that has left retailer stock levels almost entirely empty. Please see [this subreddit sticky post on the current CPU and GPU shortages for additional information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/me3dbx/info_post_current_hardware_shortages_and_build/) Note that if you are looking to build any kind of PC that requires more than basic graphics horsepower, such as for gaming or media creation work, your first priority should be to getting your hands on a GPU before going any farther. 

Direct Message Scams

Recently a number of users have set up spam-bots targeting this subreddit to send out PMs and DMs to all users who submit posts to this subreddit. These accounts sometimes pose as teenagers offering to help design a build in exchange for a ""donation"" to help them build a rig of their own, various companies offering services through external websites, or even users just claiming to offer help via PM - this last kind will often string you along for a while before demanding payment for their efforts. **Do not reply to these messages.** This subreddit thrives and grows on the volunteer efforts of every contributor who helps around here, often leaning and improving from seeing the work of others. If you receive any PM/DM messages related to your post here, please go to https://www.reddit.com/report and submit the username of the message sender under ""This is spam."" to help get these spam bot accounts permanently removed.

New diseases often are highly deadly because they face naive immune systems. That‚Äôs no longer the case with the flu. We‚Äôve been dealing with seasonal flu for millennia.

"USPS","t5_2r25j","&gt;How is complaining in bad taste?

Think about what you're complaining about. You are upset that another ""business"" wants to charge you *barely enough* money for part of the year so that we recoup our expenses for the service we're going to give you.   

You would be livid if I were to suggest you should price your services at a loss. Why do you think it's okay to apply that standard to us? 

*Hint:* It's not. 

&gt;These things do affect us. What is in bad taste is too be dismissive of it as if the extra cost incurred should just be accepted and to shut up.

I'm not dismissive of it. I understand it's an increase in your costs. But I can't sympathize because we're not UPS. We're not just raising rates out of greed. We *have* to in order to survive and directly save the careers of nearly 500,000 employees. Not to mention the millions of people like you who **depend on us existing** to have a viable business model period. 

If you can't afford to switch to our competition you can't afford to complain about us doing what we need to do in order to stay around. I'm not dismissive of your problem, I'm dismissive of your whining  and blaming us for it. You have a problem, That's not our fault. We have a problems too. 

&gt;If you want to permanently increase rates, fine, do so. But to only do it during the part of the year when most retailer based businesses make the bulk of their yearly income to snag a few more dollars, Im telling you, it hurts. And I don‚Äôt need to justify being upset about it.

This is about the most dishonest bullshit I've ever read. You're pissing and moaning about a seasonal increase but claim it would be fine if we ""just did it permenantly"" 

Yeah right...

&gt;We know that much of the losses aren‚Äôt just operational but also related to the ridiculous pension funding requirements. 

The mandate hurts but we are not profitable even without it. 

&gt;And what is being done to adjust operational expenses besides keep raising rates? 

Slowing down service.. And you see how that's going over. 

We really don't have much fat left to trim. I know I know ""ReeREeeEEeee Guvrmnt bad"" but believe it or not outside of completely scrapping service days we really don't really have much room for operational efficiency. 

Rates have to go up my guy. I don't know why that's so hard to believe but it's the truth. 

&gt;Can some of the loss be attributed to investment in new vehicles? If so, thats not really loss long term is it?

We don't have new vehicles yet so I honestly don't know if that is in last years finances or not. What I do know is they damn sure are not in the finances looking back all the way to the mid 2000's when we stopped being sustainable..",1633046466

Then it had another feature I added after ordering everything to track it coming into our possession and how it got got distributed to each contractor that received our stuff and generated a packing list that was checked manually by the packer and signed.

I used like 5 unique formulas of excel.  It is insane how powerful that software is.

It also could generate a quick % of budget and overages per item so when my boss would bug me about how the budget was I just resent him the office 360 link.  After the second time he asked me giving him the same link he never talked to me again until the budget was around 95% of the total.

Let's say the corpse was buried only a little under the plants or was put on top in heavy amounts, from what I know the gases and liquids a corpse can release can be quite acidic. This would likely kill and/or rot the plants. Nitrogen poisoning is also a common plant killer. Nitrogen is released by decomposition, so this would likely at the very least make the crops sick.

Heavy amounts of poisons and chemicals on the corpse would also effect the plants depending on what chemicals they are. Some chemicals would burn the roots or deprive the soil of nutrients.

Your suicide attempt and constantly begging her to have you back is emotionally abusive even though that wasn‚Äôt your intent.

Hard Rock stadium seats 65,000. Miami has 11,000 undergrad. It's 45 minutes from campus, and in case you didn't know football is generally easier to enjoy on television from your couch with AC than a muggy night in Miami. 

On top of that, most of UM's alumni live out of state, and South Florida is not easy to get to for a casual game. Just among my social circles of Miami alumni, none of us live anywhere close to Florida. There are few good jobs down there, and Miami gave us a decent enough education to find a bag somewhere else.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Aight everything past here is my oppionion don't go hating me.

1: The bible is not a dictionary and probobly says almost nothing related to random conspiracies.

2: Things may have been messed up or detailes lost in translation. Example: In the story on how the earth was made in 6 days, it doesn't actually say days, it is just time periods \[keep reading I talk about this more.\]

3: It is not a fact book. Many things are not meant to be taken litterally. Going back to the six days thing, I don't believe it was made like that. I don't think they were lying, I think they were just trying to give us the ideas and reasons for things. If 100% of things were meant to be taken seriously, why is there so much evidence for a natural earth creation? I still believe God made the earth, I just don't believe it was made in 6 ""time periods"" and like that.

Here is another example:  
""Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly adestroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.""  
Does that sound like a very merciful heavenly thing? No, because this is not meant to be taken litterally. If I said someone attemted to murder another by dropping an anvil on their head, you would be horrified. Of course, if I say it's in a cartoon, then you would not think anything of it. This kind of storytelling was meant to show power and strength, not be a history lesson.",1633046469

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Someone who gaslights is not going to apologize or stop from just a polite mention that they‚Äôre gaslighting. They‚Äôre just going to go harder until you stop pushing back, or reverse it on you. Him saying that you are gaslighting him is further gaslighting on his part, an abuser telling his victim that she is the abusive one. He will never approach any argument in good faith, he is not willing to admit what he dies or treat you better. Trying to argue with a gaslighter is futile bc while you are genuinely trying to fix the relationship, he wants to continue gaslighting and to convince you that you were abusive.

Start keeping a journal somewhere he cannot find, like a password protected Word document or an app on your password protected phone. At the end of every day, write down what happened between you two, and what he is trying to say happened. That way the next week or a month from now when he brings up that ‚Äúyou choked him that one time‚Äù, you‚Äôll have proof in your own writing of what really happened. Maybe seeing it all written out will help you realize he‚Äôs no good for you.

Gaslighting abusers deliberately try to rewrite reality, convincing their victims that they can‚Äôt trust their memories, feelings, or even the physical world. You have a bruise on your thigh, physical proof that he hit you hard enough to cause trauma, but he‚Äôs saying he lightly hit your butt? That‚Äôs not even the same place, and you‚Äôre considering he might be right. Even if you did blackout from a ptsd reaction, he was the one who caused it. If he wasn‚Äôt tickling you against your will, then you would never have panicked enough to hit him. And you passed out! A good bf would feel alarmed and sorry that their gf lost consciousness bc of tickling, but no, he‚Äôs upset with you?

You should just leave, and break up with him over phone or text, since he‚Äôs abuse and threatens to hurt himself when you try in person. If he says he‚Äôll hurt himself, tell him you‚Äôll call 911 for him. And if he continues, do it. If he truly were mentally ill enough to be suicidal, then he actually does need mental health intervention. Professional medical help is absolutely the best thing a suicidal person needs, not a non-medically trained girlfriend. Just leave him, take care of yourself.",1633046469

So you can always use it as trade bait to get something u really want reason I say that is cause I got the 300sl Mercedes with the gull wing doors from this year and even tho I didn't want that casting at all I was able to trade that and a dodge ram green machine to get the skyline gtr35 soup from 2020 and a nascar authentics liquid color.

"YouShouldKnow","t5_2r94o","Raynaud's runs in my family. My grandma had one finger completely amputated in two surgeries. First the doctors amputated her middle finger at the middle joint but they weren't confident they removed all the gangrene so they did the second surgery the next day and removed the rest of her finger including the knuckle, then they kinda moved the ring finger and the pinkie finger closer to the pointer finger to create less space where the finger was removed. After the surgeries, she had to switch to wearing mittens instead of gloves. It skipped my mom's generation but I have it and one of my nieces also has it.  It comes on quickly with me and for this reason, I carry high quality gloves in my purse. It takes longer for the feeling to return to my fingers and for the white color to change back to normal color.  I have noticed that putting my cold hands in fresh sink full of hot soapy dish water really speeds up the process of getting the bloodflow back down to my fingertips. It feels so much better when my fingers are warmed up to a good temperature. Y'all be safe and be serious about protecting your fingers. Amputation is only for the most severe cases of Raynaud's but it does happen and the recovery time seems to take forever because you use your hands for everything. You don't realize how important one single finger is to everything you do until the doctors have to cut one off and you spend a few months re-learning how to write, sign your name, type, button a shirt, turn on your car, boil water, fold clothes, brush your teeth, take a drink of your coffee, etc. I hope I still have all my fingers and toes when I die but my case is serious (not yet severe) so I'm think I'm just postponing the inevitable.",1633046470

The venues benefit by not having to support a whole ticketing infrastructure, while the ticket agency benefits by having a monopoly over that venue's bookings.

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","Some thoughts on your inventory of minis. You've got four right now (2 same mold, different plastic). The stamped judge is a pretty good flyer, but it falls short as a mid-rnage due to its weight. The weight ratio between mini disc and the mini basket chains are especially exaggerated, and this results in a lot of spit outs on puts even inside C1. I see you've got the Zing Pico (with the hand eye branding). Those are brilliant as can toppers, and they're good on the mini course for scrambles, and ace runs in the 15 meter range. After that they are too short-flighted or too light weight for other field work. Zing does, however, have one of the better hyzer flip mid ranges in the market: the Cozmo. MOQ is 100 units, putting them around US$200 to get an order, but that includes your custom stamp. If you want the best hyzer flip mid range, it's actually the Little Flyers Promotions' 4.25"" Little Flyer, but there are two trade offs for your players. First, they don't have the range of the Cozmo and will turnover (not good or bad, just will), and Secondly, my experience is the foil stamps do not hold up as well on their particular plastics. That's not a performance issue for the disc, but for the stamp. Pass on their Orb; experts only. It weighs nothing is dome-y and soft as hell, but it will hold a huge stamp. They promote it as a good indoor flyer, but with a few months practice I can get over a hundred feet out of it on the course. The MVP nano offering you have are great. Both fly very similarly, but I find the Proton plastic takes a lot longer to beat in. If a player tries to center their minis bag around the nano, I recommend sticking to one plastic. If you want to splurge on a really versatile mini that takes the place of that Judge, is more puttable, and is an excellent Fairway Driver, go for the Kastaplast Mini Berg. That thing can hold any angle, fights nice with the wind, and is so fun watch fly. I have a soft spot for the Mini Wizard, but it has a lot of flight path overlap with other molds. Anyway, congrats on the year! I'm genuinely glad you're still around.",1633046470

Also, do some calculations. If you work additional hours and have to pay more childcare then your universal credit might go up (UC should have an element to cover 85% of childcare fees up to about ¬£650/month), the figures depend on your exact situation but this might be something that you've overlooked so far. I've got some spreadsheets my wife and I used to calculate how changing jobs would affect our universal credit and overall situation. I'll put some links here tomorrow in case they help at all.

As others have said, make sure your council tax is correct for the fact you're the only adult living at your address. Make sure your don't have your ex on your car insurance if that makes it any more expensive.

Might be worth asking your housing association (or whoever administers your service charge) as they may be able to give you a bit of a discount to help out your situation.

Figure out how long your various debts are going to last for and what you'll be able to get rid of first, for example if you can find some extra dough to pay off your furniture then that's an extra 25/month you have to get by with.

Also, spectively, as the divorce gets discussed, you might be able to get him to relinquish his share in the flat in return for you forgiving the fact he's left you with the loan for his car (which he's now sold). Might not directly help your month to month situation but could be beneficial in the long run.

"CoronavirusUK","t5_2f3oes","Here goes my attempt at a rough guess - consider this also as notice that just because I'm not keeping up daily comments doesn't mean my days of writing long (possibly too long) comments on here are over!

First, we need a value for population susceptibility. Essentially, if you give each person a value between 0 (totally immune) and 1 (totally susceptible), add them up and take the average, what do we get? Obviously at one extreme you have young, healthy double vaccinated people who've also been recently infected (susceptibility close to zero), and older people who have been well isolated up to now and never exposed to the virus, but are also anti-vaxxers (susceptibility close to one).

Obviously I could go through a whole complicated series of calculations for this, but about six weeks ago I had a value of about 0.33 for my model. Suppose I drop that to 0.25 or so to account for more vaccines and infections since then.

We then need to determine how many people are newly susceptible each day. There's a lot of debate on waning immunity right now, so I'm not going to wade into that and just use values for common cold coronaviruses which are better understood - immunity seems to last about 3 years on average. Again, because I'm lazy I'll approximate that as 1,000 days. So, of the 50 million or so equivalent people who are immune, 0.1% of them will become newly susceptible again each day, or about 50,000.

The unfortunate consequence of this is that unless we can get immunity that is much longer-lasting than that for other cold coronaviruses, it seems unlikely that we're going to see case numbers drop too much. This is because we're going to see a constant refilling of the susceptible pool. Until recently, a lot of models could simply ignore this since we know that immunity is fairly durable over timescales of months. Obviously though, waning has to be considered when we're talking about longer timescales of managing COVID over several years.

The good news though is that second and subsequent infections would be expected to be milder than first infections (on average of course, doesn't rule out some poor bastard getting COVID three times and being hospitalised every time). I think that that is now a more realistic goal that us hitting a point where cases just go into terminal decline. Hopefully we see improvements in treatment, more people having milder infections through built-up immunity, and boosters to top it up for the clinically vulnerable. 

It'd be a pleasant surprise to see cases just drop off a cliff at some point and keep going down, but based on what we know I'm not holding my breath. Sorry this comment was a bit of a downer. Nevertheless, I tried to include an optimistic note towards the end.",1633046471

Edits are increasingly slanted in trying to establish Good Players and Bad Players and making sure we root for who the edit tells us is a Good Player, and even given that Ghost Island's edit was really bad.  Like how a single weird moment with a seashell early on was the sole reason we were ever given for why Sebastian voted Wendell.  The show just doesn't understand anymore how to portray people's social skills and meaningful relationships, it can only portray Strategy versus Bad Strategy (or its idea of that at least), and admittedly Angela had bad strategy and so that's all we saw was her being a bad strategist and the Good Players calling her out as such.",1633046471

We're talking about the only state for _thousands of miles around_ that still criminalizes cannabis, where their Gov denied it had _any_ legitimate medical applications .

Regardless of how you, or anyone feels about cannabis use I'm sure you'll agree that Idaho's position goes far beyond reasonable and has entered into intentionally wasting their taxpayer's resources - and demonstrates how the state's leadership is predisposed to ignore the world around them (not to mention the hypocrisy of their state GOP: the party of ""small government"" and ""personal responsibility"" legislating the exact opposite...)

After that, I'd move on to his Romantic operas. *The Flying Dutchman* makes a great first opera. The style will feel familiar, but you'll clearly hear some Wagnerian staples, albeit in a somewhat unrefined form. 

Once you've gone through the Romantic operas, you can either go forward into The Ring cycle and *Tristan and Isolde*, or back to his early works which will feel positively old-fashioned by contrast. 

For the operas, there are lots of good recordings, but keep in mind that opera is meant to be seen, too, not just heard. Settle in for the night with a good translation if you need it, and let yourself get swept away.",1633046473

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/Sahij_K/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

I started solidifying my views after 9/11, but especially in the run up to the Iraq war. I called bullshit on WMDs and all that other nonsense and i was right. The reasons didn't become apparent right away however, it was only until later that I realized it was simply a perpetuation of the military-industrial complex. Ie weapons manufacturers/warhawk politicians/private contractors.

I resolidified My views after the election of Barack Obama and the whiplash inducing hypocrisy of conservatives to his election. Nothing that has happened since then has given me one iota of reason to change my politics. 

The sad fact is that in the US at least, Republicans and Democrats agree on 95% of the issues, maybe more. This is the downside of a two-party system most of our choices aren't real choices at all.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The irony is, SB BRD and ShB BRD aren't really all that different. The only things they took away from BRD in ShB were the crit buff and need to upkeep it, its dependence on crit (which was arguably a QoL change that was much needed), Foe Requium, the role skill palasade, and its MP and TP regen, the later two of which were no longer needed in the game because of the removal of TP and changes they made to MP management this expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

Gameplay wise, nothing has changed. Most of the things people complain about with ShB BRD--the way songs and certain other skills line up, how bad Army's Paeon feels, the fact that our buffs don't affect us-- were present in SB too. I think people were just so obsessed with the idea that they got rid of the cast times BRD had in HW that it took them a good 2-4 years to realize that the job wasn't as good as they hyped it up to be in SB, and was, in fact, always just....""fine.""",1633046476

I remember being terrified and thought thought if I found my dog I would be OK. My dog was my best friend, my ride or die. I could see and hear all my friends but I wasn't sure if they were in my dimension or not. I knew my pup would make everything better. 
I tried calling out and eventually I saw her. Everything was OK. She came up to me and when I reached out she turned into cardboard cutouts slices as well. I have never been so scared in my life.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","For some people they have medical conditions that makes walking difficult to impossible at times. But just like everyone else they have good and bad days. I will likely end up in a wheelchair eventually. My right knee is *fuuuucked up*. Lots and lots of damaged and so unstable that I do more damage constantly by just moving and I‚Äôm hyper mobile and that‚Äôs also getting worse with time. I will still be able to stand up and walk occasionally once I get to the point of needing a chair. Just like how it is right now, some days it‚Äôs better and I move around with no signs of any pain or limitations. And some days are really bad and my hips and ankles and knees are really unstable and I have a heavy limp and can barely move around because every step is literal torture.

ETA: and just to be clear, even on my worst days I‚Äôm in pain. I‚Äôm never not in pain. The fact that I often look perfectly fine and show absolutely no sign of being in any pain doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not in pain. It means I am used to it. It means that this is my normal. It means that I have been in constant pain for so long that I stopped showing any signs of it. It doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt. It does. It‚Äôs really fucking hurts and it does all the fucking time and it never ever stops. It doesn‚Äôt hurt less than it used to. I just learned to accept it as normal because it is and stopped paying attention to it. I still feel it. But pain is a warning signal. It‚Äôs a sign that something is wrong and if you suffer from chronic pain that‚Äôs not the case, there is nothing wrong you need to pay attention to. No wound or injuries. It just is. And focusing on it does nothing. So you stop. And you look fine from the outside and you act fine most of the time because there is no other choice. You live with it or you die. And moaning about it does nothing. It changes nothing. So as long as it‚Äôs just your normal levels and normal kind of pain you adapt and you just keep going like it‚Äôs not there because you can‚Äôt rest so that it‚Äôll heal. It won‚Äôt. This is permanent. This is why chronic pain patients doesn‚Äôt look like they are in pain. Why they look fine. Costs to much energy to walk around moaning and grunting and grimacing all the time. And you don‚Äôt have the energy. Eventually you adapt and stop showing any outward signs of pain. Not because it stops hurting but because you accept that this is normal now. And you adapt how you move to minimize triggering pain. And that‚Äôs not visible to others. Especially not to random people. Especially not on a good day, in a good moment. Others don‚Äôt see the suffering that it can trigger. Because they don‚Äôt see you for the three days after you did something that ‚Äúproves‚Äù you are really fine and faking. When you don‚Äôt leave your house because you can‚Äôt get out of bed and you can‚Äôt walk or move because it hurts so much.",1633046477

"LifeAfterNarcissism","t5_30biu","Just a small rant: 

I hate when people cling over family to escape boredom and/or pursuit a life meaning. Life is about dopamine and other hormones, *you* determine what triggers this for you, like escalating, playing dominoes with an elderly person, writing a book or even reforesting a small plot of land, you don't have to take the ""easy"" way out everytime you face a struggle, sometimes they even *aren't* the right one (like all people who regret having children find out, or people that marry someone who doesn't want kids and then 15 years later expect them to ""come around"" and cry out to many bored friends that *just found out* that not wanting kids was for *real*).

But returning to you and your loneliness I'm 26 and mostly ""family less"" (meaning no kids, no parents, no siblings, no nothing except a handful of cousins I haven't seen in years and half of dozen of uncles and aunts that, when they die, won't make my life anymore loner than already is), so here's a tip from a pro in ""loner's life"": You have to be the one that isn't shy or ashamed to make mistakes, to turn around and start all over because you want to see if the other side is more beautiful.

Putting in another words: be the shameless person (we call it ""the wooden face"" here) and instead of waiting for life to be interesting and meaningful *initiate* stuff. Go to a club, be the one that's the exact opposite of shy and talk to people, be the one that starts a conversation instead the one waiting for someone else and exchange numbers, go backpacking in somewhere that isn't really #1 for a family-friendly tour and be the one there for other backpackers, offer help and be considerate over younger people there, go to a vacation in somewhere that people aren't really interested in going.

Meet. New. Types. Of. People. 

As a goth there's always someone who does the cross sign when they see me, probably thinking I worship the devil or can't stop being sad and I find it awesome I don't have to talk to them but if you reach me IRL without saying anything you'll see that I can't stop making jokes and I know more about Christ than they'll ever do. You loose more of not wanting to talk to different people than you'll ever know, they have different opinions and backgrounds and some of them will add up to your life and make it way more interesting.

You'll meet people so different, so many interesting places that you wouldn't by having a family and going for family-friendly espaces that your life won't be boring/meaningless anymore but that requires being a wooden face and being open to everything you never experienced just for the fun.

That's how I got here, still not wanting kids and having friends almost at the age of 30 and honestly I can't say my life would be this enjoyable if I were to take the ""easy"" way out of loneliness and marry to the first guy that wants to play house at the age of 22 and have my first born at the age of 23.",1633046477

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","#### Hello **isaias118**,

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Someone can help me this biology question

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

Please delete this post and I am excited to receive your question again with everything well formulated and in compliance with our subreddit rules, Reddit rules and its T&amp;C.

Do read up our subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/about/rules) so you are cognizant of how things work here!

"EstrangedAdultChild","t5_333pr","Okay, I'll try to respond to all of your points in order.

1.) RE evidence: You made several bold claims, and I broke them down and responded to each. Despite the fact that the burden of proof is on you to justify your claims, I actually did some research and looked for proof that you might be correct -- I had never heard such a thing, that CPTSD and SPD were essentially the same, so I looked into it. I shared the best of what I could find in support of *your* position. I wasn't able to find any proof that you were correct (doesn't mean it's not out there, but nonetheless I didn't find anything). However, you weren't far off, in some respect; the article I shared was a hypothesis that CPTSD and BPD could be essentially the same condition, in most cases. Will there be a consensus that this is true? I don't know. But I thought it was really interesting. So, your concept actually lined up with the proposal of this peer-reviewed article -- you just got the personality disorder wrong. It did not help prove your specific claim, but I do think it was interesting and worth keeping note of. 

Of course I trust doctors, experts etc. of today more than the I would the ones of 200 years ago, and I understand that psychology is a relatively green field. I'm very curious and excited to learn what discoveries will be made about human psychology in my lifetime. I didn't make, like, an ""appeal to time"" in my criticism of your position, so I'm not sure how relevant this is. If this is your way of implying that psychologists are exempt from providing evidence for their claims, then you're wrong about that. People can't just make things up and insist they are true without evidence, especially things that are not common knowledge. I shared the definitions of SPD, PTSD, symptom, etc. that are provided by the American Psychological Assocoation, and worked off of those. They are based on consensus in the field, and are some of, if not the most credible definitions we have to reference for the terms we've discussed. 

Again, I don't fully understand the difference between a clinical model and a 'trauma model'. Do they not work together or recognize each other? It's difficult for me to comment on this, because you seem to have a knowledge bias -- you clearly seem to know something that I don't know, and you're not explaining it well. I tried to research it, and had no luck. Ultimately, it didn't matter -- it was irrelevant to the core of my argument anyway. 

The evidence you need to justify your claims probably comes from an expert in a related field, in a peer-reviewed journal, like the one I shared. It may come from a medical or scientific institution. You and I probably can't retrieve evidence firsthand for this subject, because we don't have expertise in it. 

I'm not criticizing you for being any kind of psychologist or ""institutional agent"". All I did was criticize your position, and I criticized you for sharing it publicly because I thought it was irresponsible. Misinformation is a real problem these days, as I'm sure you know. But if you really believe I was criticizing you for being a bad psychologist, then I'm not sure how strong of a philosopher you are. I never implied such a thing.

RE stigma: I'm actually not 'touchy' about any disorder, and on the contrary, am a strong advocate for not stigmatizing mental health issues. I don't stigmatize SPD or anyone who has it, nor would I stigmatize myself if I did -- that goes for any personality disorder, mood disorder, etc. The motivation behind this criticism has nothing to do with stigmatizing -- you just assumed that (I figured at some point you would).

RE SPD: If the divergence in our views stems from being ""team clinical lens"" vs. ""team not-clinical lens"" (again, I don't fully understand what that means... is it an academic lens?), or ""pro-instituition"" vs. ""anti-instituition"", then perhaps we are at a stalemate of some kind. I have no good reason to not value a clinical, institutional lens of the field of psychology (and I'm not certain you do, either). 

(By the way, if ""SPD people think everyone has a disorder""... then maybe *you* have SPD ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) 

(I am kidding, but I had to say it)

I don't deny that SPD or other personality disorders and autism share some characteristics, or that they are comparable.

RE my experience: by asking if there is a term to describe my experience, I'm not looking for ""institutional  validation"". I asked because I was just curious! I know that my experience is valid, whatever it is.

RE anhedonia: Anhedonia is still not the appropriate term to describe the experience I described in my original post. The definition of it does not align with my experience, I explained this twice. 

RE non-prescription: I appreciate your non-prescription. I'll stick to what my doctors recommend for my health, though üôÇ

RE discarding your position: again, I'm critcizing your position because I don't think your claims are scientifically accurate or philosophically sound. I think we discovered where the main divergence comes from, so that's some progress, at least.",1633046482

&gt; Scarlett Johansson and Disney have settled a breach of contract lawsuit over the star&amp;#039;s Black Widow payday, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

&gt; Disney Studios chairman Alan Bergman added: &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding Black Widow. We appreciate her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney&amp;#039;s Tower of Terror.""

&gt; At the time of the complaint, a Disney spokesperson said, in part, &amp;quot;The lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.&amp;quot; CAA co-chairman Bryan Lourd shot back that Disney &amp;quot;Shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic, in an attempt to make her appear to be someone they and I know she isn&amp;#039;t.""

Anger seems to be the emotion you are eluding to when you talk about outburst. 

Anger for someone reason seems to be an emotion that acceptable to have as a man. This all stems from those damn lions eating humans way back in the day. Like waaaayyy back. So being strong while women stayed back was a must back then. Gender roles were actually needed. Now n days we don‚Äôt need it, but men still have this ingrained in them.

From the little I know, APC uses sanforized denim that shouldn't shrink significantly when washed, but budget 3-5% shrink which could equate to an inch in the inseam length. The waist could similarly shrink but it stretches out far easier than the inseam would.

Most folk say APC stretches a lot. Therefore, buy the cut that is right for you in the seat, thighs, rise, leg opening, inseam. Then choose the size where the waist starts off being snug to button at the top, and allowing 1.5"" stretch to become perfect.",1633046483

- A six-member Hall of Shame‚ÄîNextEra Energy (parent of Florida Power &amp; Light and others), Duke Energy, Southern Company, Dominion Energy, Exelon, and DTE Energy‚Äîperpetrated 94% of all shutoffs documented. NextEra alone accounted for nearly half.
- Duke Energy and DTE Energy together received $845 million, more than 75% of the tax bailout money the report identified in the utility sector. They cut off customers' power more than 203,000 times. Their tax bailouts provided enough unexpected revenue to forgive the underlying unpaid bills more than 150 times.",1633046483

"Skincare_Addiction","t5_3fwbd","You have like 5 exfoliating acids here. You basically just need to choose one. The SA mask, SA cleanser, BHA serum are all the same active ingredient, salicylic acid. I would probably use any one of these products 2-3 times a week. You really don‚Äôt need them all. It‚Äôs the same thing in three different vehicles. The AHA/BHA peel is again salicylic acid and also AHA, so I wouldn‚Äôt include this in your routine at all really and extremely sparingly if you use any of the other SA products regularly. The AHA/BHA peel is so strong it‚Äôs not available in many countries so use caution with it. I‚Äôd work up to acclimation to the other lower % products you have before introducing this. You need sunscreen in the daytime if you use these.

The retinol should be used PM only with no other actives on your face at the same time. You also need sunscreen in the daytime if you use this. 

The HA can be used on damp skin day or night with any combo of other products. 

The niacinamide is too strong of a % for a lot of people, the ideal studied concentration is between 4-6%. It can be used day or night with most other products. For me it causes redness and irritation at that concentration, and I have better success sourcing it from my moisturizer with nia as an additive. It‚Äôs in tons of things, you can get it from elsewhere if you need to. 

I have a prescription azelaic acid but I don‚Äôt have any experience with that one so I‚Äôm not comfortable commenting on it, but I use my 15% Finacea layered after tretinoin (retinoid) in the PM. It says I can also use it in the AM. I am not sure what conflicts it holds with other products.

"marketing","t5_2qhmg","&gt;Would it be okay to express that being full time would help me to feel secure and stay with the company and grow vs contract?

Absolutely! Doesn't hurt to ask. Don't take a contract job if you don't feel comfortable with it.

Lots of companies will do this--and I dislike it. They take advantage of people new to situations like these. On paper, the contract pay can look great, and so many people fall for it. However, when you factor in the increased taxes, out of pocket medical insurance, no benefits, no paid vacation, no paid sick leave, no paid maternity leave, no paid holidays, no job security, no 401k matching, etc... you're actually getting an extreme short stick shitty deal.

In most cases, they won't open a full time employment for you, but you can negotiate the contract pay, sometimes tremendously.

I would ask if this is a contract to employment position, and if so, get it in writing--all the details--before accepting the contract. Lots of places are doing 6-mo contract to employment--kinda common now.

If it is a strictly contract job, and if you haven't done freelance or contracting before and are unfamiliar with the taxes, write offs, medical insurance, and all the other expenses, I'd certainly recommend not going that direction.",1633046484

"belgium","t5_2qhe6","Just reading some of your statements:

\- Anything less then perfect Nederlands is considered unfair, anoying and a liability by your coworkers.

Why would it be annoying or even a liability to have less than perfect Dutch? Perfect Dutch is a pretty unreasonable and unattainable standard to set, especially for people who have been here less than 5 years. They just can't achieve and you go and call them 'unfair, annoying and a liability'. Well doesn't this seem exactly the problem OP is facing? How can any foreigner enter the Belgian workforce and feel at least tolerated (let alone a little bit accepted) when that is the case?

\- They expect a position to be filled with someone to be trusted to hold down the fort when they are not there.From this sentence it appears you are looking down on people who do not speak perfect Dutch. You consider them 'less smart and less capable' as your only reason for saying this is that they are a foreigner and don't speak perfect Dutch.

Being friendly and polite is not mandatory on some jobs. Doing your job is the only thing that matters.

\- I'd say it is basic human decency to be polite to anyone unless they do something to deserve not being treated politely. This is a weird view to hold.

Don't take it personal, don't drag racism into it.

\- Well as you demonstrated with the quotes above, there is racism involved. No it's not the 'alle bruine mannen buiten' type of racism, but it still is subtle racism, considering people who do not speak Dutch perfectly to be 'annoying' and less capable.

Don't eat garlic lamb for lunch (happened once here, true story).

\- Very weird that you even included 'true story'. Why would it be so weird to eat lamb with some garlic that it warrants the 'true story'? Is it some kind of anomaly for people to eat this? It's a pretty typical dish in Belgium and eaten a lot in Belgium (and France for that matter).I've brought various leftovers of anything I'd had the day before, which probably included lamb.",1633046485

Two things I can tell you, not sure how much it'll help.  One is that if you saw one escort 20 mins after you saw the first, it's not surprising that you couldn't get very hard and couldn't have a decent orgasm.  Your body usually needs several hours to recover itself after an orgasm.  You can have multiples in one day or night, but as a rule you start to get diminishing returns after the first.

The other thing I can say is that if you're watching porn, yes, that's going to have a major impact on you eventually.  Your brain starts to rewire itself to respond to the screen and the flickering images, and it can eventually reach a point where you literally can't get wood in real life sexual situations.",1633046486

Once solved, my brain doesn't care for it anymore and would sometimes forget about it (like i cant really remember if i try, i would have to ask him) and his doesn't want to go over it or remember it again since it's solved so it works out. he helps me with stuff i have difficulty in doing, like talking to people etc. I help him set his thinking straight. He is so emotional sometimes and my analytical side cant comprehend. and of course he has difficuties in understanding why i am this way. I am pretty sure i am the first Ni dom he's had a relationship with( or probably the first he's even met). but i love him and knew he is this way before getting into a relationship with him.

"newworldgame","t5_3gmxe","UPDATE!!! Found a 100% fix! It was my network adapter. I woke up to play this morning and I had over 2000 ping! Can't believe I haven't reset my network adapter in so long. I played about 14hrs today, lag free, buttery smooth stable fps, 4K, everything cranked to max, locked st 60fps, 3090 was stable at about 70-71degrees. I kept my gpu stable and good temps by disabling all my overclocking. Ran it at factory settings. So you don't have to keep resetting your network adapter, Find and double-click Network adapters. Right-click the device listed, and click on Properties. Navigate to Power Management tab, and uncheck the option Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.

I hope this helps someone. This game is so amazing!

Found a fix. Works for me anyways. It's the post processing in the visual settings in game. On low it looks OK, but I set it to Medium. I'm running  a 3090. Everything else is very high 4K, uncapped fps, vsync off, player nameplate amount 2,  cap fps background off, dynamic scaling on. I find zooming all the way out instead of having camera so close to my character. FOV is set to 60. I avg 80fps open world and 60 in town! This does roast my 3090 to 79-80 degrees though, but fans are operating fine. I believe my card is not a faulty ftw3 ultra. But I have an extended waranty and didn't pay 2grand to baby it. One way you can tell it works,, is geforce experience overlay should open smooth and close like it's supposed to. Before, it took like 3-5 seconds to open and close.. I hope this helps. You will experience some rubber banding, but compared to what I've been dealing with ffs, it's so much better! But ya, that fukn post processing was my problem. Let me know if it worked!",1633046487

1.Fury warriors crying their eyes out about not having world buffs.

2.Ret players hoping they will buff their class this time around kek.

[3.Quest](https://3.Quest) exp being slightly better, don't worry lmao you are not gonna zoom through the game to 60 in 1 day stop crying about how it will ruin the game.

4.People still going at mages for boosting, but consider that not all people have the time to play the game for 16 hours a day like some, what's so god damn horrific about being boosted? At the end of the day isn't it more important how you preform in raids and so on then how you got 60,i get the whole ""meaningful journey"" part, but there is also people who want to experience only end game content as afk questing to some is really boring and monotonous as they don't wanna waste time in their eyes,or don't have it.

[5.World](https://5.World) buff meta is aids we all know it,no competitiveness will be lost lmao.

6.Content going out in phases as normal(12 month cycle)(also anyone who wants all the content to be released at the start need to find a hobby like for real dude sunlight doesn't kill,unless you got XP disorder.Otherwise all content will be cleared in the same month that it launches in and then wtf are you gonna do for the rest of the lifespan?)

7.Removed dots cap(happy warlock noises)

8.Bosses more hp and will now hit like a drunk father and not like a girl

9.Honestly just remove mages at this point,dUnGeOn BoStInG bAd

SO to please everyone essentially all blizzard have to do is make realms for everything,like this realm has no mages cuz fuck mage boosting am i right,and this realm has WB,a realm where ret is playable.Just go full oprah and give them a realm for them specifically tailored to their need.

Since two photons that carry the same energy are identical, it's easy to think the photon went into the electron and came out again like a car going through a tunnel. A closer analogy would be the car is destroyed and a brand new one comes out the other end of the tunnel.",1633046490

"macgaming","t5_2rk3e","I legit have a 2008 laptop at home that cannot run any linux with a recent kernel. The last ubuntu that booted up on it was ubuntu 19.10. After a lot of research, it seems that the linux kernel completely dropped support for the nvidia drivers for my 9300M GS on that laptop. Well, I can't use opensource nouveau ones there since they only do 800x600 for some reason, while the laptop screen is actually 1680x1050. So I HAVE TO run official nvidia drivers, but I cant on any up to date linux. Nice. It has core 2 duo T9500 and 4GB of RAM, so specs are not a problem. Runs Windows 10 flawlessly. I have a second old HP Compaq laptop too, from 2007 (from my dad) that is intel 2 duo T7500 with 4GB RAM and and integrated intel GMA 950 or whatever it's called iGPU. It always ran well in linux, up until recently that they seem to have also dropped support for that card. I guess they are dropping support for all older cards? And no I don't want to run Arch or compile a kernel myself lol, I have a life. I want something to install and forget. And that something is Windows. Both of those laptops are still running great on Windows 10, while they can't even boot a modern Ubuntu/Mint/elementary/any modern linux distro.

Also, even when they did boot (or if I use an older distro version) they never feel smooth, the OS feels really heavy and takes a long time to do anything and browsers also have a lot less performance. Meanwhile, in Windows 10, they both run great and are perfectly usable for casual tasks.

I'm sorry to say but, linux (at least distros that let me actually have a life, install and forget and that are compatible with everythink, like ubuntu) is very VERY heavy on old hardware. Or it won't boot at all. Those two laptops were saved by Windows 10, not linux.",1633046491

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Man this is my best thing. 
1. When you deep throat him and he‚Äôs in your throat make the roof of your mouth like the ceiling of a cathedral and press your tongue to the base of his dick. Try to make your tongue a ‚Äúwheelchair ramp‚Äù: tip high, back of the tongue low. This will help keep him in your throat longer. 
2. Use a lot of spit, deep throat him first thing because gagging will get you insane amounts of spit. 
3. When you need a break from sucking come up, put both your hands on his dick (it needs to be slick with spit for this) and twist your hands in opposite directions. Think pepper grinder motion. If he‚Äôs big enough for it you can also move up and down his dick while you‚Äôre doing this motion. If he‚Äôs not big enough for two hands use 3 fingers from both hands and ‚Äúadjust the telescope‚Äù.
4. Play with his balls while you suck his dick ‚≠êÔ∏è
5. When his dick is really slick with spit jack off just the head of his dick. Think of the kind of thing that would happen when you squeeze soap. Be gentle, use the bottom of the palm of your hand and keep only your thumb on the opposite side of his head. This is really intense for the guy, only do this in short spurts, like when you need a break from sucking, make that the first thing you do before the pepper grinder move.  Even better if you look him in the eyes and smile while you do it. 
6. Another thing you can do while catching your breath between sucking him is licking his balls.  The best way is to be in 69 position while not being on his face (this is the best way to do anything head wise. You can get wayyyy deeper into your throat that way.) From there, make your tongue flat and move your head slowly back and forth on them. Make sure your teeth are out of the way for the next part: slowly suck one of his balls into your mouth. Don‚Äôt do it too fast or it will be too intense. Repeat on the other ball. 
7. If you combine 5 and 6 you will make his legs shake
8. With him either laying down and you between his legs facing him, or kneeling in front of him: while you‚Äôre deep throating him put your hand behind his balls and gently bring them up as much as you can so you can lick his balls while he‚Äôs in your throat. 
9. Keep your tongue super flat while sucking it normally and a a medium pace lick side to side (do this while your mouth is moving up and down on his dick). 
10. Before going full head monster lick all the way around the head of his dick. Flat front of your tongue to the back of your tongue and then come back around. 
11. While sucking, go down and when you come back up add one #10 and go back down (repeat like this). 
12. Put either your lips of a flat tongue on the top of his dick and shake your head no as fast as you can. 
13. Teasing is great!!! Start by kissing around the pelvis and then little licks on the shaft and the balls and the head. (Biting on the pelvis is fun too)
14. Be conscious of your teeth
15. Look him in the eyes as much as you can
16. I‚Äôm the kind of person that is able to cum from giving head, but even if you aren‚Äôt, moan while you‚Äôre doing it every now and then. 
This is what I can think of off the top of my head but I know I‚Äôve got more stuff in here somewhere.

"DaDaABC","t5_fraqt","I tried to avoid making it personal, just addressing what came off in your post as interacting with the staff much in a way people often do with front-line staff. People sometimes post how they speak to COs, which is less than pleasant, and most of us have witnessed ""that person"" with staff in public places. I wasn't attacking you personally but disagreeing with your points as how they came off closer to that concept than I liked. I'm not trying to get into insults as that's not ""standing up for oneself"" online as much as shooting fish, but if some of this comes off as personal attacks it's just in reaction as really, at this point we all have bigger worries. Still, here goes.

I prefer to try to be positive online, but hey it's the curse of social media, but outside of that I am always polite, respectful and firm when I have to be realising who I am addressing and their motivations and power to change things. I treat anyone the same, CEO to entry-level part time school kid, as humans and in a friendly manner.  I may just be civil and cold if they are jerks, and I don't bow and scrape but nor do I act unaware the situation may require compromises. Even if customer service reps are less than helpful, or have attitude, I bear in mind their lives. They usually take a lot of shit. That any of us work at Dada at all means we have taken some based on the compromise of advantages.

In terms of Dada, they have systems including their awful 30% base pay for a no show, but they won't change it. Any time, like with other things, I've been mistreated in a way that is not simply system wide and someone can alter, I've asked them do so and it's been fine. They won't increase my pay any more than anyone else's, so I have to accept it or move on. If they didn't fine you for the other day maybe it was luck, or are you suggesting that your dealings with them mean they have marked you out for special treatment, afraid of repercussions?

I have been given favourable consideration quite often which may be for any reason, but I'm just nice, respectful and voice complaints politely, not expecting much beyond what is typically done.

I don't need to talk about how I have schooled them in any way. I can't see how sending in examples of their unprofessionalism does a thing, and really I doubt they differentiate you based on this. They seem to play favourites, they have singled people out for unpleasant treatment, but that criteria is unlikely connects to how you anyone ""gets them flustered"", or argues a point with them.

There is a difference between ""taking shit"" and accepting the system you agree to, like working at Dada, or are stuck in, like tax rules or laws of any one place.

That you went to personal insults to whomever disagreed, inferring me but hey, is perhaps telling.

I'm actually like myself very much, thanks, but can separate ""not taking shit"", which I don't, and standing up for myself respectfully and nicely to whomever can affect change as much as possible. This without sounding at least somewhat entitled and pleased about harassing low-level staff, no matter how they behave, and as if that entitles one to special treatment, which at least your tone conveyed even if that was not what you actually do.",1633046491

"churning","t5_2vrf0","Hey, newbie here - hope I provided everything for your help!

My Credit Score is in the 800s and I pay off my cards each month.

I currently have (from newest to oldest):

1. Chase Sapphire Preferred (100k bonus offer from June of this year)

2. Chase Slate (2017 - $1800)

3. Google Store Financing Account / Synchrony Bank (2016 - $1024)

4. Bank of America MLB World Mastercard (2016)

5. Bank of America Better Balance Rewards (2014)

6. Chase Freedom (2005)

I have some big purchases / upgrades to make during this last quarter and with the holidays coming up (studio equipment, new laptop, new TV, vacation, etc) so shouldn't have a problem with hitting the minimum spend limit. For reference, I got the 100k CSP bonus in the first month buying studio equipment and upgrading furniture.

No need for MS.

I'm open to applying for a business card as I do photography on the side, but it's not a registered business and I mostly break even on buying gear vs taking on paid gigs throughout the year.

Not really looking into churning long-term, mostly just looking for the best bonus offer to go with my current credit card stack for the rest of the year.

I don't travel much so was thinking of applying for the Amex Platinum Card to get the 125k MR points.

I looked at the flow-chart though and it said that Amex has a 5-credit card limit? I don't mind closing the Chase Slate and my Google Store Financing Accounts as I don't really use or benefit from either and they have the lowest credit limits. Shouldn't ding my score too much since they're relatively new and my total combined credit is a little under $50k.

Wondering if there's a better option as far as cash back or another non-Sapphire Chase card to combine UR points. Get the Amex or a Chase Business Card? If it's anything travel-related I'd prefer something that would work well with Delta (I live in Atlanta).

I get a max ~3.3% in cash back from my MLB World Mastercard for online purchases each quarter (up to a combined $2500), 5X points in Q4 for PayPal transactions using the Chase Freedom (up to a combined $1500), and the normal multipliers from the Chase Sapphire Preferred for Travel and Dining, etc.",1633046491

So, please share this ""other side"" of whatever issue you're referring to. I'm a pretty open-minded guy. For example, I don't agree with him on healthcare. I believe in universal healthcare.

"fixingmovies","t5_3bqjz","Arwen was originally supposed to accompany Haldir and the Lothlorien/Rivendell host to Helm‚Äôs Deep and participate in the battle there so I would just reincorporate that plot detail into the trilogy and then have Arwen fill the roles that Halbarad, Elladan, and Elrohir played in the Return of the King book as Aragorn‚Äôs companions when he ventures into the Paths of the Dead. As for Eowyn, I would just reincorporate the deleted footage of fighting the orcs that manage to get into the caverns of Helm‚Äôs Deep where the women and children are hiding.

Also, footage was filmed of Arwen visiting Galadriel in Lothlorien before leaving to fight at Helm‚Äôs Deep, so if you wanted to reincorporate that plotline into The Two Towers, then I would argue that it would give Galadriel a more prominent role in the trilogy; at least in the second film.",1633046491

Totally agree. BUT, you can't expect a person to change mid-conversation. So often, I see people frustrated that they can't ""change someone's mind"" when, in practice, they mean ""get someone to admit that they were wrong immediately and to apologise"". People aren't wired that way.

People's minds change when they have the chance to think about something privately - or however they process - and are able to reconcile that new perspective with the rest of their beliefs. That takes time.

It's easy to forget on the internet that, between comments, any amount of time can pass. So, we get moments like this. Nobody was in this OP's face, making them feel bad.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","So after working in its current configuration for almost a year (docked to vizio tv, which outputs sound as digital audio (not PCM) to vizio 5 channel soundbar via ARC), suddenly my switch audio isn't working. It happened 9/28, and I believe I had already installed the latest system update about a week prior. It is persistent through any game/app.

However, audio works fully on handheld, Bluetooth, and even headphones while still docked. Since the arc cable used also is common to my firestick that is a separate input on the TV, it seems to almost surely be an issue with the TV interpreting the switch audio signal output.

I've tried power cycling, redocking, replugging everything in the I/O chain. Does anyone have any idea what may be going on here?

Note I do have CEC enabled on the TV for fire tv remote use and soundbar control on any output, but it has never caused issues before.",1633046493

1. Favourite episode is still probably episode 7, the ""Sayaka"" episode. I feel like I appreciate Sayaka more each time I watch the series. Yuu hits close to home but Sayaka is the type of character anime really needs more of. Don't wanna call her an antagonist by any means, but a lot of the traits are the type that are just butchered in typical antagonist characters.
 
 Favourite scenes are between - Episode 3 talk behind the school / Episode 7, Sayaka and Miyako (Coffee shop) chat, Episode 13 - Aquarium scene

2. I kind of failed here. Enjoyed my rewatch but I just don't like daily watching or posting so I haven't really been hitting the threads much since episode 5 and just binged it in 5 and 3 episode blocks since. oops


&amp;nbsp;

On some overall comments on the series...I'd meant to bring this up at episode 8 then just fell off the rewatch trail. I noticed when I was watching this series, specifically at 8 because I broke for the night there on my first watch, that I was projecting things onto the series that weren't part of it at all. Expectations from other yuri shows or general anime tropes that weren't really there. The show made me take a big look at how I was watching anime and any biases I had.

&amp;nbsp;

The other thing is....I adore this ending. I know a lot of people aren't so fond of it, but I think if you look at it from a character story rather than the events in the story standpoint, it's an extremely natural stopping point, especially for Yuu.",1633046493

The DVR is unlimited so I say add any show sport or team you are marginally interested in so it records them and your don't have to rely on VOD as much.

Edit: For Hulu it gets confusing. If you have no ads with Live TV added on, you have the normal Hulu library, which won't have ads. You'll have extra shows on VOD from the networks, which will have ads. Live TV will have ads. And the DVR doesn't allow skipping past ads unless you pay extra.",1633046493

No matter what path she takes it will not be easy. But things will very likely get worse the longer she is under his thumb,  unless she and her family are somehow distanced and protected from her abuser. Getting good legal help might help.

Pray somehow he gets incarcerated, goes away, or dies off before he goes too far. She needs expert help, but even that might not guarantee she can get away safely. But better off with expert help getting her and her family safe from him, then doing nothing or trying to go it alone in attempting an escape. 

You are right to be very concerned for her. Don't get yourself enmeshed, too many rescuers end up hurt or killed by abusers in domestic violence situations. Call 911 in an emergent crisis where someones safety is concerned.",1633046494

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","Defiantly the best routes are actually things that make it easier for regular players rather than things that make it more difficult for merchers.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Things like the ge showing the last 10 sales of the item you have put up to sell/are in the buying screen for would be great for example.  
&amp;nbsp;  

The reason I say adding things that make it more difficult for merchers is a bad route is unlike anti-cheat against cheaters where it should never effect a honest player in the case of RS anything put in as a hinderance to merchers could easily effect the average player worse. The reason being that merchers will have much more experience at getting around whatever is implemented while a regular player likely will not.  
A simple example can be g.e purchase limits. Lets say good old 20k limit on chrononotes (before the increase).  
If a mercher wanted to get around this while it causes them annoyance they will just use alts to buy up or make trades with their connections.  
For a regular player who just hit 99 and wants to buy the guildmaster outfit for example they have a much greater hinderance overall than the mercher who will have more resources to bypass this and also likely less need for it instantly.  
&amp;nbsp;  

While maybe not the best example this was just one of the areas where limits to stop merchers actually in truth hits regular players harder overall and to why I feel that the best route is to rather find ways to make it easier for players to see the values and make purchases.",1633046494

Most of the game mechanics and general strategies are either similar or identical to the PC version.

As for the tech tree ships being viable vs. premiums, yes in most cases they are.  There are some TT ships that are pretty bad, and others that are great.  Same goes for premiums.

If you take the time to learn the game mechanics and the stregths and weaknesses of the various ships you're playing (and playing against) you can be very successful at any tier, including tier 7 and legendary.  If you suck at the game, an OP ship usually won't compensate for it.

In other words, your skill and smarts generally play a much bigger role than the ship you're sailing.",1633046495

Us dudes struggle with finances a lot and a lot of our significant others don't worry about it. When I was with my ex, she started talking about kids and I had to quit my job and try for a better paying one. I ended up working 72+ hour weeks at a factory because I cared about them and really wanted to give them a good life. I'm sure you SO feels the same, the difference is at the end of the 72 hour weeks I was shunned and my ex never once expressed desire to help me with finances just raided my wallet every week. But yeah it's a tough scary world out there and the best thing you can do is be there for him and let him know you don't care about finances you just want to be there for him.

If I were looking at new jobs and comparing somewhere fully flexible vs somewhere enforcing 2/3 days in the office, I‚Äôd be hoping for 10-20k extra, the commute costs alone would be at least 5k.

He is a neocon who advocates for regime change in China. 

The overwhelming weight of the Adrian Zenz report, and of all later news articles was the testimony of like a half dozen Uyghur women. All of them were in their 40s or older, and multiple of them already have children. Most have also not lived in China for at least a decade.

"ProductManagement","t5_2r8ul","A few tips to improve. Not simple doable.

Needs a lot of practice.


1. Every answer you give should fit some basic mental model that you have for yourself (more on this below)

2. I use the bulletise-every-answer technique: if appropriate I start my answer with ""yes there's three reasons. First..."" This forces me to share thoughts in a first, second, third manner which automatically is more structured than a never ending paragraph

3. What I've noticed alot of people do wrong is not have commas or full stops when they talk. Always talk in sentences. Comma needs a pause. Full stop needs a longer pause.

This allows the listener to know you're shifting from one thought to the next.

This allows them to intervene at the right time without interrupting.

4. The other thing I've noticed is sharing more details than necessary. If you can answer with a yes or a no or a single word, do that first. Then share more details if required. Always start with the conclusion first.

5. Use short sentences.

6. Don't use fillers like ummm, aaaa, etc. It's better to be silent for those few seconds than use filler words.

7. I'm general, take a lot of pauses. It helps you stay on point, and allows you to think without talking.

8. Everytime you feel you're not structured or getting nervous, take 2 deep breaths. i promise you it works. I've used it, and still do very often. On video calls, the other person doesn't even notice.


Mental models - what are they

These are simple guidelines. For example:
I always answer with conclusion first.
I mostly bulletise answers
I take a few seconds before answering, even if I know the answer. I try to structure it in my head.
I don't shy away from taking pauses, even longer ones.

Mental models - how to use them
The point is create some frameworks for yourself, try them, iterate.
No model/framework is perfect. Every mental model has to be specific to the person, so create what works.

For interviews, watch sample answer videos and read interview books. Use their frameworks as the starting point.

 And alter them as you go.",1633046498

I could have finished the job in 10 minutes with a broom, yet I watch ALL THE TIME as someone waves the stupid narrow tube back and forth and back and forth, launching needles and dust and micro-fragments of NOTHING in all directions, just to get paid by the hour.....and never mind the noise and pollution, a lot of the stuff is either inconsequential or beneficial (rotting leaves, etc.) . What is wrong with some needles beside your stupid sidewalk? Lots of homeowners and business owners hire services on a regular basis, so the contractors show up and ""blow"" for two hours to meet their quota, even if there is nothing to blow. I saw a guy today who, after he finished with the blower, fired up a gas-powered mower that he pushed across a narrow strip of soaking wet grass that was maybe a half inch high. Busy work. Not far from my house is a sport court -- if you used a broom you could clear it within the aforementioned 10 minutes (and get exercise to boot!) but no, have to use the leafblower for MORE THAN AN HOUR while I am trying to sleep",1633046498

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I‚Äôm a tall guy (6‚Äô4‚Äù). I had a work colleague, female, quite tall, around 5‚Äô9‚Äù. We were very friendly. A lot of us used to go to this bar on Fridays after work for a drink. One day, this other guy was talking to me and the tall girl. He was teasing us about looking good together. I always found her quite attractive, but never thought of her that way, I don‚Äôt know why. I did consider her a good friend-from-work, I guess. Joking around as the friends we were, she grabbed me by the waist and got really close, laughing. I grabbed her by the waist as well and pulled her even closer. We both looked at each other‚Äôs eyes and stopped laughing. I felt incredibly comfortable, it was amazing having such a fine lady so close and with little height difference (compared with my usual experiences with normal sized girls). I crushed on her hard in that moment. Her being quite tall suddenly became so attractive. I don‚Äôt know why I never saw it that way before. I could also tell that she felt surprised in a good way. It lasted just a few seconds, and even the other guy noticed we had a moment. I remember, after we let each other go, he said ‚Äúwhat was that?‚Äù in a ‚ÄúI saw something happening there‚Äù tone. We blushed out of it and changed subject. Nothing ever happened between us, but I cherish that moment.

I‚Äôm telling you all this because, in my experience, a very tall woman can be something unexpected in the best possible way to a very tall guy. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh, this is what most guys feel with normal sized women!‚Äù

"Hisense","t5_3i6jn","I have a Vizio P65-F1 which is a VA panel and has awesome dark room performance. Not OLED level but definitely good.

I bought a 75 U7G not knowing it was an IPS panel. I can see now that IPS blooming is an issue in dark environments. That first night I was ready to pack it up and send it back... Except the daytime performance was so amazing that I started to question if it really matters. Well I decided to keep adjusting settings and I bought a bias light. 

After 2 weeks I can say the dark room performance is on par with my Vizio. Sometimes it's not as good as the Vizio but other times it's way better.  The extra size is definitely worth it. I sat 7 feet from my 65 and sitting 7 feet from the 75 makes for a very cinematic experience. I do believe I'm going to keep this TV for a very long time. 

By the way I have a 50 inch Panny Plasma in the bedroom and that will be getting replaced with my 65 inch Vizio and the Panny Plasma will be relegated to guest room. 

Finally OP IDK if you're aware but Hisense is offering a free [100 Day Trial](https://www.hisense-promos.com/tryit/en-US/how-it-works) of their TVs as long as you follow the requirements. If I were you I'd get the U7G and see if it's good enough for you and maybe you can snag a U8G on sale within that timeframe? Perhaps buy both and try them side by side? I myself am planning on trying a 75 TCL R646 just for peace of mind although I bought my 75 U7G for less than the price of the 65 U8G during a crazy promo Amazon had so IDK if a 75 R646 will be 80% better since it will be 80% more expensive",1633046500

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","I think it is important to note, however, that this wasn't the new goal of the Senate in 1787 when the Constitution was ratified.

No, the goal was to *increase* federal power and reduce the relative power of the Senate and the states. The previous arrangement was found to have been unstable after it nearly ripped itself apart in a span of less than a decade.

Rather than a thing to be lauded, an unchecked upper house or unicameral chamber was directly criticized and found to be inadequate.

The point of the Senate wasn't to be the most powerful check to executive power. Rather, the preexisting reality of the Senate was that it was unchecked ruling body in a confederacy that lacked a second chamber, a true executive, or an established judiciary. They voluntarily and knowing reduced their own power, but it not should  surprising if sitting Senators did not go far enough.

The reality of the present day is starkly different from 1787. Only 15 states have ever been sovereign nations, and even those 15 have spent a much larger portion of their time as subsidiary political bodies.  We have the Senate gain powers and influence it did not have even in 1787 as norms and parliamentary procedures have evolved. And we have the benefit of seeing fully out in experimentation what was only theory to the Founding Fathers. 

State elections of Senators, for instance. There were practical considerations that spurred the 17tg Amendment that only emerged after the Civil War. Notably, state legislatures had far less impact than expected and the impact they did have was largely in the form of grift and other corruption. 

An outright majority of states had adopted direct election of Senators even before the 17th was passed, in large part because it was found to be more practical and less corrupt than the alternative.",1633046501

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","How exactly does this change or alter your view? 

The Semenya situation was brought about because of a change to league rules through an attempt to be inclusive of transgender people. Rather than directly segregate based on biological sex, it would he done on the basis of T-levels. People will be excluded no matter what with any barrier. 

Why aren't men tested? Because they are the ""everyone else"" league. People competing in the men's league are also not tested for mental disabilities. But those that compete in the mental disability league, are. That's the nature of reserved leagues.

Further, there has still been no discussion on gender identity which is the foundation of trangenderism. Not all trans people wish to physcislly or hormonally transition. So the only way to be fully ""inclusive"", is to allow anyone to join any league they wish, as gender identity can't be challenged. At which point, there is no point in having separate leagues.

How exactly did this change your view? Do you see inclusion as a possibility? Or what aspect of your view was changed?",1633046501

"refrigeration","t5_2ufef","I appreciate the alternative viewpoint. (Reddit is only one of the sources of data I‚Äôm using to influence my decision, just to be clear) I‚Äôm curious about which particular variables are at play in terms of the disparity in judging whether 11 sites or 100 sites is doable/too much/to little/overwhelming for 1 or more techs. Certainly the competency and experience of the particular tech makes worlds of difference, and the depth of the PMs etc. 

You‚Äôre not the first person to question the economic viability of this equation, and I‚Äôm still continuing to wrestle with that myself. (It‚Äôs a bit harder than costing out a chicken dinner, lol). 

But the numbers you‚Äôve referenced are definitely larger than what most have speculated (including me) in terms of where the break even point is for the ratio of techs to work sites. I‚Äôm certainly not doubting that‚Äôs it‚Äôs possible to cover 100+ worksites with &lt;1 tech, but it does make me wonder ‚Äúwhat am I missing?‚Äù Is it depth of service? Skill of the tech? The particular types of equipment (walk-in vs stand alone cabinet, different manufacturers, etc).

In terms of infrastructure, our current tech already has a work truck, hand tools, power tools, general diagnostic equipment, and she already has a pipeline for parts ordering from a few supply houses that we use. So some of that is baked-in-the-cake. Obviously the cost of good gauges, pumps, extraction and storage tanks, as well as the stock of the zillion different types of refrigerant we have in our various machines wouldn‚Äôt be cheap.

"r4rMelbourne","t5_2syrh","If the aim, is just fucking, well, this cool. But speaking as one lone woman, with one perspective, sex is not necessarily connected with kindness.  It's mutual attraction, which can be any combination of factors, depending on the people involved. 

I agree with the Environmental Owl, work on yourself, connect with women as human beings. It doesn't have to be marriage, but there's usually got to be more to it, than, someone just interested in fucking any woman, we more than a collection of orifices, dude.

'They wont let me take it a step further'. It sounds like its just you wanting to have sex. It's got to be mutual. If that pull is not there, that tangible ache and tension, between two human beings, then who ever you are with, is not for you, and you are not for her

By all means, pay for sex. But don't settle for the idea that its your kindness stopping women from fucking you. Its that you haven't met one of the thousands of women in this city who really click with you. Engage a woman's brain, do this right and she will be putty inn your hands. This requires you to know her, on some level.

The actor knew it was a bad awkward line and was asked to act surprised like an idiot anyways. He said ""We were written as cheesy, callous man-children, and I think I pulled it off.

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","I do agree that it‚Äôs a very fine line to balance between. It‚Äôs why I personally want Magnus to form his own empire instead of joining Big E if he is freed. And if Magnus and the Emperor interact again, having it where Magnus is genuinely hostile and cold towards Big E would actually make it interesting to me. I think if it was written well it actually could highlight the idea that the Emperor has consequences to his actions as well.

It could even make the Emperor more human. I‚Äôd say he somehow got off the throne, having it where he slowly starts to regain his humanity could be interesting, and it could also make a unique situation where Big E realizes what he did was wrong, and starts to try and repair his relationship with Magnus, only for Magnus to basically tell him to piss off.

Have it show the power of a Primarch as well. Having an arc where Magnus finally gains control of his pride and arrogance and realizes that there‚Äôs so much potential he‚Äôs missing out on could be fascinating, and it could add onto the drama since he‚Äôs technically a renegade now.

I know it‚Äôs far fetched and difficult to pull off for 40k, but I really want to see something actually go well for Magnus, and have something happen that truly shakes up the setting. Having a Primarch that just basically says ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and goes his own way would be unique, and I think it could be a viable way to ‚Äúredeem‚Äù a traitor Primarch.",1633046505

How much ‚Äúwork‚Äù do you think this person is doing simultaneously at 6 different locations?

It‚Äôs simple supply and demand. There is demand for labor so pay has to increase if you want to be competitive. Why would anyone work for $13/hr if they can work across the street at $16/hr.

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because you did not include a minimum of one required tag in the title.

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive &amp; spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct &amp; incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets &amp; capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","There's two issues in play - one is that what is considered ""dark"" now was considered normal, acceptable and/or even righteous in a different place / time in history.  That's true for many, many things not just things dealing with the Catholic Church.   So it's good to actually research and learn how culture / society at the time viewed and understood actions as well as what was actually done, and why before judging it.

Second - yes, there were greedy, evil, sinful people in the history of the Church.  The Church doesn't deny that these people existed (and still exist today).   As long as humans make up the church here on earth - there are going to be bad ones.  On the other hand, there's also many more who exceeded the normal human standard and were particularly kind, helpful, loving, and strove for holiness in their actions.  

So for me, I won't let the bad actions of some in history (or current events) keep me away from a Church that also encourages and leads many to sainthood.  Nor do I let the fact that human society has changed and evolved over time get me upset that people decades or centuries ago acted based on what was known and believed then rather than what was known or believed now.

In fact, I take some comfort in that.  I mess up sometimes.  I don't know what to do sometimes and so sometimes I make choices that are proven to be not that great later on.  But I can look around at the Church and her history and see that plenty of others have done the same.  And a few have moved on from their mess-ups and actually turned into saints.  I doubt I'll ever reach their level, but I take solace in knowing it's possible.",1633046506

There are plenty of rule differences, but the most important one is that instead of a pitcher throwing hard from far away, they just toss the ball vertically over home plate. So the batter pretty much always has a good pitch to hit, and the game becomes more about hitting the ball where the fielders aren't, rather than just waiting for the perfect pitch, swinging for the fences every time, and usually striking out.

Why would you fatshame people in a discussion about covid?

But to get into the ""meat"" of the problem, I know you are going to say ""it's just excuses"" but consider this: 

1. processed foods are also the cheapest ones, lots of people during the years have been forced to spend less on quality food and more on cheaper alternatives and it just so happens that the cheapest (processed) foods are packed with calories. Remember that fat, sugar and salt are the friends of the food manufacturer because they allow production of a vast array of products for a fraction of the cost of better food alternatives. Because of several economic downturns many have relied on cheap foods to get by and have gotten fat because of it, either because the portions that they ate to feel full were absolutely filled with calories and had low nutritional value or because depression led them to binge eating and other kinds of disoders related to depression. Also consider that the gym costs quite a bit and many of these people hit by economic difficulties don't have time, money or both to get in shape, either at the gym or in some other environment; there are risks involved even in moderate physical activity that some just cannot afford.
2. Several people who are overweight (but this applies to underweight people too) have eating disorders and it is very difficult to get out, it's a messy and complicated process that takes time and a lot of effort.
3. Fatshaming is absolutely the worst way to motivate someone, it only makes the problem worse; only a tiny sliver of people who are being fatshamed are going to try and get in shape, the rest are either not going to care or are going to fall into depression. I'm sure as hell that you would not want a therapist who bullies you into having a different mindset.
4. Nutrition is one hell of a thing, it's compex and not everything works for everyone, add to that the fact that many people don't even know how to workout properly and you have a recipe for disaster, so education in nutrition and physical education should also be implemented in a perfect world, unfortunately they aren't.

While i may agree that eating disorders/ignorance and a less active lifestyle are not good, i would say that fatshaming only makes things worse and should stop immediately.

So in conclusion, it's not that simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the idea that you NEED massive doses of vitamines was the brainchild of Linus Pauling, a chemist who had very little idea of how vitamines affect the body, now we know that at best the super doses of vitamines are just going to be expelled with urine or feces and at worst can cause health issues.

Also Also the CDC recommends the VACCINE as the best way to prevent covid, and while masks are less effective they are nontheless useful; most of the time the reduced effectiveness is because they are either not worn or worn incorrectly (remember the mask catches spit particles, it doesn't prevent the virus from getting in).",1633046507

Avatar TLAB: He does the same as the above for the avatar universe (No one has a means to stop him if he decides to do just wreck the place the same way he did the flaxon, another verse he ca take over on his own).

HXH: This world is much larger than earth due to the dark continent which has a small share of esoteric bullshit that could kill him(Aka someone managing to wish him dead with nanaka or that girl that basically has the nen ability to automatically body snatch you if you kill her) but in terms of weakening the main defense(that being the human/ant nen users) he can easily make short work of most people and weaken the human world.

Onepiece: Logia users are basically safe from him( he doesn't have a mean to harm most if not all of them). We know that vultrimites are weaker on the inside of their bodies and I heard that there's an advanced application of haki in the manga that harms things on their insides the inside.

\- his Ult is fuckin stupid (why would I want to play as a Hulk variant...I wanna play as Iron Man.) and a waste of a slot for what I use as a glorified ""fuck this"" or ""I guess I'll res the whole team"" button. It's not actually fun to play, very slow, not even fun like Hulk, and I usually just pawn it off on a teammate.

\- His intrinsic being tied to his ability to use ranged attacks is brain dead character design...why the fuck would they do that? It's so dumb. It should have just been a super-charged meter. Dude has an infinite energy reactor as a heart...why the fuck would he run out of ammo that's made of pure energy?

But he rewards playing well, has lots of combat gameplay diversity, and so he is REALLY close to the top spot if it weren't for these two above factors that significantly undermine him.

So he loses points. Otherwise, I think his flight/ranged combo is fun as hell and his laser build (when you prioritize getting back intrinsic so you aren't playing an unfun game) are definitely more fun than I ever had playing Thor or Cap....

But I chose BP because the pounce mechanic (especially the teleport), mobility, and sick combo set + great heroics puts him above the rest. His intrinsic is great once you get the hang of it and a ton of fun to soak a TON of damage while also blitzing around the field.

Thor is just...boring, like sure, lots of shit blow up but you don't do anything complicated while playing him...just facerolling the enemy. At least Hulk you have to play well.

Hawkeye is even more boring to play....last place easily. His melee is clunky, his heroics a barely active (albeit very useful) and his ranged attacks are cool but you just end up spamming bag of tricks and it's insufferably boring....and honestly none of his ranged attacks are that fun...that ""boomerang arrow"" is clunky for barely any damage...his gravity well arrow is basically the only other thing I need to use. 

Cap is third. Solid combos, great heroics, and very fun shield play.",1633046508

But I'd never say ""you're not a Christian"" over these things. That just doesn't make sense.

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","It isn‚Äôt a monster, it‚Äôs an NPC, but she is only CR 3 which means if the party fight them at an equivalent level, that fireball is incredibly potent. But the party probably won‚Äôt have counterspelling at that level so it‚Äôs kinda splitting hairs. 

There is also an enemy that uses a 5th level fireball without casting a spell and they are only a CR 5 which means that the party probably just recently got Counterspell and will get hit hard by a fireball. As a player who got hit with a 3rd level fireball last session at level 5 and immediately had the party go from full health to under half, the spell is incredibly potent at level 5 and being unable to even defend yourself from it is kinda wack IMO (as both a player and DM).

The thing with counterspell is that it *is* super strong if the party can use it every round. However, a PC spellcaster can‚Äôt afford to cast a 3rd level spell as a reaction every turn unless you aren‚Äôt following the adventuring day mechanic, but the enemies can because they have their entire allotment of spell slots for a single fight in the day. RAW, PCs (and at my table players) don‚Äôt know what spell is being cast until the effect is applied (and they figure it out themselves). They can risk a counterspell if they can‚Äôt afford being hit by a spell but they can‚Äôt counterspell everything. My philosophy is that counterspell uses a 3rd level spell slot at least so for every counterspell that is being used, there is one less fireball or lightning bolt that day; take the time to describe the counterspell foiling an enemy‚Äôs spell that you would have otherwise have taken to describe a slow spell going into effect.

An example is as follows, here‚Äôs the mechanical chain of events:

&gt; Henry casts Disintegrate, Anadra Counterspells the Disintegrate, Henry Counterspells the Counterspell, and Daphne Counterspells Henry‚Äôs Counterspell so Anadra‚Äôs Counterspell goes through and Disintegrate fails.

I could just say that and it would be anticlimactic, or I could (and did) describe it like this:

&gt; As the mage points one finger towards you and utters some arcane words, a green beam shoots from his hand towards Anadra. Anadra raises her fist and a panel of stone sprouts from the earth to intercept the beam. The mage quickly brings his other hand forward in a chopping motion and the stone panel splits down the middle and parts leaving Anadra open to the attack. Immediately, Daphne pulls her hands together and creates a crossbar connecting the two sides of the stone panel right as the green beam passes between them. The beam strikes the crossbar and radiates across the entire stone panel, turning it into a fine dust. The mage mutters a curse, shakes his hand, and prepares for whatever he will do next.

Mechanically nothing happened besides the expenditure of a 6th level spell slot, a 5th level spell slot and two 3rd level spell slots. But narratively, I took the time that I would spend to describe 4 spells and used it to describe one interaction.",1633046509

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","""Less than 1 year development"" note that that is not necessarily unusual for vaccines; the same is true for our formerly annual flu vaccines (different strains every year).

""60k+ deaths from the vaccine itself"" a) do you have a source for that figure?, and b) is that in the US or worldwide? Note that is a 0.0153% chance of death for the US and 0.00096% for world wide; whereas I estimate the US death rate of driving crashes is 0.4896% for reference(1.35million crash deaths vs 84% of the population who have drivers references; not the most accurate comparison) and the odds of getting struck by lightning are supposedly 0.0002% (based on a far too clean 1:500000 chance figure). 60k is also less than the US's annual average deaths from the flu from 2010-2019.

With regards to forced vaccination, note that we've been forcing kids to be vaccinated for decades. Also, the question of the morality of ""forced vaccination"" (or perhaps better, ""mandated vaccination""; I'd call it ""forced vaccination"" when they arrest people and forcibly jam needles in their arms, and we're not there yet). After all, we have enforced imprisonment (for crimes) and fire codes for public safety, where individual liberty is judged to be less important than collective liberty.

I agree with you on the other points. I think that saying the vaccine doesn't work is false, but the way to combat this misinformation (and I believe it is misinformation, at best) is with honest and straightforward communication, rather than censorship.",1633046509

"Stretching","t5_2sxuw","I can‚Äôt think of any ‚Äústretch‚Äù you could give yourself that would mimic that massage technique - it sounds like your masseuse was applying pressure *across* (perpendicular to) the muscle belly, which is a common massage technique (as opposed to parallel to the direction the muscle goes). But biomechanically, that‚Äôs not something you can stretch yourself because it‚Äôs not lengthening the muscle. Your [erector spinae ](https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/erector-spinae-muscles) (the muscles running up and down either side of your spine) contract to arch your back, and are stretched by rounding your back. There is nothing you can do to pull them out to the sides because that‚Äôs not the direction the muscle runs.

To mimic the feeling of the massage you would have to foam roll or - more likely - roll over something smaller like a lacrosse ball or a peanut.

The closest thing I can think of to a similar feeling would be looking for stretches for your [Quadratus Lumborum](https://www.coachsofiafitness.com/quadratus-lumborum-stretches/) because some of them involve gentle leaning/twisting, which does give you a nice satisfying stretch across one side of your low back.

im on my phone sorry for errors. 

i just went to a diner with my boyfriend and best friend and the check was $30.01 , were on a bit of a time crunch and we had cash so i put $35 on the table and we got up to go but suddenly they stopped in their tracks and said it was weird and wrong and awkwardly stayed by the front door until the waiter came. it made a bit of scene like multiple waiting staff having quick awkward exchanges till one just rushes to grab it and goes. they eventually agreed that since the money and tip were there it was okay but it took a weird level of debate and they said they had never done that before . ive worked food service and have paid and been paid that way many times, like the change is the tip. is that wrong ? have i been an asshole unknowingly? i always thought it was a nice way to not have the server worry about an outro/closing.

&gt;You mean to don't want your kids in a school that assaults your child both mentally and physically? One that puts religion before science?

&gt;Go for it if you want. I would prefer not living any of those places.

"rant","t5_2qn2b","&gt;No breeds are inherently violent, its just a matter of shitty owners

all breeds are inherently violent, they're animals. only real distinction is their relative capacity to inflict injury.

 &gt;studies have proven that even pit bulls raised in dog fighting weren't any more aggressive to humans than other dog breeds.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/aug/03/elaine-boyer/are-pit-bulls-more-aggressive-other-dogs/

*The results found Chihuahuas and Dachshunds were the most aggressive toward both humans and other dogs. Those breeds, however, are smaller and usually inflict less-severe injuries.*

*One study of aggression done by a specialist in Australia found the pit bull terrier attacked humans at a higher level than any breed.*

*The study found 66 people died through bite-related incidents involving various types of pit bulls, which was more than any other type of dog.*

&gt;Blaming dogs for being poorly raised takes the blame off shitty owners and encourages inhumane policies like the mass execution of dogs with ""pit bull characteristics"" in the UK.

it really doesn't matter who's to blame if the fact remains a pitbull is more dangerous than a chihuahua. trying to argue that they're the same is plainly wishful thinking from pitbull enthusiasts working backwards from the conclusion they want to draw.

This would be exacerbated, not reduced, in a socialist system.

And the track record of socialist experiments are clear. Go do a quick Google search of environmental damage in the USSR (eg: needlessly slaughtering whales just to hit production quotas).

There is so much evidence that as markets advance and capital investment leads to more sophisticated economies, their environmental impact *goes down, not up.* This is what has happened in the countries that industrialized in the 19th century.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No. Its the DSMP, sadly. I love the fandom &amp; the series but Ive seen a lot of people in it, especially the ones on TikTok, Twitter &amp; Amino say they have DID &amp; their alters are the content creators or the characters they play (Ive seen some have alters of multiples of one character).

It just doesn't seem right to me, I can't see how someone can have an alter of a real person or split at any time or force alters to front. Some say they have memories of the characters they have alters as (which sounds strange to me because those memories are men blowing up blocks &amp; killing their ingame characters). It just doesnt seem like it should be possible &amp; from what I HAVE been told by others, I can't see it being true.

I can somewhat get passed it because it doesn't bother me &amp; I'm about people being who they wish to be (as in, I can tolerate it, I won't be a jerk about it, but wont like it if it makes no sense or seems crazy/stupid. If its hurting others, I'll be vocal), but I feel its watering down what DID is &amp; I don't think people actually with DID like it. I also think it makes the fandom look bad to others but that's just a drop in an lake.

So I thought, why not learn what DID from someone who has it. Learn from the source, ya know, understand it from their experiences.",1633046513

With the exception of the fact that the whole thing with Brother Four was never properly explained and made the main characters seem spectacularly dumb (was he working under Kat's orders? Or was it all Kat, and Allie never even came in direct contact with him? And if she didn't, how did she even test his loyalty? Also, how the hell did they ever think one single grunt could hide their plotting from HUNDREDS OF WORKERS?), the game was great.

Also, with the exceptions of Allie and Terra (Allie is too crazy for my tastes, and Terra is a bit immature - she's the only girl who never even kisses you, for instance), all the other girls were excellent choices for the ending. I just wish the plot wasn't set up in such a way that choosing anyone other than Kat made you feel like a complete douche; she's also the only girl that doesn't show up in the ending if you don't pick her, which further compounds that feeling.

In any case, excellent game that is definitely worth playing, especially for the amazing price of free. I'll be there on day one for any future VNs this author makes. I saw him commenting on the possibility of creating extra stories for each girl, and the mere idea of that makes me salivate (yes, even for Allie and Terra.

Sure, we do it, but we all know it's stupid. We all know it hurts kids. We all know it's not a good indicator of overall academic performance. We all know that some 18 year olds suck at test taking, don't really know the direction their life should take, or that some can't handle this absurd pressure that doesn't need to exist. It's stupid and exploitative and it waters down the quality of their overall education because it becomes more important to ace the test than be smart or hardworking. 

Using high school as a farm system does the same exact thing. A kid should have to do two a day practices to make their public high school football team. Especially if that kid has no desire to play football beyond highschool. High Schoolers shouldn't have to to go to ""optional"" practices in the summer to make a team at a public high school. Kids should be allowed to be kids. 

Stop this pretend macho, ""they can't handle the pressure"" nonsense. These are kids. My tax dollars shouldn't go to high schools to turn kids into football players. If we want elite programs, let private organizations pay for them.",1633046514

"AskConservatives","t5_2yb8u","Interesting question. I would say I am not a total purist and two important thought experiments definitely impose doubt on my framework, those of course being the Trolley and the Transplant. Interestingly, my intuition makes me react differently to each. In reality, I would probably pull the lever in the former, but I would not perform the operation in the latter. Philosophically, I support the deontological arguments over the Utilitarian arguments.

But all of this is taking place in an ethical gray area on the fringe. I think there is so much ground to cover before we get there. For example, as a minarchist and not an anarchist, if the government was only going to tax us 5% to fund roads and a military, I think a democratic process that goes against the will of, say, 20% of people to implement that tax is an acceptable thing. Let's say they even fund stuff I don't want, like public education or healthcare, and it's still only 5% - that's fine. But where we currently are is a government taking significant portions of my earnings to fund all kinds of things that I think are a waste and a significant number of Americans want to be taxed less.

For a more stark distinction, let's imagine killing 6 million Jews makes the remaining 60 million Germans happier. Utilitarians ultimately have two choices: entertain the intuition and admit that utility isn't a good framework in the fringe cases, or accept their framework as a purist and say ""yes, that's acceptable.""

Utility is a valuable thing to consider. But it can only ever override deontological natural rights at the furthest fringe.",1633046515

I don‚Äôt see Hitler as a good man or a monster.  I see him as a person who perpetrated actions I do not like.  I feel like to put emotional labels on him, gives him and people like him a power that they do not deserve.

How do you see what he is if you‚Äôre labeling him evil?  How do you fight him if you don‚Äôt know what he is?

I don‚Äôt mean to cause trouble it‚Äôs just I feel there‚Äôs a danger in moral labels, in pointing to examples and basing general rules off of them.

I agree very much for his to be presented as a cautionary tale.  I just fear if we use morally loaded words, people won‚Äôt see the tale as it is.

Most of Europe opened up a long time ago and overrun healthcare systems aren't exactly the norm in most countries.

"HaloStory","t5_2vomh","Yep. For the first few years of the war Mjolnir didn't have shields. In fact, until one of the encyclopedias retconned the Halo Wars shields into being canon, Mjolnir didn't have shields until 2551, 26 years into the war. 

Currently the timeline for Mjolnir energy shields is: 

1. 2525, Mjolnir is first used by Spartan-II teams above Chi Ceti IV
2. 2531, Spartan-II Arcadia Red Team and Team Omega receive energy shield upgrades to their Mark IV suits however the shields never enter full production, either because the technology was lost or as suggested by Dr. Halsey, the early shields were not effective enough to be worth it 
3.  2536, a captured Jackal point defense gauntlet begins the UNSC's second attempt at developing personal energy shields
4. 2551, personal energy shields first see ""mass production"" with the deployment of Mark V \[B\]
5. 2552, energy shields become standard issue for all Spartan teams

There's some wiggle room involving the dates, as we don't know when Red Team and Team Omega first received their shields, just the earliest date we've seen them. Similarly, we don't know when Mjolnir Black entered service, so it's possible that Mjolnir Black had shields prior to 2551.",1633046517

"beauty","t5_2qlac","I do mine at home because unless you‚Äôre going somewhere that charges $100 for gel manicure results are mediocre and something i can do at home for a fraction of the cost. I go to Eastern Europe and compare quality to theirs, besides all designs they draw on how they prepare nails before they apply gel is amazing but manicures also take close to 2 hours. 

Make sure you get a good lamp, 80w if you can. Good base and top, i found that colors don‚Äôt really impact how long they last. I like CND, gelish and lavender brands. 

Removing is pretty easy, you can file off top level and soak in silicone saturated cotton ball. You can use foil to wrap your fingers while they are soaking or the little clips are probably $8. You‚Äôll recoup your costs after probably 2-3 manicures. You can also invest in the efile and use it to remove the Polish. It takes a while to get used to it but you can also use it to prep your nails and do the cuticle",1633046518

This system we‚Äôre in is a mess. It‚Äôs brutal, it‚Äôs arbitrary, the requirements are constantly changing, goalposts ever moving, you‚Äôre never treated as an actual human, it requires as much if not more than skill. It‚Äôs possible to do everything ‚Äúright‚Äù and still ‚Äúfail‚Äù. I call it a meat grinder. It sucks in whole people and spits out defeated mush. 

Not succeeding in a broken system doesn‚Äôt mean you yourself are broken. 

From your perspective, all you see is getting the job or getting rejected. If you get rejected, it‚Äôs easy to assume it‚Äôs because you suck. I do it, almost all of us do. 

In reality it could be for an almost infinite number of absolutely arbitrary reasons. Ultimately, hiring is a human run process (assuming you‚Äôve managed to thwart ATS) and humans are arbitrary, illogical, cuntrags. For example, a number of studies have been done showing people with weird, hard to pronounce names that are too far down the alphabet are less likely to get hired. As a side note, fuck you, Aaron Aaronson. 

You could make it to the final round of hiring and the manager is ready to pull the trigger when a call comes in from the ceo at the 11th hour and now the job is going to his latest slam piece. 

I know none of this will make you feel better as you don‚Äôt need or want words, you need and want a decent job and a home you own. I wish I could hand you some sort of surefire formula for beating the meat grinder, but I‚Äôm kind of a fuckup and misfit myself so . . .

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","That timeline requires two simple changes:

Replace our *first-past-the-post* voting system with **ranked choice**. FPTP is what creates two-party rule, and makes slander of the opposition just as useful for getting elected as actually having a good platform. Meanwhile the biggest criticism of ranked choice is that ""it leads to boring moderate politicians who try to please everyone"". Gee how terrible

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting

There is actually progress occurring on this in the US. We just need to quit being so distracted by the latest political outrage porn so we can focus on what actually matters.

Which brings us to the second change: eliminating **ad-funding in journalism** (and unsolicited *personalization* of content from Google and social media). There *are*, actually, reasonable political candidates who run each cycle, but the news *ignores them* because the outrageous things said by Trumps and AOC's are so much better for **ratings**. And because news coverage is important for winning primaries, candidates who act like children have an edge.

The only reason that ratings matter is because ad-funded income is directly proportional to how much attention they grab, and fear and outrage are the most powerful tools for this.

They were a foe which was better than the Federation at the main advantage the Federation usually demonstrates: unity and problem-solving.

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","Just adding on to this, DO NOT wear contacts around hazardous chemicals of any kind. If eyesight is an issue, wear prescription glasses with the special over-glasses thing, or prescription safety glasses. It's more of a grey area if you wear contacts AND safety glasses, but the risks are still there. 

If you are wearing contacts, and something gets in your eye, the contact will ""grab"" it, and hold it against the surface of your eye. First aid won't work as well, since the chemical will be held between your eye and the contact, and it can ""wick"" the chemical to cover your entire pupil very quickly. With eye contamination, exposure time is the biggest factor in if the person keeps their eyesight, and contacts can make it harder to flush the eyes, thus increasing exposure time. 

The other big risk with contacts is that they can condense/absorb hazardous vapors that would then damage the eye, or react with them and produce hazardous byproducts. While there have been cases where contacts have actually protected someone from a chemical, it's one of those ""hurts more people than it helps"" situations.",1633046522

"MushroomGrowers","t5_37713","I am the r/MushroomGrowers AutoModerator. I'm a little like [Heimdallr, the gate-keeper](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3640969.jpg) for this community. Your recent submission was bounced back by my filter for one of the following reasons:

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

**1. Use only M, F or W, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or #**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

I made the same money as back then only after 15 years and much harder work at different job in a red state...almost 30 years later.  I was working 2 other gigs to be able to survive.  $15/hr is a joke for single people much less folks with kids. When the system fails the worker, we look for other options.

For now I work at home....not from home.  The pay sucks but I am happy and super appreciated, two things I didn't realize was possible.  Our budget is tight.  The kids still need help from time to time.  I don't cry every day and no longer live in almost constant pain.  Quality of life is important.

And why not reserve it only for higher level advanced graduate school courses then? Children do not see color, and these classes are teaching them to judge based on it whether that's the point of the instruction or not. But you're right about it being a catch-all - but that's because of the varying degree of the instruction... so neither side is inherently wrong, it's just that it's not taught all the same way in districts that adopt it, so people may have a different understanding of what it is based on their experience with it. You're saying that it's taught at a higher-level graduate program, but obviously it's not taught that way to children.

&gt; ideas being uncomfortable or parents not liking them is not an acceptable barometer for including something in curriculum or not.

I disagree with this to a *degree*. There's definitely things I'm uncomfortable with my child being taught at certain ages, and will not allow it.

That poor dog.  Poor you, too.   That's unconscionable treatment of both of you.  

My first inclination is to tell you to move out and contact animal control about the conditions the dog is living in.  I recognize that may be more than you're willing to do, however.   As an intermediary step, perhaps contact a husky breed rescue in your area, ask them to evaluate the dog, and talk to your grandmother about what's best for the poor dog.  

You should never believe you are supposed to accept wounds as a price of housing.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Indulge in your cravings but look for low-fat options. For example, I love Panda Express and am accustomed to eating it at least once per week. That‚Äôs horrible, right? Yes and no. Before losing weight my order was always 3-entree, with fried rice, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, and sweet fire chicken. And now I‚Äôm salivating‚Ä¶ sometimes with a soda, sometimes with other stuff eg eggrolls, etc. Now, it‚Äôs super greens instead of fried rice and absolutely zero soda; everything else is the same. If I want rice because I have a headache or something and haven‚Äôt really had enough carbs, I‚Äôll get brown rice. The greens or brown rice have very little fat and really cut down on the calorie intake. 

Same thing anywhere else, find ways to reduce your fat intake. Fat has 9 calories per gram while carbs and protein only have 4 cal/gram. Since fat is double the calories it is easy to overeat before your stomach can even signal that you‚Äôre full (satiety). 

Also, when I say look for low-fat options I don‚Äôt only mean ones labeled as ‚Äúlow-fat.‚Äù A lot of the times those products just add tons of sugar to make up the difference, so knowing what is fat and what isn‚Äôt is the best way to go. Mayo is fat, salad dressing is fat, butter, margarine, lard, crisco‚Ä¶ All fats. Even nuts like peanut butter have a good amount of fat. Not all fats are the same, saturated vs unsaturated vs trans fat; but they‚Äôre all 9 cal/gram. The difference between fat is more so going to impact blood pressure than weight loss (as I currently understand). ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol (HDL which you want more of by eating unsaturated fats) vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol ( LDL which you want to less of by limiting saturated and trans fats.)

Food IS comforting, and it is 100% OKAY to use it that way. The trick is to get to know the foods you crave and how to still eat them in moderation. I hope this helps!",1633046526

12 weeks to r14 the the absolute minimum, which if its 2 months per phase, thats 4 weeks on r14 before BWL. Which, is pretty close to classics timeline, and that is getting standing 1 every week while leveling too -- so alot of gen 1 rankers will take 13-16 weeks easily.",1633046526

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","At your height and weight you are within a healthy BMI range, so you should not be trying to lose weight.

I would recommend eating smaller portions throughout the day instead of one big meal. Or if your one meal a day is small then you absolutely need to be eating more because there's no way you would be getting the nutrients you need to stay healthy. Regardless, eating just one meal per day is not ideal. You need to intake carbs every few hours to maintain ideal energy levels. Your exhaustion is a clear sign that you haven't been eating in a healthy way.

If you really do insist on losing weight then you should know that your body will not function properly if you are starving it of energy and nutrients. I'm not going to spout ""starvation mode"" nonsense, but it is a fact that it takes energy for your body to burn energy and it is a fact that if you don't eat properly your poor nutrition will damage your body. It can damage your heart, it can damage your nervous system, it can damage your gastrointestinal system, it can weaken your bones, and so much more. If you have any issues with your GI tract or your vagus nerve it is going to cause problems for you in terms of controlling your weight. That can mean weight gain or weight loss when you don't want either. It's also going to mean chronic issues with bloating, pain, constipation and/or diarrhea, potentially hemorrhoid inflammation, and potentially other more serious problems. You should take the issues you're having now as a sign that you are making yourself sick and change your habits so that you can become healthier overall. If you can return to good health you may find it easier to control your weight so long as permanent damage has not already been done.",1633046528

What if you make a change: wake up, make coffee, take a walk, eat breakfast, etc...so you tie coffee to the walk: instead of coffee triggering breakfast, shift it so coffee triggers a walk instead, or HIIT if the weather is bad. You can do this with your evening routines as well. Maybe when you get home you do 20 squats and 10 push-ups. Maybe before bed you prep a healthy breakfast like overnight oats.

Now, what I'm about to say is a disappointing yet realistic perspective. You called an emergency hotline for a non-emergency. I am not saying that suicidality of any level does not deserve to be treated promptly and effevtively, but that hotline was designed for those actively in danger. America's mental healthcare system is so incredibly underdeveloped that the only official hotlines are still only for imminent medical emergencies. So unfortunately, those who are not actively planning to take their lives are not taken as seriously.

OP, don't take any of this to say that your problems don't matter. They do. Your feelings, no matter how mild or severe, deserve to be recognized and cared for. I really hoped that you can get connected with a therapist as soon as possible and that you can start receiving treatment.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","These institutions have deeply entrenched cultures and filters to climb that slow the process of ""discovery,"" and ""credibility."" While that obviously is what imbues them with their legitimacy in the eyes of some people, it also makes them beholden to a small set of interests, which enables their ""truth,"" to be manipulated and filtered by smaller amounts of corruption. If we tier information availability based upon these credentials, we are giving monopolistic power to a single sector of our country to determine fact and fiction, not for our final decision making process, but before we hear the options. Our solution to the issue of misinformation should be better enabling our youths to filter true information from false information, well tested theory from fake statistics or false hypotheses, not to limit their exposure to fringe beliefs. 

All we are doing is streamlining fascists job for them. We know that every well intentioned system has loopholes or means of being taken advantage of by cynical individuals. The question is, how totally can that person utilize that system? Is there a check/balance system? Individual free speech is checked by fact checking and alternative individual free speech. Institutional filtration of speech is checked by the entry requirements into that institution and the dedication of the small number of individuals within that institution who decide who is valid and who is not, sticking with those entry requirements or shirking them for personal reasons. Since the latter will fail us when we need it most not to, as a nation, I will defend the former at the expense of the latter. Vaccinated people are relatively safe from Covid. Unvaccinated people, somewhat less so. No one is safe from the mind of the propagandized. 

During the Trump administration, Fox News was cited as having inspired multiple terrorist attacks within the span of a week, against minorities. The specific wording of an ""invasion,"" at the southern border was used by multiple mass shooters. When this was addressed, in spite of the ""statistical fact,"" that immigration rates were net negative at the time and relatively low compared to under the Bush administration, Fox news continued their pushing of this agenda. There are no shortage of college professors who would repeat these falsehoods that Fox did, teach students that Keynesian economic and the Hayek model have equal merit, push false statistics in their writings which make it through their review boards, or sell their influence to wealthy donors or the teachers unions. As such, they cannot, especially without being able to prove their is even scientifically inaccurate information being presented, have, in conjunction with the elites running these small number of internet and media companies in America, the ultimate say in what gets spoken on the primary methods of communication in our country.",1633046529

That‚Äôs fair but I think this has to do with scoring and supreme spacing. Clippers offense is so outlier because of that. Oh yeah the way I would define lead ball handler is a guy who makes 70% of the decisions on the team. LeBron, Luka, Trae, Russ, etc. Kawhi and PG split the duties and are both secondary playmakers. No team can actually run the offense through Kawhi or PG and both are used best if they can score within in their spots. They aren‚Äôt point guards is what I‚Äôm saying



Rondo was good in the PO because he could shoot. When he couldn‚Äôt shoot which was the entire regular season he was one of the worst players on the Lakers



Lonzo wasn‚Äôt the Pels primary, he was a spacing wing last year. Ingram and Zion had the ball much more than he did

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","It's not pointless it's literally the only reason we can agree on what the answer to a math equation is if we say you can define the order of operations to whatever sounds easiest to you then no one agrees on anything and math falls apart. The order of operations we defined makes perfect sense and has tons of logic to support it but most importantly we all agree on it so we keep using it. If we all agree to do it left to right (which makes polynomial algebra 10 times harder) then we would do that.

The whole point of pure math is that we draw the line nowhere we just look to see what logically follows from our axioms. If we knew how to draw a line there wouldn't be math about 65 dimensional objects and some infinities that are bigger than others while still both being infinite. Everything is math because we invented math to be everything. No pure mathematician is concerned with whether what they are doing has any bearing on reality they just want to know what is possible given the set of rules we made up. 

Remember math is not and will never be a hard science it is the language we use to describe the hard sciences it is more akin to literature than to physics. Think of it like Lord of the rings JRR Tolkien made up the rules for the world and mathematicians are like the people debating whether legolas should be able to walk up the falling rocks in the hobbit.

Doctors are well aware that sex and intimacy are important parts of people's lives even if we don't openly talk about it. They are likely to be able to give you suggestions.

I also suggest that you forget about sexual intimacy for a while until he is better able to engage in it.  Has he expressed any interest in sexual intimacy or is this an assumption you are making?  He may be thinking about the relationship as a whole and its long term viability or the implications of his injuries more than any thoughts about sex.  I think that you are making a big leap assuming that his emotional distance and his feelings are about sex.  Dont assume this is about sex.

If its not sexual intimacy, I'm sure there are options for cuddling and touch. You talk about having to be gentle and careful of movements, so again, ask his Doctors and health care professionals.",1633046530

"gamemaker","t5_2qw2g","doing what your doing is good, having a variable that store the camera position where you want it to be, then when setting using camera_set_view_pos just subtract half the view size. doing this you should basically never have to worry about the camera origin.

now for the camera following the player and cursor its very simple actually, look into the lerp() function, the way it works is you give it two numbers, and a percentage, and it gives the the number between those two numbers by that percentage.

so using lerp( player.x, cursor.x, 0.5 ) for x and y you get the exact halfway point between the player and the cursor, set the camera position to that point, and there you go.

nuclear throne even plays with this a bit by making guns have a different percentage value, cross bows for example make the camera go closer to the cursor, basically letting you see farther then with other guns.",1633046530

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I don't understand the measurements at all, but if they're measuring significantly behind (I can't tell) then it's a good idea to rule out a number of things. I'd probably do the amniocentesis, full microarray, because of 3 previous early miscarriages. Most common cause of miscarriage is chromosome abnormalities in the fetus and these can increase as the couple gets older. Some can go undetected on an ultrasound. It's a good sign though that there are no additional problems apart from general growth, but there are sone conditions where restricted growth is the most common ultrasound finding as well.  Are they advising her to be tested for cmv/toxo etc? An amnio can actually test the amniotic fluid for infections as well, because your wife could have active CMV for example, but that doesn't mean fetus has the infection. Amnio can be done at 16 weeks and above, so I'd go straight to amnio in this case if the growth issue is significant and doctors are concerned. Also there can be issues with the placenta that could cause intrauterine growth restriction. I would want to discuss how significant the lack of growth is, and if they said it's very concerning then I'd just do the amnio. I had one at 16 weeks. That said, I don't understand ultrasound measurements but I do know they can be off. The further along you get, the less accurate they can be. It's nirmal to have a few days difference with due dates at times. Are they saying she's currently measuring 2 weeks behind? Did they give percentile?",1633046530

"AfghanConflict","t5_3bpbj","¬†President Joe Biden should have known ( but he has no formal background in the Marshall ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù Arts), the SecDef, and the CJCS (General Miley) that by removing technical support the Biden Administration grounded the Afghan Airforce, thus paralyzing their Army (the effective airmobile commandos). Continued pushing the narrative on how supposedly great the evacuation was‚Ä¶is just a deflection as to the failure in keeping the Afghan military &amp; government intact‚Ä¶ political optics ( that backfired, no matter how they are trying to spin it‚Ä¶or hide the truth).¬†‚Ä¶And then the Blundered airstike in Kabul, another cover for the grave mistake as to exiting Afghanistan in the first place‚Ä¶.

Many, mention the ineptitude / corruption of the Afghan Army. I agree that the Afg Army had leadership, training, and corruption issues. But there was an effective work around in place‚Ä¶and it was working.....the Biden Administration threw it all away.¬†¬†‚Ä¶.

Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) ended in 2014 - the end of NATO combat operations; then became Operation Resolute Support (ORS) in which the Afghan Army was doing the ground fighting...now important to note it was their ""Special Forces"" or more accurately their highly motivated &amp; trained air mobile Commandos that were doing the offensive operations (or defense in depth)‚Ä¶who rode to battle in M-17 or UH-60 helicopters, in sticks of three: main, supporting, and reserve squads...and doing it very successfully till they lost air support (mobility, close air support, overhead command &amp; control, reconnaissance‚Ä¶utilizing C130, C208B, AC208B, U28A, A29, MI35, MI17, UH60, &amp; MD530 aircraft). Soon after AFG Air Force stopped operations, these air mobile troops lost their ability to maneuver via air; thus frozen in place...they ran out of ammunition (no-longer being resupplied from the air), etc. The last couple months these units started to surrender after running out of munitions, food (&amp; water) most were promptly summarily executed by the Taliban. Note: the Afghan military was doing fine...yes, there was corruption....but from their corrupt and poorly trained ""conventional forces"" is where they pulled out the motivated, skilled soldiers that became their very effective air mobile operations.¬† It was the grounding of the Afghan Air Force a couple months ago, that snowballed into the capitulation of the Afghan Army / Government......this truth is being hidden from current news broadcasts. The AFG Air Force was grounded via the shutdown Bagram &amp; Kandahar, Shindand Air Bases (Kabul being only the last operating airport), and the removal of foreign civilian mission operation / maintenance of the aircraft. All USA/NATO uniform personnel could have left the theatre. Maintenance &amp; Mission operation contractors along with civilian security support (which were the Georgians as to Afghanistan) stay in place‚Ä¶.the Afghan military and government would still be intact‚Ä¶with more years ahead for greater stability.¬†¬†‚Ä¶.

A fair question to ask....if USA / NATO combat operation ceased in 2014....why did the Taliban not retake Afghanistan in 2015, or 2016, etc. And that since 2014 the Afghan Army, specifically air mobile troops were taken the fight to the Taliban.....and why in a couple months in 2021 everything quickly collapsed. In effect by grounding the Afghan Air Force....the Afghan Army was also grounded. In conclusion, the current administration threw away the progress and continued stability that was the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù in Afghanistan.¬†‚Ä¶.

NOTE: The Doha, Qatar agreement was null &amp; void by the time Trump exited his Presidency, the Taliban were not abiding to it, the Afghan government never signed fully off on it. The time table of withdrawal (&amp; how) should have been on our terms and with deep strategic thought on how to keep the Afghan government / military progressing‚Ä¶..",1633046530

"shrooms","t5_2qszq","&gt;But if the environment is the real concern, why aren't we looking into really clean energy, hydrogen?.

the simple answer is that hydrogen is expensive and inefficient. most hydrogen today is made by decomposing methane using hot steam. this process is energy intensive and releases CO2 as a by product to produce hydrogen. electrolysis can make hydrogen from water but it takes 18% more energy to make hydrogen this way than what you get back. when you finally use hydrogen about half its energy is lost to heat, when you include all the things needed to make, transport, and use hydrogen you realize that its expensive no matter what.

a pure battery system has so little energy loss that you can move about 5x as far with the same amount of energy spent making hydrogen.

hydrogen has its place in some systems but for mass energy storage and road transportation it is too expensive.",1633046531

&gt; &amp;quot;The people who fish squid are happy,&amp;quot; said Daniel Pauly, a prominent marine biologist who in the 1990s coined the phrase &amp;quot;Fishing down the food web&amp;quot; to describe how previously spurned chum were replacing bigger fish on dinner plates.

&gt; The 12 reefers active in the Pacific this past July as the Ocean Warrior was patrolling nearby had at least 196 encounters with fishing vessels during that period, according to satellite data analyzed by Global Fishing Watch, a group that supports sustainable fishing.

&gt; &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s not just a fishing company - it&amp;#039;s practically a Chinese government asset,&amp;quot; said Susi Pudjiastuti, who as Indonesia&amp;#039;s former fishing minister between 2014 and 2019 was lionized by conservationists for destroying hundreds of illegal foreign fishing vessels.

"UBC","t5_2qy2j","First off, capitalize ""Indigenous"", please and thanks, it's giving respect to their name.
I'm not going to individually address all of your questions. But I'll tell you *why* reconciliation is paramount. What it means to me is acknowledgment of the history of the land you live on, and who it belongs to originally.


This goes allllllllllllll the way back to when colonizers first arrived on Turtle Island (now the Americas). They committed genocide, killing off over 97% of the original Indigenous peoples population. 300,000 remained by the 1900's from over 10 million. Many sources say different things but here's one: https://hmh.org/library/research/genocide-of-indigenous-peoples-guide/


 Not to mention *all* the culture, traditions, languages and so much more lost. 


Here's a link, not sure if it'll work, but I know when I saw this I was speechless and horrified: https://www.facebook.com/creenativeheart/photos/a.577582069035917/577588152368642/?type=3


Then comes the residential schools. Where kids were forcibly taken from their families to far off schools, so they *couldn't* run away, and if they did, they'd die trying to get back home. Their homes being reservations, undesirable plots of land they were forced on to, many of them still don't have clean water to drink as well. This is a first world country.

The kids there from ages 3-18 were subject to abuse of all kinds. They were beaten, broken mentally and spiritually, stripped of their language, traditions, culture. They were stripped of their whole identity. They were raped, murdered, and if they did survive, they were *NEVER* the same again. 


Then the Sixties Scoop. More of stealing Indigenous children to assimilate them into European ways.


Just recently, 5,296 children have been found, buried in mass unmarked graves. There are many more to come. Just imagine what happened, and then you'll know why Indigenous peoples history should be acknowledged and known. One more reason why reconciliation matters. 


Amongst the countless other things that happened to Indigenous Peoples. There is what still *happens*. Such as racism, discrimination, intentional medical malpractice leading to *death* (look up Joyce Echaquan), disproportionate rates of violence against Indigenous peoples specifically women and girls through MMIWG. That is Indigenous women and girls going missing, being murdered, yet still little to nothing is ever done when reports are made. The Highway of Tears is directly connected to this issue, I used to live right by that highway. I saw only recently, in Colorado US, that a proclamation promoting the killing of Indigenous peoples was revoked: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/8202497002


You say your people have been colonized as well. So if you know your own history why don't you empathize with Indigenous Peoples to understand more? That'll put it into context you can sympathize with.


I understand the impacts of colonization first hand. I am Indigenous, second generation out of residential schools. I don't know my language, but I'm learning, I'm separated from my home and culture but I'm still learning. 


I moved far away because of my alcoholic father. One other aspect of the long history of injustice against Indigenous peoples. The trauma that residential school survivors face makes them cope in more ways to destroy them. I've been told we were given alcohol to cope, and is carried on through generations. He didn't even go, his father did. Yet still it consumes his whole life, consumes who he was and truly is. As it is for so many others, just from my village. It's a large scale, complex impact of intergenerational trauma. I made a whole PowerPoint project on it.


Our traditional ways of parenthood was lost, those who survived residential schools were disconnected from their people. So as generations went on, more and more was lost. More were scarred, more went through the trauma that residential school survivors faced secondhand, even if they didn't go. Because those who did, passed down the trauma.


 I face racism and discrimination, I see the hardships and injustices my people endure on a daily basis. 


This is the first time *ever* that Truth and Reconciliation is a national holiday. Only now that I'm grown up do I see my people getting true recognition. I know family members who've passed on didn't get to see this in their life, all those before me didn't get to. 


We are never getting our land back, yet it will always be our land, so many aspects of our culture is lost, but we are still working to reclaim it and reconnect with the ways of our ancestors so they aren't forgotten. 


To answer your last question, you don't focus on other communities not of your own and place us above all else. You *respect* us. Know the history of the land you now live on. And to let you know, many ""white passing"", may be Metis. For those who aren't, my ancestors did what they had to so their descendants might live a better life than they did. 


My mom told me many Indigenous women had children with white men so their kids wouldn't face so much racism based on the color of their skin. I'm not white passing, and I'm fine with that. There's absolutely nothing wrong with those who are white passing. I will always be proud of the color of my skin, of the strength and resilience of my people.


As someone who isn't Indigenous, you don't prioritize us above all and give us ""special"" treatment. What even made you think we get ""special"" treatment? I'm curious. Was it *your* understanding that you have to put us above yourself? Or where did you see that? Our ""special"" treatment is almost akin to us finally being caught up on how all others in Canada are treated. 


You treat us with the respect you'd give anyone else. Be our ally, support us as you would with anyone else. Just imagine if this was your land, and all of it was taken from you and your people. Imagine how you'd feel if what I wrote about and so much more was done to your people, and you felt the impacts of it all first hand.


Once more, it's important to know the history of the land you now live on. Strive towards justice and equity for all, stand against racism and discrimination. I hope from those who commented and myself that you now know *why* reconciliation is paramount in the Americas. For us, in Canada. With so many broken treaties, broken trust, I hope you can see why acknowledgment gets us closer to healing.",1633046531

because to me, qanon reminds me of the sort of stuff grade school kids used to talk about. Or, i recall a conversation with someone, not a kid, in his early twenties, who had watched a science fiction movie the previous night or so and no amount of explanation could convince him that it was not a documentary.

again, qanon is just a bunch of people who will believe anything. maybe it has been co-opted by fascists but many of the people who believe in qanon have no political beliefs and could easily be swayed by the next idea that they hear.

the perfect illustration is the immensely stupid woman who on camera puts a key on her body (to illustrate that she is now magnetized) and repeatedly says, maybe someone can explain this to me even as the key, which may have briefly stuck to a sweaty horizontal part of her body, kept falling off. she is just stupid, too stupid to be allied with any political movement, could not explain was fascism or socialism is.",1633046532

"beagle","t5_2skm8","my beagle recalls too. We can recall even if there are other dogs playing about and birds to chase &amp; stinky things to sniff.

it's not impossible, just more difficult than other breeds, they have a high prey drive but they also have high loyalty to their primary owner. This is why beagle are listed as not recommended for first time owners by many kennel associations. 

 it does take a lot of patience, practice &amp; the right technique, and VERY valuable rewards(real chicken or cheese). Only positive reinforcement works for reliable recall. If you use aversive techniques on your beagle, they will be less likely to be loyal enough to return. They are smart enough to know when they will be punished versus rewarded - so the more punishment they get, the less likely they will obey other things.

Reducing using aversives to control your beagle (yelling, screaming, saying no, spanking, punishing, leash yanking) is the first step to building up your beagle's loyalty. The protocol is to redirect your beagle to doing something that you want them to do, if they get into trouble. 

I do multiple 10-15 mins training sessions daily(maybe 2-3 a day...3 sessions when he hit puberty). 
If i take mine off leash at an off-leash designated area, i always conceal high value treats on me so i can reward him when he does come back.

I personally think most beagle owners just give up because of the initial difficulty or wrong technique. So many beagles don't get enough training that is suitable for their intelligence because people use the wrong technique.

 The smart tip for recall training is to start with a 5-10m leash at home, and then in the yard, then just outside the home... before practicing off-leash anywhere else. You want to practice in low distracting environments first, then slowly increasing the distractions by trying it out in different places with a longer leash (10-15m).

Other things i managed to train (with much difficulty) is loose leash walking. We trust our beagle a lot and reward him A LOT. He's pretty well behaved for a beagle, quiet too.",1633046533

"Elevators","t5_2qq4x","As one, it stems from childhood, specifically a glass-backed elevator in the apartment building my grandmother lived in, that first piqued my interest.

I'm 26, and work in IT.  I don't really have a desire to enter the industry, but I am still always fascinated by the inner workings of elevators.  And, as someone who works in IT, am more and more interested in the computerization of elevators.

YouTube is another story.  I've filmed elevators in the past but do not any longer (videos taken down voluntaily/channel currently dormant), and don't consider myself part of that group.  I have some close friends who both currently and formerly filmed elevators.  As an ""enthusiast"" it is nice to have a common interest to bond over, especially one as niche as elevators.",1633046535

Some jobs will offer to set you up with a retirement account and match some of your contributions.

You want to make sure you are setting up one of the types of accounts named above in order to get the full tax benefits. I recommend going to your local bank or credit union (probably whichever one you use for savings accounts) and asking them to set you up with a retirement account. 

Also a health savings account might be a good thing for you to look into. If your health insurance deductible is more than $1400 you are able to set one up, there was a post on this sub a few days ago which convincingly argued that HSA is the best retirement account.",1633046535

Having said this, I dare say that the super indy product has become very commonplace in wrestling with the rise of AEW, the popularity of other feds such as NJPW, ROH and so on.

I think work rate fans getting upset at NXT‚Äôs changes could fairly consider that their tastes are being abundantly met elsewhere in the wrestling. The fans who are probably least catered too are those who enjoyed the Attitude Era in the late 90s. We want shorter matches, more character work, edgy content and a fast paced show with twists and turns. The closest products have been Impact (though it‚Äôs still fairly work rate centric) and NWA (though the old school vibe isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs taste).

NXT 2.0 seems to be offering something different. A style that has been underrepresented. I hope those who are aghast at the changes can come to see that. Variety is the spice of life, as they say. I‚Äôm really enjoying it, like you R0DAN.",1633046535

Her instinct to chase them is strong. But we didn‚Äôt really do anything special. I‚Äôm glad we got her small enough that she wasn‚Äôt a safety threat to the cats. The cats were definitely not happy‚Ä¶ but now we are coming up on like 10 months of having her and everyone gets along and sleeps in the bed together. It‚Äôs definitely doable.",1633046535

The van is a 1999 but it has only a genuine 124k miles. It needs the plenum gasket doing but all the other indications are that much of the rest is fine.

Here is the thing though. We plan on keeping it a long time, so if I ended up buying new cylinder heads (unlikely), or other major components we would still be ahead of the game simply because my labor is free, I have the tools and there isn't much I can't do myself.

Would I be happy if there were major breakages? No, I wouldn't, but neither would it end the project so from that point of view we could be worse off.

I guess only time will tell but short of spending forty grand or so on a new van there is no avoiding mechanical issues. Ford, Dodge ... they all have their challenges :)",1633046536

Personally I think it‚Äôs probably going to have to be a little of a lot of things, none of which do a great job. Removing single family housing restrictions is nice but doesn‚Äôt really do anything in the here and now. Subsidies create a ‚Äúdonut‚Äù effect where the people just well off enough to not get them get hosed out of housing. Buying up old hotels is a near newer idea although it‚Äôs kind of more of a return to an older solution and also someone has to maintain that property. Outright rent control just causes housing to slowly go away while really only protecting the people who got in right when the rent control was established. Housing complexes have a long, long history of being horrific in the US, although frankly a lot of European countries have them and don‚Äôt have the baggage we seem to. Builders won‚Äôt build these places on their own because there‚Äôs not profit in them, not the way high income housing has, and that slow movement of formerly high income housing down to middle and low income is, well, slow.",1633046537

So... For whatever reason, the crew mutinies, but the ship (ie carrier group in RL) is in a remote area, but they need to get somewhere else before anyone finds out what they are doing, creating a window of opportunity for a dramatic decision by POTUS to take them out and claim the ship was lost at sea. Again, but realistic, just having fun with it.

It could be the decision to avoid all that weaponry ending up in rogue hands. Or to avoid losing national face at dinner critical geopolitical juncture (a bunch of dominos fall, resulting in most of the world dumping the dollar as a reserve currency). If that were to happen, however contrived, the loss of a single carrier would end up being insignificant. Maybe the country's at a Fort Sumter 2.0 moment and if it goes public that the USN has lost control of a major warship, various blocks of already jaded b states start breaking away.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","INFO: I'm leaning towards E S H here, but it kinda depends on a couple things:

What color were the roses?? I don't think it matters much, because roses are kind of romantic no matter what, but your refusal to answer the question elsewhere, despite mentioning her choosing the color in your post, kinda makes you look like TA.  

How well does this guy know you?  If he's a friend, you might be TA for wanting to call him out.  On the other hand, if he has no idea you even exist, then your GF is for sure TA and probably cheating.  The only reason I bring this up is that it's ambiguous from your post (it's possible he and she are Insta friends and you've never met him), and she was very quick to stop you from messaging...maybe he doesn't know she's in a relationship.

But anyway, I think he's TA for sending a gift he knew was romantic  to someone he knew was in a relationship (assuming he knew the second part), she's TA for so easily lying to her friends, and you're slightly TA for your insecure/jealous reaction.  You could brush it off and just get her something cool and original that's within your budget, and that would probably be better than what you're trying to do here.

If you do end up messaging him, kill him with kindness: thank him for the gift, and marvel at how expensive it must have been.  Then when he downplays the cost of it and makes it seem like it was super easy, ask him to give you the same discount price for anniversary flowers for you to give your GF.  If he accepts, you know he's probably legit.  If he turns you down, you can be pretty sure his intentions are NOT innocent.",1633046539

&gt; &amp;quot;The people who fish squid are happy,&amp;quot; said Daniel Pauly, a prominent marine biologist who in the 1990s coined the phrase &amp;quot;Fishing down the food web&amp;quot; to describe how previously spurned chum were replacing bigger fish on dinner plates.

&gt; The 12 reefers active in the Pacific this past July as the Ocean Warrior was patrolling nearby had at least 196 encounters with fishing vessels during that period, according to satellite data analyzed by Global Fishing Watch, a group that supports sustainable fishing.

&gt; &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s not just a fishing company - it&amp;#039;s practically a Chinese government asset,&amp;quot; said Susi Pudjiastuti, who as Indonesia&amp;#039;s former fishing minister between 2014 and 2019 was lionized by conservationists for destroying hundreds of illegal foreign fishing vessels.

Also, enjoying books doesn't mean you enjoy the classics. I am a huge movie lover but I watch almost exclusively fantasy, sci-fi and horror. I really could care less about most classic movies. I'm the same way with the books I've read.

Also, there are a lot classics that have a whole lot of sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. in them because they are a product of their time.

i think the slide reel with the vision that the eye showed them had some extremely deliberate and well chosen imagery. with such a focus on the destruction, both the players and the in-game characters will take the grass growing on the elk's skeleton as just another reminder of the inexorable passage of time. the prisoner was the only one who correctly guessed that life could be renewed through the eye after the universe's inevitable death; or rather, the only one who really cared about what would happen to the rest of time and space if the eye was hidden, and life was NOT renewed.

at the end of the day, i don't think the prisoner is supposed to be a misunderstood genius that got silenced by the rest of their bigoted kind. they (singular) were frightened, and so was everyone else, but instead of trying to eternally preserve what they knew even as it all fell apart and died, they took a shot in the dark for the sake of the future‚Äî just like YOU did in the end, only many years before, when the urgency wasn't so obvious and there was much more to sacrifice for the greater good.",1633046541

Your maximum rotation speed is FIXED. It cannot increase or decrease. A player moving across your screen on the other hand will be moving faster or slower depending on how far away they are.

How can a fixed rotation speed somehow lock your aim to target with a variable speed?

 &gt;Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is a type of ranked preferential voting counting method used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates. IRV is also sometimes referred to as the alternative vote (AV), preferential voting, single transferable voting (New Zealand),  or, in the United States, ranked-choice voting (RCV), though these names are also used for other systems. Like all ranked ballot voting systems, instead of indicating support for only one candidate, voters in IRV elections can rank the candidates in order of preference. Ballots are initially counted for each voter's top choice.

2) **Shan**:

* +Well-needed cool down episode.
* +Had an alliance solidified with Ricard.
* -Didn't explain her Sarah vote.
* -Still no personal content beyond being the ""mafia pastor"".

3) **Liana**:

* +Alliances solidified.
* +Comments on who she's aligned with and who she wants to vote out.
* -Again, all strategic content was deferred to Evvie once she returned from the summit.
* -Zero personal content. We know literally nothing about Liana.
* -Was shown pushing really hard to vote out Xander.

**Non-contenders**

4) **Evvie**:

* +Still being shown as the one driving the vote.
* +Their relationships were further solidified this episode.
* +Was not shown pushing for Xander as hard as Liana.
* -Still not much personal content beyond ""studying what lives and dies"".
* -They're getting way overexposed way too fast. This person very rarely wins.

5) **Xander**: 

* -He's becoming a bit gamebotty. 
* -Came into episode two needing an alliance and/or personal content, and he got neither. I guess maybe his alliance with Voce kind of counts? 
* -The editors seem fine letting Xander feel like a side character.

It could also mean couples that have sex for more normal amounts of time, but due to low refractory periods and high libido, start again (and again, and again).  
Neither is the norm, and the latter is not sustainable long term. If you're having discussions with your partner where they want sex to be one thing and you a completely different thing, it's possible you have sex drives that don't match up. Some times this can be remedied through open discussion, compromise, therapy etc. But other times a couple could consider this a deal breaker and would wind up separating in order to find a partner that better matches their needs in that department.",1633046543

I also think its ridiculous that some say a woman can't consent to sex when drunk. Obviously if the woman is passed out drunk, and you have sex that is probably not ok. But for example if my wife and I stay up late, drinking wine and watching movies and we have sex is that rape? Also do I need clear consent from my wife to have sex?

So basically, I was out scouting bc there were only 2 squads left and my squad just finished off 3rd place, and I notice these suckers hiding in a tunnel, I ran off just before they started shooting me, my team regrouped outside the tunnel, and a gift from the heavens appeared: Lifeline overextended and I beamed her with my carbine. At that point I figured victory was assured, but they walled us out long enough to get lifeline up and for her to Phoenix. At this point I knew I had to act fast, the last person you want alive is lifeline; she can totally throw off your approach, especially with a gold backpack. My brother ( the Bloodhound) and I subconsciously coordinated an attack. I had to get in there quick to finish off lifeline, so he threw a well-placed thermite and I ran in and ulted to conceal my presence. Masterfully executed.

Can I climb two flights of stairs or more w/o getting out of breath? Not before, but I can now. Does the SI joint in my hips feel like it's stabbing me if I move the wrong way (thank you, pregnancies)? It used to, but not anymore. And most importantly, can I bring all the groceries inside in a single trip? Well, I'm still working on that one, but you get the point.

Yeah, pulling those base/g3 punches...

Kaido wasnt fighting back, not even blocking. He wanted to see what luffy could do and after he did no damage he oneshot luffy. Fuji was getting pressed bc he was getting pushed back despite blocking luffy's moves, luffy tanked/dodged his sword attack and resorted to using Raging Tiger.

*****
&gt; The UK has joined a mounting international campaign of pressure on Mali&amp;#039;s military leaders to step back from a suspected deal with a Russian mercenary company, amid fears that the agreement will further complicate insecurity in the region.

&gt; &amp;quot;If Mali commits to a partnership with these mercenaries, then Mali will isolate itself and will lose the support of the international community which is heavily engaged in Mali,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; Within Mali, the prospect of a deal with the Wagner Group deal is feared by many in the political elites as well as opposition and civil society groups, but has been welcomed by many who are keen to reset Malian-French ties, according to Boubacar Haidara, a lecturer at the University of Segou in Mali and an associate researcher at Sciences Po Bordeaux.

"meltyblood","t5_2t2ie","I agree that there should be a toggle or they should come from 6A only.

Auto-combos are really forcing me to think though.

It's making me become overly aware of every time I get to the third jab that I absolutely -must- do something else.

jab-jab-jab-[special]

jab-jab-jab-[moonskill]

jump in-jab-low-[etc]

Then joining all that together is really satisfying when the auto-combos don't come out until the very end and you see your combo counter going sky high and health bar drained. So you know you did it yourself. Without moonskill none of this would work, you end up using moonskills as much as or instead of jabbing to get bigger combos.

You must mentally appreciate that the jabbing gives that little pause for your hand to work on the motion for the next special/skill (using fightstick).

It does seem though that we are all trying to play the game differently than intended. The missions for the most part seem to heavily revolve around auto-combo. e.g. I didnt really find the missions helpful for learning much about Noel other than a million ways to go into autocombo, and found I have to learn by just playing single player modes instead.",1633046549

But apparently it stuck in my brain as a permanent fetish/interest, and watching my partner enjoy herself with other people is still a huge turn-on.  As long as I'm getting satisfied (and nobody is being put in danger or coerced), I don't seem to care if my partner fucks on the side.

By systematically changing the direction of the applied field, as well as comparing with a control of no change in the field, they observed that the brain does respond to the magnetic field, but this is not a conscious behavior.

i don't want to feel so frustrated with them because... those are real issues, and they didn't cause them... but they do perpetuate their problems which is just irksome.  i suppose i kind of vacillate between hopeful pity and a kind of bland contempt, the latter just because they're really so arrogantly, superciliously closed-minded.  but that's still sad.  it impoverishes one's life.",1633046550

I think that includes some not athletic persuits as sports. I think for example poker is a sport but bowling isn't, chess is a sport, and darts is not. Etc.

I'd you could basically play the game by your self in front of an audience all at once and then mark your performance, then hours later someone else does the same and the winner is whoever scored better, that to me isn't a sport.

"FortNiteBR","t5_3oeyf","1. not many people going to be able to get much heals off in end game, even if there are chug splashes they arent infinite like the chug cannon, you also cant use 200 as a base line since most people in casuals and comp are usually 150-200 due to minis/siphon being a thing

2. this is definitely not true, damage values do not round up, this can be easily seen when going a bit behind the fall-off start line with a blue burst, it should deal 33-49 but it deals 33-50 on the screen indicating that it is only a visual thing, another thing proving this is the lever shotguns, they have decimal base damages and yet they show up without their decimals

im also not saying it rounds up nor down, im saying that it‚Äôs 0.5 damage away from 200 meaning it‚Äôs NEARLY a 100% kill, not literally 100% kill

3. there wouldnt be much of a point to vault 2 edge rarities and keep 3 middle rarities, the only 2 guns from the top of my head that is like that is the crossbow and the drum gun, and those are just 2 rarities and not 3, you also saying that there shouldnt be pumps dealing +100 base damage proves that gold pump shouldnt deal 105 damage

4. which is why 2.5 headshot heavies work best, because of its higher mag, tighter spread, longer range, high structure damage, etc., it should have at least one down-fall, the pump for example has the fire rate downfall but it deals fantastic damage and fantastic headshot with a good spread and decent mag, not only that but it also makes room for other shotguns to have that type of damage output, a purple heavy and a purple pump would be balanced together since they have about the same headshot but ones faster with -18 damage while the other has +18 base damage at a slower rate

5. i feel like the spread on all pumps (except maybe common/legendary) are good since the pump is suppose to be accurate (im not sure what you mean by ‚Äúslower pull-out‚Äù since regular pumps are 440ms and spas‚Äôs are 400ms) but i agree on reload (ive been thinking either 5/4.8/4.6/4.4/4.2, 4.8/4.6/4.4/4.2/4 or 5/4.75/4.5/4.25/4)

about the tacs, it‚Äôs more of too much base damage and too weak headshot, it‚Äôs basically what they did with the pump but the tac stayed with the same damage difference and very slightly higher base damage, but i feel like damage being 70/74/78/82/86 with a x1.75 headshot would keep tac from constantly dealing 100 damage but also having a better chance to while also not being too strong in base damage to where it dominates every shotgun for its rarity

heavy shotguns are somewhat fine, it‚Äôs just a few tweaks away from being balanced tho, the base model of the shotgun tho is fine as is, ive been thinking higher base damage (77/81, gold one shots), faster reload (5.2/5), slightly tighter spread when moving/jumping+moving, lowest damage from 3 pellets to 4 and slightly higher structure damage (82/86)

anyway back on the main topic, making it feel satisfying doesnt mean it‚Äôs balanced, i mean you said you wanted to change the design back to chapter 1 which shows that you are at least partly blinded by nostalgic",1633046553

The key is heat and fats. The THC will bond to the fats of the milk (you need to use regular milk). I believe decarbing the plant material first would be usefull, the rest of the plant material usually hasnt much left, and because of the milk its not very usefull for doing anything else. Thats why I use the trims for doing these, leaves work pretty well actually, there is more THC than people think in there.",1633046557

A man's natural libido is 12-17 times that of a woman (Average for healthy male) if women actually understood this, you would have less issues when it comes to intimacy because there would be more understanding. Sex is a natural part of the attraction and dating process

However, yes, the sex can only occur with the consent of all parties involved, so if you wanted to limit it, just say no and try spend more time with them. If they see the value in you, they will do this, if not, well they wont.

Again from getting many women coming to me now asking questions like this (I coach men in real life, but they refer me onto other women) You need to, as i said below in a response to another person, build your value up as a woman. Become more feminine, improve your looks, build value that transcends that of just intimacy and i GUARANTEE you, if you put the work in, a man will see the value and reciprocate your request.

I just laugh at how all women its always ""all men are trash"" and its always their fault, yet they are several kg overweight, dunk their faces in powder and lead with big cleavage shots. Take some accountability and responsibility and see where you can improve on your end, if needed.",1633046558

*****
&gt; A series of police operations since last year has also cast a light on the central position of the Netherlands in Europe&amp;#039;s drug trade, which Europol described in a report this month as the &amp;quot;Staging point for cocaine trafficking on the continent.&amp;quot; The Netherlands is also a center for the illegal production of amphetamines and crystal meth.

&gt; Part of the reason for the surge in drug trafficking through the Netherlands is that traffickers in Latin America mostly rely on shipping containers to deliver cocaine to Europe, which gives a critical role to Rotterdam, the continent&amp;#039;s largest seaport, as well as to other big container ports like Antwerp in Belgium and Hamburg in Germany.

&gt; &amp;quot;In Dutch law enforcement, everyone is wondering where will this end, and how this will evolve,&amp;quot; said Jan Meeus, a crime reporter at the newspaper NRC Handelsblad who covers drug trafficking in the Netherlands.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","There's no defined numerical ""limit"" to when the debt would be dangerous. Its more about the interest rate and the perceived ability to pay. Japan has a debt to gdp ratio of over 300%, which for the us is 107%, yet Japan's interest rate is low and investors don't doubt Japan's ability to pay in perpetuity. And the us economy is growing faster than Japan's, so it should have better prospects of paying going forward.    
I agree that increasing military budgets being favored over, say, making education free definitely is an example of bias - the us could fund both of those through deficit spending if there were the political will. Funding universal public health insurance could not be done this way though. It costs too much- about 3.2 trillion extra per year. Issuing that much debt would significantly raise interest rates, which would significantly increase the share of the budget spent servicing the debt, which to a degree would increase the amount of debt we'd need to issue to fund everything else, etc. This could probably be sustained for longer than any other country
due to the us' position, but eventually investors would lose faith in the government's ability to pay, which would result in default and severe recession. So there is a limit to deficit spending, based more around those factors than any numerical ceiling of leverage. No one really knows what this limit looks like,ibut the evidence suggests we are not near it, imo.    

Finally, you mention the bank bailouts. I will just say that those were not handouts to the banks, per se. They were collateralized loans given to the banks by the government that no other institution was in the position of giving, which was done to prevent a financial collapse. The us taxpayers did not lose money on those loans. You could argue that doing this might create a risk that in the future, big banks will be overly risky with the assurance they cannot go bankrupt, and that maybe another course of action was better. But it was not a giveaway.",1633046559

If you think that you have a diagnosis, and no one around you thinks that you need help or you think that you don't need help, then you probably don't have (insert mental health illness).

"gamemaker","t5_2qw2g","When I'm doing a camera I make a new camera object then tell the room camera to follow that. Then I tell the camera object to follow the player with the lerp function as smoothing.

The step for the camera would look like this:

    x = lerp(x,oPlayer.x,0.25);
    y = lerp(y,oPlayer.y,0.25);

To add to this you'll need to find the halfway point between your player and the cursor.

    var target_x = (mosue_x - oPlayer.x) / 2;
    var target_y = (mosue_y - oPlayer.y) / 2;
    x = lerp(x, target_x, 0.25);
    y = lerp(y, target_y, 0.25);

Now I haven't had the opportunity to test this code, I'll see if I can after work and reply with any updates. Hope this helps.

Hi, obligatory on-mobile.

I'll try to keep this short since I never post here. I (21F) have been invited to my boyfriend's (24M) brother's wedding. As expected, my bf is going to be the Best Man. I, however, am not familiar with the fiance so I won't be a bridesmaid, just a regular attendee. This is important.

Just some background before the conflict part, I am an anxious person who does not do well in crowds of strangers. Which is what this wedding would be.

Now, my boyfriend came to me with information that caused an argument. The fiance is apparently a perfectionist, and has assigned seating at her wedding. Since my bf is the best man, he will be seated at a table with the bride, groom, and the maid of honor. The groomsmen and bridesmaids will be at a certain table. The regular attendees are assigned to their tables. Aka, I would not be allowed to be with my boyfriend during the wedding (since he'll be standing with them) or during the after-thing (reception? I'm not knowledgeable about weddings, it's the thing after the ceremony where everyone eats and stuff). We will be seated at different tables and doing different things the entire time.

This didn't sit well with me. It feels unfair to me that I, as the best man's girlfriend, don't get to sit with them. Truth be told, I didn't really care who sits where, I just wanted to sit by my bf so I would be more comfortable. Sitting by myself in a crowd of strangers for that long would certainly cause a lot of fear for me.

I told him this, and asked if there was any way he could sit with me, or make it so that I sat with them. He said no, as the fiance was very strict on everything being ‚ú®perfect‚ú®, and he didn't want to risk bringing it up to her and ""ruining her day"".  

Here's where I may be the asshole. I got a bit upset, and told him I wouldn't be going. I told him that it felt like he wasn't standing up for me and trying to find a fix to this issue, despite him knowing how it would make me feel to be isolated among strangers. I knew it meant a lot to him for me to be there, but I feel like that's an unfair situation to put me in. 

I told my parents about it (they wanted to know why I changed my mind about going), and they got mad at him and said (not to him) that he should be standing up to the fiance and his brother and having them include me, since I'm his partner. 

I am trying hard to remain passive, but my parents' arguments on the matter are making me feel a bit wronged by my bf for not fighting for me. 

I came here to see the verdict of the court. AITA?

"minnesotavikings","t5_2qocl","The thing has always been with Childress is his attitude. Andy Reid is known for being just about a saint. He gets along with everyone. He has been the only person who has been able to tolerate Childress long term and in retrospect I think he was a buffer between Childress and other people. Thus while there were issues with Childress and other people (Like the well publicized blow up with him and Terrell Owens) these issues were few and far between enough that people saw Childress the McNabb QB coach and not so much Childress the guy who had issues with players. 

Childress has coaching talent. He was McNabb's QB coach for the 5 years he was a pro bowler. He has the personality of a stepped on snake however. Even when we were winning under him the players hated him. He had to deal with players in Minnesota in a way he never had in the past working under Reid. That Reid buffer was gone and the result is what we all saw in 2010. Some people simply are not good with people and you need to be good with people to be an NFL head coach.",1633046562

Lastly, Amity doesn't feel like a black character in the MTG sense. Black from a flavor standpoint is all about the furthering of opportunity through power, and this doesn't feel like it fits Amity as a character. My gut says she's red white, but I have no explanation for it whatsoever.

^(By: Marilynne Robinson | 219 pages | Published: 1980 | Popular Shelves: fiction, book-club, novels, literary-fiction, classics | )[^(Search ""Housekeeping"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Housekeeping&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;A modern classic, Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her younger sister, Lucille, who grow up haphazardly, first under the care of their competent grandmother, then of two comically bumbling great-aunts, and finally of Sylvie, their eccentric and remote aunt. The family house is in the small Far West town of Fingerbone set on a glacial lake, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck, and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town ""chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere."" Ruth and Lucille's struggle toward adulthood beautifully illuminates the price of loss and survival, and the dangerous and deep undertow of transience.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;We actually required contestants to start following the UC quizmaster's favourite podcasts and radio shows and had a bunch of CDs full of his specific areas of expertise/common question areas they could revise from.

So, in other words, you got them to study trivia. Which is the key thing people forget when watching trivia shows, the contestants studied extremely hard for it. So it can make you feel a bit dumb watching someone who ""knows"" so much, but the take away is that this sort of knowledge has little bearing outside of trivia itself, and there are techniques/tools for learning it, which most people don't know about. 

I don't know what the culture is like in the challenge teams, but my experience playing trivia in uni taught me that spaced repetition flashcard systems were the method of choice, and that many of the best players didn't want to admit they practiced trivia religiously. I think a few of them had a bit of an intelligence complex. 

The point is, trivia buffs are more normal than we'd care to admit. Obviously, the smarter you are the better at it you'll be (if you also work hard), but the smartest people i've met usually consider *competitive* trivia to be a time drain.",1633046564

"HeadphoneAdvice","t5_3k8u4","Sony XM4's ANC is really great, when coupled with app it is a notch better than the others. I have been using it for 2 months now and in love with them.

For my use case (music, calls, podcast with and without ANC) Sony's are better than my wife's AirPod Pro. The only place AirPod Pro beats Sony is Apple's proprietary Spatial Sound. Sony has something similar, 360 Reality Audio, but needs special app to stream you that kinda music. I don't know about the others, but you can use each of the XM4 earbuds independently if needed (when configured properly).

XM4 has awesome Speak-to-Chat feature, when you speak with earbuds on, it will disable ANC and stop the music to allow outside sounds in, very useful when you start talking to someone without having to fiddle with the controls or phone to pause the music. Another great is you can press-hold left earbuds to disable music and ANC and allow you to talk to other person. I don't think Momentum2 of Beats has this feature. I find myself using this more often than I thought I would!

Sony's are definitely more expensive of the lot, if you can afford then go for it, you won't regret :-)",1633046564
"Spiderman","t5_2rw42","It's... technically both? I feel like it depends a lot more on how the symbiote itself is depicted, rather than the person it's attached to.

Consider the 2018 *Venom* movie, where the symbiote says ""I am Venom."" This depiction is shown to be of much higher intelligence than just being a pile of sentient alien sludge. It's its own separate consciousness from Eddie Brock. It should also be noted that this version of Venom (the collective entity that is Eddie and the symbiote) only physically speaks with one voice at a time; Eddie and the symbiote don't share voices.

Now consider *Spider-Man 3*, where the symbiote is just point-blank feral. It has no voice of its own save for the screeches and roaring, even after having two hosts and carrying Spider-Man's webbing pattern over to Eddie's Venom suit. Eddie, in this film, speaks as Venom exactly two times with the ""mask"" on - when he first confronts Sandman and convinces him to help kill Spider-Man. The entire time, he's talking in his own normal voice, unchanged by the symbiote's presence. The exact same thing happens near the end of the final battle at the construction site.

The same also applies to *Spectacular Spider-Man*, but to a slightly lesser extent. We only ever hear any sort of voice coming from the symbiote when it speaks in its host's head. On the outside, though, we again only hear screeching and roaring, like in *Spider-Man 3*. This version of Venom collective also does the opposite of 2018 Venom... sort of. There are two main examples of what I mean by this, both near the end of Season 1; when Eddie answers the phone, he's partially suited up with the symbiote, but it retracts from his head so he can talk in his normal voice. The same thing happens in a fight during the parade; the symbiote retracts from Eddie's head and he talks normally, then covers his face again and he goes back to sounding like Venom.",1633046564

One easy mistake to make when merging from a ramp, and one that this driver likely made, was checking their mirror BEFORE the lanes became parallel. This causes you to look further back and effectively makes your blind-spot larger for those few moments.

And the answer is two words: Blood Flow.

The better the blood flow is to a given area the less fat you're going to store in it and the more your going to store in areas with poorer blood flow.

Which is why the feet, hands and forehead are the last places obese people store fat.

An easy way to prove this is if you have lower belly fat is to first touch your chest first and then touch your lower belly, the temperature difference you feel is due to poor blood flow to your lower belly which is why it feels colder.

And the only way you increase blood flow to an area like your lower belly for example is by physical exercise that stimulates the muscles in that area specifically.

This **DOES NOT** spot reduce belly fat but If you achieve great blood flow throughout your entire body, when you gain weight the fat you gain is spread out more evenly,",1633046565

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* You can check your karma here:  http://old.reddit.com/user/MajorMaxxor4091/overview

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

On the turn when it‚Äôs going to use Firepowder (2 or 3 in normal phase, no one targeted) use Mettle Overture to add some healing per turn. Then the turn after when everyone likely has blastblight use Healing to remove it.

Bring a strong non-elemental monstie, like Nergigante, with good survivability genes like Divine Blessing, Self-Heal, and All-E Def and/or a good water monstie (SS Mizutsune) with Evade, Fortify, and Dancer XL for survivability. Most of Molten‚Äôs attacks are non-elem so you can go the defensive route, or the offensive route with a water type.

In the blastblight phase either mount your monstie and stay on, or chain play Evasion Riff. If your monstie gets low on health/blighted in this phase consider swapping it out instead of healing.

Other than that, make sure you always keep your hearts maxed and if you‚Äôre still having difficulty try putting on a Dampening XL talisman.

"IoTeX","t5_f7nfw","Best way to start would be to look at the team behind it. The names there almost made me think it was made up, considering the cheezy games and generic hype package involved with this package. But honestly, thats an easy way to raise money and keep investor interest when building something extremely high tech that has a lot of competition. Marketing and finance, and opening up mainnet to silly defi projects dont really interfere with the main purpose of our the project, which is to create THE standard in IoT security. Ever heard of IEEE? They are the gold standard in tech industry standards, and they are objective about it. One of the members of the Iotex project was elected vice chair of the IEEE working group for IoT blockchains, which is a nod at their work being industry leading. Thats not mentioning the other orgs that have recognized the project. Their potential hasnt really scratched the surface outside of defi and the pebble. Considering the companies the founders are collectively coming from this seems like a project with a much greater purpose than the way it looks to the typical investor. The pebble is built by one of the most reputable iot device manufacturers, and the tech in that is probably going to see a lot of use in many critical infrastructure applications like manufacturing and supply chain. Yeah, its got the same cheezy launch strategy as other defi projects, and includes some questionable content on the app, but thats because its funded by defi investors. Most crypto projects claiming they are doing industry leading development are just blowing air.. considering IBM and the linux foundation are really the industry leader outside of finance in blockchain technology.. we are somewhat lucky their marketing wasnt the greatest",1633046567

"cheating_stories","t5_3kcu1","I get that it is SO hard see someone change for the worse, and that it is tempting to hope they will change back for the better. I think it‚Äôs really unlikely your husband will though. 

People change for one of two reasons: they themselves want to, so they work hard to make the change. Or, they don‚Äôt want to change, but they are at risk of losing something, and the prospect of changing seems better than the loss. Usually change for this reason is more shallow and temporary.

Your husband has neither of these as an incentive.

He learned long ago that he can mistreat you, people around you, endanger you, disrespect you, etc., and that you will stick by him for it, and even pick up the slack and cover for him when he fucks up. He feels at no risk of losing you, no matter what he does, because his past experience has told him that‚Äôs not something he has to worry about.

And he doesn‚Äôt want to change himself or out of love for you, unfortunately, because he already would have if that was the case.

"SapphoAndHerFriend","t5_voyv5","It was initially just sexual orientations. Gay women wanting to distance themselves from gay men by using the term lesbian. Then bisexuals and transgenders sought representation and that was met with backlash from the Gay and Lesbians of the time who thought Bi person were simply confused and Transgenders were just drag queens and kings who liked to play dressed up. Obviously after stone wall the conversation really began to shift as Marsha P. Johnson, a transwoman and major figure in the gay rights movement of the 1970s and 80s came out proudly to the forefront of it all, not just to fight for her fellow queers but for POC and Trans representation as well. The letters were put in and over time as more sexualities and identities were discovered more letters are added. Finally the community decided to add the plus as the ever expanding acronym was becoming a bit too large and confusing. In the spectrum I believe intersexed and trans are the only two that are immediately represented and not sexual orientations. As a trans person I still say it‚Äôs mostly a list of sexual orientations, because it is. I would just ask that you enjoy a joke, or don‚Äôt and if you don‚Äôt, how about downvote and move along? I keep having to explain myself and my queerness to people. Maybe you‚Äôre in the community maybe you‚Äôre an ally, either way we‚Äôve been fighting this fight ourselves for a long time. We don‚Äôt need people picking a joke apart on the internet cause the right term wasn‚Äôt used. I get what you were trying to do and that‚Äôs cool, but you picked to tell a trans person what trans is which was just luck of the draw haha.

Are you willing to stand up while you still have a modicum of comfort, even if your basic freedoms are gone? Are you willing to start a rebellion *before* you become oppressed? 

I've dug deep for an answer to this question, and I can honestly say, no. I'm not willing to give up relative comfort on the off chance that something slightly better may happen. I would have to lose a lot more than some basic freedoms before I risk not being alive anymore. As long as there is a roof over my head, food in my belly, and I can be moderately happy, I'll toe the line. I'm not some savior of society, and I don't really see much in society worth laying my life down for right now.

You can go back to the old eyk sub and see when the audience began to suss out Simon's bad behaviour, and it was long before Martina said anything (about 4 months from memory). Sure she let us know he was in Hawaii when Meemers had the crystals emergency. Simon later said he was in Hawaii this year. We still would have found out because he doesn't think he has done anything wrong. Martina does recognise she has done some wrong and has genuinely apologised for that. Simon has done the old ""sorry you got offended but here's why you shouldn't be offended"" type of apology.

Martina has at most reacted badly to bad behaviour, and she has genuinely tried to be better. I can't say the same for Simon. It's apples and oranges.

If I put myself in Martina's shoes I can see how she is trying to do the right thing. If I put myself in Simon's shoes I can't see how he is trying to do the right thing. It is simple as that. Maybe my opinion will change in the future with other evidence, but I'm not holding my breath.",1633046569

Over the next several decades, there will be more retirees than new pilots.

Majors (ex. Delta, United) are having a significant number of retirees. 

They need lots of pilots, and they get their pilots primarily from the regional air carriers.

The regionals see their pilots being snatched up by majors, thus are wanting to make sure they have people to fill the gaps.

An example program is with SkyWest Airlines is linked below. They are a regional that fly Delta/United/Alaskan/American banners.

*****
&gt; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has given Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory and threatened to withdraw recognition Israel if it failed to do so.

&gt; Palestinians say Israel&amp;#039;s proposals would fail to grant them full statehood or resolve other core issues, including the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem.

&gt; Israel&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, widely seen by the international community as the only way to resolve the conflict.

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","Since I've been on Reddit I find this is a very common post for someone to make with regards to cycling.

I used to be a fat guy too, was over 300 pounds at one point with fucked-up knees, one of which required arthroscopic surgery to fix the cartilege. I am no stranger to these problems.

So here's my thoughts:

* Bike fitting: have you had it done? A mis-adjusted bike will fuck up your knees
* Trying to go too hard? Common mistake for novice athletes. You're not a Pro in the TdF, don't ride like you're one, that's not how you get there. Ride at a sustainable pace.
* Cadence too low? I.E. are you hammering? Aim for a cadence of 80-90rpm, turning **smooth circles at a sustainable pace**. Lower cadence == more torque == more pressure on your joints.
* Do you take vitamin/mineral supplements? **I am not a doctor; take everything I say about nutrition with a grain of salt, do you own research, consult a medical professional if you aren't sure!** Athletes and older people need (according to my own sports-medicine doctor) vitamin D3 supplementation; it's a potent anti-inflammatory among other things. Consider it and a decent wide-spectrum multi-vitamin/mineral supplement.
* **Are your knees just flat-out damaged like mine were?** Clicking, **locking**, popping, bruising around your knee joints, these are all signs there may be damage.

That's all I can think of at the moment.",1633046571

I am SuperCorp.  I negotiate my health insurance premiums for my employees.  If hospitalizations, critical care, and after care go up because people have COVID...then my health insurance carrier is going to want higher premiums.  

Rather than pass that down to everyone, those at higher risk (unvaccinated) end up footing the bill.

That's not wage theft.  Health insurance from employers changes all the time from co-pays to higher monthly contributions.

It is the insurance market adjusting for increased costs...especially considering that the vaccine dramatically reduces hospitalizations and death.  I'd expect more insurers to jump on that bandwagon.  The employee still has a choice but it will cost them.",1633046571

"OCD","t5_2qvqm","Hi! I was also recently diagnosed with OCD (27 F) and also really don‚Äôt relate to most of the stuff I read here, or online in general. Still, two therapists and a psychiatrist have all diagnosed me with OCD, so I guess I have OCD ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I honestly downloaded Reddit because I started obsessing over whether or not I had OCD and reading Reddit became a compulsion‚Ä¶So sounds like we‚Äôre in a similar boat. 

I also have health OCD (or health anxiety - whatever you‚Äôd like to call it, but in my opinion it‚Äôs OCD) that has, at times been pretty severe and debilitating. It started when I was about 20 or 21. Compulsions include excessive googling, and seeking reassurance from friends, family and doctors. But the other themes  I obsess over aren‚Äôt really ‚Äútypical‚Äù, and, at least right now, most of my non-health-related compulsions are almost entirely mental - lots of memory hoarding, making mental lists, etc. (which is also why I think my OCD went unnoticed for so so so many years). I also think I have some form of ‚Äújust right‚Äù OCD that makes me feel the need to finish telling a story once I‚Äôve started it - otherwise something just feels incomplete and wrong. I‚Äôve never heard of anyone else experiencing ‚Äújust right‚Äù OCD in this way, but again, that doesn‚Äôt mean my symptoms aren‚Äôt OCD. 

I also just have plain old anxiety, and there have been times when I don‚Äôt remember really doing anything compulsive. OCD symptoms don‚Äôt have to be constant. 

My understanding is that an obsession can latch on to literally anything and compulsions can also be just about anything. The ones that tend to be written about are just the more common ones, but that doesn‚Äôt make your OCD diagnosis, or mine, any less valid. 

I hope this gives you some insight!! Feel free to DM me.",1633046572

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Welcome to the 2nd half of your first decade of marriage.   They don't call it the 7 year itch because it's untrue.  Been there, so you have my sincerest empathy for your situation. Although once a month is still better than a lot of married people these days.

Anyways - most people find that the chemistry dies for a couple of reasons.   

One, having grown up responsibilities and children to take care of puts a serious damper on energy, time, and the kind of pursuing of one another that you both did before you settled into the routine. Now the routine is easy and comfortable (psychologically speaking), and it's hard to fix that without deliberate action from both of you to re-light that fire of passion.

Two, many couples never have those deep, this-is-really-what-gets-my-motor-running conversations about our desires, kinks, perversions,  etc.  Not that everyone wants to be choked or suck toes, mind you - but we all have those things that turn us on that we can be deathly afraid to share with the ones we love and care about because we are deathly afraid of the pain that comes from their judgement.  So we hold back,  and the sex can be good or even great.....but if that's died a bit and it's gonna take work to get going again....it's easier to make the effort for mind-blowing fulfillment than it is for mere good or great sex.

Finally,  there could be performance issues that cause significant stress or anxiety.   At 28, I don't suspect this to be an issue (although not completely unheard of), as he should have more than a decade before he *may* see things aren't the same as they used to be.....but modern medicine and the internet fixes that easy enough.

So I suggest planning a way to get out of the routine, have the grandparents keep the kids, and start dating and pursuing one another again.  Play a game of Truth or Dare and share the things you want to do and have done to you, and he do the same.  Make it exciting,  and then it becomes something you both think about, crave, and make happen.",1633046572

"AskAstrologers","t5_2vrcj","But Venus &amp; Mars are in aspect:  by semi-sextile. So how do you understand the 30¬∞ aspect?

Personally, I have no use for the old worn out terms like ""debilitated."" No planetary energy is debilitated simply because of its sign placement. It is not working in its ideal environment, but that should not be equated with a human handicap. 

You may be wrestling as much with worn out language as you are with meaning and interpretation.

Mars in Aries = dynamic, active, forward-moving on one's own agenda; in Libra it follows the Venusian principle in the cardinal air mode, therefore it aims less to act on personal agendas and more on mutual agendas ‚Äî more to 'please' ‚Äî it's more about grace in motion and the air around one's energy, not the action itself.

Venus in Libra = affectionate, relatable, generally gracious or sensuous, and aesthetic; In Scorpio its agenda is not working on the surface is it? It's as if the skin is in constant conversation with the reproductive organs about what's happening or going to happen. So that's typically kept quiet, but the person may pride themselves on some power of seduction (or at least fantasize about it). Scorpio is the fixed (steady/obsessive) mode of water (emotion), so Venus is less about friendship there and more contained, as if each friendship induces loyalty or commitment. Venus here is less about congeniality and more about deeper feelings that are harder to deal with.

About 'mutual exchange', that's not in my astrological dictionary. Nor is it in the glossary at [astrology.com](https://astrology.com). So it sounds like a term made up by someone to apply to these kinds of situations where there's not a mutual reception of planets in opposition to each other. Such terms are ultimately only categorical in importance, not any key to interpretation. Just understand the semi-sextile, the planets in their signs, and let your mind go with it.",1633046574

*****
&gt; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has given Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory and threatened to withdraw recognition Israel if it failed to do so.

&gt; Palestinians say Israel&amp;#039;s proposals would fail to grant them full statehood or resolve other core issues, including the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem.

&gt; Israel&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, widely seen by the international community as the only way to resolve the conflict.

"paypal","t5_2rzac","Either a contact with support who can often help change the number, or one of these suggestions may work: 

A European user said this worked:

""Guys I just solved this with the help of a fellow member on here!!! The secret is to change your password! For the verification, I selected entering my credit card number and voila I got into the account and then changed the number successfully!""

Another one of our Redditors provided the following helpful write-up: 

(the author of this was in the United States, instructions may not apply in your country)

Last week I was planning to switch phone numbers as I had moved states and wanted a local area code. Before doing this, I made sure to change the number on my PayPal account to a different number that I would still be able to receive texts on after changing my main number. Well, despite doing this, logging into PayPal a couple days later, it tried to send SMS one-time login codes to my old number that I had removed from my account and no longer had access to.

I contacted their online support. You can contact their online support without logging in like this:

Visit https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/contact-us

Click ""Password and account access""    
Click ""Login problems""    
Scroll down and click ""Message us - it's like texting, send us a note!""    
Click ""Chat with us about your password issue"" and the chat messaging will open.    

The online messaging support agents were not helpful. They did verify that my new number was on the account and verified, so I should wait an unknown amount of time for the system to update my number, which never happened. They would also try sending me ""one-time password links"" via email which literally just allowed me to change my password, but did nothing to help the issue of bypassing the login codes. Their final suggestion was always to call support. Well, their call centers have been closed for months due to the pandemic (at least in the United States). If you call, you eventually get an automated message telling you they're closed due to COVID-19 and the line disconnects.

Since the first day of this issue, I'd been communicating with their support on Twitter, https://twitter.com/AskPayPal through DMs. They had been giving canned responses and referring me to the online messaging support which was not helping. However eventually, over a week later, I was able to connect with a support agent via DMs with the @AskPayPal Twitter account who actually knew that the call centers were closed (which is how the request would normally be resolved) and they asked me to email [askpaypal@paypal.com](mailto:askpaypal@paypal.com) informing me to request that the ""security key"" be disabled on my account.

Just under an hour later, I receive an automated email that the old phone number was removed from my account for the ""security key"" feature! Success! I was finally able to login without any one-time SMS login code hassle.

In all cases, I verified my identity by providing the following. Provide this when speaking with a new agent via the online messaging, or when emailing them. Note that they cannot verify your identity over social media DMs however due to security concerns.

Your country. They will be able to guess this based on your Internet network, but provide it anyways as their rules and services are different per country.
Name on the PayPal account. Make sure it's the exact one on the account -- I'd signed up with a shortened version of my first name and was only able to verify myself by providing that.

PayPal account email address. The one you use to login.

Last 4 digits of one of these that is connected to your PayPal account: credit/debit card or bank account

I hope this helps someone! I do think 2-step/2-factor authentication is a good thing and have re-enabled it WITH the backup option of an Authenticator app in case something like this happens again.

Also, if you can't get into your account but need to make PayPal Credit payments, you can do so via this automated phone number: (844) 373-4961, which even allows debit card payments which you cannot do via the normal website.",1633046574

"Aupairs","t5_2sp0r","This seems like a European problem. In Europe this is more common. Whereas in the US its more co.mon for the family to have a cleaner (even just once a week) and they actually expect you to do more with the kids and do chores when they are at school/napping etc.

Not saying it's 100% Europeans wanting a maid that conveniently takes care of the kids and Americans having a nanny that sometimes do the dishes and laundry. But this does seem to be the usual.

However no matter where you are or in what country you should never have to clean up after the parents or do any heavy work like washing floors, cleaning windows, mowing the lawn, taking care of pets(I do but thats because I love animals and volunteered) cleaning the pool, etc. 

The parents are adults and should take responsibility of their own messes and their 'environment'.

So it's normal to do the dishes after you cooked for the kids, tidy the kids room. Do kids laundry, if you have older kids give them chores like making their own bed, scraping their plates or putting away dishes.

If you have such a great family explain to them that you would like to have more time to spend with the kids rather than cleaning.

Don't make it about yourself. Make it sound like it's in the kids best interest.

Like for example:

""So (child) has been doing great in soccer however he seems to still need practice with dribbling and would like to take him to the park to practice. But its difficult because I spend so much time cleaning I have no time to help him, and he keeps on asking""

Or even, ""(child) has shown interest in learning more about colors and shapes. But I don't really get enough time to do those kinds of things because of my chores. How about I only vacuum every second day and we take turns on the dishes?""

This would make them consider it in the interest of their children and not the strange random girl living in their house. Lol.",1633046575

But the problem is that even sex is based on general trends rather than absolute facts about a person‚Äôs biology.  There are men with XX chromosomes and women with XY chromosomes.  There are women without uteruses that can‚Äôt bear children, there are men that can‚Äôt produce semen.  There are people born with male genitalia despite having female hormones, and vice versa.  There is no one defining characteristic of sex which can‚Äôt be contradicted, so instead we just take stock of the characteristics that are present and we ‚Äúassign‚Äù a sex at birth.

 

We do the same thing with gender.  Some women like to wear dresses, some women never wear dresses.  Some men are big and aggressive, other men are small and compassionate.  There is no single ‚Äústereotype‚Äù that can be used to define a person‚Äôs gender, so we just take stock of those characteristics and make a judgment call.  But really, the person who is best equipped to make that call is the person in question ‚Äì nobody knows their own gender better themselves, so we should trust people when they self-identify one way or another.",1633046575

*****
&gt; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has given Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory and threatened to withdraw recognition Israel if it failed to do so.

&gt; Palestinians say Israel&amp;#039;s proposals would fail to grant them full statehood or resolve other core issues, including the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem.

&gt; Israel&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, widely seen by the international community as the only way to resolve the conflict.

Turning Orange Shirt Day into The National Day of Truth and Reconciliation can be a hollow symbol if we let it be. Stand with Indigenous peoples, whether they're standing up for land rights, sovereignty, Missing and Murdered women, girls and 2 spirit people, or just taking a stand over broken promises.

Places to start:

Support the [Tiny House Warriors](http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com/)

Support the [Unist'ot'en Camp](https://unistoten.camp/)

Read the [Truth and Reconciliation Reports](https://nctr.ca/records/reports/); here is [a link to audio versions](https://nnels.ca/trc)

Use the CBC [Residential School Locator](https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/beyond-94-residential-school-map/) to learn the history, and current news, about the residential schools that operated on the land you occupy. Learn where the children whose land you occupy were sent, and what happened to them there.

Check out the CBC's [Progress Tracker for the Calls to Action](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-single/beyond-94)

Make sure that you don't stop at learning, learning is important but not sufficient. Action has to happen along with it. 

[Write your local MP](https://cpj.ca/writing-a-letter-to-your-mp/), MLA or city council about the Calls To Action or in support of an issue the First Nations, M√©tis or Inuit in your riding are championing.

Use multiple sources including https://native-land.ca/  and First Nations government websites to figure out whose land you are on. Once you have an idea of the Nations and people that have taken care, for thousands of years, of the land that takes care of you: look into 1) what their laws are now and were historically, 2) what the colonisation of their land looked/looks like, 3) what their government cares about today, 4) what these groups have to say about the land.

Whatever you don't get done today, pick back up again tomorrow. Reconciliation doesn't end on Oct 1.

Here is a list of Indigenous organisations you can support, vetted and compiled by the Indigenous Employees Secretariat of Crown-Indigenous Relations. Links are dead bc I'm copying from an email on mobile, apologies for the inconvenience.

## We triage most questions into a recurring megathread called the Daily Questions thread which you can find pinned at the top of the subreddit.

## The most recent thread can be found [pinned at the top of the subreddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/) or [at the top of this list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+%22Daily+Questions+-+ASK+AND+ANSWER+HERE%21%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

We've found this is a better way of people getting answers from knowledgeable users rather than 300-500 standalone posts per day. These threads often either didn't receive any answers or received a deluge of answers, many of which were of poor quality or flat-out wrong.

"VaushV","t5_10to4u","It's not really a trick. It's getting someone to understand the logical consequences of the positions they are taking. It's like if I was to say to you 'anyone who kills another person should go to prison for the rest of their life.' You might say to me 'what if a person was being attacked with homicidal intent, and killed the would-be killer to save their own life? Or what if someone was enslaved by another person and forced to kill under threat of horrific punishment? Or what if someone kills someone by accident through no fault of their own?'

I would have to either bite the bullet and say 'yes, all those people should get life-imprisonment' which seems unjust, or I must reconsider my original statement. The important point I am getting at I am not being put in a bind because you have tricked me somehow. I am in a bind because I hadn't thought through my position fully and as such found that I didn't really agree with my own statement when the implications of that statement were pointed out to me.

You can also use hypotheticals to show inconsistency. If I said 'anyone who kills another person should be imprisoned for that act' and also 'anyone who saves another's life should not be imprisoned for that act', you might say 'well, what if a person kills one person in order to save another? What happens to them?'. In asking that question, you've exposed an inconsistency in my thinking because you have pointed out a case where two of my positions collide. It's not a 'trick' it's an argument.

What I meant by proving anything interesting is that all Sam Harris has argued is that IF (and only if) the two choices were to genocide a demographic or allow the murder of every single human, a consequentialist would probably say that you should commit genocide. But that's a trivial point. It doesn't say anything about what we should do in reality, where that IF is not the case.",1633046580

Example 1: Agility affects non command attacks and counter rate. Cool down reduction affects character and weapon ability uptime.

Example 2: Stat break points. How crit damage scales with attack and procs with crit chance.

* 60% crit chance is the sweet spot.

Or how a some character and weapon abilities are not reflected in your load out, only taking effect when in combat.

Example: Elemental % and \*timed buffs or Celebratory Noelle's character ability.

* \*Memoir and weapon timed buffs reset at the start of each wave.
* Timed buffs being good for PvP and Speed farming PvE but pretty bad for pushing.

The importance of having matching weapons and why. Which sub-weapon abilities to look for and why.

How cool down reduction and 14s weapon abilities is as important as agility the higher you push in PvP.

For f2p: not to wasting gems on banners that will become part of the daily pool. Saving up gems and tickets to hit a pity. What is a pity (did not know this term for a while since this is my 1st gatcha).

* Confirming the drop rate on banners
* Best use of stamina
* Best use of the each type of coins

Which dark characters and weapons to aim for and why.

How to build an effective healer for pushing (this one took a lot of tinkering). The importance of counter affinity weapons and shutdown/support companions when pushing.

What do the grades on character skills mean A, B, C (higher grade = higher charge time).

Go on UMD OCH for housing. It is mostly people renting out rooms in a house. Some people will offer discounts to graduate students.

University Park. It is by far the safest neighborhood near campus and only a mile and a half walk to South campus. There are a couple of places available on OCH.

Riverdale Park is also a super nice new area right near University Park. Both neighborhoods are within walking distance to a Safeway, Whole Foods, and a couple of other shops.

Greenbelt is a little further (you would need a car or bike) but is a super cute area. There are some nice apartments there that are significantly cheaper than the ones on rt 1. I know a lot of graduate students who live there.

The closer you get to CP, the more expensive it is. Berwyn neighborhood is good but definitely not as nice as Greenbelt, Riverdale, or University Park.

If you want more context: Chicago is doing worse this year, with it looking like might hit that magic 30/100k mark. 2016 was as bad as 2020. If you look at the rate over the last six years, things are looking a lot more like the 1990s than the mid-2000s.

The other was that Emma smith wasn't Joseph Smith's first eternal wife. She was #23. They weren't sealed until May 28, 1843 (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/latter-day-saint-history-1815-1846-teacher-material/lesson-24?lang=eng). Yet prior to this Joseph was already married to 22 other women. I think Joseph was practice sealing long before he even talked about given the revelation for the practice. It's just funny Joseph claimed to have all these ""spiritual wives."" In reality it's further proof that they were affairs he hid from Emma, as she wasn't even given her own sealing until much later after the cat was out of the bag and Joseph needed a cover story for his secret flings.

Edit:

Also important to add, there are many critics that say Joseph not fostering children with underage wives is proof that he never had sexual relationships with them. But even if that were true, the following prophets DID have sex with underage wives. Brigham young had a 15 year old wife Clarrisa Decker who he had 5 kids with, and Lorenzo Snow had sex with his 15 year old wife, Sarah Minnie Jensen and had 5 kids with her - when he was FIFTY SEVEN YEARS OLD!

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","Completely agree that Deathslinger ***just*** ***feels dreadful*** to play after the changes. What I disagree on is that it comes from the changes themselves - I think they've just brought forward the things that were awful about him from the very beginning:

# The new windup

&gt;*A 0.4 second startup on his power seems small, but it's huge in a game where survivors can move at 4 meters a second. Survivors can move 1.6 meters in either direction by the time you the scope in, making immediate shooting in any instance but locked animations nearly impossible.*

I have to disagree here. Yes, it limits some of the potentials for shots but it doesn't even come close to the windup on Huntress - and is only 50ms slower than Trickster. That's not to say I'd be against it coming down though. The purpose of the delay was to remove quickscoping and give survivors an opportunity to make a read as to what the Deathslinger will do as opposed to just always dodging. To that end, I think the lowest I would be okay seeing the delay go is 300ms, which is just a smidge over the average human reaction time of 250ms. That would give survivors enough time to make a read but not enough to ""react"" to what the Deathslinger is doing - still weighing the odds in the Deathslinger's favour. With some other changes I propose later on, I don't think we'll need to tweak this at all - but it certainly wouldn't be unwelcome.

# The aim sensitivity

&gt;*This might not be a problem in the open or in longer loops, except when*   
*you have aimed down sights your camera movement is slowed significantly.*  
 *This results in an awkward control scheme where you either lose*   
*significant control over your aim, or you have a sensitivity switch on*   
*your mouse (which makes the killer have an unfair advantage for PC*   
*players relative to console).*

I think you are completely right. For some reason, Deathslinger's zoom does not line up with the reduction in sensitivity when aiming Redeemer. For the uninitiated, Deathslinger's FoV decreases from 87 degrees to around 65 when aiming (a **25%** decrease) but his sensitivity decreases by an insane **60%** horizontally and 20% vertically. Not only does the mismatching of horizontal and vertical feel outright disgusting on a mouse, but it's nowhere near a 1:1 sensitivity given the level of zoom he gets. This I think is why so many people quickscoped almost exclusively with him - it gets around that horrible battle with the sensitivity change. 

To make matters worse, the sensitivity changes immediately the moment you press the button to draw and aim Redeemer, but the FoV change occurs gradually over the course of the animation. This again adds to that motion sickening aiming that's extremely uncomfortable and **unintuative** even after learning it.

That's why I think we should be advocating for a gradual change in sensitivity to match the animation and zoom - as well as vying for either the option to set the sensitivity for Redeemer ourselves or bringing down the decrease to -25% over reverting any of the new changes. I think a lot of people would be surprised by how different he would play.

# The terror radius

&gt;*This nerf to his chase not be too bad of a change on it‚Äôs own if he*   
*still had his stealth element, as you could catch unsuspecting players*   
*off guard with your decreased terror radius to get some unsuspecting*   
*shots on survivors who are healing or working on generators, but*   
*increasing the terror radius from 24 to 32 meters gives the survivors*   
*almost 2 additional seconds to react to his approach.*

I would agree with this thought were it not for Monitor &amp; Abuse. Monitor drops a reasonable 24m terror radius into just a **16m** terror radius - which is already pretty scary - but factor in the max range of Redeemer being **18m** and you have a situation where survivors can be shot without *any warning whatsoever.* This isn't crazy strong (unless you bring in Iri Coin) but feels really unfun and unfair for survivors. I think this wouldn't be a big deal if there was some kind of lullaby like with Huntress that matched his base terror radius. As it stands though, especially factoring in the new addon changes, it just wouldn't feel good to play against because there's not a whole lot a survivor can do to fight against it.

With that said though, I'd love to see a PTB that toys with the following idea: Make that warning sound that gently plays when aiming Redeemer as loud as Spirit's phasing. That might allow Deathslinger to keep his super short terror radius and mitigate a lot of the annoyance that comes with being shot by harpoons out of nowhere. And now that we have the windup delay survivors would hear the sound, need to guess where the shot is coming from, and dodge it - if it's even coming at all. That to me sounds much more interesting than another lullaby or increasing the terror radius.",1633046583

Working from home completely changed that, no waking up at 6.30am to get to work for 8, no eating poorly because I needed to make food in the morning for lunch, less time in a stuffy office where everyone had the heating on way too high for my liking.

Once working from home I was able to exercise after work, eat fresh food for breakfast and lunches, became a lot healthier.

Tearing out the frames is a nightmare and prone to installation errors (I've done a lot of them). I won't describe the problems because you shouldn't do that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mhn9CDCY_k

Install the windows just as you see it in the video EXCEPT that guy is using far to little sealant. A window that size would use 3 tubes of sealant (it depends on the stucco texture, smooth will use less, rough uses more), You want that thick bead from the trim onto the stucco, at all four sides and not just onto the old frame, You want to make sure not water gets as far as the old window frame. I don't like to leave the gap at the bottom but there is a never ending argument about it. If you don't use enough sealant you may need the gaps to let out the water that would have never gotten in had the job been done correctly.

Use elastomeric sealant, Sikaflex NP1 is a good example but there are many. No silicon, no latex. Elastomeric sealant is expensive ~ $9 a tube but you want the installation to last and not leak, Imagine your self tearing out the window if you feel skimping on the sealant.",1633046585

Almost 80% of soy [worldwide ](https://ourworldindata.org) is used for meat and diary, with other sources citing up to 85%, most of this consumption goes to Asia.


""Seventy percent of Brazil‚Äôs deforested land is used as pasture, with *feed crop cultivation occupying much of the remainder*. And in Botswana, the livestock industry consumes 23 percent of all water used"" so its still for diary and meat.


""And in the United States, livestock production is responsible for 55 percent of erosion, 37 percent of all applied pesticides and 50 percent of antibiotics consumed, while the animals themselves directly consume *95 percent of our oat production and 80 percent of our corn*, according to the¬†Sierra Club."" [here](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/is-the-livestock-industry-destroying-the-planet-11308007/)


So we could have 95% more oat, 80% corn, 85% more soy not to mention the land which livestock takes all of this for 17% of the total calories and 33% of proteins, the rest is plants. So we get the remaining 83% calories worldwide out of those 5%, 20% etc because crops take only 23% of agricultural land and out of that mostly is also for livestock.

So English isn't my first language, and I'm on mobile etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple of friends, Jean, Tina, Mia (Not their real names) and I went out for a drink tonight. Jean was supposed to stay at my place for the night, anyway, after maybe half an hour Jean says that a guy she met earlier is coming to the bar we are at. We say okay, and he shows up (Note: Mia met him maybe around 30 min before she came to the bar, didn't know his age or name even though he was a couple of years older than us) after maybe 30 more minutes she decides that she is going home with him, a guy she doesn't know. 

She leaves, and Tina, Mia and I get to talking about how she always do this, and then the conversation turns to how Jean has a habit of putting any, and I mean ANY, guy before us, and we've known her for over 10 years. 

This then leads to what the title is about. Around two months ago, Jean and I had a grill/drinking kind of evening at my place, where Jean invited a guy, Cal, Cal has been talking a lot with Tina for at this point, and she is pretty sure she is in love with him (Cal doesn't reciprocate Tinas feelings, this is entirely about Jean and Tina, and how Tinas feeling betrayed). He's the first guy she has felt a connection to in a really long time, Jean knew all this, underplayed Tina's feelings for Cal when she talked to me about it, and asked me not to tell Tina that Cal has been at my place, I, like an idiot agreed. And it ended with Jean and Cal having sex.

Tonight I told Tina all of this, and that I was feeling really guilty about not having told her this before. This has lead to a huge confrontation between Jean, Tina and me, where Jean thinks I'm an asshole for having told Tina, am I?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I told a close friend that our common best friend had sex with a guy that the best friend knew our friend was in love with, and now there's a huge confrontation happening, aita?

Sofia mainly got jokes by the general public about making bad business choices. It would be hard to deal with, but it's not a personal attack. The members of this sub attacked her for about two months (I'd also like to note everyone blames Alex for a bullying campaign, but they don't acknowledge who did the bullying because it was them). I'm not saying any of what happened to her was okay, but just trying to say she's not regularly still being torn down.

Alex, on the other hand, has been ripped to pieces for a full year. There's a whole snark sub dedicated to each picture she posts and thing she says. It's ridiculous and draws attention away from the actual bad things she's done that deserve criticism. People have harassed her guests for associating with her and essentially given her all the blame of the past toxic Call Her Daddy, but don't give her any of the credit for the success.

Sure, further study may be required to determine exactly how to repurpose the drug.  Additionally, it may also only be effective as part of a larger care regimen.

That said, not even you can deny that there IS evidence to suggest it has an effect.

Your hunger is sexual desire (libido) while the pizza is the object (sexual attraction). Desires are physical things while attraction is the thing that latches on to attraction or the external medium with which to consider it. These are not mutually exclusive and can exist without the other.

You can be hungry (desire/libido) but don‚Äôt want the pizza (no attraction)

You can also *not* be hungry, but then see a slice of pizza and think ‚Äúyea, I could eat.‚Äù In that case, there‚Äôs no physical appetite or need but you attracted to it because you know you like it.

Asexuality can actually exist in each scenario. But asexuality tends to never want pizza. Hungry or not hungry, pizza just isn‚Äôt their thing.

"pittsburgh","t5_2qhrn","I have worked at UPMC as a lead software engineer for about a dozen years. As a corporate employee, I can't say more good things about working there; so much so that I have turned down offers of more money just because my team, the culture, everything is really good there. Employee happiness matters on that side of the industry, and it's now my job, as a lead, to make sure the 27 developers I oversee also feel that way. I work in the health insurance side, and tirelessly at that, to create web and mobile interfaces that people of all ages and ableness can enjoy. If you have used a health plan product, I have either helped develop it or have oversaw its development. I want our employees and members to have the best experience possible. The culture we have in my department is rooted in caring about everyone. 

However, my SO is a nurse on a difficult floor and while she never complains because she loves being a nurse, I constantly feel bad about how different our job environments are. She and her coworkers care about everyone too. She does the best she can to provide the quality of service that UPMC is known for, but then I hear about how hard she works physically, and know the very large pay difference in our roles, and I can't help but empathize with what life is like on the other side of this many sided coin. It's tough but like any job, if people feel they aren't treated fairly, employment is voluntary at the end of the day. People should be happy and paid fairly at their job, as I am. I hope others find that with or without UPMC.

At the end of the day, UPMC is a major corporation and employer, and American corporations are how they are. Anecdotally, if I can do what I can to change that, I will. I give people chances, I fight for raises, I want people from all backgrounds, genders, and identities to have the same opportunities, especially in a STEM field where that is generally not the case. I will continue to do my best to keep morale high for those that might feel less than in a large organization like ours.",1633046590

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","Thanks, I enjoy having conversations on the subject that actually consider secondary and tertiary effects of administrative decisions.  I know this sounds crazy for our usually hilarious and sarcastic sub, but I truly care about how decisions we make affect the efficacy of our organization to execute military operations on behalf of The People.  Over a long enough time frame, administrative decisions about how we evaluate individual humans for promotion or job placement inside our organization **does** effect our efficacy in executing our mission to defend and progress National Interests for The People.

Sometimes we may have to work just a tiny bit harder to ensure the ‚Äúright‚Äù people are promoted and the data provided to hiring managers and promotion boards is detailed and thorough enough to enable them to make an informed decision.  

On your points of ‚Äúwill probably highlight verbs and numbers anyway for quick consumption‚Äù we are again just shifting the work to another human.  Measure twice cut once.  Just write it in an easy to consume format to begin with.

Sure, does writing a bullet of fixed length take a little longer than writing a sentence of indefinite length?  Yeah.  Is it worth the extra 5 minutes at lower levels?  Yep.  Again, it takes me a duty day or less to write the EPRs of all my troops from the draft EPR and attached word doc my troops give me.  It also took them one duty day AT MOST to get that to me.  I‚Äôve been doing this a long time.  I‚Äôm not some crusty chief, but it *really* is not that hard, and I don‚Äôt know why people hate it so much.  If it takes you more than a duty day to write for all your troops; you‚Äôre really fucking up somewhere.   If I can handle drafting from blank for 5-8 troops in a duty day, and a chief can handle 60-70 EPRs in a day, then nobody should really be complaining about how EPRs are distracting from the mission.  It‚Äôs once **a year**.  

I just think people are only considering how it affects them personally.  Nobody seems to be thinking about the butterfly effect it will have on the service administratively and operationally as our identification or high, average, and low performing Airmen becomes  harder.  This isn‚Äôt just about promotion and time saving from admin duties.  The fate of a nation is affected by every decision we make, and the hiring manager for a [competitively manned] assignment needs to know **exactly** who is the best of the best with as many data points as can be provided.",1633046590

I'm a 3.0 computer rated, but had the regular Men's season not been scrapped in my area last year I probably would have been bumped up. Near the end of last year we had a 3.5 singles flex league and I was winning about half of the matches I had with 3.5 players.

2. Personally I love when the tank knows their limits. Your healer isn't an unlimited supply of health. They have cast times, cool downs, mana issues, and they can't run after you and cast at the same time.

Taking a punch is a skill.  Part of it is being desensitized.  Part of it is the little things like taking it as a glancing blow instead of dead on.  You also might overcommit a little bit more if you think you have the skill gap.

If you're cornered, stalked, or physically contacted against your will, then that is enough of a threat to respond.  You act with enough violence to make the threat stop.

The fact you're giving him trouble over defending himself is what worries me.  If it was indeed justified self-defense (which I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that it was, you can assess the situation based on what others have said), then being told he's in the wrong might make him less confident next time he needs to defend himself, in which case he might get hurt.",1633046592

I just got news that my housing situation might need to change. Right now I and three roommates share a three bedroom house, each of us (I, Roomie 1, Rommies 2 &amp; 3, a couple) pay $500 a month.

So I looked up one bedroom apartments (including studios) in my area, they *start* at $850 per month.

If we take the generally accepted budgeting wisdom that rent should only be 30% of your net income, that means that in order for that apartment to be affordable I'd have to make $2550 after taxes.

Assuming a 20% tax rate that means my gross needs to be $3,187.50. Assuming biweekly pay and a full 80 hours per paycheck that means my hourly rate to afford an apartment in my area has to be at least $19.92 per hour.

I just got a 3 dollar per hour raise and it's not that high. And I'm at a mid-level positron where I work, I've been there more than five years and I'm considered an expert in my field.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","What am I deflecting? I made a point, you didn't like it, and then you bowed out when you realized I wasn't going to take it lying down.

What goalpost did I move? I stated my point up front, and then you inserted yourself into the conversation, essentially talking past me and my original thesis.

As you said, community is defined by common attitudes and goals, as WELL as interests. It's those other parts which are important, and where the key distinction lies. 

You seem to be loosely and interchangeably using ""community"" here to refer to both the ""community"" of people who play Genshin in general, and those who participate in this subreddit specifically. 

I maintain that defining a community on such a tenuous shared element as playing a game is useless at best. If anything, such a community can only really reflect back on the game by the type of people who play it. Trying to turn that into a two-way street, implying that everyone who likes X also has characteristics A through Z, is nonsensical.",1633046592

the issue was that he would often ""forget"" that you worked a certain day, or that you had a certain number of hours for a given day. 

unless you were *really* on top of your time keeping, and could ***prove*** you worked the day/time you actually did, he wouldn't cut you a check to correct the amount and claim that ""you can't prove it, don't come crying to me when you're not recording things right"". 

it was always a fight, even when you *could* prove you were right.

the issue with proving things was that we wrote our time in/out on a piece of paper, with a pencil, and he wouldn't accept it if it was in pen. and since it was just notebook paper, half the time he would just throw it away and you'd NEVER be able to get it out of the dumpster.

the schedule was set by him and one other person, neither of who talked to each other. so you could tell them ""hey, i have a dentist appointment on monday, cant work"" and ONE of them would get the message, but the other wouldn't or they'd ignore it. you go to the dentist, you get a bunch of texts from whichever one didn't want to pay attention and have to take the rest of the week off ""because we don't know when you're available now.""

and the schedule was set a day before (so, the schedule for tomorrow is set today, and the one for the next day would be set tomorrow), and TEXTED TO YOU if you were LUCKY. if the boss had you on snapchat, he'd send you it there, or in the employee snap groupchat and assume you got it....

was sent a snap once, boss just wrote ""be here at 2"".... 2 ***what?*** 2am? 2pm? WHEN DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW UP!?! and wouldn't respond to me ""because my work phone was charging"" when i called his house at 1:20 to ask when he wanted me

he wanted me at 9am

he would also text you at random times with changes to a schedule, like after you'd fallen asleep at 2am and tell you to get there by 4am the next day.... 

I managed to show up after one of these texts one time, and he was VERY surprised to see me on the security cams as i opened the shop ( i just went about my opening duties assuming i'd beat him there). stupid ass called the cops because he thought i was breaking in, and had to admit he didn't think i would show up on time so he hadn't bothered coming in. 

oh, and the ""work"" he claimed he wanted me to do? it was cleaning chairs to go out on delivery...the same chairs he'd had me cleaning for 14 hours the day before in the parking lot in 102F with no shade or water....

basically wage theft, bullshit scheduling and a BUNCH of lies to keep you from making the 70+ hours of $7.25 minimum wage he owed you that week, or even cracking 30 hours if you didn't keep track well enough

i really wish i had been more informed of my rights, been allowed to talk about my pay and had been just a bit older (i was like 18 and just failed out of college, so i wasn't in a great place to stand up to the only person who'd even responded to my application)...

thank god covid shut him down and he had to move back to eastern europe to live with his brother and dad, if i saw that fucker again i dunno what i would do

it should tell you something that i met a coworker who was working sorting trash and cleaning garbage trucks/sewage trucks by hand, and he said he was happier now than working at that place....",1633046592

What's the point of telling me this? I really don't understand. What a horrible and shameful thing to use your family's deaths as an argument. I have sympathy for you and pray that the Holy Spirit comforts you but you need to realize you are not the only one who suffers and who has lost family members. Death is coming to everyone some day. Prepare your heart to God and get right so when death comes, you'll be ready for it.

I guess we need to think about how we could coordinate it into a process. Maybe teams can do the PR process then request the cloud engineer to apply the change\*\*.

"TropicalWeather","t5_2sue1","company press release page is non paywall version with key data: https://www.saildrone.com/press-release/ocean-drone-captures-video-inside-category-4-hurricane

This is a Sailboat not a ""surfboard"".  It did use a super small sail/wing, which would make them slow when its not windy.  It's a good proof of concept for wingsails in general.  It is the technology future of sailing, especially for commercial boat potentials (motor sailers and racing).  It is higher performance and more durable than composite racing sails, though not up to date on how much higher performance.  OTOH, in terms of potential to change sails, foldable is going to be a huge advantage for a boat.  

The idea of a hurricane wing on a mast/boom(s) that can hold larger (cloth) sails when winds are reasonable would be a very promissing design for cost efficient wing.

there's a difference between saying they could do it, and doing it.",1633046594

I really hope not. At this point I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt. I'll be pretty pissed if she is though.

&gt;any person that lives with her must be vaccinated

Mum and dad already have one. My brother is supposed to get his first with me. I'm th only one resisting. 

&gt;I seriously doubt you'll have any legal leg to stand on because it's not you that's losing a job, it's her

That's what I'm worried about. I know it's not legal for them to be coercing me, but I don't want them to be trying anything shifty. I'd rather prevent a legal shit show, but be ready if I can't.

&gt;she would have to be the one to bring any legal action against her employer

I came here asking if there was any legal grounds for their actions. Most people say it's an issue for fairwork. If they do try to get dirty, mum is fairly legally inept, any actual legal battle would fall to dad, he's the one fluent in legalese. I just want to cover our arses so that doesn't happen.

Mum is the main income stream for the household. If she loses her job the I'll be the only income for the family.

&gt;Have you tried googling the name of her employer along with ""vaccination policy""?

That's a good idea, thank you. Id rather not contact her company directly though.

I've told her to tell them that I moved out, but she doesn't seem to want to do that. So she's either worried about lying to them, or she *is* lying to me. We'll find out soon enough.

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","In 2020, there were 35 Senate races. In only one of those races did a state vote for different parties for president and Senate (Susan Collins). 

In 2016, there were 34 Senate races. There wasn‚Äôt a single instance of a state splitting its votes.

Compare that to 2012 (6 out of 33), 2008 (7 out of 35), and 2004 (6 out of 34). 

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and this will change in 2024, but the data I‚Äôm seeing shows at a statewide level people don‚Äôt split-ticket vote anymore. Sure, maybe they like their congressman or their state rep because they know and like them, but at a statewide level that isn‚Äôt panning out.

The reason why the computer doesnt see it as a blunder is due to the fact that you were objectively winning super hard. If a computer were to play that game out it would win every single time. Being down the trade doesnt really affect the end result. The computer obviously sees better moves, however that particular move is not losing by any means and is therefore not a blunder by computer standards. We are however not computers so the win is not guaranteed. That rook would have made winning way easier and losing it is therefore a blunder from a human standpoint.

Also there is to the best of my knowledge any divine moments that eye witnesses saw in Islam (Muhammad talking to Angels etc).

But I also get the mindset of the other school.

I'm reminded of the trope ""it was just Tuesday"".

&gt;For you, _event_ was the most important day of your life. For me, it was just a Tuesday.

Maybe they play a sport against the other school and this is the best team they play so for them it's the most important.

Tangentially related:

The year after I graduated high school, they opened another high school in the area. That school pulled students from the two existing high schools. It had no history. It had no rivalry except maybe among their own students pulled from the other schools. (Civil war rivalry? lol)

The other two schools, however, have a clear and ongoing rivalry. It's been a staple of the community for decades. When this new school was built, school board administration contacted various local businesses that basically use the original rivalry for promotions and whatnot to include the new school.

Walking into a local place after they made the change was hilarious. One restaurant updated their wall to include a football helmet from the new school (before there was even a team to try out for!) and put all three under a mural depicting various games and a painted banner that just reads ""THE RIVALRY"". As if all three schools have always been in competition with each other.

I still laugh when I see that and we're going on twenty years now.

Best part, there's a fourth high school across the river but still in our district that they could have paired the new school with as a rivalry within the area. But they're predominantly black whereas the new school would be predominately white and they didn't want to be seen as racist. smdh

And yes, that's the actual reason. I think the official reason was the fact that it was over the river - distance - but my parents were friends with the superintendent at the time and I asked one day when he was over for dinner. (How weird does that sound? The pandemic had made the most mundane of things seem outlandish. Having people over for dinner that aren't family. Yeah right!)",1633046596

"mormon","t5_2qky2","Most of them ending up joining the RLDS/Community of Christ. 

Strang refused to appoint a successor on his deathbed. Strang's own claim to succession was that an angel showed up and ordained him as Joseph's replacement. When no one came forward claiming to have received appointment by an angel (at least in a manner that was credible to Strang's followers), his followers were left scattered and without leadership. They were also tragically scattered as literal flotsam, when the residents of Mackinaw Island violently drove them from their home of Beaver Island following Strang's assassination. When the Reorganization, which founded the RLDS church, occurred in 1860, most of Strang's followers gravitated there, as did a lot of the other scattered Mormons who did not move west with the apostles. Indeed, most of the RLDS/CoC church's initial members were former Strangites.  

I recommend Vickie Speek's book *God Has Made Us a Kingdom* for a good history of Strang and the aftermath. I once asked John Hamer if there is any carry over of Strangite beliefs, traditions, or scripture into the modern CoC and he said that people in the CoC quickly forgot/disregarded their Strangite roots.",1633046596

Do you know this? We've had an issue where legal name changes were being processed by the ministry of health in one database, but not another. For years. 

Only fixed now after the vaccine passport came out in BC because shocked pikachu, a province can't ban hundreds (or thousands?) of fully vaxxed trans people from restaurants and events without ending up in front of the courts.

If you've done a legal name change, filled the appropriate forms with the appropriate agency only to have them shit the bed and only half complete the change and still have the name come up over and over again over a period of years, it shouldn't surprise anyone that trans people get pissy, especially if they're irritable because they have some kind of medical condition they're seeking treatment for.

Fuck me, I shouldn't have had to do the damn legal change, then file the appropriate forms several times in a row and then contact the health minister quoting FIPPA and threatening an OIPC / BC HRT complaint to fix it.

Who you probably present as is the 20 - 34 but who you actually feel you are is the emotional centre. It is so powerful the emotional centre no wonder it is the highest authority. (Like it becomes dominant over the other centres if defined).

I think split and triple split definitions really do benefit from having some of their thoughts at the pub or cafe or something. 

The 20 - 34 is usually extremely social, extremely energetic and of the ones I have known extremely sexual too. Also with five hanging gates out of the root you will likely feel when you are with others there is a certain pressure towards experience (You also have the 36 unconscious on a defined emotional centre that experiences quite a push towards experience.) The root is essentially pulling in many directions with all those hanging gates. And there are no format channels. the 52 - 9 being 'focus'. 

You have the 23 twice which is about creating group harmony so new ideas can be accepted. 

I was recently talking to someone about the Neptune in 60th gate so I know that you are about 23. On balance I would guess female because of things like 'I feel sad about this event and I want to have children' but I could be wrong. I have before guessing genders of users.

I now live so close to 35W that I can read one of the brightly lit electronic billboards from the comfort of my bed. Mostly it's just the general hum of highway traffic...except for the somewhat frequent crashes/screeching tires to break up the monotony.

While I got used to the trains at my old place and don't mind the noise at my new house, I much prefer the latter. 

As someone else said, it depends. There are lots of factors to take into account besides distance from the highway. Living in a city means you need to expect to hear city sounds of one sort or another. If it is specifically highway traffic noise that bugs you, I'd suggest staying a few blocks away.",1633046597

Put engineering first because it‚Äôs more competitive. 

That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôll have the rest of the year to figure out what you want to do. The idea is that if you‚Äôre accepted into engineering, you can switch to biomedical science no problem since it‚Äôs less competitive. But if you put your first choice as biomed, get it, and then change your mind, good luck getting into engineering. 

Getting into engineering is no joke. I have a lot of friends who put engineering first choice and had well enough grades but didn‚Äôt get in. Not saying it‚Äôs the most difficult thing ever, but with any competitive program and the university you want to remove any hurdles or barriers you may have to overcome. And if you do get into a high competition program, it‚Äôs not nearly as much of a problem to switch to something less competitive",1633046598

And this board is George, Ted, and a handful of other people born into wealth who probably think they earned it. It isn't a meritocracy at the top, so there is no reason to believe it would be anywhere. It's a fucking miracle that we have a decent young DC, but we only found that out after two years of a washed up pagano. 

The moral of the story is, of course this is a failure team, it is trickle down failure. No one at the top knows anything and they hire the people below them and worse, it's by committee. So you have 10 jerk offs getting their say, whether their opinion has any qualifications or not. This isn't a winning organization because it's never been a winning organization.

Except I never argued that China was a pure utopia with Jetsons-level technology and raindows that appeared in the sky 24/7. The point was expressly about the end of the Chinese practice of slavery.

Now granted, I got the date range wrong. It was actually sooner (re: under a communist regime). 

&gt;Slavery abolished beginning on 31 January 1910. Adult slaves are converted into hired laborers and the minors freed upon reaching age 25.[146](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom#cite_note-Historicalsurvey-146)

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The girl planted the box at the crossroads, using what she‚Äôd heard her parents talking about after watching their favorite tv show.

After a few minutes a man with short, brown hair and strange red eyes appeared.

‚ÄúWhat can I do for you, young girl?‚Äù The red-eyed demon asked with an irish accent.

‚ÄúI want my kitten back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour kitten,‚Äù The man said with a chuckle. ‚ÄúYou do know what you‚Äôre asking for, right? The life of an animal who will be alive for 12 years or so, in exchange for your life in 10.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I want my kitten back forever!‚Äù

‚ÄúForever? Well, if you insist. But in ten years I‚Äôll be back for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTen years is a long time,‚Äù she said with a smile.

‚ÄúNot nearly as long as you think.‚Äù 

He reached out his hand, and she shook it.

He may be a demon, but even he wouldn‚Äôt kiss a child like that. His mother raised him right. More or less.

‚Äî9 years, 8 months later‚Äî

The young woman planted the box at the crossroads, this time, with not a request, but a plan.

The red-eyed demon appeared.

He remembered her.

‚ÄúHello, Ashley. How‚Äôs life been treating you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo far so good. My cat is healthy and well, thanks to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. Your deal comes due in a couple months now doesn‚Äôt it? Are you here to ask for an extension? Beg for your soul?‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúQuite the opposite.‚Äù

The demon‚Äôs smile fell. ‚ÄúOh? How‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see, you never sealed the deal, and you forgot about a technicality.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst, minors can‚Äôt make legally binding agreements.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a human concept. No demon would stick to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecond, you never kissed me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you were a child. It would‚Äôve been improper.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet, the deal is unsealed. My cat was resurrected, and I never need to give you anything in return.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell- I- you see-‚Äú

‚ÄúGoodbye, King of the Crossroads.‚Äù She marched away, proud in her intelligence.

The demon sighed. In the old days, he would have found some reverse loophole, but he supposed he‚Äôd been hanging around humans too much. To be honest, he kind of admired her guts.

‚ÄúBest of luck, Ashley. I hope you become a politician or lawyer so you can put your cunning to good use. And so that you‚Äôll be in a position where you‚Äôll probably want a deal again eventually.‚Äù

So i guess we're just gonna have to wait and see. I also think he said something about the token itself is going to be the fuel... that's all i remember. Bottom line is that right now we can just try to piece together what information we have been given but the big picture will be revealed in December. No one can say anything for sure

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","This is probably going to get down voted to oblivion, but this whole concept of cultural appropriation seems like an extremely American concept to me. 

And I sort of get it, I think. Like you have a lot of minorities, and when people from the majority just take stuff that's associated with a minority without giving credits, that feels like adding insult to injury.

But when you start applying it on a global scale, it really comes down to other countries not being allowed to export their culture because some Americans might get insulted. Like, is calling the wearing of Indian garments by white Americans 'cultural appropriation' in the best interest of actual Indians, or is it just in the best interest of some Americans? And similar questions with Japanese kimono's, etc.

Feeling connected to your heritage from another culture is beautiful, and it should absolutely be cherished. At the same time though, people who live in that culture should be allowed to export that just as much as the west exports its culture. 

On a local scale, the concept of cultural appropriation seems like a good way to protect marginalised communities from having their identifying traits stripped from them and made generic. But on a global scale, the west being allowed to export its clothes, movies, songs, food, and other parts of its culture without any limits or questions while simultaneously explicitly banning other cultures from doing so, strikes me as lopsided and imperialistic. Especially when considering that on the global scale, the cultures in question aren't minority cultures, but can be huge instead.",1633046605

I believe there should be hard content and there should be easy content.  We should have content which caters to the consumer of it.  I believe there should be a curve of harder content.  Why should demo which is more on par with vos right now in terms of difficulty be placed in the new players method to improve their toon.  I think there is an argument to move demo out of the RTQ.  Maybe now even an argument to increase the Ad for the other queues that are easier.  Maybe 20k to 30k rAD for the normal dungeon queue.  Most players will still take a while to do but at least your back towards getting people a path to improvement.

Ireland is not England, Ireland is not uk, Ireland has nothing to do with uk. Calling Ireland connected to uk via Northern Ireland is wrong because Northern Ireland is not part of mainland Ireland and the Irish government has nothing to do with it, also because of brexit now it is basically like a separate country and even before that it was kind of separate country. The people in Northern Ireland consider themselves british for the most part and people from the roi/mainland consider them to not be entirely Irish

Edit:btw it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgeographically connected‚Äù to Ireland anyway, the Irish Sea is literally in between the two countries?!? The only way England is connected to Northern Ireland (ignoring the republic) is by their political dependencies and a bridge from Belfast to England",1633046607

I've not seen this discussed in any of the prior DIY threads.

This thread is only about the ability to reuse coils from an existing mattress if those coils are still good, instead of having to buy a new set of coils.

A lot of the more recent DIY threads are about creating all-latex or poly/memFoam/latex builds, with the specific advice given to purchase a stretchy knit cover with *no* fire barrier, as opposed to more traditional quilt- top zip covers.  One particular stretch knit cover keeps getting recommended and linked to at Sleep Like A Bear in the DIY threads.  This has occurred dozens of times.  Another stretchy knit topper cover at SOL also gets recommended a lot on this sub, as a mattress replacement zip cover, and it too does not contain any wool or other fire barrier material.

Users of r/Mattress should know and be reminded there are covers that use 100% wool quilted to cotton.  The ready-made latex builds by APM, SOL, and others use those covers as well as make them available for purchase on their sites.  Wool provides a natural fire barrier.

Perhaps you could place a reminder in the other DIY threads about needing a fire barrier as part of a safe build?  There are probably 5 to 10 new threads created each day in which someone looking for a new mattress is guided to a DIY build instead of purchasing a mattress.",1633046608

You think the game should become whatever the streamer that helped you discover EFT said it should become and have a massively distorted view on the development and goal of Tarkov. It was never about being a multi millionaire or the literal god of death with a scav case full of dog tags, it was never about entertaining an audience on Twitch or sponsored tournaments. 

It's about being a shitty soldier in a shitty city, with shitty gear who gets a little bit better every day and gets a little bit better gear until it all culminates into self sufficiency in a short lived end game, then it resets. *You need to be happy with less, that's the secret to living with Tarkov*. Simple gameplay loops, simple wins, simple losses, get in, get out. Don't worship it, don't create a religion based on it, don't become a terrible person and don't say terrible things just play the game and live your life.

I've got the MD, CFO, CMO, AD and everyone else excited by the ropey proof of concept I put together. Now we have to go and tell them that it's  not actually that secure and due to limitations we have to employ an entire industry of people to manage the authorisations and actions to add and remove people to content.  Artifact level access will be a godsend but sensitivity labels and DLP policies are just a pair of huge snowballs coming at you. Truth is there are controls at source data, O365(inc DPS and sensitivity policies) tenant level, workspace level, app level and report level. But we we need better controls. Where is the page to see who has access to content by type or group, in a single place? Where is the other side where we get a summary of the content a user has to assigned individually or via SGs. It could be so much easier for admins and governance. How come I have to document model with a 3rd party to? Why don't we have PBI governance view like we do with data lineage? Why isn't there a separation between sharing permissions and authorisations? I could go on for hours. You raise a very valid point and it highlights Power BIs biggest weakness which is access and governance as most of what you need to do sits outside PBI. Instead of adding more and more marketing led content and niche use cases it would be helpful if you listened to users. Just because you build in a million  options doesn't actually make it better.

\&gt; The goal of the game is to kill as many of the competitors as possible in a 15 Minute timespan.

Focus all your attention on hacking this goal. If they don't appreciate it, find other teachers, or join industry where they will. For instance, one strategy could be to rush and kill one opponent, then DDOS the post and get requests. Maybe you can send a 1GB attachment in the post request? Another is to find the keys of opposing teams, perhaps in a shared repository, perhaps by social engineering.

In the end for assignment 4 I did a case study approach and I presented it with slides and video/audio of me presenting it as if it were a case to be disseminated amongst professionals - I did well on that and it brought my grade up fortunately.   


In terms of the forum grading, I never received feedback or a breakdown, but I did participate in all and I did always provide citations for every claim I made.

&gt;There are a thousand other reasons for Myrrdin to be there, and this one is one that makes an incredibly small amount of sense. For Myrrdin to be there for a heart demon, he'd have had to fly to Brockton Bay after finding out that a heart demon would form from a precog, since he'd have to be there prior to a heart demon having formed. Also, why Myrrdin? Why does he have to help with anything?


I am using him as a specialist in parahuman investigation. Basically he is a CSI tech. parahuman edition. He is pulled in to investigate the attack on the mall.


&gt;~~Lastly, Sophia, sure. How would Emma have an easier time with their own heart demons? How have the PRT not figured out that Taylor's the cause of this by the second or third heart demon? Does it still work if and when someone else kills a heart demon instead of Taylor?~~


~~Taylor won't actually manage to kill any of them. Mall security takes down the Aspid Hunter. A PRT officer kills the Flukemon that spawns at Taylor. With a second spawning on Sophia and getting defeated. The third time the Protectorate intentionally triggers a spawn with the most of the team present. It is Emmas and it is a Nosk. By this point they will have a better handle on what is going on and Taylor will have been separated from everyone for safety reasons for a little while.~~


&gt;&gt;After all three bullies are dealt with Taylor makes the trip to her mothers grave in some fashion. Currently thinking dream journey. Obtaining the flute she will use as a support item. Buff allies. Debuff foes.


&gt;Didn't the Trio ruin the flute? Are they giving it back for some reason?


Her mothers ghost restored it or fuses with it or something. It is the destroyed flute but obtained in a magical way.


&gt;&gt;It needs to be something small like the bank robbery. Perhaps uber and leet going after chaos Emeralds? Meaning robbing a jewelry store where she is getting a case for her flute.


&gt;Also, you don't go to a jewelry store for a case for instruments, even for display cases. How about something really petty like she's at a music store for a case, when the place is raided by Uber and Leet who're doing a Jet Set Radio thing and only attacked for the video rather than any real gain, like the GTA episode that everyone knows about?


I will watch a few lets plays first but thanks for the idea! It is most likely what I will use.


&gt;&gt;She goes back to school during this time and meets Yuno Gasai (This name is also subject to change. It just made me laugh).


&gt;Using names from other franchises is always a bad idea unless it's a crossover. The name sets and expectation that the fic's character will somehow be similar to the original character with the name.


&gt;Worse still, if you make them similar, then it becomes a really weird insert of an unrelated character, which throws things off and makes the whole situation somewhat cracky. If not, then it confuses the reader after they don't read your fic for a while and come back to it when it gets updated.


&gt;There really isn't a need to shoehorn in an OC either. There are characters that they are more likely to start bullying already at Winslow, like Charlotte or Greg.


If you know a female student who is Asian in the same grade as Taylor I will switch from original character to her. 


Greg is a possibility if I make him a general Asian equivalent to an otaku. But I already had some small plans with him reading litrpg and sharing the hobby with Amy (Panacea). It would be an online friendship with him not knowing who she really is. I don't want that to intersect with the main story until much later.


&gt;In fact, why would they choose to bully anyone other than Greg if Taylor was no longer an option? He's the easiest target by far.


&gt;&gt;~~Because Emma and Sophia switch targets out of fear of what will happen if they keep bothering Taylor.~~


&gt;~~This is a bit out of character, especially since there isn't a bigger reason so far for this to be the case beyond regular canon. Emma, maybe. Sophia? She'd take the heart demons as a challenge and double down on it. She'd probably also convince Emma to do the same, or Emma might just keep doing it because she refuses to believe that Taylor can be strong or whatever.~~


&gt;~~Even without bashing, Emma and Sophia are kind of nuts.~~


~~This is taking place when the Protectorate and PRT still have eyes on Taylor from the heart demon section and Sophia knows it. I just assumed she would let that heat die for a while before starting back up on Taylor.~~


&gt;&gt;~~Madison is no longer in school due to her skin mostly being gone. Panacea did the best she could to restore it.~~


&gt;Why would Panacea not be able to just restore it to full? She should be able to heal skin loss just by punching Madison after wrapping a raw fillet mignon on one hand and a raw McRib on the other.


Word of god from wildbow: ""She can regrow missing body parts. She can't conjure material out of thin air, however. Even donor material is tricky because the body is liable to reject it unless she invests the time to alter it on a deep level.""


I could have sworn that I had seen a word of god stating she cant work with dead things like raw meat but couldn't find it so‚Ä¶ I guess that will just be another AU element of my story. Think I am going to have to put the words ""Heavy AU"" in the title.


&gt;&gt;Taylor should start confiding in Yuno during this phase and have to save Yuno (Who just triggered) from lung. Taylor feels untouchable. When Yuno joins the wards so does Taylor


&gt;Wait, so at the point of being an upper level athlete with no other real powers other than what her flute does, she saves Yuno from LUNG?


Should have said ABB not lung personally.


&gt;If Taylor feels untouchable, she'd have had to BEAT Lung. I think you might be seriously underestimating Lung here, or at least seriously underselling him.


&gt;Not to mention why ""Yuno"" is being attacked by Lung in the first place or how Taylor finds out. That isn't really much of an issue, but it's something you'll need to think about.


To press gang the new trigger into the ABB. The overtures from the ABB started out more gentle but eventually escalated to trying to kidnap Yuno. I was thinking the attempt could happen when the two are together. 


&gt;Also, joining the Wards so easily is kind of out of character for Taylor, especially if it's just because her friend joins. You've established that there isn't much personality change yet, so...


&gt;I think this has a simple solution if Taylor and ""Yuno"" escape without taking Lung out. Rather than feeling untouchable, Taylor could end up joining the Wards to keep themselves safe from Lung, hopefully.


Thank you, I will try to work this in. It makes sense.


&gt;&gt;Taylor finds out that ABB slavery and sex farms are propaganda by the empire.


&gt;Then what was Lung doing with ""Yuno""...?


Press ganging the new trigger. As I stated earlier referring to lung in particular was premature. Although he should know about Yuno it is too early for him to take the field. 


&gt;&gt;This would be more familiar to some as Holocaust trains. The empire murders families of immigrants and minorities(including sexual minorities) then use this network to hide the bodies.


&gt;???


&gt;What?


&gt;Wait, so are there like, actual trains in Brockton Bay that nobody noticed somehow?Why would they need to use any kind of system to hide bodies? They can do it just fine by throwing the corpses in the Bay or something. It's not like the water gets explored much due to fear of Leviathan


Reichsbahn would be how the more low profile cases are hidden. The reason the program exists is because the nazis don't want a reputation as mass murderers even if it is true. The term Reichsbahn literally translates to German National Railway however it is being used by the nazis to refer to Holocaust trains. Just as the Underground Railroad was not underground nor a railroad, this program is also not a literal railroad. 


&gt;&gt;including sexual minorities


&gt;? What does this mean...?


&gt;Do you just mean children? Because if so, that's kind of already implied. Other than that though, I'm not sure what this term means.


A sexual minority is a group whose sexual identity, orientation or practices differ from the majority of the surrounding society. Primarily used to refer to LGB or non-heterosexual individuals, it can also refer to transgender, non-binary (including third gender) or intersex individuals.


&gt;&gt;She is a minor brute now and she gets sloppy in her fighting. Letting herself get surrounded she needs to be bailed out. Sophia calls Taylor a coward because she did not help Madison.


&gt;She should have been a minor brute since Qi Condensation. Starting from Core Formation, she should be mid-Brute. It's cool if you nerf it though. Weaker powers are better for storytelling.


&gt;&gt;~~Sophia calls Taylor a coward because she did not help Madison.~~


&gt;~~Where did this come from?~~


&gt;~~Where did Madison come from?~~


&gt;~~What's happening that required Madison to need saving? From what? The E88? Why are the E88 against Madison?~~


~~She needed saving from the aspid hunter which Taylor ran away from at the beginning. It is just Sophia's first chance as a hero to rub in Taylors face that she did not help Madison with the aspid hunter heart demon.~~


&gt;&gt;Intense things like the flamethrower from the end of the flute or calling down lightning should be in her reach but she might not know how to do them. I am not sure.


&gt;Flamethrower isn't intense at all. She should be able to do that by Core Formation.


&gt;Lightning on the other hand is a natural phenomena. For something like that, she'd need to be Soul Formation at least, I'm pretty sure.

If it's balljoints usually a visual inspection shows the rubber boots are damaged and the grease is gone. Shooting some lithium grease from a spray can (or any grease but thats easy mode) into them will quiet them down temporarily and confirm the issue.

There are two balljoints on each of the front wheels. Upper and lower. The upper is built in, so you have to replace the whole upper control arm. The lower can be replaced on it's own. Parts range from $150 - $600ish depending on what you buy. I suggest landing somewhere in the middle, I bought moog problem solvers and 5 years and lots of gnarly 4x4 later they are still going strong.

They are safety essential. They support the weight of the car onto the wheel, so when either breaks the wheel is basically flopping around, it's especially bad when the upper goes.",1633046611

He was super premature and his growth is the number one vital thing for lung growth so we surveyed my mom group and made our own decision, which met in the middle from the 24 oz a day he was at and the 16 she wanted with 20.

If your baby is putting weight on his legs and attempting walking there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything to worry about, and you are 100% right that walking is a 18 month milestone. Just because ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of babies do it well before then doesn‚Äôt mean a baby who walks just before 18 months is delayed or doing anything wrong.

...The timeline that we provided of 3-4 weeks is regarding the¬†entire process from actioning the request on our end to you receiving the physical DRS statement by the mail.

We manually process your withdrawal within 7-10 business days of receiving official confirmation of your request to withdraw shares to DRS... Due to the extremely high volume of requests that we have received lately, these are processed on a first-come-first-served basis.

Once ... you see the shares are no longer in your account, the rest is out of Wealthsimple‚Äôs hands...

From there, our processing provider also manually processes the request before your shares arrive with our transfer agent (this can take 2-5 business days). Once the shares are in possession of the transfer agent, they are the ones that send you the physical DRS statement, which is entirely dependent on the postal service...

"AnxiousAttachment","t5_3im8q","Wow. It must suck to have a partner tell you that they need a day or two away from you to not even text. Hopefully, her therapy sessions work out and she grows more emotionally available. But I suppose, it's good that she is communicating with you beforehand on which days she will be completely unavailable. 

But I do recommend asking yourself if this is what you want? How often does she need a day or two away from you? If it's just once a month or every few weeks, I suppose that's easy to accommodate. 

But what if you have an emergency on one day, or you had an injury that day and got hospitalized, or maybe something bad happened to a family member and you feel sad... But it's on the day she asked for space. Are you going to have to wait a day or two before you can talk to her??? Just feels pretty restrictive. 

Think about your own needs a little more. Is this a good partner for you long-term? I do hope her therapy works out. 

You seem like a very patient person. Hopefully, it works out for you. 

Wish you the best.",1633046612

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","Indeed, but I always thought Thanos at least had his guard up, to at least react to an attack. Afterall, he has good reaction speed. 

Otherwise, he's somewhat dumb. And, he never struck me as dumb before. 

I could understand not reacting to an attack from behind, but Ultron-Vision was right in front of him for a good few seconds, surrounded by destruction. Which, should have given Thanos a hint. The thing with the stone in it's head is surrounded by death. Maybe, would be a good idea to ready yourself.

However, assuming I'm wrong, there's still the durability  thing. Going by past movies, even a full blast from the Mind Stone shouldn't have cut through him like butter. Just injure him significantly. Which, isn't at all a light feat. 

As someone below me mentioned, it took a Vision mind stone blast, Thor lightning, and Iron Man repulsors combined to melt Ultron's vibranium body. And, it wasn't even close to instantaneous melting. I don't imagine Vision was using less than 50%, at least not less than 40% of his beam power, to melt Ultron. 150% that shouldn't then cut through Thanos like butter, as later on Thanos tore through Vision's own vibranium body with drastic ease when grabbing the Mind Stone.

That is a strength feat, but also shows the skin resiliency of Thanos, so also slightly a durability feat.

Ultron may have upgraded the Mind Stone's beams, but that was never specified at all, nor implied.

I know I'm overanalyzing fiction though. Just saying it doesn't add up.",1633046612

"TrueCrime","t5_2s5e8","How about a car that a death occurred?  In the early 90‚Äôs I worked at a new car dealership. Our used car dept purchased several late model cars at auction. One of those cars sold quickly. At the time of purchase it was Fall and cool outside. Fast forward a few months and the temperatures start rising (in Texas). The customer brings car into service complaining of a foul smell. We find that someone has crudely placed new carpet over the original carpet. When we remove it we find that the carpet behind the drivers seat is stained with blood. After further inspection we find blood between the drivers seat and console as well as splatter in the dash ac vents. It had been detailed but these areas were missed. The used car manager went back to the people at the auction and found out that the original owner had their throat slit by someone sitting in the backseat. The manager got them to agree to take the car back but the new owner wouldn‚Äôt hear of it. She said she loved the car and did not want to lose it. We replaced the carpet correctly, fumigated the interior and she happily took it home. It was hard for me to get technicians to work on it when she returned for any service after that.",1633046613

Folks that were paying attention and had some history with Sinema were quick to point out what was being advertised didn't match the actual product but her opponent McSally was clearly unacceptable.  If there's any hope for the future, the candidates that she'll be primaried against (and she'll without a doubt be primaried) will with no question be more thoroughly vetted.  Arizonian's won't be surprised again. Until that time I'm afraid we're just going to be hopeful she doesn't inflict too much damage during the remainder of her certain **single** term as a US Senator.",1633046614
"learnspanish","t5_2rd6d","The main difference is the emphasis in the ""i""

For ""ia, io, ie, iu"" you want to pronunce clearly the ""i"" and then follow up to the next vocal. You may even take it as far as too think that there is a small pause between both vocals.

For ""ya, yo, ye, yu"" the ""y"" it's more like just mean to the next vocal, with a very lazy and fluent  pronunciation.

Some languages have the ""open vocals"" and the ""close vocals"". Spanish doesn't, but i would say that ""i"" is a close vocal and ""y"" it's open counterpart.

Edit: after experimenting a bit i realise that when saying ""y"" i stick a little my tongue to my palate, and for ""i"" the sound just go straight from my throat.",1633046615

"Starlink","t5_2qpxi","I think the RF engineers look upon us muggles and say ""the muggles want the wizards to make the regular smartphones work like comedians describe them - connecting to that satellite in the sky. But that is a Bad Idea because of Physics - and not just Theoretical Physics, but Physics You Need Math To Understand.""So when some groups gets a backer (sucker) to fund them to put a cell tower in a satellite, and they manage to somehow relay text messages in a demo, of COURSE they are gonna write an article about it! It's marketing glitz! And you say But Why Not Starlink???Then the engineers hop onto this conversation and say ""well you can't just copy/paste your desires onto existing equipment not designed for it"". And I say ""well... maybe if the frequencies were somewhat compatible with the antennas, and we're talking end-of-the-world scenario here ... you could possibly cobble together something that could maybe work for just a few smartphones."" But honestly this would never happen because you're better off just buying the specialized satellite communicator that lets you send text messages through existing satellites designed for this type of communications. Or putting a cell tower on the ground with the correct antennas (notice the demo satellite DID use the proper antennas, unlike Starlink which technically does not use the same frequency ranges).

Also for posterity, [5G frequency ranges are listed as below 6 Ghz to above 24 Ghz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G) while Starlink is 11/14 Ghz according to u/shaim2. I'm not saying it would be pretty or efficient, and there would probably be a huge amount of errors and spectrum bleeding around and it might have to downgrade to super low data rates, but I would be very reluctant to say ""it will never work"" to a bunch of RF engineers. Like, I would say ""it would never scale to the number of smartphones you're thinking about"" and ""it might require you to put the phone into a dish to focus the beam to the satellite"" but if you have ever worked an ham radio operator doing packet radio in the field you would not say ... *never.* Would it be a pointless demonstration?

Lot's of stuff to play around with, and this doesn't pigeonhole you into a Wordpress guy so nothing to worry about there. Take on other assignments when they come up, suggest extending with custom plugins, and work on your own stuff at home.

"MurderedByAOC","t5_xkt2h","I think the issue is that people heavily rely on the media, and the media portrays Biden as a different person than he is in reality. That's why some voters viewed Sanders as ""aggressive"" (because of the way he talked and pundits opinions) yet they didn't seem to know about Biden's multiple aggressive outbursts during the primary. Or why some voters criticized Sanders for repeating some of his lines while being unaware of Biden's gaffes, like his ""have kids listen to the radio"" answer when asked about his past reparation statement. It also doesn't help that people would prefer to watch clips of the debate instead of actually sitting through the whole thing, and the clips usually omitted these types of gaffes and mistakes.

Also, the largest influx of voters during the 2020 primary came from the 50+ age groups, which largely rely on mainstream media. That's one of the big reasons why Biden did well, along with some other suspicious happenings that make me question the legitimacy of the primaries (that aren't legally protected in any way).",1633046616

&gt;&gt; # [El aberrante audio del masajista acusado de abuso sexual: ""Te hice masaje de ovarios""](https://www.minutouno.com/sociedad/abuso-sexual/853)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;   ""Te hice todo lo que es el masaje de ovarios"", se puede escuchar decir al hombre cuando su clienta de 2020 le cuestion√≥ lo que hab√≠a pasado durante la sesi√≥n gratuita que pas√≥ de ser ""descontracturante"" a ser el disparador de un abuso sexual.
&gt;
&gt;Ambas [mujeres](https://www.minutouno.com/mujeres-a5128383) aseguraron que el masajista us√≥ aceites que las adormecieron, lo que les impidi√≥ reaccionar cuando avanz√≥ el ataque.
&gt;
&gt;C. explic√≥ al canal El Doce de C√≥rdoba que el hombre us√≥ aceites que la adormecieron al punto de bloquear su reacci√≥n, y la mujer que la contact√≥ por Facebook dijo que pas√≥ por lo mismo.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Pero el masajista insisti√≥ en su audio de 2020: ""Te hice todo lo que es el masaje de ovarios.
&gt;
&gt;Eso ya es otro masaje.
&gt;
&gt;Te hice drenaje en las piernas, te hice drenaje en los senos, en el pecho, descontracturaci√≥n en la columna, cervicales, te tuve que bajar la bombacha para hacer todo lo que es parte de gl√∫teos"", explic√≥ el hombre, para quien su sesi√≥n ""fue un masaje muy profesional"".

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","* There are many easy live plants out there: Chain stores have them, r/aquaswap, etc. Online stores like Buceplant.com have tissue cultures which are pest free. If you get plants from a tank (or not tissue culture), then Google how to dip them and quarantine separately to avoid hitchhikers and parasites introduced into the main tank. 

* **Rhizome plants**: Anubias or Java Fern (beginner plants, easy, low tech/light, attach to driftwood or decor or let float, don't bury the rhizome or else they'll rot). Java Moss, Flame Moss, Buce, etc.

* **Floaters**: Frogbit, Red Root Floaters, Salvinia Minima, Dwarf Water Lettuce, Elodea. Liquid ferts like Easy Green or Thrive by NiclocG (start off with small doses then adjust) works well for these.

* **Planted**: Water Wisteria, Crypts, Dwarf Sag, S. Repens, Amazon sword, Rosette sword, Rotala, Bacopa, Jungle Val, Limnophilia, etc. Root tabs like Flourish Tabs works well for these. 

* **Moss balls**: Rinse it out, roll it onto a ball, and put new conditioned water into the cup, then put it back in and into the fridge for qt 1-2 weeks. The cold temps greens them up well. Once they're in the tank, rinse in tank water you siphon out each week or so, then roll it into a ball again. That way they get light and stay green on all sides.

* For low tech plants, too much light will cause algae. Timer highly recommended. I use the Century Digital Timer, it lets you program 5+ time sets. 6-7hrs is a good starting point.

Just search some on Etsy, AquariumPlantFactory is one iirc. Look at reviews and pics",1633046616

Sex needs to be mutual and something you both can share, and if she holds the keys and does not share them with you that is kind of a bad dynamic.

According to Mangadex rules, MD does allow Groups to post links instead of the chapters in their site as long as they meet the conditions set in the rules section if i understood them correctly.

&gt;!Main fact Bilibili are the official publisher for these titles, though i wouldn't put it that Bilibili aren't getting preferential treatment,!&lt;  
&gt;!\-For 1 they didn't place links to the chapters but rather to the manga/manhwa/webcomic page in their site though they posted as an individual chapter in MD.!&lt;  
&gt;! \-In some cases they didn't care about the existing chapter order making it appear they have more content than the already existing chapters shared in MD (might be secondary to many but i don't see a reason why they couldn't preserve the chapter order even more considering it was following the correct numbering). !&lt;  
&gt;!\-Overall the mass exposure feels unjustified since MD in these titles does have the link guiding to the official Publisher and users like me already knew they are the official publishers from several sources.!&lt;

When Google search analytics were free for the public there was a pretty repeatable method you could track ME subject search histories worldwide as a function of time and you generally would see spikes in 2009, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 for affected subject material. 

I take this possibility seriously in part because I have only experienced flip flops in 2017 and 2018 and the effect has been almost nonexistent for me since 1/2019 with only 1 exception. 

If your question is how and not why, we don't really know.  Some possibilities are collisions are affecting our ability to remember clearly or affecting our ability to distinguish unreliable memories. Direct effect to consciousness.  If memory is accessed via quantum processes we may be accessing memories stored in a nearly identical timeline. Large extinction events are shunting our consciousness into a new timeline en masse. 

This guy does a bad job understanding and trying to translate the publication gatekeeping, but does a good job laying out the timeline of the experimental runs and the concerns about unintended consequences from the LHC. I'd suggest just skimming through:
