"lasik","t5_2sihf","Soft lenses do not meaningfully correct HoA's, while RGPs or Sclerals, through a combination of mechanical plastic deformation and the presence of a tear film, are able to significantly alter the corneal optics in such a way as to smooth the cornea and somewhat correct HoA's.  

post-LASIK dry eye might be an impediment to contact lens tolerance however.  So a 'nightmare' scenario could very well be contact lens intolerance and HoA symptoms.

Therapeutic transPRK, sometimes combined with corneal cross-linking, is often an option to fix LASIK that has problems of those nature.  But it can be difficult to undergo another surgery after a failed primary surgery.  And therapeutic re-treatments from the relatively few practicioners worldwide who can do them properly can be hard to access.

That said, flashbacks are all fine and dandy but sparing a couple of pages for Inuoka at some moment of the Summer Camp would have made his character arc more organic. He fell out of (the narrative's) grace way too abruptly.

It's also a good omen (for the possibility of Year 2) that Furudate is adding depth to Nekoma's roster with Teshiro. I wonder how will they take advantage of the 'Calculated One-Point Two-Setter' (lol). Considering Kenma's reaction, maybe he's a decent server?

I also wonder if we'll ever meet #8 and #10. If we go by the team's vacancies, both should be WS and, considering the numbering, 1st years. It bothers me that Nekoma has so few third and second years but I'm not going to be too picky about this.",1535760002

"hotas","t5_32txt","I have been waiting for the Gunfighter since the first announcement. Like almost 3 years ago, I'm in Europe too. Yet I didn't went Virpil, as I value the additional functionality of the VKB stuff. I had an extended Warthog for over 6years, the Virpil T50 would clearly be an upgrade on the Gimbal side. As we can't really sell the Warthog Gimbal alone, I sold my full stick, and I find the T50 grip to be a downgrade to the Warthog, so.. Going extended Warthog to T50 base and Grip wouldn't have been a so huge update. While going GF I win MiniStick, brake lever, dry clutch. No loss at all, only win. T50 grip don't have CMS.. Huge no go for me. Also the software is far from Target and the VKB configurator. The larger throw of the GF and curved extension also interest me a lot. Again, going Warthog 15¬∞ to Virpil \~12 to 15, apparently it's not symmetrical on the pitch axis, would have been a loss. While I win 5¬∞ on each side with the GF. If I had went Virpil, I would have wanted their next Grip for the Ministick, I also would like twist, so.. Again another Grip? Or an adapter? While going VKB I go GF MCG pro and I don't see what they could do more to upgrade their grip really. Force sensitive ministick, but that's really expensive, I would also have preferred only one ministick, and a 4 or 5 way hat for trim.",1535760002

On this particular day my brain said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs in Catalonia‚Äù - just as a statement, no particular emotion.

There is a category normally referred to as glass cannon, such as grishoalbrand. That deck can win on turn 1, but it is an all in combo. And without the right pieces it let's other decks win easily.

Some aggro decks have less reach, or have trouble beating certain strategies/cards. Even in that case they tend to be pretty well tunes, Bridgevine and hollow one are more variance then any other aggro deck, even so they still perform very often.

Most combo decks are designed to consistently win with a regular hand. Storm players can goldfish turn 4 very reliably. What makes a combo deck consistent is 7 or 8 copies of a card that can win for you after setup.

"jillstein","t5_2ty1q","Do you know the difference between a federal designation and a state law? 

In regards to the telecom designation, congress had simply never done their job and given the FCC the right to regulate broadband. Therefor net neutrality could not be implemented at the federal level. To get around that the FCC listed broadband as falling under telecommunication designation, which they did have the right to regulate. That gave the FCC the right to regulate, but also added a bunch of arcane and restrictive telecommunication rules that fell under the law. It had nothing whatsoever to do with restricting freedom of speech. When Ajit Pai ruled to change broadband designation back from telecommunication, he effectively blocked the FCC from regulating the internet and ended net neutrality. All that needs to happen to restore net neutrality on the federal level is for congress to pass a law granting the FCC the right to implement net neutrality over broadband. Then we get net neutrality back and no asinine telecomunication rules to go along with it.

Cal. Penal Code ¬ß 653m(b) on the other hand is a state law. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the federal net neutrality, telecom designation by the FCC, or even the state net neutrality (unless that particular code was revised by the net neutrality law). That state law existed separate of the FCC net neutrality and seperate of the state net neutrality. It exists whether either of those net neutrality laws exist. And as such, using it as an argument against net neutrality is disingenuous at best, especially since net neutrality is about regulating ISPs and not user content.

You're basically conflating a bunch of separate stories to create a narrative.",1535760005

I got off the bus and started the mile walk up uphill at Interlocken which is a sprawling corporate office park.  The building was up near the crest of the hill next to Rocky Mountain Metro Airport.  The kicker was that it was during a blinding spring snow storm.

On the way up I slammed my big toe into a sidewalk slab that was sticking up a couple inches but covered in snow.    The pain was excruciating because I have arthritis of the big toe. (hallux rigidus)

It's entirely cultural, by definition. Anything innate is biological, by definition. That's sex. They are different things.

Biological sex is binary, ova producers on one hand and spermatozoa producers on the other. That's how reproduction works in our species and every other sexually reproducing species on the planet. Exceptions of infertility and disorders of sexual development don't break the rule. If you wanted to start an egg farm you wouldn't get a mix of roosters and chickens and hope they all laid eggs, now would you? Stop pretending you don't know how reproduction works.

I've always wondered why antennaweb shows practically no channels for my address, but dozens six houses down the street. Does it know that much about the geography and other obstacles between my house and the antenna farm?

Also, with my old flat-wave whatever, on an outside wall of my master closet 20 feet on from TV, on it's included amp, with a baking sheet behind it (believe it or not), I used to get all the major channels except KTBC down in the low VHF frequencies. 

That's until recently, when I, too, began having spotty performance with KXAN and KLRU. In fact, at that time I even picked up a larger (better?) antenna for the attic, but haven't found the sweet spot for it (difficult to do by myself). I also need to try it in my master closet since that's where the flat one worked best (I have tech shield on the roof decking). It amazed me it worked better on the wall, with trees, brick, and all the homes between here and there, but that was the best spot I found in the house. 

Oh, one time, a directional antenna handed down to me performed best pointed at the FLOOR in the same closet than it did pointed at the towers. 

Truth be told, I don't watch a lot of TV, so fixing it hasn't been a priority; just like to always get it working before guests expect to see games on the TV during the holidays. ",1535760011

So instead, she looked at my medical history (I dislocate/subluxate almost daily), and did a full physical exam. She found a few physical indicators of vascular type, but I didn't have enough major symptoms to be diagnosed vEDS. Then, during the physical, she found [piezogenic papules](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0601/p2327.html) on my heels. These are usually associated with EDS, but not with Marfans. She called it immediately at that point.

Participating in class is a great way to start, because then they can see that you're engaging with them and the material that they teach -- aside from that, yes, going to office hours can help. I'd say to start by participating in class so that the professor can get to recognize who you are, that you're engaged and motivated, etc. and then to start going by their office hours to talk.

If you do choose to go by their office hours, make sure you do your research first -- if you want to speak to them about their own research, look them up online (the school website or elsewhere) to see what kind of work they have done in the past. If you can find any of their publications, read or skim something to see what you can grasp from it. This way, if you don't have any questions or comments about the course material, you can approach the professor to tell them what you find fascinating in their research.

Honestly, my rapport with the professor who created the position *for me* began when I followed her on Twitter. I hadn't even taken her classes yet, but I was registered for three of them and was about to start my first semester of university (as a transfer student) so I figured that I'd follow her and get a feel for who she was so I'd be prepared when I started her class.

Like, ""Go to the lawyer, and get your shit together"".

""Well, that was before. We're (magically) ""changed"" now. We're in a ""good"" place."" 

I don't think Ron and Jen would even know how to function in a healthy relationship. What pisses me off is, Ron was crying last night. Not just solely for his daughter, but for himself for attention. Jen is a crazy fuck and Ron is a crazy fuck. Another Sid and Nancy. However, unlike Sid and Nancy, there is an innocent baby involved who doesn't deserve ANY of this.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So I've been going to this dentist since the early 2000s. Around 2008 this dentist built a building across town, rented out most of it to other businesses, and he moved his practice to the 2nd floor where it has done quite well. Both the building and the practice were named after him, last name of course. When they opened in the new building they put in the latest computer filing system for dentists, and I think they've switched it since for another newer one. While they kept all the original paper files, they never bothered to enter them in the new system. 

A few years back he sold the practice and the new owners changed its name.  

At least three times I have had to argue with some young dental tech, that yes, I have had this surgery.  $dentist did it 15 years ago, twice,  back in the old office, back when the practice had a different name, different owner,  different filing system, and different location.

I've lived here 18 years. The building is only 10 years old.  But no, I'm just some old guy who apparently doesn't know what my own teeth look like. ",1535760016

First of all, the loading times are quite cruel. I'm commenting as I play, if it wasn't feedback friday I would just give up.

I have had some issues of buttons appearing on top of texts too.

The system seems complex enough with crystals and wands, which is cool. I can't see every part of the controls because the screen cuts off though. It does seem a bit overwhelming with a lot of stuff.

I like the in gameplay graphics, looks way better than the UI stuff. I think you would better have a tutorial to introduce the controls.. Maybe. Putting X as the button to leave the game is a bit upsetting, maybe use ESC? Easy to press X by accident.

The camera troublesome when you entered closed spaces, not sure how you can fix that though.

Totally agree about the right wing propaganda machine though. I know a lot of factors contributed to Trump falling breathless and exhausted on the finish line, but without Rush and Faux News etc. he wouldn't have had a chance.

The First Amendment was supposed to guarantee that voters had access to accurate information, but, as with so many issues regarding the constitution, the founding fathers could not have imagined the technology we've created or how easy it would become to spread lies and bigotry to millions if people instantaneously.

Anyway, please don't give up hope my friend.

The ""anti-rape class"" approach is based partly on research that suggests that people who commit rape/sexual assault actually don't consider what they are doing to be rape/sexual assault. For example, from [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/health/men-rape-sexual-assault.html)

&gt;men who commit sexual assaults...usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex....Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge nonconsensual sex ‚Äî but that does not mean they consider it real rape. Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again.

&gt;Asked ‚Äúif they had penetrated against their consent,‚Äù said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did ‚Äúsomething like rape,‚Äù the answer is almost always no.

This research does not generalize to other crimes. So it is not surprising that we see intervention to try to teach people what counts as rape/sexual assault and why it is bad, but we don't see this for other crimes.",1535760018

I'd say a [65 Chevy El Camino](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/1964_El_Camino.jpg) was the starting point, seeing as how these are GM A body platforms.

Probably not that difficult of a mod to do, and would involve mating a GTO front grill and fascia or entire front clip onto what is essentially a very very similar car. The belt from the Pontiac clip would have to be carried along the entire length of the body, as on the the 63 and 64 El Camino it's much wider but not nearly as pronounced. ",1535760018

"futurebeatproducers","t5_2t5r3","This has a solid foundation. I dig the direction and vibe you're shooting for, especially the flute-ish sounds and metallic percussion (has a bit of an odesza influence to it). 3:16 was an unexpected switchup (the twinkly lil synth reminded me very much of flume's newer stuff). 

I feel that there are a few essential things that could elevate this track greatly. Try your hand at learning more complex chord progressions, to give a bit more expressiveness and accuracy to the atmosphere you're trying to weave. Try to have your lead synths not always exactly mirror your chords, build sounds in layers rather than the same progression in multiple layers (if that makes sense). 

From a mix down standpoint, I'd suggest introducing some much needed high end to your percussion, to really give it the snappiness it's lacking. Multi band compression will also enhance this (make sure you don't over-emphasize the transient, you'll just end up making the sound less impactful). More drastic panning on synth layers rather than just perc will enhance the stereo spread of the track. A deeper sidechain over all the synths, not just the chords, may provide a better groove; ultimately there's no rules to any of this, just do what sounds best to you. Not bad at all man.

"Wordpress","t5_2qhjq","Page builders like Elementor or Divi make it very easy to make many designs without custom code or custom styles, but they don't really let you make every sort of design or functionality, and they don't help make large sites manageable.

for example, elementor pro offers several styles of ""testimonial slider"", but there aren't enough to have an option that matches every site's intended look and feel. if you want a testimonial slider that matches a specific design or layout, you may need to re-style the normal elementor block, or you may need to build your own.

In the same way, if you have many pages on a site that need to show many testimonials in a slider, and you want to update them regularly, it is very hard to have to go to each page to change the testimonials. With custom coding, you can design features for the specific needs of each site. So, for example, you can have a custom post type for testimonials, which provides a single place to edit them, then you could have a custom block that pulls in testimonials by category, onto different pages. For a large site, that would be much easier to maintain and update than separate testimonial sliders on each page.

The last limitation of page builders is that, if you have seen enough sites built with them, the designs start to feel very similar and stale. Even with all the layout and block combinations possible with Elementor and Divi, sites tend to feel very similar and somewhat ""cookie cutter"".  That isn't a huge issue at certain price points, but for larger clients, you really need to be able to deliver something that feels tailored specifically unique to their brand.",1535760020

My D&amp;E will likely be on Friday, assuming nothing comes up to make me question that decision. 

I'm hurting because I feel like I didn't enjoy the last ultrasound. I didn't really get to see him and now I never will. There are all of these fears that I have for the next time. Between things that could go wrong and more petty notes, such as what if it's a girl and I feel sad that I lost my only son. I'm really pissed that I'm still feeling sick and I'll be going right back into another miserable first trimester once it's safe to try. There's more anger here than I had expected. 

In the end, I know I'll survive. It could have been worse, in a lot of ways I feel lucky that we found out so quickly and were able to get in to see the MFM doctor immediately after finding out.

They intentionally give everyone a small amount of stash space to make them want to pay, when the amount of stash space is virtually free for them. It's not like stash space is a finite resource.

As a fan of the series, I will say, that, with fire emblem being more of a niche franchise (if that makes sense) it definitely doesnt deserve to have 7 characters over zelda, and 2.5 of the FE characters are clones (Roys in a gray area). Its surprising to me atleast that fire emblem even has this many characters playable in the first place. Do any of them actually deserve to be in smash? Outside of marth, none of them really. I mean, you could argue about ike, since he is a good canidate for most popular character in FE, but none of the others really deserve to be in. Roy and Corrin only served as advertisements for their respective games, and awakening as 3 reps because i dont know why, only reason i can think of is because hurr durr it saved the franchise. 



&gt;3 fighters from one era of your series alone is already as much as or more the majority of series in smash




I will agree with you on this, as it is alot more than most series get, and FE is extremely lucky to even be in smash outside of japan in the first place, not even taking into consideration everything else i talked about.




At least to me, the problem is that FE's 7 characters are not extremely diverse. We have marth, reverse marth (roy), a marth clone, a clone of reverse marth, Ike (who out of all the stock sword users is the most unique compared to marth), and then we have robin and corrin who are both half sword users. The main problem is that all 7 characters are sword users. There is not much diversity in weapons, aside from robin with the magic, and corrin with the dragon powers. Bows, lances, axes, and 100% magic users are com pletely ignored. If anything this makes FE even less deserving of its 7 characters than it already is. 






Tl;dr, I can see where you are coming from, but you dont have to come off as (and im sorry for using this term, i cant think of anything else to use) toxic.





Edit: Forgot to mention this, the representation of non 3ds/awakening fe is still not nearly as good as it could be, as both stages are generalizations of series staples, the one item is a series staple, and the 4 non awakening (Tiki is in that gray area) are from only 1 game (ikes game). So to reiterate, we got 1 assist trophy, and the 4 trophies that are a ll characters from ikes game. Nothing from geneaology or thracia, nothing from gaiden, nothing from sacred stones, Blazing sword only gets an assist trophy, if it werent for roy being added in as a clone for basically  advertisement, binding blade would have nothing, and the only representation of marths games is marth himself. Fates only got corrin in BECAUSE it was purely advertisement for Fates. 




Tl;dr again, it would just be nice for the other nonrepresented games to just get acknowledged with a collectible trophy or something, Im not asking for 5 new fighters, or even anymore stages, just a trophy or something would be nice, aside from focusing on awakening only, and giving a few prominent/important characters in ikes game a trophy.",1535760025

My entire comment was also about earning trinkets under the current system that reflects your skill level, not sitting on your ass and earning pity prizes. All they've done is adjust the scale of this reward, they are most definitely not letting actually good players go by unrewarded.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","1) Never put meat in cold oil. You can test the heat of the oil by throwing a small crumb (meat, bread, garlic, onion whatever really) into the pan and if the oil sizzles it‚Äòs hot enough.

2) Use your ingredient to its fullest. Use almost everything an ingredient offers! If you need lemon juice for a sauce, why not use the zest to give the salmon or whatever you are cooking a nice crust? If you plan to cut off the fat from a steak, why not use the fat in the pan to add flavour?

3) Season with your ingredients first, before helping with lots of salt and spices! Most food can change it‚Äòs flavour depending on how it is prepared. In a frying pan or on a grill, veggies will almost ‚Äûcaramelize‚Äú and give a wonderfully sweet note. In a steam pot with very little salt they will gain rich flavour instead, but will need a little salt to get the flavour out. Meat can be ‚Äûseasoned‚Äú by slightly burning it (NOT BLACK! Just brown, like grill marks).

4) Use oil to fry and butter to baste. Basting means taking the juices from the pan with a spoon and pouring them over your meat. You always wanna do this.

5) size up your ingredients! Same size = same cooking time ;)

6) Rest your meat. Let it cool down a bit on a board before serving it. It will cook on at a lower temperature, so fast cooking meat will have to be taken out of the pan a bit sooner!

7) Ingredients make the dish! If an ingredient is on its own, use a good version of it. If it gets mixed (like in a sauce), use cheap. E.g. Tomatoes: Canned tomatoes are more than good enough for tomato sauce, but you want nice tomatoes with rich flavour and not too watery for a salad.

8) Scents go together. You generally want to go across the palette, sweet, bitter, salty... Don‚Äòt overdo it on one end, try to balance it!",1535760028

If you have shutters, you can remove them to paint and repair them if you don't feel like doing it on a ladder. If you're not apt to doing work on a ladder, try to take them off. Some places sell lathes for broken shutters.

If you do the sill work, gouge the rot. Go over it with a coat of oil primer. Let it dry. For the Bondo, it'll be a golf ball size of the grey stuff and a pea sized amount of the red stuff. Mix well on a scrap piece of wood. Keep this small piece aside for the other parts because Bondo dries fast. Once you patch the gouge, sand it smooth, electric sander helps but sandpaper (80 grit to rough it down, 100-120 to smooth it off. Oil prime again, then paint to your color liking.

"AatroxMains","t5_38ams"," **The first comment previously selected (I take it out so he lets me post)** 

LOL, The heal on W was a lot of micro games (hit a champ or minion-ward to heal more or cost your health to keep the fight or finish him, all this in less than 3 sencons) the kite while ulti and the  immense macro game that defines the game doesn't cares seems, LOL. 

""Tons of combo"" HAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Dude this game is  league of legends, the combos in general are patetic compared to other games, they can't do a massive game about combo, so they have 5 abilities. Combo on Boris: Q-W-EQ-Q, whoa AMAZING! Old aatrox: Q-AA-E-R-Tiament: WHOA! AZAMING COMBO!

Dude, don't be idiot, really. Boris and old aatrox have a really sad combos  with Static skills and high CD. The problem is boris can't do more, old aatrox still can do things, the things are not do AA, are a lot of macro game    
because those small decisions can be a disintegration or something excellent if the constructions of correct way. Sure boris and old aatrox do this, the problem is boris when click three times the Q a lot of macro games is lost, this is him main problem, that's why people still say he needs a rebalance or even a mini update, to don't be so dependent in one ability. Even i say i want to keep both champs, but Boris really needs a ulti that makes you feel World Ender, even the music at least makes you feel that a little. In fact, this happends to old aatrox. Same mistake again

**Even Riot said "" Ezreal is an extremely popular champion "" in the champion roadmap when they announced his rework.** 

Funny thing that only applies when goes op

 **Still is a revive, which is still broken when you are a carry** 

¬øRevive with no AS, the most important thing on old aatrox kit, even with the bug on W? I still don't know what kind of champs you play. Make lucian-ezreal-anivia, etc every most important thing on every champ and them take it away when revive. Plz dude

Aatrox carry, well i don't understand this. If you refer about the Damage, old aatrox is supposed to be a  Skirmisher  and again, you revive without the most important thing, is like revive yasuo with no Q to use

Even Zac got a patetic passive that needs massive buff in his time to make it work and the funny thing is that was ""decent"" because the TP. So no, revive is not broken but yes is a hard ability to balance. Even Boris need the help on his Q. Revive is a passive 2800 gold HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, sure with 0 efficiency in this cases, even if don't never like the buff on his passive,  because was toxic for me, but even with these buff his status in league doesn't go better. That's why a lot of times is better fix bug and make healthy change than simple buff

**Challenger people still got hit by it. What's your point ?**

Is more easy to dodge, sure theres a time when take the hit is worth and a lot of times when not. This problems is really clear when you try to do a pick up with aatrox and they got vision

Challenger people still got hit by old aatrox. The thing is  how do you react and what happens after the reaction, boris can't do more. I'm not going to deny it, it's good that a champion shows clarity, but even it has a limit, I do not think it's in a bad place but it's not in the best spot right now

 **So ? She is still not as ridiculous as aatrox, who has a revive passive. Imagine a Camille that can dive in, wreck your team, and then revive.  And she is even not that kind of DPS. She is like a nasus, with enchance AA. Her Damage has spike, not evenly distributed like old Aatrox.** 

Lol, if you engage the enemy team with old aatrox you just explode LOL. Camile engages AA-Q, R to dodge and disagange to leave alone his victim and them applies his Q with titanic or hydra

He got a lore more DPS than aatrox. Enchace auto is still an auto. The old aatrox spike on this W was real. Camile goes to (least say, becaushe is a lie in fact) low dmg to HIGH dmg, old aatrox goes mid damage, he goes high dmg with the cost of his HP (a lot of hp that doesn't applies life steal), so is still a mid damage. Is not distributed, camile has a damage really distributed  the damage of aatrox was continuous in mid-late game, in early game was more a AD caster than a basic attack champ

 **Care to explain ? She has to hit her abilities. Unlike old aatrox, who can aa for it. And how is it more unfair when she is ahead ? She has to hit the same ability.** 

 It is not correct to say that you must hit the skills, this is why old nidale defenders got fail.

 The problem is when you give her the possibility that she chooses the freedom of when to do it. That there is freedom is perfect, but a metaphor to explain this is: No right is absolute, the limit is when it affects the other's right  In practice, the problem is when you do not have room for movement or you have no choice or you do not have an ability to move. But if you fail the last one, you're an idiot.  The problem with irelia is that when she has freedom, she has too much and that is why she can practically not fail, but since she does not have a swing point, when she is free she is extremely opaque, it is almost impossible for her to play 

The Q is just another enchance AA,  with many cancels antimation

**A top lane vayne has better DPS and better poke, same with quinn and teemo. NO ONE PLAY GNAR FOR DPS.** 

Nobody plays gnar for DPS, but he is a DPS champs.  It is undeniable that it is not the essential quality, but it is

Ej: Jax tank

**And ignoring the fact that he is MUCH MORE PROBLEMATIC is not a good argument.**

**And no, They didn't ignore those champs. Kayle is the next to be reworked after Ezreal.**

 The same main many years we had ideas to balance the champion, even so that this was weak but healthy so that the player does not feel frustration  There are two ways to see it: If you ignore that it is difficult to balance, because other champions are much more difficult, then it shows that they are capable, but they do what is best for them in the short term and not in the long term. Bone a few liars  If you do not ignore this fact, taking into account what has been said previously so as not to repeat it, then we are facing a company made up of people who are not professional 

Lol, four years is not a ignore champ........ LOL. Hey btw patch 5.16 make laugh all 

**And esport is d2+. And if so, WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM BEING GOOD IN ESPORT ?**

**And he has 47+% win rate in Korean D+. What are you talking about ?**

Never, but NEVER you can say Esports is the high elo on soloq.   This could be accepted in KR, but even watching the faker streams you realize that it is not the same organization. In soloq personal decisions continue to prevail, the more elo you have, these decisions are going to be accompanied by your colleagues, but not always, but in the esports ALWAYS this happens, there is no margin for error 

High elo on soloq is NOTHING compared to esports. Even, you like to him the reason to riot, they say a lot of times  that it is necessary to preserve a certain average balance between both, so that an abrupt imbalance is not created in one of the extremes. Every year with the worlds they say it 

 **And what's the problem here ? Have you ever seen anyone complain about Ryze being toxic? Or Azir? Or Galio ? What's the problem of being an esport champ, not a soloQ ? Is a champ not allowed to have utility instead of damage ? If so, what is the point of Support and Tank?** 

I see a lot of times people cry about ryze because the by the machine gun, this was shown by the forum and reddit in the two previous reworks. Azir... may god,  they said azir could do anything, including things that did not exist yet

Ej: The Q was pure burts, in fact was a more burts champ than DPS, clear wards from long range, can't trade him in mele because the burts and DPS, the shield knock up, etc

¬øGalio? ¬øHow many fucking times galio was nerf, because in full tank still do a massive DMG, them the Q explodes everyone and then nerf again?  
 The problem is the champ goes well with utility on esportes because the organization, the dmg is a just another good thing to add. But in solo, there's not  organization, at high elo you only can predict  but if utility becomes many times low because it is not accompanied by the team

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","&gt;When Karl Marx picked through probate records to develop his theory on capitalism, his cataloging and aggregation of information regarding incomes on property and intergenerational transfers of wealth did not affect the behaviors of the individuals composing or executing wills and trusts.

Karl Marx's theories on economics had quite a dramatic knock-on effect on the entire political, economic and social history of the world. 

&gt;When the Fed and the BLS and the Department of Interior and the SEC gathers and publishes periodic surveys on consumer spending habits, employer hiring, capital expenditures, inventories, debts, and unit production, the simple act of measuring activity does not cause the economic participants to change their behaviors, so long as the measurements occur predictably and consistently.

Government and private economic reports cause economic impacts in very trivial and obvious ways all the time; valuation of companies, prices of commodities, value of currencies and so on. I don't see how you could argue otherwise. If participants in a market base their actions on the information available to them and the framework which they use to interpret that information then providing them with new information or a new interpretive framework will change their behaviour and alter the market, possibly in chaotic ways.",1535760030

&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
Below are the latest known issues after yesterday‚Äôs game update.
&gt;
* Starting Mod Battle 9-C causes endless loading for some players
&gt;
* Attempting to equip recommended mods while in the basic view without having enough credits is resulting in error 40 and forced you to restart the client (Note: we deployed a temporary hotfix to remove the error message and prevent the client restart but you will not be notified if you do not have enough credits)
&gt;
* GP doesn‚Äôt immediately update in Player Stats after slicing a mod
&gt;
* Events that require Capital Ships do not correctly count the number of valid units needed to enter the event. This is a known issue with how the Capital Ship is being included in the total.
&gt;
* ~~Some players had Weekly Shipments that were blank before the weekly refresh~~ **FIXED**
&gt;
* ~~Players are able to swap mods after locking in their team in Territory War~~ **FIXED**
&gt;

Getting ready to give Odd Paladin a whirl after taking much time off with it. I'm noticing not as many decks run Leeroy as I had thought, and I only have one Stonehill so I dropped it completely. Nixed Stormwind in favor of Boisterous Bard but not sure if that's wise, or the inclusion of Void Ripper. Any thoughts appreciated (ie, drop Void Ripper to include 1x Stormwind, drop both the ripper and the bard in favor of 2x Stormwind, etc). 

I play R14-10ish so I'm not sure how helpful my anecdotal observations are going to be re: making tweaks.

Specific examples and citations please? 


&gt;As much as I'd prefer if God had prevented the Israelites from keeping slaves, I'd much rather him prevent all murders/rapes from happening within the next few years. 


""God"" apparently had no problems whatsoever when it came to commanding his followers not to commit murder and adultery (Along with creating graven images, wearing clothes woven from mixed fabrics, eating shellfish, engaging in homosexual acts, lying about virginity, having sex with a woman who is menstruating, mixing meat and dairy, eating pork, performing any work on the Sabbath, striking or cursing your parents, planting more than one kind of seed in a field, cross dressing, etc...)



Funny that ""God"" and Jesus never once bothered to simply command their followers with something along the lines of, ""Slavery is an abomination. If you would follow me, you shall not own people as property.""




Apparently, doing so was far less important to ""God"" and Jesus than was banning the consumption of shrimp cocktail and pork fried rice or the wearing of a wool tie with a linen suit.

It‚Äôs really put me off doing any more maps. Each one took me over 2 days of my time (I‚Äôm a beginner) and I did it so others could have fun (easy, normal, hard, expert with light shows) but it seems players download and consume the content with no regard to the fellow player who made it.

It‚Äôs so disheartening.

I could post a photo of a carrot on Facebook and get more feedback!

As long as the players continue to consume the custom made maps with no thanks or regards to the creators, the quicker this game will die. 

There needs to be some in game feedback on maps. I try to make family friendly maps as I know the ‚Äòparty mode‚Äô is made for everyone.

1. I was a fuzzy! 

2. I think I'll just edit my post with those. Probably should have included a bit about my educational background to begin with.

3. Of top 20 schools? I also was accepted to Notre Dame, and I was waitlisted at 3 or 4 others. I chose not to ride out the waitlists; as soon as I was accepted to Stanford I (mentally) committed.

4. Nope

5. I think that it depends a lot based on which graduate school you are applying to. Some are extremely competitive, others maybe less so (if, for instance, you are a Stanford undergrad and you want to coterm, it is fairly easy to get accepted into a grad program so long as your grades are solid). Here's what I can say (although it is anecdotal) from attending an information session held by a panel of professors of Political Science and International Relations: their department specifically (and departments at other top schools) prefer to take undergraduates from other prestigious institutions for admission into the PhD program in Political Science. That is to say, they'd rather take a Harvard undergrad rather than a Stanford undergrad for their PhD program, all else being equal. They described it to us as ""cross-pollinating."" Do you have a specific program in mind? I'm not sure if this is specific to this one discipline or holds true across many departments. Admissions to other programs are different; for example, the law school's admissions is heavily weighted towards your numbers profile.

6. Dang, that's a tough one, and I'm not sure what I'd pick. Can I give you my most bitter-sweet memory? It was during graduation weekend, when it finally really hits home that you're leaving. I was really busy juggling entertaining my family, finalizing travel plans, and packing. My friends were insistent that I come to the Claw and hang out with them (bear in mind this was after 1 AM, and graduation was the next morning). I finally went down to chill and drink some beer. When I got there I realized that this was essentially the last time we'd all be together (except for graduation I suppose). As we all trekked back to our respective houses afterwards (most of us were on the Row) we stopped in a bunch of houses to say goodbye to random friends. Unlike the lucky people who take no classes and ""camp Stanford"" their senior Spring, I had had a really busy quarter and didn't have as much time to socialize with people for my last quarter at Stanford. So it didn't really hit me until then that this may be the last time I see some of my friends (at least, until we're old adults at reunions, and are completely boring).",1535760036

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Sure, if you want to be pedantic about it, there are other reference frames where it hasn't happened yet, but none of those have any relevance to science.

And don't forget space is just as relative as time. But you're not arguing about the distance, are you? Why not?

&gt; so much that the photons, were they aware of anything at all, would barely notice the passage of time

They wouldn't notice the passage of time *at all* - if you could apply the concept of a reference frame to a photon, which you can't.

No laugh track. Fade to black. End.

In Edith's near-rape episode, she runs out of the house after pushing the guy's head into the cake/oven whatever, blouse half-open, screaming. The audience cheers End episode.

They provide a concierge in my condo. They provide 24 hour security. We have a pool, spa, fitness center better than any gym in the area, a sauna, bike and surfboard racks, free reserved parking, a fully equipped business center, and high speed wireless.  Our party room is pretty nice. 
In exchange I agree to act in a civil manner and follow some pretty reasonable rules. I can live with this. No one ever, and I mean ever, anywhere, bought in to a HOA community without first being given the rules and expectations. Never. It‚Äôs the law in every state. So if it didn‚Äôt work out for you, who‚Äôs fault is that? 
Yes there are some associations where people on a power trip run for the board and prove they are asshats. But the emphasis here is on ‚Äúrun for the board‚Äù and are elected. So a second requirement for successful living in a HOA community is to vote.

also be sure to yell fore!!! before they tee off, implying their shot will blow ass.  this all is covered in ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" book and ""The Art of the Deal"", two very crucial golf auto biographies written by the likes of men who have maintained an everlasting legacy of dominance on not only the green but also the driving range (perhaps after u finish the round, u invite your clients to the driving range to exhibit your trick shots?? this is how to seal the deal, trust me on this one )))",1535760040

This GIF shows caves of all possible kinds (both short tutorial scenarios and the main dungeon), each randomly generated 8 times (it's not completely random, though, because stairs need to match on all adjacent levels and their particular position in this PCG run does constrain layout to some extent):

Here is the current state of the main content definition file, the one describing places (rooms and other structures populating caves):

I may yet need to add some items and monsters and fix and tweak a couple of things, but soon I should be ready to start testing before a new release. I will need to spend a few weeks or months rebalancing the game and fixing whatever comes up in tests, but I don't expect the content format nor content itself to change much more, especially the dungeon layout content.

Excuse me, I meant hottest recorded temperatures.

The temperature record isn't taken from just the measurements of 1800's scientists or tree rings, or from just those weather stations. Modern data is taken primarily from satellite readings and, yes over 8000 weather stations all across the earth. The link I provided gives multiple ways of measuring past temperatures and, hey, what do you know, they all agree. It's almost as if those numbers are accurate.

I mean we bombed the fuck out of North Korea so hard, we actually ran out of targets to bomb. We dropped more bombs on North Korea during the Korean war than we did in the entirety of World War 2. But yes, it was their rejection of capitalism that made them poor. Further, no one is arguing for Juche government. So...

And yes, the US vs the USSR. One nation was untouched by the war, one nation was completely pulverized by it. The USSR rebuilt from an agricultural economy to being the #2 economy, massively increasing the standard of living of the citizens living in it. During that time they beat us to space, they built some of the earliest high level programming languages, innovated on rocket and bomb designs (eww), made advancements in computer science, as well as in medicine, and numerous other achievements. 

Also the companies you claim were making the innovations? Again those innovations were funded by the US government. Why? Because the US Government realized the USSR was beating them in science and it was because the government funded them. GPS, the Internet, the Microprocessor, the Computer, all of these were government projects. Not capitalists.

‚Äã

As for the kids babying you, if one of them had been thrown and blacked out long enough for someone to go get help and come back, I bet you'd be watching them pretty carefully too!  They're learning how to love from you, it makes sense that they're also learning how to care for the people that they love from watching you.‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

Just a random thought, and totally not my business so please ignore if this doesn't apply, but it's from my own experience with developing strong relationships with wounded teenagers (my nieces). I also bet they'd be in some trouble for riding a horse, who is either unknown or known to spook easily, full out without the proper safety equipment.  I know you've been trying to reassure them, but have you apologized to them for making a careless choice?  They are dependent upon you and the sudden fear of losing you must have been terrifying.  It's a fine line between your personal independence, not instilling over caution, and respecting your experience. But since you've already implemented the helmet rule, clearly you've changed your behavior to make sure future possible damage is prevented.

But as they're growing into adults, the respect that you show them through apologizing for not **being more careful with yourself\*** (not just for an emotional outburst, like during the drinking incident)**,** especially when their care is dependent upon you, will go a long way toward teaching them about the respect and consideration they deserve.

(\*This is also a great thing to tell yourself when you're feeling pulled in multiple ways and really need your own self-care.  Your self-care is as important to their well-being as anything else you give them.)

- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e and following), 
- The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) amended Title VII, 
- The Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206(d)) 

Although it is not perfect, we also have the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which protects a job that a women has for up to 12 weeks after childbirth or adoption. You can‚Äôt be penalized for taking the time off.

As to why we don't provide the socialist polices that Scandinavian countries offer, the answer is quite simple. There are countless people in America that want to limit as many social services as possible. Therefore, we do not get as many. That is how democracy works.

Next release is pretty much done! I started public prerelease testing on Tuesday, but the final version won't go out until 9/4 so this'll give players an entire week to mess around with it first.  I usually only allocate 2-3 days for testing, but this version's got a ton of new stuff in it, and with that a lot of potential for emergent issues, making it important to get some extra play time.

I've done several runs already, my first to play with the new hacking system, and it's turned out quite fun so that's a relief! :D

* [The very first run of a hacker-to-be after having raided an early garrison](https://i.imgur.com/pCZBd05.png)

A bunch of little last-minute features and fixes I worked on this week:

* ""[Gunslinging](https://i.imgur.com/a0QuHuT.gif),"" or continuing firing a gun-only volley at addition targets after the first is destroyed, is now guaranteed rather than having a 50% base chance adjusted further by targeting computers
* For consistency, melee weapons get the same treatment when it comes to [multiwielders attacking additional targets](https://i.imgur.com/v9Ng7Gu.gif), also guaranteed
* ARCs (robot carriers) now generally [still release their contents when destroyed prematurely](https://i.imgur.com/Nkgz3Yg.gif), although said contents will often be maimed :P
* Added yet another method of inventory management: a [fully modal menu that doesn't require any modifier keys](https://i.imgur.com/59lnaYC.png). Just strings of regular alphanumeric keys can be used to do everything. Some players would prefer this method over others, so why not :)
* There are also a lot of modal state identifiers that can appear across the top of the map like that, and they've never been visible if there's a temporary message displaying over that line, so I finally made it so that [the message is moved down if there is an active modal state](https://i.imgur.com/IPRDOgv.gif).
* Added a [confirmation requirement when melee attacking while flying](https://i.imgur.com/TAeUKgS.gif), because flying players may have meant to jump the target rather than fight (Cogmind has a ton of QoL confirmations they're easy to add and help keep players from making mistakes, and almost all of them are optional for players who want to turn off certain messages)
* Fixed a bug whereby multiwielding impact weapons could continue doing follow-up attacks even when the target was already no longer adjacent, having been knocked backwards, resulting in up to several spaces of knockback potential ([here seen also ending up slamming into an explosive machine](https://i.imgur.com/9UyBzMc.gif), because fun!)

The last step before putting out the prerelease was to of course put Cogmind through automated testing.

* Normally I just [run four instances at a time](https://i.imgur.com/J5UVU3L.gif), one for each physical core.
* But then... well I was just sitting around waiting for tests so I [upped the instance count to nine just for fun](https://i.imgur.com/skTuwZw.gif) :). I added yet more on-map alerts this time around so while these tests are going on there sure is a lot of red messages piling up as turns race by :P

No issues were found, so that was nice :D

NS streamers dont really stream daily routine 1% runs, so w/o players shows you the ropes in game, its hard to obtain video guide out side of the game. Few Chinese streamers shows speed farm runs 134-145 ish runs, but very rare do you find zbarb POV.

Ze Darkpatator has terrific pulling rhythm, i d recommend watching his vids to see how he pulls.  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw814-Ng\_IGGqaDMe-vpRyg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw814-Ng_IGGqaDMe-vpRyg)

Unfortunately its hard to teach mob selections / spot selections through written guides. These selections are crucial in dealing bad layouts. Basically you need to know the mob types and map layouts. Each map has fixed amount of tilesets / layouts. Usually it also has fixed setup spots depending on mob types. Selection of setup spots depends heavily on mob types and some influence on map layouts. Rule of thumb, minimum 30 in a spot, leave the spot if its below 30 with no killable elites / drag to nxt spot. In push, this minimum amount should be 60-80. Every setup costs time, the wiz has to line up rotations. Roughly each setup costs around 20s before good dmg dishes out. 10 setups costs 200s or 3 mins. So on a particular layout the less setup spots the better. Never pick 2 spot if you can drag all mobs to 1 spot even it means dropping IP. Dropping IP is advanced tactic. On high level play its common to drop IP for long durations on long range aggros. While there are squishy wiz builds which dont allow dropping IP, standard storm armor + karini on most occasions do not need IP to survive. This depends on elite affix though and zmonk ability.

Aside from the density generations, zbarb also needs to help ""pack"" the mobs better. In an ideal situation, the elites are at the center and trash are evenly surrounded to provide max area damage. In some occasions, you may need to pull mobs / fresh elites in the epic center.

Just play, join skilled clans and group with skilled players.  Learn from mistakes. Its not easy to find groups accepting new zbarb though as zbarb is the backbone of a group. However, even solo play can learn zbarb knowledges. Map layouts, mob types, which mobs follow easily, which mobs dont. Which mobs have high progression which low. This is common GR knowledge useful for all modes. That is why you often see high rank meta zbarb also excellent in high rank solo pushes.

Meta zbarb really breaks down into 2 skill categories: Ancient spear usage and common GR knowledge.

Minimise the usage of ancient spear and furious charge is key to effective pulls.

Always pick a spot where you can have multi direction pulls.

Knowing the ability of your team, high dmg wiz requires less density so you can adopt hit and run tactic during off cycles. Low dmg wiz needs high density and requires big setup spots. High healing zmk = dropping IP, low healing Zmk = 100% IP up time. Experienced necro can have bigger setup spots as they will help aggro mobs, noob necro smaller setup as it costs the zbarb time to pull. Stuffs like those. For example N shaped map has 2 intersections, usually you stop at 1st intersection, clean pull back. Drag all remaining to 2nd intersection, clean pull back and front. Kill all killable elites. With experienced neco, you can go straight to 2nd intersection. Necro clean aggro from entrance to 1st intersection, zbarb clean pull 1st intersection to setup.

You should memorize your layout so you dont need to scout too far ahead.

Best zbarb isnt determined by the highest GR he cleared but how many 150 gems in his stash.",1535760048

"gpumining","t5_2z759","there are several factors to consider:
1. the Auto Exchange Being Used, take for example Mining Pool Hub, you mine what is most profitable at that moment but thats not always the case by the time it has actually been exchanged, which can take hours or even days.
2. The exchange rates of alts relative to Eth
3. The speed of the confirmations so you get paid
4. Pool luck in finding a block
5. How the pool pays you (PPLS vs PPS) determining the level of your reward.
6. the exchange fees.

all these things vary from site to site (and even can vary coin to coin) so honestly there are so many variables it could be better one day and worse the next day, it's virtually impossible to say for sure which is better. 

Then you have the third option, Mine on Nicehash, exchange to Eth, this can allow you to get basically the price of Eth (within a few cents per card per day) while also catching higher earning algo's that pop in from time to time which ultimately allows for the purchase of more Eth if other algo's pay well enough for a portion of the time each day. 

side note Eth will be one of the Altcoin payout options on Nicehash when they roll out the next generation (V3) miner and next gen platform that is in testing now and should be rolling out ""in the next several weeks"" https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/9b5uls/nicehash_wallet_to_steam_balance/e5148zk/",1535760049

I strongly recommend that everyone look into effective altruism - for me, reading up on it was a paradigm shift in that I realized that many orgs, though well intentioned, have negligible good effects.

I'll say it again, there's never been a non-American team that has had nearly as much talent as that USA squad. It's a squad of all NBA players, including NBA all stars.

The trail near Richland Center is called the Pine River Trail and it's quite scenic.

If you just screw with it, how do you know it won't kill or seriously injure someone?  You can't cause harm on another for no reason.  And if your reckless actions destroy property, you'll be liable as well.   We value life above all else in this country, there is no exception because of your property.  Being a vigilante and creating a dangerous condition will cause you to be sued for damages or arrested for loss of life/injury.

Your best bet is to contact your neighbor and find out what's going on/if they know/if they're willing to disconnect it.  If not, you're going to most likely get a court order to get it shut off at the source.  If it comes to that, call a lawyer in your area.

The left needs to stop pretending black on black crimes aren't a serious issue, especially when they really do make up a large part of reported violent crime. Black on black crime is a social issue that is swept under the rug, it's disgusting. 

The only time I see it brought up is when racist fucktards use it as ""proof"" blacks are violent or something. Talk to a black person who was actually alive in the 80s and 90s. You'll get reality without the liberal/altright filter. ",1535760053

*****
&gt; BUENOS AIRES, May 11 - Argentina&amp;#039;s central bank sold $1.1 billion in the foreign exchange market on Friday and the peso weakened 2.74 percent to an all-time closing low of 23.35 per U.S. dollar despite talks aimed at securing an International Monetary Fund financing deal.

&gt; Argentina requested a &amp;quot;High access stand-by arrangement&amp;quot; from the Fund earlier this week after the peso depreciated rapidly, prompting the central bank to sell reserves and hike interest rates to 40 percent in a bid to contain one of the world&amp;#039;s highest inflation rates as well as stop the peso slide.

&gt; Earlier on Friday, the peso fell to a record intra-day low of 24.50 per dollar as investors moved into dollar-denominated assets.

"selfpublish","t5_2sew3","Using your own website to self-publish is a smart idea. You can control how sales pages look, and you aren‚Äôt at the mercy of a 3rd-party platform. You can install your own advertising pixels on your platform, too. Important for retargeting. 

You can go to Namecheap and buy a domain for $18.00/year (really good deal, IMO). You can buy a WP site for $10/month for one year, which is $200/year (or you can get a monthly subscription and pay $10/month instead)

With WordPress, it‚Äôs cheap and easy to set up a decent looking website. Plus, it works well with mobile devices (VERY important these days. It‚Äôs not 1998. It‚Äôs 2018. Many people access the net on tablets and smartphones nowadays). You don‚Äôt need to install WP Touch for $1,000 or so. And, while you can hire a web designer for $1,500 to set up your site, you can get your hands dirty and set it up yourself for free (minus any paid apps, of course).

For downloadable content like your ebook, there‚Äôs a lot of apps you can use. One good one is Easy Digital Downloads. It allows you to install a payment system (PayPal, Braintree Payments, etc) easily. Another option is the GumRoad app. Neither of these require an ounce of coding.  

To build my website‚Äôs content (headers, blog posts, etc), I used the SiteOrigin Page Builder for WordPress. Takes some getting used to, but it works like magic once you figure it out. 

Having said that, I‚Äôd try to avoid doing any coding on a WP theme, unless you know how to code. Any mistake with coding your theme or any apps can mess up your site and lock you out of your WP admin, which will require an FTP manager (annoying as hell). WP apps will help you create your site without having to mess with your theme‚Äôs coding. 

Aside from that, though, WP is a good platform to use! You should still put your books on Amazon as an extra sales/marketing channel because of the high amounts of traffic that Amazon receives, but don‚Äôt make it your only source of buyers.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","**¬∑ Say Anything** - I am simply dumbfounded that I couldn't find this one on anyone else's list.  This is easily one of the best party games I've played.  I've grown to really dislike games like 'Cards Against Humanity' where it all follows the same boiler-plate gameplay loop as 'Apples To Apples'; this one allowing players to write whatever answer they want makes it such an improved experience to those games.

**¬∑ Spyfall** - I think I like this game a lot more than most of my other friends.  I think with me, creativity is the name of the game, so the more flexibility the game gives you the more enamored I am with it.  Having to come up with a question that straddles the line between revealing and secretive is super fun, and blatant lies always lead to hilarity.

**¬∑ Balderdash** - I can't say for sure because I've only started playing this game this year, but this game may have gotten the biggest laughs out of me and my friends.  Coming up with answers is, again, a thing I like in my games.  The movie synopses in particular lead to some of the funniest answers.

**¬∑ Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - Taking a break from the usual style I enjoy, this one is definitely the game with the biggest bite to it.  But it's probably my favorite social deduction game.  It plays a ridiculous number of players, has some additional roles at higher player counts that keep things interesting, and a pretty solid expansion from what I've heard.

**¬∑ Concept** - There's really something to be said for this game.  I can very distinctly recall the moment I managed to get 'The Truman Show' after only two or three clues, just as easily as the time it took my friends and me ten minutes to get 'Hermione Granger'.  Pretty consistently fun, so long as you more or less ignore the scoring aspect and just let everyone take turns givibg clues and guessing.",1535760060

*in-service means you are still employed there

Make sure you ask whether you can roll over just the after-tax contribution and its earnings. Since you have a traditional IRA, you can also ask whether they can split the checks into two: Earning (goes to traditional) and Contribution (goes to Roth IRA), so you don't get any tax at all.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; This is basic knowledge. The problem often lies on the lack of a clear answer and expect the other person to mind read.

Well that sounds perfectly clear and obvious.  It's not *true*, but it's a nice-sounding answer.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/health/men-rape-sexual-assault.html

&gt;Rather, other kinds of patterns have emerged: these men begin early, studies find. They may associate with others who also commit sexual violence. **They usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex.**

&gt;...


&gt; Asked ‚Äúif they had penetrated against their consent,‚Äù said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did ‚Äúsomething like rape,‚Äù the answer is almost always no.
&gt; 
&gt; Studies of incarcerated rapists ‚Äî even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones ‚Äî find a similar disconnect. It‚Äôs not that they deny sexual assault happens; it‚Äôs just that the crime is committed by the monster over there.

&gt;...
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, experts note one last trait shared by men who have raped: they do not believe they are the problem.

If a 4X company spent enough money to make a great in-house AI they would probably go out of business. AI doesn't sell as well as other expansions or features.

"BattlefieldV","t5_2uxp8","The lock on melee animations are back?  That's really shitty.  You should have to aim properly at your melee target to kill them even if they are at 1 health. 

The culprit is those canned melee kill animations.  They require that both players are placed in exact positions regardless of what location the melee kill was initiated from.

Might even be fun if they allowed you to block frontal melee swings by hitting a block button at just the right time.  Something where the timing is at least as hard as Fallout 4 or ""We Happy Few"".

The frontal melee kill **reversal** in BF4 that allowed you to kill the original attacker was a disaster from a popularity standpoint, but a simple block that requires precise timing might be more popular.",1535760065

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","For a little bit of background, I built a PC last November and knew I wanted a mechanical keyboard, but wasn't ready to spend real money on one, so I just got a Kumera Redragon with blue switches for like $25. 

Flash forward to last month and I decided it was time to upgrade. The first one I bought was actually a Vortex Race 3 with clear switches, but after owning it for 3 days, I was trying to swap out the keycaps and the switch in the escape key pulled right out with the cap : ( I had read this was an issue with clear switches, and was trying to be careful about removing the caps, but evidently was not careful enough. Fortunately it was purchased on Amazon, so return it as defective was easy enough. 

I liked the Race 3 well enough and would have kept it had nothing gone awry, but as I needed to get a new one anyways, I took the opportunity to get something a little different. I was pretty interested in getting a board with SA profile caps, and eventually settled on doing a Tofu through kbdfans with brown switches (the clears were a little heavy for my taste). I looked at SA sets on a bunch of sites, but ultimately liked the Foundations on kbdfans the best of what was available. 

(Side note, it's crazy how few SA sets are available at a given time and how hard they are to get). 

Getting everything up and running was not without its issues. I made a mistake when I was preparing my QMK .hex because I didn't set the right keyboard profile, so when I flashed the firmware it borked all the keys. About 2 hours later, and thanks to the help of some nice folks on the Discord, I had removed all the keycaps, taken the PCB out of the case and triggered the manual hard reset on the back of the board before finally reflashing the correct profile. 

Now we're up and running. Not as beautiful and cool a keyboard (or battlestation) as the likes of what I see often on this sub, but I'm reasonably happy with it for now!

All told, the keyboard and keycaps, with upgrade to cherry stabs and USB C was about $275, and took about a week to ship from China using the free shipping option. ",1535760066

Going into college, I was into technical theater (e.g. lighting/video/sound) and studied computer science and my car trunk was full of cables/adaptors/whatever. Showed up early to one of my first classes and the dudes who would become my first ""real"" boss and coworker were troubleshooting something with the classroom AV. I was bored and nosy so I joined the fray, offered the missing cable from my trunk, fixed the problem and was asked ""Do you want a job?"" 

My na√Øve-to-the-world, college freshman answer was ""Not really, but my mom said I should think about it..."" and about 3 days later I was employed.

In taking to people I work with on projects, and at least in the US:  On the Commercial/Enterprise side the vast majority come from either Rental and Staging (e.g. doing event audio/video/lighting for concerts/theater/corporate events) or audio engineering/recording. A growing number have come from the worship technology (i.e. church) world. 

On the residential side, from what I've gathered car audio is the gateway drug to that market. 

I don't think anyone I've talked to has actually intentionally found their way to this whacky sub-industry. ",1535760068

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There's a sitcom we have in the UK called Only Fools And Horses about a pair of working class brothers who essentially sell stolen goods for cheap at markets in London, the core of the show was about them getting into capers based on faulty stock or being incompetent.

One episode though sees one of the brothers, Rodney, get engaged and his older brother Del promises him that he'll get him ¬£2k for a deposit on a new home as a wedding present.

He ends up selling some dodgy VCR machines for the deposit but finds out they belonged to two well known gangsters who come to collect the money at Rodney's stag do.

We later see Rodney stumble home drunk assuming his brother had let him down, but Del shouts to him from the bathroom that his money is on the table and that he can get his own place with his fiance. 

We then see a battered and bloodied Del in the bathroom nursing his injuries, he lied to the gangsters about having their money so they beat the crap out of him for it.

In all honesty there are a lot of moments in Only Fools And Horses that deal with stuff like that really well. Rodney and the woman who ends up becoming his wife eventually end up pregnant but she miscarries and we see how it hurts the whole family.

I would recommend that show to anyone, it's up there with the likes of Fawlty Towers, Blackadder and The Office in terms of importance to British comedy.",1535760068

- main character presses to ask what's wrong and finds out dad is abusive 
- needs to keep it a secret 
- next day friend shows up at house with a broken arm begging to spend the night or isn't in school because friend is in hospital 
- main character has to tell, and friend gets rescued by CPS. 

Okay except literally most cases of abuse aren't parents literally breaking kids arms. This just confuses kids and makes them think ""abuse= broken bones and visible injuries."" Child abuse is so much more. Physical abuse isn't always so alarmingly obvious. I wish shows like this would show kids what to do in less extreme, more common and relatable situations. ",1535760068

"arkhamhorrorlcg","t5_3fnyy","Since Zoey was long, I'll try to keep this one a bit more brief. Your Rex deck actually looks pretty good for the most part. The main thing I'd change would be to cut both copies of ""I've Got a Plan!"" (you're Rex and shouldn't be fighting too much) in favor of Perception (you like investigating and drawing cards. Perception helps with both) and your 5 splash (non-seeker) cards.

Fire Axe - Pretty much what I said in previous comments. You don't want to be doing much fighting as Rex, and any fighting you do happen to do doesn't get any extra damage from Fire Axe most of the time. And worst of all, it takes up a precious hand slot that could be holding a magnifying glass. The other reason you don't want fire axe is that you can use strange solution instead. I see you've included a single copy of it already, so if I were you, I'd throw in a second copy and plan to upgrade them both into the acidic ichor variant. It takes a bit more setup and costs you 8xp, but the result is you get to have a weapon that will always deal 3 damage on a hit and that doesn't take a hand slot. Also you get 2 more splash slots to fill with more exciting cards from other classes!

Burglary - I think burglary is not a very good card in general. Most of the time, you're going to be better off just investigating normally. And in Rex's case, once you have Milan out you're gaining resources AND clues for successful investigations. Plus, with only 2 players, Rex's ability to get 2 clues at once becomes super efficient since you can often clear locations with one good investigate action, whereas using burglary would cost you can extra action. Just an inefficient, slow card, imo.

Leather Coat - Not a bad card in the right deck, I just don't think Rex wants it. As stated before, you're ideally not going to be fighting much, which means you shouldn't be taking too much damage.
*****
I don't have any strict recommendations for which 5 cards you should splash, so instead I'll just recommend a few options:

Drawn to the Flame: 2 clues for one action and 0 resources is pretty good. You do incur a bit of risk by drawing mythos cards though, so play it wisely.

Ward of Protection: Solid card for blocking nasty treacheries. I suggested Zoey take one copy, so that leaves a copy for you to take. Feel free to take both if she doesn't take one.

Delve Too Deep: You might not want to take this one until you've won a campaign or two and are feeling a bit more comfortable. Or if you like balancing risk/reward. +1xp for the whole party is no joke, but it comes at a price.

Elusive: Good for getting away from enemies if for whatever reason Zoey can't get them off of you. Can also be used with no enemies on you if you just want to teleport around the map as long as no enemies are at your destination.

Quick Thinking: You want to succeed your investigates by 2 anyway to pick up multiple clues, so why not get some extra actions out of it too?
*****
As for upgrades, so far I like all your choices. Higher Ed is a super powerful card, no brainer there. 2x Pathfinder is good.

Next I'd suggest the second upgraded magnifying glass, then probably 2x Deduction (2), 2x Strange Solution (Acidic Ichor), and 2x Cryptic Research if you get the xp for them. Maybe some Discs of Itzamna if you want even more ways to fend off enemies.",1535760069

"antiMLM","t5_2swge","&gt;believe that it‚Äôs possible that people within mlms, as within cults, can develop genuine friendships.

Developing genuine friendships is extremely rare in MLMs, just like cults.

‚Äã

The genuine part will be if the friendship lasts after the MLM/cult. Realistically, it's going to be a very hard break. Just like breaking up with a partner, or quitting/getting fired from a job - more than likely a person is not going to continue with the relationship if that ***something*** isn't still holding them together. Maybe some will try, but MLMs/Cults make this that much more difficult - as you are now seen as an outsider.

‚Äã

Think of it like being in high school, once you graduate, you may still keep in touch with friends, but as they move on, and grow as people they will have different interests and make new friendships with others that are in similar lifestyle/situations as them. Of course there is always the exception, however, the exception hardly ever becomes the rule.

&amp;#x200B;

Add: I mention High School in particular, bc the ""stereotypical"" thought is that most have ulterior motives when it comes to friendships in HS. I'm sure there are a ton of ppl that can honestly say they still have friends from HS, but the large majority who only hung out with a certain crowd, or only had friends bc they had a big house w a pool, was captain of the football team, \[add in stereotypical HS cool degrees\]",1535760069

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","&gt; How does IW proves him wrong? On the contrary, he was right, even Rhodey thinks so by going against Ross.

What Rhodey did was exactly Tony's view on it. It's exactly what Tony did in Civil War when he found out Bucky was innocent, he ignored Ross's orders to do the right thing. Cap on the other hand, was pretending that signing a piece of paper means they can never go against that. 

IW proves him wrong because the most important thing was keeping the Avengers together. He disagreed with that. Something was coming, even Thor suspected that. Splitting up the Avengers when there's a bigger threat looming is stupid, and Steve is the one who did that. He could have just stayed out of the Bucky thing, he could have not dragged Clint who was retired into it, he could have not dragged Wanda who didn't even want to leave into it, he could have not dragged Sam and Scott Lang into it, but he chose to drag them all along with him. The Avengers without Cap are weakened, but the Avengers without the half of the team he turned into criminals just to protect the last link to his past? That team is crippled.

&gt; He does not say that he is always right, rather that they should be, as the team, the ones who decide what is right, since others (especially governments) can be easily and actually are corrupted. 

Except he doesn't let the team decide does he? He imposes his view on most of them. He assumed Wanda wanted to escape without consulting her, so he dragged Clint out of retirement. She didn't and told Clint as much, and only left when Clint was losing to Vision to prevent further fighting. Cap convinced Clint that Wanda was in trouble so Clint ignored Wanda's opinion on the matter and forced her hand. Cap is responsible for the both of them becoming criminals.

He takes the final say in everything and for that matter has a clear bias against anything coming from Tony, that's been the case in every single movie they've been in together. Also, they will ALWAYS be the ones who decide at the end of the day. His ""If we sign this we give up our right to choose"" line is pure bullshit. That's the real issue with his entire argument. Ultimately the accords are just PR and won't stop them from doing what needs to be done.

&gt; don‚Äôt see him being hypocritical throughout actually so I don‚Äôt have an answer for that, but for emotional decisions, I can only say the last fight was purely emotional on his side and he was right to stop Tony from killing Bucky.

Again, the entire premise of his argument is hypocritical. The core argument he makes is ""We can't let them control us"" and every single one of them has proven that a piece of paper saying you'll listen to someone is less important than doing the right thing.


&gt; And to say that he was right on those moments for the sake of the plot not right in my opinion since that argument can be used against any character being right in any situation in any film. That can be said that Tony was right about the Accords for the sake of the plot (from your perspective I mean).

Literally anytime a character is right about something in a movie it's for the sake of the plot. I probably phrased that all poorly, but my point with that is that Cap being right about some things doesn't mean he isn't wrong about the Accords. He's been wrong multiple times in the movies they just aren't memorable because they weren't big plot points.

&gt; And maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have Vision but if he had it his way maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have Ultron in the first place. 

Um, how? Cap made no effort and showed no desire to prevent Ultron. He criticized Tony for testing the scepter two days after standing right there and having no issue when Tony said to Thor he was going to study and test the scepter. The way that the team reacted to that whole thing was idiotic and made zero sense. Cap had no problem with AI in general or he would have been against the Iron Legion at the beginning of AOU. So, when exactly would Cap getting his way would mean no Ultron?

&gt; Natasha saw his point in the end after all. Staying true is more important than staying together in the wrong way.

How do ya figure? She never said anything about agreeing with Cap or 'seeing his point' she just let him go and that made her a fugitive too. She let him go to stop them all from fighting and anyone else getting hurt. She says to Tony ""Steve's not gonna stop, if you don't either Rhodey is going to be the best case scenario."" Her motivation is preventing them from hurting each other, that's it.",1535760070

1. The perfect group probably doesn't exist. Unless you preselect people, you're going to get different genres and opinions. Give it a little time, though. We had a few members I didn't like at first, but are now good friends with. Meanwhile, some of the people I liked right off the bat turned out to be kind of fake.

2. You don't have to contribute much on your first day. There's no need to come in brandishing your writer's cred! I see this a lot. Each group has its own little culture, so let it play out to see if it's for you.

3. Don't take criticism personally, because it isn't. We lose a lot of new writers this way. Filtering through critiques takes a bit of practice. 

4. If it's not working out, or if something really bothers you, don't hesitate to leave. Stay safe and good luck!",1535760070

Set two seperate alarms for your phone... The initial alarm... and a backup emergency alarm set about 10 minutes before you absolutely must leave to get to destination... In addition, get a wind up alarm clock, set it at a time somewhere inbetween your two phone alarms... And finally if you have a PC or laptop set up an alarm on that to do something like play music or whatnot. all these alarms should be like 5-10 minutes apart, this is designed so that about the time you get comfortably back into sleep mode after turning off the previous alarm, another one goes off...

All of these alarms should be far away from your bed as possible.

I haven‚Äôt identified any apps in particular that cause it, but it‚Äôs definitely a range of them. 

Some google searching has found that it affects other apps too. Bookmobile uses an iOS audio framework in a mode that lets it play in the background, and can be controlled by the ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù app on Apple Watch, Car Play, etc. This mode shares the audio player with Music, and any other app configured the same way. I suspect this mode might be the reason for the auto-play - the shared audio player is told to play, and if it‚Äôs an audiobook, it makes sense to think it‚Äôs Bookmobile, although it might be inactive. Tapping on the app icon wakes it up, and it recognizes what‚Äôs playing and syncs the UI to it.

&gt; You say capitalism can provide for human needs and that the profit motive won't damage society, but we also need social programs to help people who've been damaged by the profit motive and whose needs have been left behind by capitalism.

This is sadly where capitalism sounds good in theory but in practice has issues. Capitalism in theory rewards you equal to the value that you put into the market, it is possible for everyone to live well if everyone puts in relatively equal value. The problem is people are not machines, so different values are put in, and over time a hierarchy of value is created (rich and poor). There's no way around that. The only reason we need this hierarchy, is because it's the best thing for the longevity of the human species, which is the ultimate goal. It forces the fastest possible evolution out of us because of our greed and passion. You could say an individuals needs are more important, so fuck the future of humanity. That's a valid point, but it's a philosophical question and I believe the species is more important than any one human. That being said I'm not that hardcore, and I believe social programs and charity are moral obligations.

&gt; you want shares to be more evenly distributed among society which means you would be favor of workers owning corporations and the means of production which is literally socialism.

I love this because you're dead right and it proves that we both want the same thing in the end. It's just we have 2 different ways of getting it. I believe in a democratic way of owning companies through shares that everyone can trade, the problem is not everyone is educated enough to partake so they get robbed. I believe if the government would force it, yes it would be more equal for everyone, but removing the dream that you can ""have it all""/the ""american dream"" (greed), will discourage tons of people to the point where it'll handicap the evolution of humanity.

&gt; Capital naturally accumulates in the hands of the few, that's an aspect of the market economy under capitalism.

Ya that's the hierarchy I was talking about earlier. Sadly there's no way to avoid that. My thoughts are still the same though that the hierarchy is absolutely necessary to maintain the fastest human advancement possible, and put in social programs for people that end up at the bottom of that hierarchy.

&gt; If we want society to operate and benefit all, we need to have all in control of society. We need, frankly, democracy.

I truly do believe that but to me a real democracy is one where people are allowed to own companies and trade them, just like every other commodity. The power is all in the people's hands, they get to decide the future. I don't believe in a government forcing it, because then the power is all in the hands of very few people. Ideally everyone in the country would participate equally so that the inequality isn't too out of control, but we see that humans aren't perfect and so we have to have social programs. ",1535760074

This week the documentation was vastly improved and there were also some code upgrades.

- Added the option to use component-relative positioning in a static-way so what previously looked like: 
  `Positions.defaultPosition().relativeToRightOf(someComponent)` now can be done this way: 
  `Positions.relativeToRightOf(someComponent)`
- Calling the `draw` function on a `Container` with a `Component` was not behaving in the expected way. Now it properly
  delegates to `addComponent` since it is the right way to ""draw"" a `Component`
- Added the option for the `AppConfig` to enable beta features. They are *off* by default.
- Streamlined some naming conventions
- Simplified how mouse events for `Component`s work from Kotlin
- Fixed a bug which caused event duplication when `Screen.display` was called on an already-displayed `Screen`
- Reintroduced True Type fonts. It just occured to me in the shower that I was doing something in a way which was the exact opposite
  as I should have been doing it in the first place, so supporting `.ttf` fonts became trivial. Here are some images of how
  they look like: [tandy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/485181757755228176/unknown.png),

  [vtech](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/485184521021685770/unknown.png). There are also some
  narrow variants: [ibm ps2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/485189629817913344/unknown.png),

  These can be loaded by specifying a height, so dynamic font sizing is now a thing: [extreme font size](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/485213263857057832/unknown.png).
- Added `TileImage` next to `TileGraphic` in the `graphics` package. The difference is that `TileImage` is immutable so it can be used
  as an in memory (or even persisted) image composed of tiles. It has some convenience functions like `withTileAt`, `copyImage`, `fill` and
  `combineWith` which lets you conveniently create versions of the original. All of these operations return a new `TileImage` and leave the
  original untouched, so this can be used to create blueprints as well.

A next major release is coming up for this Autumn, so **stay tuned.**",1535760075

I read this as, ""Now he can cancel *your are floor* right before you get to it..."".

I think it means that he can put a stop to your existence as a floor, which sounds good!

Here's my interpretation: It sounds like *your are floor* is the possession of some state. In this case, the state of being a floor: you are floor.

Now that you are floor, you have the state of being a floor. The state of being a floor is *your are floor*; you posses it, it's your state. It's not *my are floor*. I am not a floor. I am not in the state of being a floor. You *are* a *floor*. It's your *are floor*.

So now that we know from the quoted sentence that by him being able to ""cancel your *are floor*"" (your state of being a floor), that he is in fact returning you to a non-floor condition: your *aren't* floor.

In conclusion, I believe that being in possession of a state of being not a floor is a good thing. After all, we all possess this state.

Unless we let people walk on us.

But if you let people do that, well then that's your are floor, not mine.",1535760076

A Riot employee's account was hacked. The hacker decided to try-hard in a ranked game on the account and after losing he decided to flame his teammates in an attempt to make the employee who owned the account look bad. 


Which do you think is more likely? If someone hacked his account and wanted to make him look bad, he would have int'd or flamed WAY harder during/after the game. My money is on the first possibility.

*****
&gt; In all these cases, the administration has pointed to a national security or economic justification: Trump says the travel ban targeted countries the Obama administration deemed security risks, that instead of helping refugees the US should help native-born Americans, and that immigrants bring crime.

&gt; This follows the resignation of a Trump speechwriter who attended a conference with white nationalist and news that Trump&amp;#039;s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had the publisher of a white nationalist website as a guest at his birthday party.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s not a coincidence that a significant chunk of anti-immigrant sentiment is undeniably racist, or that administration officials continually find themselves rubbing elbows with white nationalists, or that Trump is simultaneously pushing policies that target immigrants and saying things that you wouldn&amp;#039;t hesitate to call racist if you heard them at a bar.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","At my mum's clinic (she's a med receptionist &amp; nurse) they have quite a few dr's and often long wait times, depending on the individual dr. They're all exceptional and have a great duty of care for your health so they don't want to rush you through unless they're satisfied themselves.

Some dr's only work a couple days/ half days each week so their aptmts fill quickly and it can be months between seeing them again and then a 15min appointment turns into 30-45+mins because there's so many things to discuss.

On that note, when booking patients, the patients themselves don't know how long they may require for an  appointment so again, what was thought to be 15min goes way overtime. 

You have the emergencies which obviously get priority, pushing your time back further. Or minor surgery procedures that take longer than expected.

Someone brings all their kids in coz one is sick but they all get checked or remember a weird rash the other one had last week that hasn't gone away.

The frailer patients do have problems with mobility so they do move slower, and a clinic that does a tonne of old people, it's gonna be a little while before you're seen.

Sometimes they'll put on a flu clinic and herd you through ""first in first served"", but then essentially they're ""down"" a dr and nurse just dedicated to that alone so you'll have really long days then too.

They're also a training surgery so they get new dr's training with them practically, which slows down the process, and some dr's do clinic at the public hospital as well as home visits and nursing home visits which all can make them later than expected, depending on the circumstances.

These are just a few of the instances that happen on a daily basis. Not to mention all the paperwork and reporting and emailing/faxing/follow up that goes on between patients and when the doors close for the day.

My mum usually does a min 12hr shift per day, just because of all the ""behind the scenes"" stuff that needs to be sorted. Not to mention medicine is an always advancing field so there's a lot of training and workshops/meetings/seminars/courses on top to make sure the patients are receiving the best possible care and treatment.

One way the clinic tries to reduce wait times, is to have ""urgent"", ""book on day"" and ""dr book only"" appointments blocked out of their schedules which gives the drs some breathing space to catch up if they do run overtime or have to attend emergencies.

I find it helpful to ring maybe half an hour or so ahead of my appointment and see how my dr is going for time. Sometimes they'll say, ""they're running a little behind"" or ""there's still four more patients before you"" and then I ask whether I should come in on time but they'll say ""you could come in half an hour later"" or something like that, then I'm not twiddling my thumbs waiting for so long.

Anywho, that's just some of the stuff I've picked up watching mum at this clinic for the last 17 years so yeah, it's a bit of a bugger when you have to wait so long but some things really are just out of your (and your dr's control). Just bring a book or something quiet to do while you wait and treat it as some ""me time"" and rest for a moment in this bustling, hectic life of ours!",1535760078

Yes 

&gt;Do people tend to play one theatre (Northern Europe, Asia, Mediterranean etc.)?
 
Some do, many nationalities can be used for more than theater. Germans can be used for eastern front and western front, italy as well. US Army can be used in North Africa, Italy, Europe and the Pacific (It wasn't all USMC in the Pacific), British can be in Italy, Europe, India, Burma. 

&gt;How much would I reasonably need to spend to play decent games of BA? Would a starter set do? 
  
Yes.
 

&gt;What might I want to add to enhance it? I am not able to do a deep eve into the game, I just want to play casually. 
 
Depends on the nation, but you can add units as you see fit. There are plenty of 28mm WW2 manufacturers, you aren't just limited to Warlord stuff.

&gt;Ww2 is just so overwhelming in its intricacy. 
 
Start with an campaign or theater that interests you and look online for some info, good place to start.
 
&gt;Am I looking at GW WH40k level of spending?
 
Not really, though it can get that way, but with a starter kit and a couple of extra units or vehicles you won't be into it too deep. Also plenty of online painting guides as well.",1535760078

You shoot a 1911 for a few years and you feel good with it to the point you can wake up groggy find your 1911 and go to town then by all means. 

1911 is the best range gun though!

Being at $1500 for a TRP I‚Äôd say save for a little longer and find a Les Baer Custom Carry. I picked up one for $1800 new and it‚Äôs CA compliant. I have maybe a dozen 1911‚Äôs but only two railed.

A company like Aliexpress isn't going to get anywhere near that as it would just represent a major risk to them.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","First of all, Canada has a near ban on the collection and dissemination of racial crime statistics. Secondly, which immigrants? Based on the state of affairs everywhere else in the western world, it's a safe bet that Chinese immigrant have a lower crime rate than anyone, but they're hardly comparable to Afghans or sub-Saharan Africans, for example. Lastly, the ""replacers"" I'm referring to are not just 1st generation immigrants, but their children and children's children, that's what makes them replacers. So it's more appropriate to look at racial crime statistics, which are largely absent because of PC sensibilities.

The best thing I could find on the topic is this:

When I hear such a bold claim, as a non-Catholic, I look at the evidence.  And I see a church rocked by scandals that I've seen before dozens of times, being led by corrupt men.

And that's where you'd say that the RCC has divine promises protecting it in the bible, so the individuals don't matter, then I argue about the corrupt behavior of high-ranking Church officials throughout history affecting Church teachings and policies.... and round and round we go.

It comes down to a fundamental difference in beliefs.

I don't believe there's any basis to the RCC's claims to being divinely guided and protected, and cover ups like this only further support my belief.  You do believe it's divinely protected, so it would take an incredible amount of evidence of corruption for you to feel the Church isn't valid.

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","Oh, I get what you are saying now. My apologizes then, I misunderstood you and thought that you were saying something else. I thought you were saying all units should be totally flexible without any niches to shine instead of just not being as limited in a single spot as Titania.

About the starters heroes, to be honest nowadays begginers have an insanely solid start with Fjorm, Ike and two Braves. If they pick for example Lyn and Ephraim and are not interested in arena they are already set for PvE content except the hardest events and modes with more than a single map.

I would say stats do matter tho, not as much as the base kit, but each character has usually a different distribution of stats that allow them to use certain builds better or worse. Even if it was possible to give for example Arvis and Julius the same build it would not work exactly the same in every situation. But yeah, the kit makes the different hete, specially with skills exclusive to the unit.

I pretty much agree with what you are saying then. I still think it's a neccesary evil trough, because is the best way to fight powercreep. Titania's refine definetly could have been better, and that is why I also said they also need to be creative in some way. I get she is a gem weapon user but her refine doesn't really add anything too distint for her. They need to find balance between making old units revelant again and throwing them into really awkward spots that are barely used. Going to the extreme is always bad.",1535760082

Eventually a Lord Fendrick took over and started to use any ""mutants"" (Demi-Humans and magic users) as scapegoats and started to exile them to one of 3 colonies. The colonies are then forced to send material resources back to the mainland.

At this point all of the characters are outside one of those colonies named Fendaloc. It is comprised of the Order of the Shield (law keepers to the people) and the Red Guard (protectors of the Empire and Viceroy Mathias).

Through the help of Beverly Bulsara (NPC) the party has learned of some of the pre-devastation geography of the area and are currently investigating the site of a once thriving trade crossroads town.

There are plot lines in play involving corrupt Red Guards, Orc camps, a mysterious figure known as ""The Burrow King"" that has only been mentioned but has been tied to the corruption of a member of a local druid's grove. There are mysterious green lights seen on the darkest of nights to the east and Beverly's dream of making it to the ruins of Kalasahra, a super power kingdom from pre-dragon devastation.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","There are many many complexities to this, but I want to go into the weeds with just one: debt.

The US government owes a lot of money to a lot of people.  Those debts are guaranteed by the Constitution (14th amendment) and are owed in US Dollars.  If the US splits up, somebody needs to handle all of the debt somehow.

There would need to be a [""successor state""](http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/3_2_1978.pdf) to the United States who would inherit the obligations of the erstwhile USA.  For an historical example, Russia was the successor state of the USSR, and [inherited the Soviet debt, which it finished paying off in 2006.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2945924/Reborn-Russia-clears-Soviet-debt.html)

If the US split into 4 equal-ish size countries, the successor state would be left with a debt:GDP ratio of about 3.5:1, which is way higher than any other developed country has right now and would be totally unsustainable.

As such, the non-successor states would need to either undertake debt payments to the successor state for decades into the future, or else would need to make enormous lump sum payments at the time of the disunion.

The former transfer payment system would be a major detriment to the sovereignty of the new nations.  In particular, it would mean decades of payments in a currency they no longer control to a foreign state.  Ask Greece how fun that is.

The latter would be an enormous and likely impossible burden, as they would need to all market trillions of dollars of bonds in new currencies at the same time - which would be damn near impossible.

I'd also add that by dividing up the fiscal power of the United States, you can end up with parts which are less than the whole.  The US Treasury is the single largest unified economic entity on Earth right now.  Merely due to its massive size, it is inherently a very safe place to park your money - as it has the command of more resources than anywhere else.  Four or 5 smaller states would not have the enormous size advantage that comes from being the USA.  Their currencies would fluctuate a lot more.  

A California-anchored nation would for instance feel a much bigger burden from a second tech crash than would the current USA.  That risk would mean people would demand higher yields from investments, and therefore higher interest rates on debt.  

Markets also might not trust the smaller nation governments as much to be fiscally sound in a crisis, and you could see big debt crises like Canada saw in the 1990s.

This is obviously only a small slice of the complexities of actually doing something like this, but I think it's a good example of just how hard it is to actually split one country into several.",1535760084

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I ll go into a different direction: Are you possibly overtraining a lot? How do you deal with rest periods? Because it sounds like muscle is breaking down, and instead fat storage is built up. Since fat stores more waterweight, that might cause at least part of this phenomenon. 

Another approach would be a complete change of what you eat. Sweet potato instead of rice, lentils instead of chicken, or whatever else - basically require your body to deal with different foods, still hitting your macros. Your digestion can be trained and specializes after a while, so it might be overly efficient at handling the food you eat.

Last, maybe consider changing your workout style? Powerbag or weights instead of bodyweight, machines, tabata, whatever it is you are not doing - use new movements, different movements, more compounds, anything you are not used to yet.

Dude is pathologically anti-women, and has a hard-on for IQ as a qualitative, objective measure of human worth. While completely ignoring any and all socioeconomic and cultural or historical influences on IQ.

For the record, Hitler also thought Jews and Asians were smart. These toxic worldviews are more nuanced than ""white people are the fastest, strongest, smartest people in every way"".",1535760084

Your question was, is it okay not to trust anyone in uniform? Sure, completely fine. You have the right to trust or not trust anyone you want. Soldiers are still people, and people can be flawed.

I don't trust anyone until that trust is built. You trusted some guy you probably just met who was trying to ""sell you a job."" You said yourself they gave you that information on day one. When I joined, I chose not to trust my recruiter initially and do all my own homework and verify everything he was saying. I definitely got bad information several times and made sure to get it clarified and changed to what I wanted.

This is what I was recommending you do in the future. I was not giving you a lazy answer; I was giving you an answer you didn't like.

Stop using this as an excuse. You cheesed. You should be and will be banned. Don't treat your situation as some martyr, fighting against low population on any platform... So you are a martyr on PC but on PS4 you would be just a cheeser not using this excuse (a lot bigger population)... You deserve it and point. I prefer a low population than a bunch of cheesers and hackers/exploiters.

They watched 4 months of data and banned accordingly. their game and they are only making it fair and gettin rid of cheesers like you. Just move on to other game....

Like it's pretty obvious that for some god forsaken  reason you keep playing you will cheese it again and again. People that doesn't have the skill should not earn ranks, items or whatever.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; Let me guess, you don't drink do you? People are just fine in the morning after a night of drinking. 

I'm assuming you don't based on that. Surely you've had a reasonable night, 5/6 pints and then finished with a few shorts and stumbled into bed at 3am, probably after eating something dubious... If you have, the chances are that you will still be over the drink drive limit well past midday the next day, never mind in the morning. 

I'm reasonably sure sleep doesn't have much of an impact on the speed at which your liver is able to process the alcohol out of your system either, although drinking a lot of water might well help a bit.

Now you are right that you'll probably feel like you are fine after 6-8 hours sleep, but you almost certainly aren't.

&gt;Evidence of there having been alcohol the previous night doesn't equate to drunkenness behind the wheel.

Yes, it does, feeling like you are OK doesn't mean that you are, there is enough evidence to support that the level of alcohol in your blood is a good indicator of how impaired you are likely to be, and so in the context of a Breathalyzer or blood test, a heavy night often does mean you aren't safe to drive for quite a while the next day.",1535760087

"sto","t5_2rfq3","&gt;Sorry I duplicated one. I did read your list but I must have missed it.

I don't know how I forgot this one: Movement keys get ""stuck"" occasionally, as if they are still pressed. I have seen this reported by some others but some have not had it happen, not sure if this related to rebound keys. Definitely not the computer or keyboard. Extremely annoying (and tends to wreck TTG runs), but hard to nail down. Happens on ground, too. Not in other games, or, you know, Word.

Did you have the one about the Subspace Fold ability from the Solonae core failing to move forward? Not sure if this is random (about 1 in 20 times) or related to certain places (seems to happen more often when next to an object in sector space).

It's hard to nail down ""abilities don't start but cooldown timer does,"" because sometimes that's a failure to display the effect and sometimes it's the effect not going off. I don't know if there's some poorly documented game mechanic for skill failure or not.

Edit: The ""difficulty randomizer"" seems to be back with a vengeance after this last patch - but it could also literally be bad luck, since it's only one day.

EditEdit: Not a bug, but the fact that full impulse and slipstream are the same key is grotesque, since most of your time is spent in mission space and you're trained to use that key as a low-cost go-fast button. \*Constantly\* set it off in sector space when I don't need to.",1535760088

Not inherently. Just because someone is attracted to cis males/females doesn't necessarily mean that they will be sexually attracted to transgendered people of that same gender, especially pre-op. As much as it sucks, genitalia *can* be a deal-breaker in a sexual relationship. 

A lot of our differing opinions come down to just that: opinions. Merriam-Webster defines bisexuality as either being hermaphroditic or being attracted to ""members of both sexes"", which is very vague when talking about various queer elements. It also defines pansexuality as ""sexual desire or attraction that is not limited to people of a particular gender identity or sexual orientation"".

What matters is which gyms are ex eligible. Those are the ones you specifically want to target. Going down further you also want to check how many of these ex eligible are within a cell. That will sorta affect your chance of getting a pass.

The last step is basically balloting. Everyone who successfully raided at the gym is casting a ballot. If it happens to be an ex raid it will randomly pick a set amount of people to give it to.

The pokedex100 discord channel is good.

&gt; California&amp;#039;s legislature has approved a bill being called the strongest net neutrality law in the US. The bill would ban internet providers from blocking and throttling legal content and prioritizing some sites and services over others.

&gt; The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the final legislation &amp;quot;a gold standard net neutrality bill.""

&gt; There&amp;#039;s already one clear obstacle: the FCC made a rule prohibiting states from creating net neutrality laws.

‚Äã

Yes, it's called the news. I think it's sad that you deny accepted problems in society because a stranger on the internet hasn't provided you the exact details of each and every of the 1000s of cases. Denialist mentality I suppose.

[https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/08/23/ripe-abuse/human-rights-conditions-south-africas-fruit-and-wine-industries](https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/08/23/ripe-abuse/human-rights-conditions-south-africas-fruit-and-wine-industries)

‚Äã

\&gt; I link to the major ones. I'd be happy to scour Twitter for new ones if you want.

‚Äã

The internet is full of racism and bigotry from all sides. You only link to the same handful because those are the only ones that fit your silly narratives.

‚Äã

\&gt; What if a white person does it because they've experienced violence from black people in the past? Does that suddenly make it ""reactionary"" racism? Would you then be falling over yourself to excuse it?

‚Äã

It does, but most times the racism they faced from black people will have been reactionary itself. There isn't a vast history of black racism stemming from colonialism, oppression or racial superiority so such racism is rare.

"rantgrumps","t5_38iu4","Yeah the creator never played Ocarina as a kid. He solved that puzzle for the first time as an adult.

But I digress, because I happen to disagree with his stance on the Jabu Jabu fish puzzle. What I will say is that I disagree that the water section and the Silent Realms are bad, or rather disagree that they're badly designed- yes you're moving through a familiar location, but the particular constraints of these challenges (swimming in a 3D space/no items and sentries that must be avoided) force the player to interact with that familiar environment in a new way. Skyloft is the best example of this- it turns the normal hub world into a hostile environment, and forces you to consider the once harmless home base in a whole new light. 

But I suppose that's the problem with debating game design choices- one player might enjoy a particular design element while another player will avoid it like the plague, not to wrenches in the works such as player skill or playstyle preferences.

No, it's more immersion breaking. Not less.

Not magical, but clearly primal. Barbarian Rage =/= Normal Rage

Because it is just so very interesting that these people never protest against racism of any kind, until they think it is directed at them. Then they scream opression. Because being told you smell like marbles is just so horrifically offensive and absolutely comparable to systemic racism such as redlining and Jim Crow. Get over yourself.

And this is because they do not care about racism. They are racists. But they know that decent people care about racism and are trying to use the morals and standards of decent people against them.

You still haven't explained how, though. How do ID laws help non-passing trans people who are obviously, visibly trans?

Anecdote:   I see a lot of people who in childhood were severely and usually non-sexually abused by narcissist parents.  It is remarkable how many of the kids are queer in some way.  
  
Borderline personality disorder has a genetic predisposition but almost always has a history of severe abuse, usually narcissistic or sexual.  In one study 30% of BPD patients identified as bisexual. My impression is they also have far more trans and gay people than would be expected.

In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, many state constitutions, and state and federal laws. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. However, laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment laws that restrict employers' ability to prevent employees from disclosing their salary with coworkers or attempting to organize a labor union.

You haven't even asked the original artist permission to release the artwork online, even after the fact.

Such little thought towards the person that put so much effort into the original drawing is nothing but disrespect.

Please, try and think of the artist more. It takes hours often to complete a piece, on top of years of practice to gain such skills. It is extremely insulting to have others just edit it as if to claim their hard work is inferior. 

If you were truly a fan of their artwork, you would care to make sure they were okay with you posting this before you did, and at least try to get permission afterwards. It is extremely self centred to only care about getting your version otu there, and not their own.

I get that your intention was not a bad one, but that doesn't matter if how you come across is disrespectful. I think a much better way to go about it would be to message them saying something like:

""Hey, I really liked your Tana, but was wondering what it would look like in colour, so I coloured over it. I think it looks nice. Would you mind if I posted it on here and reddit?""

&gt;It‚Äôs really hard to explain why you shouldn‚Äôt have one because you have given me NOTHING as an example to counter argue.

That's exactly the reason I'm not indulging you.  Your logic depends on an axiom that owning an assault rifle is unreasonable.  And that's not an axiom that I share.

If I give you a reason for owning an assault rifle, you'll tell me it's a bad reason because I could use something else.  And I'll say ""Yeah, but I could also use an assault rifle and there's nothing wrong with that.""  

&gt;It‚Äôs weak and can be used for many other things like ‚ÄúI want a million dollars because I want it‚Äù.

This is a different scenario, we actually do share an axiom here, that you have to earn that money.

I think it comes down to what we continuously see as normal in our day to day lives. Speaking from a big city perspective, there are many minorities who live in impoverished communities and when people get use to seeing them struggling with difficulties associated with those communities (unemployment, lack of opportunity, crime, drugs) that‚Äôs what people expect. From my minimal study of psychology, stereotypes develop as a mental-shortcut and we begin to associate skin color with life circumstance and personal characteristics based off our experiences with different types of people. I realize that I GREATLY over simplified that idea, but I sincerely believe that is the heart of the problem. Warning, my opinion again: The solution is to integrate people and make the success of black/latino or any other minority in America more common place and well within public perception. We need to eliminate systemic racism, educate people about how their brains work and why people develop biases/prejudgements about others. I sincerely believe I am not racist, but I have definitely caught myself stereotyping people, even whites and I am actively trying to shift/eliminate my perceptions and prejudgements.

####***""This Reiki session is intended to assist you with cutting the etheric cords of negative attachments that are draining you.***

*Feel free to do whatever you want to while this video is playing and the healing energy is being sent to you. You could read, work, study, meditate...
You could also mute the sound of this video and or minimize the screen and play it in the background without even having to watch my hands.
Immediately after hitting the play button the energy transmission will instantly flow towards you. Just be aware of the Reiki transmission and willing to receive it.*

*This is a ""real time"" Reiki session filmed from the beginning to the end. I focus on sending PURE Reiki energy, while channeling I do not speak.
During or after the session you may feel sensations of warmth, coldness, tingling, buzzing-head or nothing at all. Yawning and getting tired may also occur. It could even trigger emotional feelings or arouse memories.*
***This is all perfectly fine. Just relax and enjoy the healing energy flowing to you.***


####***Important Note: Treatment with Energy Healing such as Reiki - does not promise to cure any illness or condition nor replaces professional medical treatment.***

####***In order for Reiki to work effectively, please be open to receiving the healing energy. It is extremely beneficial to drink water after a Reiki as part of the healing process.***

Thank You!

There were a lot of shocking entries to the debut team - especially those who came ranks 15-20 the week before. Some could be justified like Yena and Yuri who probably got all the votes of their eliminated label mates, and there are also factors such as casual voters who only watched the finale and got to see the trainees and their personalities/talent during the episode. Voting during the show meant a vote is equal to 7 votes so we can definitely expect drastic changes from that, considering that the broadcast is like 3-4 hours long.",1535760114

What you want to do is erase her scent in your house as quickly as possible. If you can get it/afford it, also look into some Feliway - there's a spray but there's also scent diffusers. The stuff doesn't work on all cats, but if it does work it'll help her to acclimatize to the change the more quickly.

Then just twice a day for fifteen minutes (or as long as the cat allows), do some pleasant interactions - playing with string or toys, brushing her, etc. You can do more, but if you have that twice a day interaction it helps to start a new pattern both to compensate for the old one and to insert yourself as an important figure for emotional bonding. (Do not use catnip for this as it's like LSD - you don't know if a given trip is going to be a good or a bad one for the cat, and for many cats it hypes up their hunting drive along with the goofy side effects we see. Catnip isn't inherently bad, but I don't recommend it as a bonding aid.)

And while maybe you can't force a cat to love you, you CAN make the cat WANT to. ES has been deliberately interfering in your relationship with YOUR cat, if it were a kid I'd call it parental alienation. And just like a kid, the cat goes to the person who's not as healthy a choice because 'grandma has candy'.",1535760114

"lcfc","t5_2ukrz","Quick run down of our players

Boyata 27: Our best CB but downed tools for a few games there. Back in the team and playing well but can have a few shaky moments here and there.

Ajer 20: Young player who started as a midfielder but transitioned to CB while on loan for 6 months at Kilmarnock. Good player but needs someone with more experience to help build and guide him. One to watch for the future.

Hendry 23: Honestly he's not been great since he joined. Poor passing that's cost us to lose goals. Loses the man he's marking regularly. I want to hope he will improve but from what I've watched he's just going to be decent and that's it

Simunovic 24: One of our best CB's but has had time out due to injuries. Has some good and bad spells. Loves a tackle on Kenny Miller

Compper: Played 82 minutes in 8 months. Been out injured and at the point now where we're considering terminating his contract. He was meant to be the experienced CB to help us but it just didn't happen.

Tierney 21: Idolized by the support and it one of the best young LB in Europe. Can easily go on to be one of the best in the world. Our best defender by far and can also play as a wing-back.

Izaguirre 32: Brought in as cover for Tierney. Not the best but can certainly do the job when called upon.

Lustig 31: Once our best RB and still seems to be our first choice. Isn't as fast or good as past seasons. Has slowed down quite a bit probably his age catching him idk.

Gamboa 28: Hasn't really played much under Rogers and most people aren't sure why. He did play at the WC, is faster and picks a better pass than Lustig but still can't seem to break into the team on a regular basis. Can also play as wing-back.

Overall our defense does lack some leadership which is odd considering we have WC players in there. We have been poor at defending set-pieces and it's caught us out a fair bit over the last couple of years. We don't really command the box as ours and a lot of the time we lose silly goals due to bad marking and positioning. We like to play out from the back and work our way up the pitch, although sometimes our keeper plays an iffy pass to a defender and the opposition picks it up and gets a free shot.

If Benkovic can come in and work hard he can certainly take a place for himself. Most of our fans would be happy with Boyata - Ajer and Benkovic as our back 3 from what I've seen.What kind of defender is he? What's he like when it comes to defending set-pieces, marking, passing? Would be good of one of you could give a bit of a run down on what he is like. Also to note, our league is quite physical, how do you think he will cope with that. He should also get some European experience with us.

Interesting that you'd talk about me projecting onto others, then turn around to make assumptions on whether or not I'm intimidated by said trinkets. For the record, I'm not particularly affected by what people choose to hang on their playercard.

Other games like HS have your reasoning of recording a specific point in the player's game history with cardbacks, which is fine. In their case though, it's not even an indication of high performance at that point in time, but simply a reward for the most basic level of participation during that season so theres not even a decent comparison here. Gwent does differently with a year-round rotation and there are different factors influencing why they might want to do that, with their rewards being rewarded on slightly different conditions. 

Point being that whatever they choose to do, people will act entitled and be pissed off at their decision. If people are acting like this because of the reason I quoted, camping on a one-off achievement, then for the reasons I stated above, it offers very little of a counter-reason for CDPR to go the other way.  The reason why I specifically wrote to address these people is because I've personally responded to multiple people back when they initially introduced the reward restructure who whined, and quoted this as their exact reasoning. 

You do have a point about recording a player's history in the game, and maybe that's something they can look into with a more stable development schedule, but as things stand now they haven't been intended for your stated purpose for well over half a year now, even if they were originally labelled as such. Other games are able to implement your preferred system but unfortunately, those games had very different development compared to Gwent so it's not very productive to speak of their respective reward systems in direct comparison.",1535760118

Aaaah, think you misread what I wrote :P The Myst games are about reverse-engineering machines and doing science things instead of inventory puzzles.

Doki Oki is more about traditional inventory-based puzzles from what I remember. I don't remember the inventory system being particular convoluted though. Let me boot it up a bit and seeee.

--- edit ---

Oh okay I know what they're talking about now. So basically if you press X, I believe, you get to move the cursor around the screen and click on things. If you press Circle? I believe you activate whatever the cursor is over, and if you press Square? you get a list of items/character names/places names that you can pick to use on some/ask someone about.

The inventory list is not at all readable if you don't know any Japanese though, because it's all text-based, and on top of that it's not immediately clear that you've actually got four categories of /things/ you can use/ask about. Also the game uses a ton of neologisms and has its... own kinda devanagari-looking alphabet in places.",1535760118

"roguelikedev","t5_2si41","**One Knight In The Dungeon** | [Twitter @herberticus](https://twitter.com/herberticus) | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/OneKnight)

TLDR: Lots of progress on character classes. Here's video playthroughs as a [Holy Knight](https://youtu.be/NNUsemXkpG4), [Martial Artist](https://youtu.be/4fd93BsRu6E), and the beginnings of a [Mage](https://youtu.be/lQZc30RCX9M). I cheated on these to start at a significantly higher level, in order to show off the skill tree.

I started the week with some architecture work that has been festering while I healed. The changes make for a much more fluid game. I then started focusing on individual skill trees/character packages, with a view to making them varied and fun. I'm now where I planned to be around weeks 5/6, so I'm catching up!

*System Changes*

* Updated to Unreal Engine 4.20.2, which is a *lot* faster on some render tasks. In particular, it fixes some issues with offscreen render targets, which are needed for the upcoming ASCII mode. It also provides much better level-of-detail support, making it faster to render things when they are small.

*Game System Changes*

* Instead of everyone acting at once when you move, it now uses the same Initiative system as Nox Futura (I backported a bunch of fixes, too!).
* This means that an entity (including the player)'s initiative is really important. So you can be a slow-moving tank or rely on speed and escape - and it works. This has completely changed the flow of the game.
* You *can* play in real-time mode like Diablo (I tested it for debugging), but it isn't recommended (or even supported; you have to find a secret command line to do it, currently). You will die horribly - everthing is optimized on being turn-based (so was Diablo, initially!). I don't think I'll ship this mode, but it's good to see that it's possible.
* Added weapon delays - so big weapons swing more slowly, further adding to the tactical side of initiative.
* Added shield delays - so a cumbersome shield slows you down. This mitigates the awesome damage mitigation bonus they give, making use of a shield more of a tactical choice.
* Added armor delays - again, heavy armor becomes a choice that slows you down. So you can tank up, and unless you mitigate the initiative penalty you will fight more slowly.
* Randomly rolled NPC attributes scale upwards with level. This is a cheap way to make ""level"" have more effect.
* Fixed an issue with the skill roll calculator; stat bonuses were accidentally inverted.
* [Reworked Pickpocket](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/oneknight/Aug18-Pickpocket.gif) to be a fireable skill belonging to the rogue tree. Not everyone starts with it now!
* Going up/down stairs is now a regular movement option, rather than a special action.

*Character focus: Knight of the Inner Focus - Martial Arts*

* Started working on the skill tree for this class. The goal is to focus on fast movement/fighting and evasion.
* Start with skills: Unarmed Combat (3), Dodging (2), Leg Sweep (1). Leg Sweep gives them a knock-down ability to start.
* New skill: *Weapon Grab*. If successful, the enemy's equipped weapon falls to the ground leaving them unarmed. You need 5 points in Unarmed Combat to buy this skill.
* New skill: *Dead Leg*. If successful, the enemy's crunches horribly and they suffer a substantial initiative penalty. You need 3 points of Leg Sweep to buy this skill.
* New skill: *Eye of the Storm*. [You sweep around, kicking every adjacent opponent](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/oneknight/Aug18-EyeOfTheStorm.gif). This skill uses a lot of stamina, and requires Unarmed Combat 5.
* New skill: *Iron Fist*. A passive ability, adds to your unarmed combat damage. Requires Unarmed Combat 5.
* New skill: *Iron Skin*. A passive ability, adds to your damage mitigation. Requires Iron Fist.
* New skill: *Healing Meditation*. You focus on inner wellbeing, and regain some health at the expense of some stamina. This requires that you have Iron Skin.
* New skill: *Whirlwind*. You spin rapidly, stunning all adjacent enemies. This requires Eye of the Storm.
* This is enough for now; if you put **all** of your points into Martial Arts, you'd be level 12 before you finished filling the tree. That's a perfectly valid way to play, but it'll be more fun mixing in a few other trees!
* Here's the [current WIP skill tree](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/oneknight/Aug18-19-MartialArtsTree.jpg).

*Character focus: Holy Knight*

* For the Holy Knight, I'm going for classic cleric play: blunt weapons, and spells that focus on healing and defense (with some attacks later). I'm not sure about Turning Undead yet; there aren't many of them, so I'm not sure I want to offer to let players waste their points.
* Starting package: Blunt Weapons 1, Shields 1, Prayer 1 (Prayer grants access to faith skills), Faith Armor 1.
* Faith Armor has a better graphic.
* Fixed an issue that was preventing the faith pool from refilling.
* New skill: *Cure Light Wounds*. Cures 1d8 + skill level hit points, at a small faith cost.
* New skill: *Cure Moderate Wounds*. Cures 2d8 + skill level hit points, at a moderate faith cost.
* New skill: *Cure Serious Wounds*. Cures 3d8 + skill level hit points, at a moderate faith cost.
* New skill: *Full Heal*. Cures all hit points, at a significant faith cost.
* New skill: *Holy Flame*. Burns the target (range is line of sight) for 1d6 + skill level damage. This gives Holy Knights a ranged attack.
* New skill: *Create Food*. Summons rations in your backpack for a faith point cost.
* New skill: *Flamestrike*. A pillar of flame descends upon your target tile, burning everyone in that tile and adjacent tiles for 2d6 + skill level damage.
* That's good enough for now; focusing purely on prayer power, you'd have to get to level 14 to be finished with the skill tree.

*Character focus: Knight of the Inner Fire (Mage)*

* I've been looking forward to this one! I'm aiming for a damage dealing utility mage, with very little defense.
* Starting package: Dodging 1, Short Blades 1, Spellcraft 1 (used for mana points), Zap 1.
* Fixed an issue that made spells free to cast. Oops. It was fun raining unlimited death on my foes, but not what I had in mind!
* New skill: *Zap*. You invoke a burst of electricity, and zap your opponent for 1d4 + skill level damage. Low damage, cheap to cast.
* New skill: *Lightning Strike*. You shoot lightning from your hands, inflicting Skill Level d6 damage on everyone adjacent to the target tile. Expensive and lethal.
* New skill: *Noxious Cloud*. A cloud of green vapor surrounds the target, stunning them and their neighbors.

*Visual Changes*

* Various NPCs can produce ""quips"" (for example, loyal guards in prison pledge their loyalty to you). Previously, this was a bunch of log spam. Now it renders onscreen, in a speech bubble. Since it doesn't *do* anything other than add flavor, it doesn't matter if you miss it. Adding a background to text turned out to be a really odd thing in Unreal - you have to make an Overlay widget, and add the text and image in the opposite order to what you'd expect, with the image set to grow to fit.
* Actors now slide to their destination, rather than jumping. If you somehow move faster than the very fast animation rate, it will ""jump"" to catch up; jarring, but better than getting confused.
* Smooth movement looked great, but with the camera on strict grid lines it was jarring when it re-centered; so I made it move smoothly with the player. I tried several approaches to this, before settling on the simplest: move the camera when I move the player. For some reason, I just couldn't get spring arms and similar to work properly.
* [Added walk animations](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/oneknight/Aug18-SmoothMoves.gif). Combined with slide movement, it looks a lot less jarring.
* There's a sparkly effect when you pickup gold. Since that's transparent, I wanted to indicate that it happened.
* Added an [on-screen movement control](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/oneknight/Aug18-18-OnScreenMovement.jpg). This will serve if I ever go mobile, provides a convenient way to play with the mouse. It is ""smart"", and only offers directions that are currently available (including for special actions).
* Target list sorts and automatically chooses the nearest target first.
* Added on-screen display for targeting.

He escalates things, though, and station security tries to confine him, so he hijacks a ship and tries to contact Starfleet directly. Starfleet tells him to go back to the station and turn himself in. 

He ends up tracking down the senior officers who were away on a mission and confronts them with a phasor, demanding to know what's going on. He's shot and fatally wounded, then another O'Brien arrives on the scene. Turns out that the real O'Brien had been abducted and replaced with a replicant sleeper agent.

We were suppose to win being 25 points up. We were suppose to have a shit year after a super bowl loss we finished 10-6 and won a playoff game and we're the only team to truly have a chance to stop the Foles hype train.

Either ways I don't have Superbowl aspirations much anymore. I just cheer for them each year with no expectations. A game by game guy. If and when they win a Superbowl I'll be over the moon  but until it happens I just have no expectations Atlanta sports have frustrated me and let me down and gets me depressed year after year and 28-3 just completely broke me.

As you can see, it is lightly teasing the idea that Christians care too much about whether or not people say Merry Christmas or not. The fact that u/Peoples_park uses the fact that I have posted this content as some sort of ""response"" to a Jew reporting their experience with violent antisemitism is representative of exactly the kind of antisemitism that is somewhat common around here. Would it be acceptable to tell a member of another marginalized group that their communities' experience of discrimination was somehow ""lesser"" because they personally had engaged in ""disagreeable"" behaviour? Moreover, I am not a professor nor is my reddit posting in any way affiliated with the university. Hatem Bazian's twitter matters insofar as he is a professor, a representative of the university, and an authority figure to some of the same people he is insulting. The Daily Cal matters as an official representation of the views of some of Cal's student body.

Bringing up how hard it may or may not have been to discuss Palestinian issues on campus, in response to my comment about Israel-unrelated antisemitism in Berkeley is literally exactly what the article is about.

I never believed in FLAC and I still have some doubts but this album + the Sauron mod and after removing Viper4Android (has issues with FLAC) is amazing, the drums impact the voices I love it, one of the best recordings I've heard and now I'm searching for something like that because I listened to the same 11 tracks too much by now I don't know if it would sound like that with a MP3 I'm just saying that the version I listen is great.

Overall the V20 is a very solid package, can take good photos has the wide angle camera has a quality DAC, can drive a much more cans with more juice, even after all these years it doesn't feel slow or dying and the best part: I can change batteries!

"FinalSpace","t5_3e2el","Well, it's complicated. First thing, Little Cato shouldn't have been on Lord Commander's ship in the first place. He had different objectives, but his desire for revenge got the best of him and went there where he shouldn't, without thinking about potential consequences of his actions. His presence on board of Lord Commander's ship was a coincidence, one that Gary couldn't fathom - he had no idea Little Cato is there when he was going to ram Galaxy 1.

Also, Gary accidentally saved Little Cato. The problem was that when Little Cato decided to face Lord Commander, in his lust for blood he completely forgot that Lord Commander has psychic powers. It could've been possible that, despite his condition, Lord Commander would disarm Little Cato before the latter would pull the trigger, and subsequently possibly kill him, or hurt him badly. Gary ramming into Lord Commander prevented that. Also, like some people already mentioned in other posts, if Little Cato have indeed succeeded, he would most likely succumb to darkness that's currently holding him. Gary saved him from that.

It's possible that Little Cato's fixation on revenge will be a deal in the show, but I don't think that will turn him into a villain. Rather, it will serve as a device that will determine which way Little Cato and Gary's relationship will go. After all, Avocato told Gary to take care of his boy, and Gary himself stated once ""all of us are broken, the question is how far are we willing to fix it"". Perhaps Gary will try to bring Little Cato back to the light, and show him that his life has more meaning that he realizes, which is especially important since Avocato sacrificed himself so he can keep on living, and that there are things far more important to do.

I guess it's possible that Little Cato may be mad at Gary for this accident, IF this will take place in the show. But I have a feeling that there will be a reconciliation afterwards. Right now, they have each other only.",1535760125

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Sure, happy to! So what they did was clean up the UI, essentially. Now those weekly/daily milestones, are incorporated into the different areas by gold icons. They have a new rotation, so some are daily, semi-daily, and weekly. The idea is that encourages people to log in more frequently and always have something to do. Old system was just knock everything out Tues then wait. When you factor in bounties and pursuits, come Forsaken, we should have a boost to our regular grind while still being broad enough to cater to many play types. 

Gambit is a 4v4 PvEvP mode. If you haven't seen gameplay it genuinely looks unique and fun. So it's going to be a pinnacle activity like Strikes &amp; Crucible (meaning has it's own loot and ranking systems). Gameplay: Your team kills guys to gain motes. You then ""bank"" these motes in a terminal, which causes the opponents terminal to lock down and a bad guy spawn to hinder them. Then, several times in the match, one person can invade the other team, and assassinate them, setting them back further. Eventually a big Public Event -esque boss shows up. Whichever team downs their boss first wins. I'd suggest watching some gameplay or just try it yourself tomorrow, but it certainly looks fun.

I obviously am speculating as to the quality of Forsaken, but my optimism is high. No harm in waiting if you are hesitant. I think Bungie knows they fucked up and are really trying to right the ship. ",1535760128

It took everything just to get it in a parking spot and I had to get it towed somewhere.

The other problem I had was that, timeline wise, this is the shortest Star Wars Movie. It takes place over the course of a few days, rather than the month of previous movies. The Last Jedi was too packed, and it tried to do too many things at once. A better plan would have to spaced out and developed a few scenes more.

"bestoflegaladvice","t5_34iym","Depends on your insurance plan.  ""Retail"" price is $600 for a set of 2, which is the only way they get prescribed.  There are some programs which reduce that and insurance copays vary.  On my 14yo's primary insurance through his dad, the copay is $4.  With my wife's insurance, which is through me as a disabled vet, it's $0.  We run the 14yo through my plan  as secondary so there's no out of pocket either way but $4 is reasonable.  With the dad's old insurance through a major Seattle coffee chain but with literally the same insurance company, the copay was $80 per pen even though you can't get only one.

We need one set per house, one on the kid at all times, and one at the school in the nurse's office so a total of 4 sets.  That used to run us $640/year per full set.  We had to get new ones every single year because they expire.  Now that we have him on my plan for secondary coverage his dad got a new job at a much smaller employer and the cost is $4 per 2 pens which, of course, my plan still covers.

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Read his autobiography.   That feat was fairly minor compared to some of the stuff he did. 

Here is one example:

Yeager was shot down while trying to make a head-on pass at a group of Fokke-Wolfe 190s during a raid on Bordeaux, France. Bailing out over Occupied territory was risky business. Even if he made it to the ground in one piece, Chuck knew his chances of avoiding German patrols were slim.

He waited until the last possible moment to open his parachute, then scanned the ground below as he descended. German troops seemed to be everywhere. After sweating out the ride down, he found himself in a forested area. Chuck rolled up his parachute and took cover in the heavy brush.

The next morning, as a French woodcutter made his way through the area, a pistol-wielding Chuck approached. His objective now was to avoid being captured at all costs and make his way into neutral Spain. He needed the help of the French underground if he was to succeed.

The startled woodcutter spoke no English, but understood that the young flier needed assistance. Soon, Chuck was under the watchful eyes of the Maquis ‚Äì the French resistance movement. He spent the next few weeks traveling with the Maquis through the French countryside. He showed them how to set various timings for fuses on plastic explosives, something he had done years before with his Dad in the natural gas fields.

On 23 March, 1944, Chuck and three other downed American fliers were driven to the edge of the Pyrenees Mountains. The range forms a geographic barrier between France and Spain. Once on the other side, the men would be in neutral territory.

Chuck and a B-24 navigator would make the journey together. After four days of steady climbing through knee-deep snow and a relentless, freezing wind, the men were exhausted. They found a deserted cabin and decided to rest a while. The other airman hung his wet socks on a bush outside the cabin. He and Chuck were too tired to realize what a mistake that was.

Chuck was awakened by the sound of bullets hitting the cabin. A German patrol had passed by, seen the socks, and started shooting. The two men dove out a back window. Chuck threw his injured comrade on a snow-covered log slide and jumped on with him. The men ended up in a deep creek several thousand feet below the cabin. Once on the bank, Chuck tended to the other airman‚Äôs wound. Without Chuck he would have perished. Chuck then proceeded to drag his injured comrade back up the mountain.

Cold, wet, hungry, and with every muscle in his body aching, Chuck inched along. He did not stop for fear of falling asleep and letting go of his injured comrade. Finally, and practically without realizing it, Chuck reached the summit. Far below he could see a road. He pushed the unconscious airman down the slope and followed behind. Chuck left his injured comrade at the side of the road where border patrols could find him, and continued south. Now in Spain, he would soon have to turn himself in to the authorities.",1535760136

And Wawrinka is probably the player that is the hardest to read. He can look so incredibly tired / careless / mind out of the game, but its actually the entire opposite when he looks like that. This is the match ive looked the most forward to so far in US Open.

Hiya everyone, 

I‚Äôm a student starting a new job on Tuesday. Unfortunately, I have to pay rent tomorrow with school-related expenses coming up next week as well. I am asking for $120 if anybody would be able to help me out at all, just to cover groceries and transportation to/from work. I will be working full time, 5 days a week. I am more than happy to provide my proof of employment and/or any other necessary information. 

Will repay $150 on or before 09/17/18, once I get my paycheck. 

Thank you all in advance!

We know once Cell absorbs someone they‚Äôre unable to escape unless regurgitated by force, ie; 18, however because the story must go on, without explanation Goku forces himself out of Cell after being completely absorbed.

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Suggested this song so many times on this sub I‚Äôve lost count. I was a really lonely kid back in 2015. I really wanted affection and I wanted people to understand me. I discovered this song when Bj√∂rk‚Äôs album Vulnicura was released on iTunes (which is a sad album in general. It‚Äôs mainly about her divorce and the deterioration of her family). I‚Äôve never heard such relatable poeticism. It was so ‚Äúcalculated‚Äù, yet human at the same time.

‚ÄúA juxtaposition in fate
Find our mutual coordinate
Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is who is open-chested and who has coagulated
And who has shared
And who has shut down the chances‚Äù

And the chorus just blooms as she sings

‚ÄúShow me emotional respect!
I have emotional needs!
I wish to synchronize our feelings!‚Äù

I'm guessing this is somehow all tied to NAFTA which also started in the early 90s.

Pre-New 52, there have been several waves of teenage heroes. The first was the 1960s Teen Titans, and many of those same characters were members of the '80s reboot of Teen Titans and the '90s Titans. The second wave began in the 1990s, with the characters teaming up in Young Justice and added a few old favorites in the '00s Teen Titans (even if they were technically no longer teens). New-52 onward is confusing. New 52 Teen Titans was a bastardization of the '00s Teen Titans. And Rebirth Teen Titans began as a weird mix of the '80s Teen Titans and more recent characters (some pre-New 52, some created for New 52). But there has recently been a soft reboot of Rebirth Teen Titans with the more recent characters and brand new ones.

If you censor people for their political views, no matter what those views are, you will draw criticism for acting as a censor.

If you permit organized influencing groups to operate unopposed, you will be criticized for allowing foreign influences to run amok on reddit. 

This is a huge debate and I think it is fundamentally a battle for the soul of liberal democracy. I truly believe that, in a marketplace of ideas, these propogandists will be defeated. Who they are should be irrelevant, when it is their words that should matter.

However, I cannot ignore the impact that the reddit voting system has on discourse. Even if you, as administrators, don't censor anyone, the other users will. The voting system all but guarantees that echochambers will form, and they strongly empower coordinated vote manipulation with the ability to control the flow of larger discussions.

I think the only real solution here is to publically take a stance that *reddit is not a place for debate.* The format simply doesn't support it. That is unfortunate, because I really like the technical aspects of reddit, but the voting system just doesn't work for open discussion.

I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.",1535760146

"Python","t5_2qh0y","I had a very bad interview once. I went to UCLA and got a degree in Electrical Engineering. After I graduated I couldn't seem to get an interview anywhere. Finally got an interview at a chip company called Maxim.

The interview was like a 6 hour test basically. I specialized in EE with biomed applications so I took a lot of premed classes where I would've normally taken EE classes and also got 0 hands on experience at UCLA. If you took a class on circuits at UCLA you would never actually touch a circuit board and would basically just do really complicated math the whole quarter.

So I had really few applicable skills by the time I had graduated when many people who went to worse schools had more. But I had shown I can learn quickly and I'm very smart otherwise I wouldn't have gone there and graduated.

My interviewer told me I was the worst candidate out of 35 and basically laughed me out of the interview. I got really really depressed afterward. Why am I taking a 6 hour test for an entry level job that will require on the job training anyway?

Since then no interviews have gone half that bad. But yeah, you're going to have some miserable interviews in your life. Some companies just make the process terrible.

I have now been working for 5 years at a major hardware company and just got another promotion on Monday with 11% pay raise, so things change. You just need to keep on it and eventually you'll get the job. Don't let it get to you. Once you get your foot in the door somewhere you'll get a lot of skills quickly at your new job and every job after that in the industry will be easier to get. You'll have connections to more and more companies and have a wider amount of knowledge. Also, getting questions wrong doesn't necessarily mean you failed anything. A lot of time they just want to see that you can logically work through a problem even if it's not the right answer. There are many graduates these days who lack that skill.",1535760147

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;But what about the accumulation of wealth would cause these people to gravitate towards such a viewpoint?

There are two main types of people that spring to mind.  The first are those who are the true believers in the ideology surrounding liberal economics and perceive the creation and holding of wealth as a sort of proof that they are top of the game in a survival of the fittest world.  They are either corporate CEOs to whom the pursuit of necessity long ago gave away to the pursuit of status when money became a way simply to dominate or the born rich who seek to justify their position in society and the means needed to maintain it.  

The second are the tech millionaires and billionaires behind the current wave of data science based groups.  Their perception of humanity has been shaped by realising just how predictable we are, how easy we are to manipulate, how big the scale of the problem is and from seeing behind the curtain of how we act when we think no-one is watching.  They also know that very soon most of the work that we spend our lives doing to create value will be better performed by an advanced algorithm controlling a robot.

Here is a copy of the original post:

Hey guys

I've just moved into a new place and it pretty much drained me financially. There's a few unexpected costs I had to pay, they were sprung on me after I actually moved into my new flat.

The money you lend would be used to buy food and guarantee my travel to work each day.

I am full time employed and can prove this via wage slips and ID.

This is my first loan, so if the interest offered is not acceptable, then we can discuss adjusting it slightly. 

Thanks in advance!

Character/race focus sucks balls atm.  
  
When you look at characters like Sylvanas and Vol'jin, the Alliance doesn't have faction leaders that seem as cool or as popular. Tyrande is pathetic. Velin spent Legion helping both sides. Malfurion rolls from one ass kicking to the next. Genn has a lot of screen time and has a strong following (and out of any main characters, a proper and real reason to fucking hate someone on the other faction).

Alliance characters die and stay dead. Sillyvanas has more lifes that Catwoman and Vol'jin seems to still be kicking about. Blightcaller even got a shiney upgrade from dead to ""not so dead"".   
 
  
Team human need some variety into it. Give me foul mouthed take no shit Dark Iron and flamboyant Void Elves. Give me savage Worgen and more savage Night Elves.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I'm so sorry about your friend. You're not  being overly dramatic at all. I was abused as a kid, I often felt depressed and suicidal. Part of me thought it was my fault and it was very hard for people to convince me otherwise. Most people left me because they didn't have the answers and they didn't want to deal with it. I'm telling you all of this because I want you to know how much it means to her to have a friend like you. This is a heavy weight for you to carry alone. Perhaps you could see a therapist since she can't. It could be good for you to vent your feelings to a professional as well. The therapist might have tips on how to deal with all of this stress and ways for your friend to cope too. I really give you a lot of credit for sticking by her because so many people aren't willing to do that. She's been let down a lot and having a consistent person like you helps her keep going. Like the others have said, compliment her when she says something negative about herself. Even though it might not get totally through to her, it's still good to hear the opposite of what her family says. I understand her fear of adults. As terrible as thing's are in her home, to her it's still her home and the only thing she knows. The thought of being taken away is so scary no matter what. I know its a very sad thing for you to see. You're being a great friend. Sometimes all you can do is listen. You may not feel like its helping her but i promise you it is. I'm sorry I don't have the answers you're looking for. Really I wish I did. For now keep doing what you're doing, hear her out and validate her. Just don't forget to take care of yourself too. I hope things get better and that she's able to get away from them as soon as she can.",1535760150

Well, there's no evidence that it wasn't either. I think Occam's Razor is that the questions that were being asked, as it was portrayed in the article, were *leading* to the result of ""are you a player of the sort of high speed competitive games that we make, or not."" 

I don't know what any other conclusion could reasonably be derived there.

&gt;In the article itself, there's an example of a Riot producer using a World of Warcraft raid as an example of ""core gamer"" activity and that's much slower-paced than competitive PvP games and entirely cooperative rather than competitive.

I don't have a lot of personal experience with WoW raiding, but from my understanding of them, they can be very intense, and while not competitive in a person-to-person sense, they involve a lot of the same group tactics and coordination that LoL employs, correct?

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I respect developers greatly when they are keen and pay attention to other games and go ""we'll steal that.""  It is a sign of a great developer and artists, imo.  They are not just developers but fans of videogames like us.  It would be intriguing to ask GoW 4 devs what exactly were the major influences and games they were playing because it's difficult to reverse engineer precisely. 

I don't think taking ideas from other games and sneaking them in is bad.  The reverse.  I don't think they are lazy for it either.  I am sure they put a lot of hard work into GoW 4.  And you say it's a lot of risk to drastically change but to be honest it's not that big of a risk, it's like there are so many shitty mechanics in God of War 1 that it's just logical to change with the times and create something new.  They are lucky people appreciated the game.  Can be a bit of a crapshoot.  

In regards to labeling it reinvention, in my opinion it's a bit extravagant to call it a reinvention.   Technically speaking they didn't invent shit, they improved their game a great deal and threw some garbage out.  You know.  I'm sure they put a great deal of hard work into it, and I appreciate that.  For them to change so radically is quite refreshing.  It shows they are not dummies.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","At first glance, I see a couple problematic aspects here, and I'd say that overall this needs to be tuned down. Let me run down a quick list:

* Swordsman's Hate strikes me as sort of weird as sort of weird from a design standpoint. Mostly because it has sort of a clunky interaction with the standard barbarian Rage: both require a bonus action to activate.

* Also, my gut impression is that the numbers need to either be lowered, or lose the scaling.

* The ""this excludes extra attacks"" limit is sort of ambiguous and weirdly worded. It might be better to say something like ""the first time you hit the marked target on a turn, it takes an extra...""

* For all of the Way of Swords fighting styles, you should specify exactly what weapons they can be used with. Do I have to use a longsword to gain the benefits of the Ittoryu style? Can I use a shield as well? Can I use three greatswords with Santoryu? How is the third weapon held anyways?

* Nitoryu needs to be clarified a lot. ""Proficiency in using two weapons even if they are not light"" doesn't really mean anything. It would probably be better to copy the wording of the Dual Wielder feat, and say ""You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't light.""

* The second part of Nitoryu is also kind of redundant: if the fighting style lets you dual-wield longsword, that's already means that you can use the two-weapon fighting rules to attack one with your bonus action (albeit without adding your Str mod to damage). 

* You should specify what actions your Swordsman Expert option require to use. Some of them seem like one-action strikes, while others act like passive bonuses, which interacts weirdly with the ""can only be used once per short rest."" Does a barbarian who takes Presence of Mind only get to resist fire or cold damage once per short rest? How long does the AC bonus last for?",1535760156
"nba","t5_2qo4s","Man I really don't get this perspective. Is it better to just throw in the towel year after year? Don't you people want the NBA to be competetive? Not every team can afford to add LeBron in the offseason so you have to do your best to make incremental improvements.

We just mean they're going to try and win some games and be less of a joke, which demonstrates to Booker that the organization is serious about winning long-term and isn't going to waste his prime years chasing after more ping pong balls.

Same thing if you say ""want to visit City X and come to a birthday party on saturday"" versus ""want to come spend the weekend with me and Steve for his birthday"".

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Why not just use the Starwheel?  It is a equivalent of a Manual Revolver in the Forgotten Realms available since 1362 DR, and it is currently circa 1491-1494 DR.

The trick is making or finding Smoke Powder.

Smoke Powder is not Black Powder.  It is not explosive.  It is a force arm, not a firearm.  Smokepowder is expensive and is about 250 gp per keg, or 240 shots.

People make this harder than necessary.  It is basically the cantrip Magic Stone reflavored, with six instead of three.

I was a Firearms instructor, (Gunners Mate and Armorer as assigned).  I see no way that Trigger is connected to those hammers.   When making a mechanized weapon make this before *anything* or it won't look functional.  Most of the weapons that could look like this were not trigger operated.  They had a short fuse and were basically hand cannons, or have hollow handles for ammunition magazines and are recoil operated,  i.e. a Spring mechanism is triggered to move the next round into firing position, but this requires an ejection of a cartridge.

The first ideas to consider were a caplock was the natural evolution of the flintlock, and was the last major step before the pre-packaged catridge fired ammunition (i.e. bullets).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","Hi. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm involved with a place that provides grief support services for families. We run programs for children and adults who have lost loved ones due to death loss. I would highly recommend getting your children involved with a place like that. Most places provide support groups for children starting at age 2-3. These groups are separated out by age ranges and usually have a concurrent group of some kind for the surviving parent. 

In terms of how to talk to your kids about their mom's death here's a tip sheet from The Dougy Center in Oregon who is one of the pioneer grief support organizations. https://www.dougy.org/docs/TDC_Tips_for_Supporting_Grieving_Children_2018.pdf  Be sure to check out their site as it has a wealth of information that will be helpful to you. 

In terms of actually communicating the news we recommend that our parents always tell the truth but keep it on an age appropriate level. For example your youngest kids won't really have an understanding of what death means yet. We recommend telling them that mommy died and that means her heart stopped working so her body stopped and she won't be able to run or eat or sleep or feel any pain. Avoid using euphemisms because they are confusing to young kids. For example telling your kids that mommy, ""went to sleep forever,"" can make kids afraid to go to sleep at night.  

Your kids are going to have questions. Do your best to answer them. I know you feel like you have to hide your emotions from your kids but it's actually helpful for them if you allow yourself to show some. You should try to avoid overwhelming them with your own grief and anger but it's totally ok to cry in front of your kids. Be prepared to have many, many, many conversations about her death. Grief is a process that lasts years although in time the pain won't be so acute. As your kids grow and their understanding of the world deepens they are going to have new questions about their mom's death. 

Also be prepared for a variety of reactions. There's no wrong way to grieve and kids often show their grief in ways that people don't recognize as first. There might be anger. They might act up at school etc. etc. A lot of kids express their grief through play and you might notice certain things coming up repeatedly. 

Lastly please don't forget yourself in all of this. You need help and support too. Take care of yourself. Find a therapist and confide in your close friends. Most of your friends want to help but they probably have no idea how to approach you because we do a terrible job of dealing with death and grief in this society. Don't be afraid to ask people directly for what you need.

I see them support these things all the time. They say you need a penis to commit rape, or that rape requires power that women don't have.

I see them dismiss conversations about circumscision by claiming that it doesn't hurt babies and it's not nearly as bad as FGM. To them, taking it seriously means equating it to FGM, and they can't stand the idea of equating them. Please, point me to these feminists that give a fuck. I want to shred circumscision and everyone who supports it with a fucking vengence. I want society to consider its supporters to be monsters. I don't care who I have to work with. I want people marching on the fucking capitol over this. It's sick. Show me the feminists who fight against any of these things.

That caption is no better. They're saying that boys are monsters, so you have to make them act genderless or like girls. They're saying that masculinity is evil. I don't give a damn if it's an Oedipus reference. They're sick fucks for publishing that trash. I don't care that the author is male either. He's a little bitch.

FUCK Jessica Valenti. Any attempt by her to care for men is twisted by her ideology.

He's so good at explaining why you should care about your life and how to find your own meaning in life. He actually understands men. Valenti has no fucking idea how men operate. She wants to strip men of their masculinity because she thinks we're just broken women.

Please, show me these ""majority feminists"" that are so virtuous.

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","The comments in this post do more to illuminate the stark differences in play styles of all the different members of the EFT community better than any post I've ever seen

Some people are completely hyped about the hideout, others couldnt care less.

Some people want more PvE, events, and endgame.  Other people are fine the way it is and just want more guns etc.

I think one of the most important things for the future of this game will be different game modes.  Like Arena in particular for people who dont care much for the RPG aspects of the game, but love all of the gun mechanics and handling. 

 Some people HATE the fact that ""most"" of the game is locked behind a ""grind"" to level 40 so that they can have a good ""fair"" fight and access to the best gear.  Other people love the process and the tension of being outgunned and improving every day.  Some people hate the looting and barter, while others think its the best part of the game.

I think if they can find some clever ways to cater to a couple of these different play styles not only will the ""endgame"" content be halfway solved, but more people will be playing Tarkov more often.",1535760159

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Black/White depicted the legendary duo of Zekrom and Reshiram, the dragons of ideals and truth respectively. 

A couple thousand years ago two brothers owned a dragon. The two brothers built civilization (I think, this part is hazy for me) and the region Black/White is set in. 

The brothers had an argument about how they should strive forward, the younger brother thought they should focus on ideals, while the elder wanted truth. The brothers fought and the dragon they loved split in two, into Zekrom and Reshiram (and Kyurem who is the broken remnants of the two iirc)

The dragons were of equal power and although they ruined the land the brothers worked hard for they could not defeat each other, so the brothers called it a day and stopped fighting. (That whole paragraph could be wrong I‚Äôm not sure)

In the modern day when the story is set Team Plasma, led by N and commanded by Ghetsis, try to shape the world to their (Ghetsis‚Äô) will, using the opposite dragon of your respective game, and will repeatedly say throughout the game that they fight to create a world of truths/ideals.

It‚Äôs not particularly dark but it‚Äôs quite intense as far as Pokemon games go, with how devoted they are to their cause, N‚Äôs creepy bedroom in the castle, and the fact that the writers actually put effort into writing each character it can be unsettling and serious compared to past games.

Hope this helps, although I‚Äôm not the best and I‚Äôm sure someone will clear up some stuff for me.

Oh, shoot, really? I just thought the authors were unknown and the translations were bad...""

Here is a link to the Wikipedia entry for *Forged*, a fascinating book by Bart Ehrman. Ehrman is a New Testament scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a highly respected researcher in biblical history. Give this a click:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forged_(book)

""I agree. What my uncle said, though, I'm not sure about‚Äî he said that if a business posted what it wouldn't do, then customers just didn't have to go there. And the business's reputation would suffer quite a lot.""

I don't think that your uncle wants to think about the old days of Jim Crow laws when virtually all business excluded blacks. The institutionalized bigotry of those days was a blot on US history that is still remembered by the victims. Even I, a Caucasian, had a small experience with it. I was dating a black women and we went into a restaurant and it wouldn't serve us. They just ignored us and seated many couples who came in after us. I got madder and madder but my date tried to calm me down; she was well acquainted with that kind of treatment. I eventually went up to the maitre d and just stood there. He finally turned to me and pointedly said that the Italian restaurant down the street would serve us. That experience was humiliating! 

I've got to shut this off here. I'm going over to Marilyn's for dinner and will spend the night with her. I should be back at my computer about mid-morning.

Mania's auto-running is constant, and is required to go faster in order to win them. There's not much in the way of ""risk versus reward"" in the Mania special stages either. There's not much in the way of a ""more difficult but more rewarding path"" in them, aside from honestly the last one in Plus. But even then, it's risk, or no reward. You have to take the harder route to even think of getting it.

And excuse me, but mechanics? Having to jump repeatedly to make turns? Constantly speeding up to make movement even more difficult? It works for what it is as a special stage, and nothing more. If it were made for an entire game, with longer stages? Nope. It wouldn't work. And it certainly couldn't be deep.

I love the special stages. They're my favorite in the series. But dude, you're just doing nothing but showing your hate bias against the boost formula. It's alright. It's not for everyone. But get over it.",1535760159

Although on second thought, I think you‚Äôll have a difficult time selling the titan because the 2080 is officially announced with performance numbers. Its not like a couple months ago where it was anyones guess when the 2080 will be out. So if you cannot sell the titan since people rather buy a 2080 with the same amount of money, I‚Äôd tell you a big ‚ÄúDepends‚Äù. If you wish to play 240fps games at max settings, You‚Äôll want an intel 8600k. Any other uses, like 4k, 144hz, etc, you‚Äôll want to buy AMD unless you have another reason. For me, I just have a deathly fear of PGA cpus, and since my use cases dont see much of a difference between Intel and AMD, my 3 year old 6700k does me proud.",1535760162

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","I see what you‚Äôre saying. 

I think the prospect of creating another google although we may have the ability, Im not sure if it would be really viable. 

It‚Äôs like we don‚Äôt let one company privatize the Internet. At a certain point we need to take the monopolies like Facebook and google and make them public assets. I don‚Äôt agree Steven bannon or his ilk should be running it but the idea is a solid concept. 

Google profits off of being the information superhighway and they have started to tinker with the way people access that information and the private company is being squeezed by the deep state the way the Qwest CEO was locked up and bogus charges levied against him. As long as a private company exists and controls this information it can censor as much as it likes. Google in secret is already doing this. So is Facebook. So is Twitter

Yeah it could cause ripples in the stock market if we the people seize google and have it run by a public trust out in the open, but I would argue what we gain from that is more valuable. 

Great if tech companies close up shop and move oversees we prevent them from selling products in the US. They then go belly up unless they play ball. 

We have to start calling their bluffs, because what you‚Äôre saying is advocating for what we currently have and we are on our way down a slippery slope. The companies keep demanding more and more or they will leave. Well good, leave and we will seize all your assets for tax theft and arrest guilty parties. 

Obviously what I‚Äôm presenting is just off the cuff right now but companies need to serve he public good or else they need to be abolished. We have to take back our country and laws because right now they do not work for us but rather against us. ",1535760162

**JJ Part 1/2**

****


###Opening strategy:  

Russ knows a stand user carrying a rifle is across the road and will prevent line of sight as much as possible while dealing with the immediate threats, being the body guards.  Russ quickly uses Bodhisattva‚Äôs many arms to remove as many tires as possible within a short time.

Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms latch onto one of the tires and form an extendable spring and a leftover 2 arms throw the tire at the closest guard between the two rocks. Upon hitting the ground the spring attaches to the ground and extends, acting similar to a cartoony boxing glove on a spring. This should easily knock the guard out. The spring releases the tire to grab the guard and his weapon back behind the truck stop. Russ loots the guard and takes his gun, armor, ammo, and goggles.

Russ goes back to the car and removes the side mirrors, using the mirror and one of Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms russ safely takes aim at the guard in front of the truck stop and takes him out, moves forward, and takes out the remaining guards among the nearby rock formations before returning, having also used the detachable arms to retrieve their weapons and ammo as well when available. This should give russ about 4 guns as well as an extra set of body armor.

Russ makes his way in through the back door or restroom window of the truck stop and takes cover. Using the mirror to occasionally check for Buffalo.

Russ approaches the truck owner in the store and gives a brief description of what is happening and that he needs to trust Russ that if he wants to get out alive he needs to follow his lead. The best way of doing this is to give him the goggles and armor of one of the guards. ‚ÄúIf you can now see this man behind me you should know that this is beyond your understanding, all you need to know is that I'm not the only one with strange powers, and that everyone else here will kill you on sight. Do as I say and I will grant you safety to the best of my ability. You should know escape isn‚Äôt an option seeing as they all have long range weapons and this is basically a warzone. You will have to fight back.‚Äù


****


###On the offensive: Plan A  

If by this point the pickup is still operational Russ will go with Plan A. ‚ÄúGive me your phone and keys, take one of these guns.‚Äù Russ says as he moves to the back of the store to get a couple more tires. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to attach two arms to you, use one to hold the gun. Our phones are in a video call now, use the other arm to make the camera look down the sights with my phone while you look at your own screen to aim from safety. Keep laying down covering fire wherever that sniper is, recoil isn‚Äôt a factor with arms as strong as these. When I say so just put a bunch of shots down range to keep him from seeing what‚Äôs happening. When I run to the truck, move when I do, how I do, do NOT fall behind‚Äù‚Äù 

Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms begin forming a coil with the truck stop‚Äôs fire extinguisher in the center, one end attached to the floor and with a binding (either a zip tie or torn cloth) wrapped around the handle. ‚ÄúKEEP FIRING‚Äù Russ yells as he begins to roll the extra tires towards the  pickup one towards the flatbed and one towards the front. Russ then pulls the pin to the extinguisher and tightens the handle, forcing the extinguisher to begin spraying. Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms start to rapid uncoil and launch the fire extinguisher over to the opposite side of the road or wherever Buffalo is currently taking cover from the civilian‚Äôs shots.

 As soon as it is sent airborne Russ and the civilian run into the bed of the truck. All of Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms are suddenly put to use. Two arms are tossed into the cabin via the back window with the trucks keys, one arm drives, the other works the pedals. Two arms attach to one of the rolling tires which continues toward the front, where the arms grab onto the front of the truck. The tire will be used to block at least one direct shot to the front. One arm Is used to provide video feed to Russ from the safety of the truck bed in order to avoid obstacles. Other arms are sent to the underneath of the truck for standby. Russ, the civilian, the remaining tire, and all the guns are in the bed.


The truck starts and gets to speed before Russ enacts part 2 of plan A, where when he either reaches a sufficient distance or purposely hits one of Buffalo‚Äôs many traps, arms in the front of the truck grab onto the undercarriage and attach to the ground, while two more jack the truck up from the back. The action catapults Russ, the civilian, and the remaining tire through the air and remain hidden within the smokescreen left mid-air by the extinguisher. While mid-air Russ pulls the civilian to his back, forms spring stilts using 4 arms for the landing. Holding one of the guns himself while about 3 arms hold the remaining guns from his back and aim forward, and 2 arms to hold the remaining tire out front like a shield.

****


###On the offensive: Plan B  

If the pickup has been rendered useless before Russ can get to it, he instead falls into Plan B. (after starting mostly the same with Russ giving similar advice and weapons to the civilian) Without the pickup, crossing the street directly is remarkably dangerous, so Russ and the civilian will decide to work there way around the back. Russ and the civilian take a tire and extinguisher behind the second rock and do a similar trick to Plan A by flinging the extinguisher while its spraying, but this time at a lower height and spanning from that rock formation and into the end of the limo closest to the truck stop. This simultaneously blocks Buffalos line of sight and distracts the 8 guards surrounding the limo while Russ and Civilian use arms in the shape a spring heels to quickly dive underneath the furthest armored vehicle.

 Once the guards return to place, Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms will sneak up one of the guards to the north while their guard is down (they won‚Äôt expect an attack coming from the armored car and likely won‚Äôt be looking low to the ground). The arms sneak up the back of the guard and force him to discharge his weapon, bodhisattva also making them shoot directly at the limo.

As soon as the guard attacks the limo the other guards will turn on him. Bodhisattva recalls the arms before he gets peppered. The resulting gunfire is used to mask Russ and Civ‚Äôs own shots as they take out the two guards between the rock formations to the south and yet again springheeling between the rocks where the guards once stood.

Russ and Civ can then freely take out the guards to the southwest and southeast simultaneously while shots still ring and move east towards Buffalo. As they near Buffalo, Russ takes the same arrangement of arms, guns, and tire as the end of Plan A and prepares to fight. The civ also having armed himself with the guns from any of the 3 dead guards along the way and beginning to slowly circle around unseen.",1535760164

Why are only four Jessica Langes in four different circles and not all nine? Why are almost all of the characters in season 7 played by a different cast of actors than season 1? Why do Billie Dean Howard Howard and Queenie both show up in THREE circles? Why does the Apocalypse circle have more than one Joan Collins character and where was she in the other circles? How did the witches then descend into Hell in Coven?

Even when taken as a metaphor, the theory is still broken because at the very least the show's going to have 10 seasons, not 9.

You're viewing the old system through rose-tinted glasses and your focusing on a section of the game that's never been important and is possibly ""hurt"" (not really) by the new watchtowers and ignoring the ways that watchtowers have opened up gameplay.

‚Äã

Recon has never been important to this game, because 9/10 times any recon you do is ignored in chat,  in the old system. Should it be made more important? I believe so, but I think it should be made more important in a way that doesn't make watchtowers dumb. This could be accomplished by making Watchtowers subject to LoS, and by making the radio-pack actually useful by allowing them to scout objects semi-permaneantly.  Additional changes to watchtowers could include being unseen while prone or crouching at different distances.

&amp;#x200B;

I also completely disagree with AI not being a substitute for a real player. This game will never be able to run without AI substitutes and anything we can do to make the AI behave more like an actual player (In limited roles) makes them less noticabley AI, ups the challenge of the game and makes the game more fun.",1535760169

Fast forward to this summer, where I run into a digico desk running the latest firmware, and my file is from the end of tour last year. It worked fine.

As for me, I realized I was an atheist a mere 3 years ago. After about 6 months of being a secular humanist I somehow realized the meaninglessness of everything (I don't remember how and what prompted it) and found out about Nihilism. 

Then I started thinking about free will and eventually realized its illusory nature. That swiftly moved me to the rejection of the ego, which happened suddenly through a single statement: *You are a thought*. 

Some time after that I got exposed to Alan Watts and with his help I realized that not only am I thought, but also that everything is basically a thought.

I don't think it's something divine or anything like that. It simply requires a very fundamental shift in perspective.",1535760171

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Every practice is different; at my office when make running on time an absolute priority. Rarely do we run even 15 mins behind. This takes a lot of work on everyone‚Äôs part (including the patients). We have same day access. Objective measurements of our success at this is a) 3rd next a available appointment is typically within the next half day (ie  we start any half day with at least three open 15 mins slots. Cycle  time (time from start of appointment to when pt is checked out  is typically 9mins.  (This is very fast because my pts have become so used to me running on time that they tend to show up early- and yea that can become a problem if I am merely running on time and they wanted to get in and out ahead of time) 
Incidentally if/when pts arrive more than ten minutes late they are asked to reschedule or they can be seen by one of the NursePractitioners if they would prefer. This rarely happens, but is nice to be able to offer the patient a choice &amp; not suddenly have my day trashed by one late pt. 

Does this take a ton of work? Yes. Does it take constant vigilance ? Yes. 
Is this a huge patient satisfier? You bet. And I/we rank near the top in our 300+ doc group and when compared  to national cohorts for patient satisfaction. 
Are my quality metrics in the top percentile as well. Yup &amp; that takes work as well. 
Now as for money - actually we do just fine,. Our group has a long tradition of laying all the numbers out for all the docs to see - and what is kinda funny is my office actually generates more revenue than some that see 10-15 more pts/day and run dreadfully behind. Why? Overhead &amp; payer mix. As patient volume goes up the need for additional staff/overhead costs goes up. Now in any other industry you can pass that cost on to the consumer. Not medicine. Our reimbursement per patient is fixed. So a natural response to to increase patient load (volume). 
In reality there is a very low point of diminishing returns where the cost of the increased staff needed to support the extra patients being seen outstrips any increased revenue and all you are doing is seeing more patients, running late and generally being miserable.
To be fair I work in suburbia, started my practice with a good sense of the forces and see very little underinsured/Medicaid (these often lay less than it actually costs to see &amp; can quickly spiral into the need for high volume as explained in an earlier post) I rarely have no shows etc. 

In short (TL/DR) a Doc in primary car can run on time and still provide high quality care- but it takes a lot of work/buy in from the patients and the right external factors such as payor mix. ",1535760172

###Confrontation  

After either Plan A or B come to fruition, Russ in his impromptu arm suit  should be within proper fighting range of Buffalo. Russ charges towards Buffalo using the tire to shield against direct shots. With all 4 guns firing at Buffalo at medium-close range he can not climb upwards to save himself as it would leave him wide open.

Stuck In The Middle and Scar Tissue would be wildly ineffective as the shield would entirely block a direct shot. Indirect attacks to the legs by using them on the ground would only take out one of bodhisattva's arms at a time. And sticky limbs can easily be abandoned and resummoned.

Atom tan requires a brief delay and that Russ not be in close range, Russ should be able to close that distance very well. Russ can also potentially return Atom Tan by having a spare arm catch and send it directly back or behind a rock formation where it does no harm.

If Buffalo managed to fire at the tire at close range Russ has many options, he can use one of his 4 guns to block the shot, if it manages to dissolve the shield Russ can break off and use part of the nearby rock formations, or Russ could push as hard as possible to get closer to and gun down Buffalo before he could have any follow up. When buffalo fires his rifle, he would need to pull out the slingshot, load, aim, and wait for a delayed effect with his only effective fruit. Whether he can do that before 4 guns can connect to him is questionable at best.

Russ has several options in this short frame besides simply shooting a lot. Russ could attach one of his remaining arms to a bullet as it is being fired and attempt to start restraining Buffalo with an arm from range. He could hide Bodhisattva‚Äôs arms underneath the sand at one of the palms and snag buffalo as he tries to climb. He can change the direction of a bullet an arm is attached to by having the arm grab one of the palms and having the bullets momentum slingshot it around before the arm releases it. And lastly the civilian can get a sneaky shot in or pincer Buffalo during the fight.


****


###Finishing Randall  

Russ can infiltrate the limo relatively easily but having a lot of arms open all the doors at once and rush him. Russ could also use the guns and attach them to roaming arms and have them all raise up into the windows and fire in synchrony.

Taking care of the rest of the guards defending the limo should be easy, since both of Russ‚Äôs plans involve him ending up on the southern side it should be considerably easier for him, approach from the east and take out the nearest guard, the more western guard can easily be taken out after that and from then on i can remove the tires from the limo and redo the tire-spring-hammer from earlier in the strategy along with typical restraints to subdue or eliminate the guards on the north side while Russ takes the senator out.

If attacking from the northern side of the map Russ could use a chain of arms to fling another arm to the guard on the right and force him to shoot the other guards and cause havoc like in Plan B.


****


###Contingencies  

* If Buffalo tries to use a palm as a sniper perch in the same corner he appeared in he becomes way too out in the open and if he remains there can be safely taken out by using the mirrors and phones methods to shoot from behind cover.  

* If Buffalo begins to dissolve the limo, the senator should easily be able to climb out the opposite side, which would bring him closer to Russ where he can be more easily taken out it‚Äôs generally just not a good idea to do that near the beginning of the fight and should be saved for after Russ is already defeated.  

* If Buffalo attempts to bring down the entire Truck stop it would take far too long, and Russ having had experience in both construction and disaster relief could easily survive even if it fell on top of him.  

* If Buffalo lays trap after trap completely surrounding his corner, Plan A should still be able to get to him, being flung over all the traps and landing with the massive springy stilts means no matter what Russ lands on he can‚Äôt take that serious of damage upon landing.  

* Of course constant interference from buffalo during plan B is expected, the visibility being reduced by the fire extinguisher should be enough to easily make it under the armored truck. The chaos after the guard begins shooting will cause a commotion on the opposite side where the visibility is bad and will likely momentarily hold priority over watching for a crossing, at least enough where a shot couldn't be lined up before Russ makes it into the southern rock formations.  

* If Buffalo decides to change positions and move towards the bottom left of the map, Plan B should still work fine, only the positions at which the extinguisher is thrown and where Russ gets across are switched. 

* If Russ manages to get one arm onto Buffalo the following would happen. The arm first swings itself up as fast as possible and connect to the middle back or nape of Buffalo‚Äôs neck before grabbing his primary shooting arm and pulling it back, or wrap around his neck and repeatedly jerk his head upwards. As 1 or two more arms are added they would bind up anything he could use offensively as a priority or bind the legs to prevent escape. This would lead to Buffalo either getting gunned down or made into a sitting duck for Bodhisattva to either stand rush him or choke him out.",1535760172

the world and him, they were in a strange but coy affair
his beloved earth, on display, and he - the voyeur

in a pointed stare, a tear rest snug to the cusp of his lid 
in wading bliss, the swell built to a drop, then Drip - dripped.

it made its escape - the watery membrane in flee of the cling
with the spilled emotion soil bound - this angel shed his wings

his choice brings the human condition, in place of the divine 
the sun in resign, he finally witnessed beauty on the skyline

that subtle pull, that ever expanding warmth he felt 
a lovely spell - cast by the color band's swarming meld

and as it held, mere moments from its dip to thriving shore 
the fleeting feelings soared - brought forth by diving orb

it was this, the utter importance of such trite and simple things
like a young girls dream, daunting questions tied to diamond rings

this is the speech the father speaks, the constituent of time 
he reveled in it, this new life of mortality - a being redefined

his line of homage, all worth his sacrifice and relinquished flight 
a celebration in its own right, he honored the finite in life

for life is amazing - but it is death he pays his tribute to 
in truth - its our numbered days that makes things so beautiful

I've been a Dolphin's fan my whole (yeah I know). Here are my predictions: our Oline is supposed to be better than it has been throughout Tannehill's entire career so Tannehill won't need to dump the ball to one receiver (Hartline, Landry). Amendola is awesome and I think he has some great games this season but I don't think he plays more than 6 games due to injury history and age. Parker seems like a bust coming from all the news about his health and overall work ethic so he's a massive question mark. That leaves Stills, Wilson and Gesicki. I think Stills will thrive in this situation the most with Gesicki getting the most RZ looks. It's hard to say where Wilson falls at this point because I haven't heard or seen much of him at all since coming to Miami. Overall, I think Stills is the WR to own in Miami and Gesicki will breakout this season or next to be a top 5 TE.",1535760173

If anything this subreddit should encourage continual experimentation, even if it's extremely unlikely to result in anything more then a realization that Forge and Minecraft were written by knowledgeable individuals.

Your comment, followed by drhotdog's, clearly paint the act of decompilation/edit/recomplication as illegal, (and distribution being a secondary illegal act), with his clarification cementing that stance (which is why I responded to his comment).

If not to OP, it would definitely discourage potential mod-writers see when they see 'decompilation is illegal' followed by that being a core requirement to start writing forge mods.

and last but most important [buy this book](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30038085828&amp;searchurl=tn%3DThe%2BSailors%2BSketchbook%26sortby%3D17&amp;cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-title3) The Sailors Sketchbook and you will see a huge list of shop projects you can do to make it your boat. [Here's an example](https://i.imgur.com/RsUWzRe.jpg) , mahogany combings and standoffs. I just put those on. 

Suggestions: move the switch panel to the wall by the aft cabin seat. Near the floor it will eventually corrode and all the switches will need to be replaced. Mine did. 

The first time you put it on the water have all hatches open to the compartments under the seats in the cabin. As soon as the boat hits the water watch for leaks. With a dry boat they will be easy to spot if you have any. 

Good luck. I've been working on mine for 3 years and still not even close to being done. But she sure sails nice. eBay is your friend, cheap parts and sails. Enjoy the ride Commodore_64. If you're ever in Northern Minnesota PM me. ",1535760174

"bangtan","t5_2zqih","BTS is wonderful because they are able to articulate hardship, nostalgia, and personal growth through music. Although there are songs that remind us of the sad times, the overall message seems to be rising above the adversity and knowing oneself. No dream is too small, no person that doesn't matter. 

They convey this message in their interviews and the way they present themselves as artists. I admire that they are not afraid to point to their flaws and continue to want to grow and learn from each other and from ARMY. I hope that they continue to inspire us to be our true selves, that it's all right to be sad and imperfect, because eventually we'll rise. ",1535760174

But it's all good man, just keep suggesting people get charged (I'm assuming you mean criminally, because charging someone is not really used in the context of that word in that way when it comes to damaged property), that you would look maybe for another 15 to 40 seconds to maybe see if you you should make that comment.

If my neighbour damages my fence, even intentionally, I wouldnt ""charge"" him to fix it, I would expect him to fix it, I would demand he fix it, demand he pay for it, but never ""charge"" him for it.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Yes your therapist is right. Im a guy and I know that there are guys out there that just pretend to care until you sleep with them. I put in effort into the girls I date because I want to get to know them and at no point was I close to sleeping with them. Yet I see guys call up girls they just met and they have sex and the girl is left wanting a relationship and he wont give her that. If you want a relationship or to trust the guy it takes time.

I once had a girl get disgusted because I was a virgin. She got cheated on by her ex and wanted me to be her rebound after I let her vent to me and I was not interested in that. Too much drama and I know my feelings would be hurt when she realized I wasnt what she wanted, just a place holder. Its all tricky but look you can get a guys attention which means you can get other guys attention. There is no shortage of guys out there for you. Sorry to bring it up but that loser made fun of how you look yet he got mad when you didnt want to sleep with him. Im willing to bet they dont look that bad if he wanted to sleep with you again.

He is just mad you wouldnt sleep with him and wanted to hurt you, dont take what he says personally. He just wanted to get under your skin to make you upset, thats all. I would not sleep with a girl if I was not attracted to her, I mean I have to look at her and its kind of hard to have sex when you arent attracted to the person. 

Honestly dont worry about your looks, I know its hard but women seem to see small things as giant flaws. Again he wouldnt want you if you werent attractive in some way. He is just mad you wouldnt give him what he wanted so he threw a tantrum, thats it. You had complete control over what he wanted and he got mad for it. And trust me there are guys out there that will wait, Im one of them. We all arent wanting to just sleep around or avoid relationships at all costs, we want the same things as you. Im seeing a girl now that doesnt want a relationship, she just wabts to casually date me and barely talks to me in between dates despite me texting and calling her at times. She still wants to keep seeing me though, its weird but its not what I want. I want a relationship but no one wants that.

Relax about all of this, the guy is mad you wouldnt sleep with him. There is nothing wrong with you, he is just an asshole. There are guys out there that want everything about you abd will wait until you are comfortable with them for sex. You just have to keep looking, watch out for red flags, and just meet them half way so you both know you are serious about each other. Dont please a guy until he is your boyfriend and you know his intentions. If you arent there yet then he is either willing to wait or walk away and you let him do either one, dont make him stay he will stay if he think you are worth it. A good guy wont need pleasing, it needs to be mutual and when you guys are both on the same level. Just remember what your therapist said and dont do anything else.",1535760176

2. Have you given her a list of stuff you want to see if she can manage that? It‚Äôs not the same as being surprised by a lovely, thoughtful gift, but if it eliminates this source of grief it‚Äôs worth it IMO.

Infinity War was good for what it was, but it took the terrible mechanic from the Jessica Jones even if putting a sought after character in a big capsule with an 80 shards only chance and waved it in our faces the whole event with terrible odds. The Black Panther even was the best imo with no roadblocks, no daily rewards from battle and we earned characters and weren‚Äôt dependent on RNG capsules which was a good use of the new system.

Even the Hulk event was decent since we crafted shards with materials we gained from battle which still gave us a sense of control of our progression.

It was only when the capsules came out that things went downhill since everything became dependent on them rather than them working as a supplementary means of getting shards. Things only got worse when they introduced drops that can only be gotten once a day yet we‚Äôre used in getting everything from capsules to buying shards. The fact that these items are rendered finite, it‚Äôs obvious what the problem is. And it‚Äôs not even hard to figure out that they‚Äôre mostly doing it to force players to buy the generators to double the amount they can achieve of said items.

All in all, it‚Äôs just been downhill since they introduced the capsule system which is a shame because it could have been a nice means of helping get old characters into fighting condition but instead they just used it as another loot box",1535760180

&gt;.....on Tinder (im not using this to find a gf, its just for fun)

Don't see how this is really relevant. You don't need to explain or justify this to us. 

_______2_______

&gt; and she texted me right away, she gave me her insta and saw that she is actually a insta model with 25k+.

Your reaction is understandable, but this is fear talking if that matters. Most of the thread going on a just catfishing and such, was also swept up in a very unhelpful emotional reaction as well. 

This idea that it's too good to be true or it must be a scam if you happen to think she's pretty, is nonsense, and a common reaction when people are working on things like confidence. (I've even seen it in girls at times.)

**The truth is, meeting new people/dating will always be a screening process, one that you really can't predict the outcome of until after you've interacted with someone.** 

She might very well be a cliche of trouble. There are a ton of things that are possible. But none of them are terribly worth dwelling on, because focusing on these things could fuck you over. If you end up with someone who's not the cliche, you'll be less likely to see that if you're going in with assumptions.  

But being really present and aware when you are actually with her will give you the best chance to make the most out of your date. **Drop your assumptions and expectations and find out what's possible.** 

_______3_______

&gt; We agreed on a date and we meet each other on tuesday.

Cool. So just withhold judgement until then. *What did you decide to do for the date?*

_______4_______

&gt; She is not very talkative so i don't know if i should keep on texting until tuesday or not.

You're overthinking this. 

There's a reason why the common wisdom is that texting is only for logistics. I consider this an exaggeration, but the important ideas here are:

* You should have a life and more important things to do than making a stranger your priority like this. 

* You can't replace in person interaction with texting. You have a date set up. Be patient and find something else to do with your time until then, other than texting a stranger. ",1535760182

If you can make a copy of someone (or many) that behaves just as its original, then you can safely assume that those that will interact with them will act the same way as if they weren't copies. Having a working ""human"" host would mean they could easily impersonate or replace someone for any given purpose, such as having your loves ones be around you for as long as you live, or maybe go as far as replacing someone in a position of power, whom they'd later have near full control of.

As for Delos, perhaps what he actually wanted was continuity. He never saw his children as successors to his legacy, and William, though close, wasn't exactly following the direction he'd have wanted (Delos seemed to simply relent to William's suggestions, as William approached him with enough conviction to dissuade him).

"AskNetsec","t5_2t3w8","Sat for the GCIH...and failed.  Got 72%...one question.  And frankly (here come the down votes), I really do not think the course, nor the practice exams, remotely prepared me for the exam.  My first practice exam, 44%...but I expected that, as I purposefully only tried from memory, no references.  The second practice exam, only (99/150) 66%, with references.  I found the second exam much more difficult than the first.  And then I spent five days studying before sitting, minimum 5hrs a day.  I honestly walked in there thinking I ""had this"" and would get about \~80% \[117-123/150\] (+/- 3%).

‚Äã

When I took the exam, the questions were by far, more difficult than the practice exams.  And, I found it interesting the questions were purposefully worded for minutia, and verbose. (Yeah, not all of them. My statements aren't infinitives.)

‚Äã

An example - while it was easy enough to reference one of the books from the course's index, the questions purposefully excluded the normal verbiage you would look for, and included minutia verbiage.  You know, words that are only mentioned once or twice, in peripheral to a full page (or pages) of description.

‚Äã

Honestly, it was crazy.  Yeah, yeah,...I know ""Study \[harder/better/more\]."" or ""Make a better index."" maybe even ""You're just to stupid/not good enough."" Whatever.

‚Äã

After attending the course, and sitting, I am honestly stating that the course **\*\*severely\*\*** understates how difficult the exam was/is. I am also keeping in mind that the questions come from a 'pool'...or maybe I just got an unlucky draw of questions from the pool, eh?  Another \~$750 (geeeesh!) to sit again.

\- talk to your house fellow. Make friends with them, they already know a lot of people.

\- just join any group at the dining halls, just be polite. Especially this time of the year most frweshmen are looking to make friends, they would not mind.

\- join the people playing games, they usually like. having more people joining.

\- if all else fails, go to Sellery, everyone is super-frindly. A lot of then have 'come say hi' signs in front of their doors' and they mean it. A lot of them even have open doors. No I am not kidding with this one, it'll work (I am from Sellery)

The coder wants to make sure the diff between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1 before executing the code in the if statement.

This code (I assume) is in a loop. So the coder wants to make sure that the `i+1` element actually exists before trying to access it. This is what the `!nums[i+1]` is doing. The second part of the OR statement only gets executed if the first part is false. So if `!nums[i+1]` is false, or in other words if `nums[i+1]` is truthy, then we evaluate the second part.

The only thing irrelevant are your points, those of which you are using to try and steer this thread into a different direction.

&gt;Nice strawman you built there.

Nice misuse of a fallacy you got there.

&gt;more BS

I love when people link to sources that they perceive support their viewpoints, but either: (1) don't read them, or (2) don't understand it.

Essentially, what your lord and savior has done is try to twist any single exception to his advantage. Apparently, lacking a 60 seat ""filibuster breaker"" means he never had ""total control.""

I'll interrupt here to remind you I said he had a *blue majority* congress, *not* ""total control"" - but I'll put aside your lack of reading comprehension for a moment to wrap this up.

So the argument here is that he didn't have ""60 or more true Democrats,"" but that assumes a few things:

* That he wouldn't get any ""yes"" votes from the Independents or Republicans, ever.

* That every single piece of legislation would actually be filibustered

* That no president could get anything done without 60 seats of their same party in the Senate, minimum.

Do you know when the last time any one party had 60 or more seats? In the [95th Congress](https://www.cop.senate.gov/history/partydiv.htm). Do you know which session is taking place now? The 115th. Have we not gotten anything done since the late 70s? What a weak excuse.

Oh, and the fact he was able to pass the ACA, ARRA, and Dodd-Frank  makes your points - AKA the author's, whose point you were relying on - moot.

She calls me back after a few minutes and everything is fine, she‚Äôs almost home. I expressed my relief and reminded her to let the car run for a while once she got home.

I changed your post flair to ""FAQ"" as this is a question that comes back regularly and is addressed in both the sidebar and the [sub's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/faq#wiki_i_do_not_want_kids.2C_but_my_so_does._what_can_i_say_or_do_to_change_her.2Fhis_mind.3F) : 

---

### I do not want kids, but my SO does. What can I say or do to change her/his mind?

Nothing more than could be said to you to get you to change your mind. If you've talked it over and both decide through thoughtful deliberation that you still stand on opposing sides of potential parenthood, your relationship has three possible outcomes:

 1. You will acquiesce to the wishes of your partner and have a child. It can end well (both of you are happy being parents (although you can't use the ""childfree"" label anymore)). To read more of these well-ending stories, you can browse /r/AskReddit, /r/AskWomen, /r/AskMen, /r/AskParents and /r/fencesitter and search for the ""People who originally didn't want kids and now have them, how is your life?"" type of questions. It can also end with you not bonding with your child and feeling miserable, narrated in [these testimonies](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/regret#wiki_first_party_testimonies) and [those testimonies](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/love#wiki_conclusion_.3A_.22so.2C_now.2C_there.27s_a_kid.22). The child can also happen without your agreement (which is referred on this sub as ""oops"" or ""baby trapping"").
 2. Your partner will acquiesce to your wishes and agree to never have children. [They might grow to love being childfree like they might grow bitter and resentful](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/love#wiki_conclusion_.3A_.22my_.22not-so-cf.22_so_decided_on_not_having_kids.2C_in_the_end.22).
 3. You will both realize your life goals are incompatible and [part](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/love#wiki_conclusion_.3A_.22we_broke_up.22_or_.22we.27ll_break_up_soon.22). It can happen sooner like it can happen later if you're determined to make scenarios 1 or 2 happen but end up not being able to hold up to them.

---

You will also find many posts either asking for advice or giving us testimonies on how it all went down in the sub's *CF Love and Sex Life Troubleshooting* [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/love#wiki_testimonies_on_.22cf_.2B_non_cf.22_couples).

I hope this helps!

**To the community** : There is always one person to comment ""We get this question on a daily basis"", ""Why don't people search before asking?"", ""It happens all the time, your love isn't special"", etc. We understand that a lot of questions that /r/childfree gets aren't new - even more so to our most seasoned veterans - but a gentle nudge to the sidebar or just answering the question really goes a long way and speaks well of the community. There's a reason OP didn't ""just Google it."" It's because they wanted to engage in a conversation with people who know what they are going through and above all won't shower them with bingos. They want to vent a very personal issue because they are confused and/or hurting. Isn't that the whole point of our subreddit?

That statue belongs to a museum, but should not be a public display.  The flag is great because we like the values it represents, so is MLK, more so than malcom X.

1. She is trying to complete her hunt! That's the best that we can guess anyhow. It's a very common behavior and my kids do it all the time.
  
2. Lots of poop is pretty normal, especially if she's young. A lot of cats that don't cover their litter were bottle raised kittens (or just strays) who didn't learn this behavior from their mother. Sometimes it's just a quirk. One thing you can try is putting her in the box and using her paw to try and mimic the digging motion. It might not work, but it might be worth a try.  
  
3. Cats pretty much do whatever they want, they're obstinate things. You can spend $25 on a toy and they'll play with the bag it came in. Buy an expensive cat house and they'll avoid it like the plague. Get them a water fountain but still have them refuse to drink anything but sink or toilet (ew) water. That's just cats for you.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Complicated situation, but this is how I understand the legal framework under which Trump is operating:

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Canada joins negotiations and agrees to terms with Mexico and USA. As per the 1993 Implementations Act, Trump doesn't need any new congressional approval in this scenario. (Only requirement is 90 day written notification). The only thing congress could do is block with 2/3 majority (not happening) or write an amendment to the 1993 Implimentations Act... which Trump would then have to sign (not happening). 

&amp;#x200B;

Hence why they are in a position to give us this 'take it or leave it' offer in the first place. Unfortunately, this is our best option.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Canada does not join negotiations, Trump invokes A2205 (automatic withdrawal after 6 months), the US slaps us with tariffs at 6 months and 1 day and destroys our auto sector (and other manufacturing, mostly in Ontario), while the bilateral deal they've been working on with Mexico only needs a simple majority to pass in congress.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; US congress has no power here. Best course of action would be to go back in time 18 months and actually take Trump seriously and try not to back ourselves into a lose-lose situation.",1535760193

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I've been there.  Without oversharing for fear of causing you more worry, she was not a gal I ended up being with for very long because of infidelity.  The silver lining is this:  if your fears have any really grounding in reality, it will probably not take long for the cat to get out of the bag.  If she is not a loyal sort of person, she is probably not very tactful and you will know one way or another in a relatively short time whether or not she is going to exhibit behaviors you can't stomach or adapt to.  
NOW the part where I try to make you feel better:  
Do some math.  How many partners have you both had since you lost your virginity?  She is 5 years older than you, so there's a good chance the ratio is actually pretty close.  hypothetical numbers:  If you lost your virginity at 17, and she lost hers at 16, then you are averaging 2.2 sexual partners per year.  She is averaging about 1.8.  That actually makes YOU the bigger slut (jk, I should say a ""looser"" partner or ""more sexually active human"").  You also mention only 2 of them you are proud of?  (What do you mean by ""proud"", btw?  Proud because they were hot/popular/intelligent, or proud because the sex actually meant something to you?) Does this mean 9 of them were one night stands?  Are you perhaps projecting a little bit?  If you have hooked up with a lot of women outside the context of a committed, caring relationship, maybe you are worried she has similar propensities?  Take a few minutes to consider if this is accurate.  I am 28 and have had 12 partners since I was 14, so in my mind my ""ratio"" is a fairly conservative one.  But no doubt, (if I were single,) I could meet a woman who lost her virginity at 18, a reasonable age, and has only slept with several people since, and she might be mortified by someone who has had a whopping 12 partners, while to me those partners are so distant and foreign to my life now I would struggle to understand why she even cared so much.  The truth is, and you probably know this, you just don't count it like that in your own mind.  The reason we stop sleeping with people is because we stop wanting them, our hearts or crotches no longer reach out to them in that way.  It's pretty unreasonable to think she is comparing you against this big list of other men, and if anything she probably thinks of the men in her past less than you think of the women in yours, based on your genders, and the things you've stated about being ""proud"" of them.  Women also do not tend to put as big of an importance on the quality of sex in the context of relationship.  Most women (MOST,) who want love and security are not putting much stake in high-octane scream-inducing porn sex.  I think it's very true though for a lot of women, (and men, I'm sure) that the ability to orgasm easily comes with a high level of sincerity and comfort, not dick size and thrust rpm's.  As far as her friend goes, that's a little tricky.  It's really not fair to ask a partner to stop being friends with an ex if it's still an important relationship, in my opinion.  My current partner is best friends and roommates with an ex of mine, but me and the ex haven't been even slightly romantically inclined towards each other in almost a decade, and it's actually a wonderful thing that we all get to spend time together and have a very solid triad of friendship and trust among the three of us.  But if this is a guy she has returned to in a sexual way time and again, I think that changes the rules a little bit, and if it's really hard for you to sit with, I think putting down boundaries would be reasonable.  Perhaps not a full cutting of ties, but things like, ""You guys don't hang out without me or his partner also present; you don't stay at his house, he doesn't stay at your house.""  Things like that, that will give you enough breathing room to see if you can accept it.  And if you can't, that doesn't make you a bad guy, but she also has the right to prioritize that friendship over your relationship.  It really just depends on her response, her level of empathy and understanding.  That stuff will become more clear the longer you are together, and hopefully get easier all around.  


TLDR:  Are you projecting?  Are you skewing the numbers to make her seem looser than she is?  It's ok to not be okay with the relationship she has with her ex, but you must communicate about it, and accept it may be a deal breaker for one or both of you.  Good luck buddy

- i might becareful when you decide to try it out, it may take a little time to adjust but ar as I can tell it doesnt take long to go back to the way you were if you stop.
So perhaps if find yourself in a crucial or difficult situation you will panic and stop taking it without giving it a fair shot.

- If you read this sub you will see different reactions to the meds but I found on the first day that it was subtle, very easy to work with with very few almost nonexistent side effects like a little dry mouth. My appetite went up and down although most seem to have their appetite reduced.
I think because it has a reputation with ritalin doled out like candy to children and the ADD issue has a certain stigma of being a legitimate condition except if you have it and you feel like its debilitating. If it doesnt help you and make things better then dont take it, your an adult and can choose to stop any time.",1535760194

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Chris Robert's doesn't fucking know how to manage a project. He just keeps adding shit whenever the feeling strikes him, and thus it's impossible for the team under him to set and achieve any goals. That's why he left Origin, it's why he was forced to push Freelancer out the door by Microsoft, it's why the Wing Commander movie was such a shitshow (and also it was amazingly bad), etc. The dude CANNOT contain his ambitions.

Previously he had people above him to tell him ""NO"" -- undoubtedly with good reason more often than not, given his track record -- and he chafed under this every single time. He can't stand anyone getting in the way of his ""vision"", but he also can't stop modifying his vision whenever some new shiny idea comes along. The goalposts move far too often, so the team moves from Chris' Pet Project A to Chris' New Pet Project A, and to us look like they're treading water... because they are.

CIG needs a big, outside investor (i.e., a publisher) to step in, tell Chris ""no"", and either kill the project or shove it out the door so this debacle can end, but that won't happen. The whales are the investors, and thus all Chris has to do to keep riding the gravy train is convince the nerds with deep pockets to keep tossing money at his face, which, apparently, isn't that hard to do, considering they do most of the conivincing themselves. I really feel like it's sunk-cost fallacy for many of them, at this point.

Oh, and Sandy shouldn't be in the company at all, and especially nowhere near the money. I will die of shock if she isn't doing something shady with it, with or without Chris' knowledge.",1535760195

It was really helpful for setting and working towards some short-term goals and learning some new coping and management skills.

In the meantime while you are waiting to get into a program, FSTV also runs a drop-in on Tuesdays, from 1 to 6pm I believe. 

Also, you should not be waiting over seven months for something to happen with your OHIP stuff. Something's gone sideways with your referral. That happened to me the first time I went to a doc for referral three years ago and I ended up going to FSTV instead. 

However, I found myself in need of more help last year so I went to a doctor again (different doc, walk-in,) got a new referral, and I was in a psychiatrist's office in a couple of months. That led me on a path to medication and some really great group therapy that has me doing a lot better than I was before.

Please, call your doctor - I know that is SUPER HARD with social anxiety - that's why I let my first referral go. You should have at least gotten a call from LHSC by now. Call your doctor and see if they can find out what is up. You deserve to feel good and you deserve good help!! ",1535760201

My son also had 4 different days we thought he would be coming home and then bam he would have an apnea spell. 2 of those days were literally day 4 of no spells and then he would have another. My nurses told me to never trust a preemie, and never get your hopes up until they are strapped in the car seat ready for discharge. 

I'm so sorry mama. But a year or two from now it will be just a distant memory. It's my sons second birthday today, we're spending it in the house because I had his sister 6 days ago.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Remember: fucking this guy who she ‚Äúwas better than‚Äù and who ‚Äúmeant nothing to her‚Äù was more important than her keeping her agreement with you to be in an exclusive, mongomous relationship. Given how absolutely little she claims that sex meant, yet she still was willing to have it at the risk of your relationship with her, then what does that tell you about how very, very little she cares about your relationship or her promises to you?

Moreover, she put herself in this situation, against your wishes. She refused to make time for you, and then blames you because she was lonely. 

The only question I have is why in the fuck are you still with her?  

Edit: also, no, couples counseling is not worth it. This is a common card cheaters try to play. The issue I have with it is that you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, yet you are expected to do (at least) half the work to fix what she broke. And mark my words, you **will** be the one who most of the heavy lifting in your counseling exercises. Cheaters very rarely are willing to put in actual work. Instead, through every session, they just get madder and madder at the non-cheater. ‚ÄúUgh. That cheating was six MONTHS ago!  Why can‚Äôt he just get over it already?‚Äù

She needs **individal** therapy. She needs to get to the bottom of her problems, her insecurities, and her self-destructive behavior. She needs to figure out how to deal with her past abuse. And she should get that help. But you should not be in a relationship with her. ",1535760206

Then why don't you go and actually check it out instead of sitting at your computer desk shitting on arts you've never even learned.

&gt; Again I would like to see it in action.

Again, go and check it out.

&gt; Until then I remain unconvinced

That is fine, you're entitled to your opinion, but as long as you remain an uneducated and inexperienced keyboard warrior armed only with an opinion, don't sit there and write ""all arts fail at this"" on a public forum in response to a video that addresses weaknesses in your favourite sport, because you're admitting right now that you've no experience with these arts after saying they all fail to train this effectively.

&gt; if they are good at it remains to be seen.

By you, you are free to have opinions, I for one am not about to let you pretend they're valid and based on facts, such that you can blatantly say arts you've never trained or even seen before fail to do these things effectively, because you're straight up wrong.

&gt;  If you or anyone can show me a style good at training these things I would train there, plain and simple.

That's great, you're going to have to leave your little sport sandbox if you're ever going to see them.

&gt; even with weapons and multiple opponents training, the result would be the same.

With no or poor training yes, with good training, absolutely wrong.  This is the ""ignorant bullshit"" that I said people like you make up to try and validate your opinions and justify why you do what you do.  This is completely unfounded and only an opinion from someone with no experience.

&gt; I just doubt you can actually train it.

So your doubts mean you can say that all arts fail to train it?  You have no experience with majority of martial arts out there yet you're somehow such an expert on them all that you know this and can say this is true???

&gt;  I said in the very beginning it shares these flaws along with every other empty handed style.

Yea and that's where you are wrong, as I made pretty clear in my response.  You are skeptical which is fine, but don't pretend that your skepticism is based on anything but your own lack of experience with these areas of fighting.

Enjoyed this game a lot. Being on an island added a fun set of challenges, including how to make it all fit. :)

Pics: https://imgur.com/a/vuOdCYY


First time I ever ran a game past one rocket launch. Ended up much larger and more complex than any I've done before. My most successful factory yet, and I'm really pleased how it went.

Rocket count passed 50. Seems a good place to stop.

I'll go back and assemble some rail components into a blueprint book for next time.


*  First really complex rail network. Was wary of 2 rail, but 4 seemed too hard to fit. With 30 - 40 small trains none ran out of fuel, no snarl ups anywhere and 2 rail was surprisingly not limiting throughput at all. Just wish I could find a way for stations to take a bit less real estate. I'm probably using far more signals than actually needed. Fairly sure ore loading/unloading could be optimised too.

*  I will not confirm or deny any accident related thoughts you may have from all the walls, gates,  and flashing lights around the central drop off stations right at the start of the main bus. This may not be the ideal spot for the factory's busiest station. :p

*  The little shuttle train worked great. I prefixed all bypass stops with B so passenger stops all show at the start of the list.

*  I deliberately limited mall to highest use things only compared to last game or two. I prefer how it worked out not trying to pre-make anything I only need a few of. A mix of hand assembly and a few scratch assemblers solved everything else.

*  The two marked bays at mall start are just highlighting. Red stripe to show inputs before requester chests.  Blue stripe is temp storage - blueprints mostly so I can find again quickly. Instead of losing where I put them after wandering off to go build something... :)

*  I think I would have done better sending crude oil in by rail and refining centrally.  So many stations!

*  Running continuous rocket launches was constantly bottlenecked by oil. 25 oil pumps over on the mainland couldn't keep it fed. Rocket fuel drinks absurd amounts of oil.

So in reality, the new tax law makes the difference between folks at an income level between the old deduction of $6,300 and the new deduction of $12,000. Basically, it lowered effective tax rate to zero to folks between 6,300 to $12,000 income.

Using high Vcore and IMC (VCCIO) voltage can degrade the IMC and RAM cells over a long period of time. Additionally, high VCCSA voltage can degrade your motherboard traces over time causing a loss in signal integrity.

What you are seeing is probably natural degradation of the overclock over time as a result of overvolting, usually it is because your overclock was so close to the edge of stability already that a mild degradation was enough to cause a complete loss of stability.

"SpidermanPS4","t5_3f1fs","I was actually really surprised and maybe a little skeptical when I first saw the 2016 trailer and realized that Insomniac was making this game.

The rumors were all saying that Sucker Punch would likely do the game, which made sense at the time since they've had experience with making games about people with Super Powers.

But I reflected on it and came to realize that they are more than capable of creating a good Spider-Man game. They had experience in making games about... as Ted Price said on a Game Informer video ""Little guys overcoming colossal challenges"". So the story and character development was in good hands. The graphics was also in good hands since their latest Ratchet and Clank games had really good visuals, despite it being fiction and not something based on photo realism. Something that many developers aim for in other games.

Then there is the gameplay. This game is Insomniac's biggest challenge yet. They've made third person adventure games before, but nothing on a big scale like Spider-Man PS4. But they did made Sunset Overdrive, which was open world with good movement and free-running possibilities. So that was also in good hands.

So in the end, they are a suitable developer and this was also a brand new challenge and opportunity for them. And I have played the Ratchet and Clank reboot on PS4 and enjoyed every minute of it.",1535760212

"RedditLaqueristas","t5_2se5q","Bear with me - 

Try taking an oral iron supplement. My weak, brittle nails grew beautifully after I had my children. Not while I was pregnant, so it wasn‚Äôt the prenatal vitamin; only afterward. The only thing different was the iron supplements (and breastfeeding).

So, I mentioned this to my hematologist (I had a bad bleed after my last) and she said most women are chronically slightly anemic. We lose iron after every period, after every injury, while we‚Äôre pregnant/nursing (baby has to get iron from somewhere). Anyway, since iron‚Äôs job is to carry iron to your tissues, if you don‚Äôt have enough of it, your body priorities your organs and shafts your nails and hair. Often, poor, brittle nail growth is the first sign of anemia.

The crazy thing is, you may test ‚Äúaverage‚Äù for iron in your blood tests, but still be anemic. My hematologist said that since women have such a hard time keeping iron levels up, our ‚Äúaverage range‚Äù is still depressed and not optimal. So if you‚Äôre hovering around a 12 g/dL and have crappy nails, try to get it up to the high end of average, 15.5 g/dL and see if that improves it. Men, btw, have averages of 13.5-17.5 g/dL. Now, do men‚Äôs organs need more iron than women‚Äôs? Is that an obvious physiological difference between the sexes? No, in fact, because the average woman loses more blood more often than the average man, we should be aiming for those numbers.",1535760213

And market controls are needed for Canadian dairy producers only because the US heavily subsidizes their own dairy producers. It would cost Canadian dairy farmers billions because they don't receive these subsidies. Again, does this seem like a fair bargain? Sure doesn't sound like it.

Right... so when Trudeau went to visit Trump a little while back and agree on a framework and got ambushed by Pence who said that there wasn't going to be any deal without a sunset clause he was just ""trying to make Trump look bad."" Maybe he should have turned around and bent down right there?

&gt;Two of Robertson communication aides, Katie Robb and Sarah Zaharia, left 12th and Cambie in 2017 to join the NDP government.

The problem is that the standard for exemptions such as these are based on genuine belief. I find it doubtful a judge would accept a religious exemption for a person or group of people who are petitioning in this way based on suddenly finding a passage in the Bible that they like. 

On the other hand, if a group of Christians who had a genuine belief in such things came forward and could convince a judge, they would likely get the exemption.

Buffalo soldier got on his Walkie Talkie, dialing it to the right frequency.

‚ÄúBastard Man. Come in.‚Äù He said, approaching a nearby rock formation and ducking behind it.

‚ÄúBastard. Man. Answer me.‚Äù He said, raising his voice.

‚ÄúSOICHI. ANSWER. ME.‚Äù Buffalo yelled, angered at the wimpy bastard and at the stupid technology.

Done with this stupid magic device, Buffalo crushed the walkie talkie in his hand, shoving the shards of plastic and circuitry into his mouth. A nice crunchy snack.

‚ÄúOnce that bastard gits back t‚Äô the bus‚Ä¶ gonna smack him upside the head‚Ä¶‚Äù

Buffalo grabbed Wild Wild West off his back, giving it a little kiss, and readying it.

‚ÄúBut right now‚Ä¶ ‚Äògot me some game to hunt.‚Äù

#Part 0: Rules of Nature

* Wild Wild West has a range of 200m, meaning it can effectively cover the entire map. Map dimensions are 176m by 92m.

* While standing in an oasis, Buffalo Soldier can control the sands in or originating from any oasis Wild Wild West has created. This has been confirmed with the Judges. 


* Wild Wild West, and all of it‚Äôs constructs, have B durability. This includes the trees and the leaves. 

* With 5 Projectiles, Buffalo has anime bullshit level mastery with his sling, slingshot, and Wild Wild West. This includes accuracy, as well as spotting moving targets at distance, judging angles and other factors such as wind resistance. He also can time when his slinged fruit will get to the destination relative to their detonation time.

* It can be assumed for the longer distance plays, the fruits will be flung with either the sling of the the slingshot, unless stated otherwise.

* It can be assumed, unless stated otherwise, that when firing ATs, Buffalo pulls the stem before firing it. If he needs it to explode as soon as it gets to where he‚Äôs shooting it, he will time it and angle the shot using his projectile skill.

* Buffalo can choose whether not a tree produced by WWW bears fruit. It can be assumed that if a tree is not planned by Buffalo to be harvested from, he will choose it not to bear fruit.

*WWW=Wild, Wild West. AT=AT. SITM=SITM. ST=ST.


 #Part 1: Astral Travelling

**‚ÄùHell of a day trip.‚Äù**

A true hunter knows the terrain they hunt in as well as the prey they pursue. It is as important a part of the hunt and any, and deserves the hunter‚Äôs respect. In this case, there‚Äôs not much to work with, but it‚Äôs more than enough for a skilled huntsman. Buffalo will start the match climbing onto the large, T-shaped rock directly next to him. He‚Äôll travel to the top of this rock, creating an oasis in the sides so the tree extends out sideways, linking directly to the next rock. Through this, he can move directly from rock to rock, never needing to return to the ground. If the trees can‚Äôt quite bridge the gap between the rocks, Buffalo will simply jump and climb up the remaining distance. 

Buffalo‚Äôs path will take him along the rocks running down the right side of the road. As he runs, he‚Äôll set up oases ahead of him, turning parts of the rocks into sand so large chunks of them fall down to the bottom, into waiting patches of sand he‚Äôll have also placed there. He‚Äôll create large amounts of ATs, with a slightly lower proportion of SITMs, and finally a comparatively conservative amount of STs. Buffalo will also create oases on top of the rocks, around their edges, but for a different purpose. As he reaches these oases, he‚Äôll throw the sand out of them, effectively creating large, deep pockmarks in the rocks. He‚Äôll take cover in these whenever he‚Äôs taking up position to shoot, and duck into them if he‚Äôs ever in too much danger. He can also create another oasis beneath himself, throwing the sand out and tunneling deeper into the rock, if needs want.

Whenever Buffalo is free, he‚Äôll create oases to his north, whipping up the sand to destroy the rock formations without growing fruit.

Buffalo‚Äôs destination is the large rock directly to the bottom-right of the limousine that the Senator is in (The one shaped like a Z). After all other factors have been deal with, Buffalo will pick off the Senator‚Äôs mosquitos at range, shooting the ill trained dogs that stand between him and his prey. If they take cover behind any rocks, Buffalo can create an oasis to dissolve cover before executing. The first two he will target are the farthest east on the south side of the road, and any who fire upon him will draw his ire.

#Part 2: Tying Up Loose Ends

**‚ÄúSorry, little men. It‚Äôs the law of the jungle.‚Äù**

Hunters are not cruel. They kill what they need to, and nothing more. But the insects crawling around this desert have somehow mustered the gall to interfere in the final battle between a great hunter and his prey. They‚Äôll have to be taught who here, exactly, is the apex predator.

The first of the small fry is Russ Teneo. A good hunting partner, perhaps, on another day. But here, he‚Äôs simply in the way. Russ would be a fool to simply proceed on foot, so it‚Äôs assured he‚Äôll either take one of the vehicles available or transport himself via his Stand. Before beginning any of these strategies, Buffalo will bombard Russ‚Äô general location with a few ATs. This is not intended to damage him as much as gain him the attention of the guards, who‚Äôll likely immediately begin firing on him after this maneuver gains their attention.

**If Russ tries to steal a car:**

The two great metal beasts on either side of Russ are a major threat. The pair slumber for now, but their ears are sharp, and if Russ is able to tame either of them, they may be an issue. The larger beast is within range immediately, and shooting the face of it will produce sand to eat away at the engine, killing the head swiftly. The smaller beast is more problematic. Buffalo doesn‚Äôt have an immediate angle on it, but if he sees it on the move, he‚Äôll shoot in front of the metal creature‚Äôs path and then create trees in its path after covering the windshield as best he can with SITMs. The beast‚Äôs incredible speed will be its undoing as it careens directly into WWW‚Äôs palm trees. Should Russ avoid the trees, Buffalo will fire directly on the car, transforming parts into sand until it becomes completely unusable.  

**If Russ begins moving with his Stand:**

Russ‚Äôs stand allows for much better mobility than his own two legs can offer him. However, it is foolish of a hunter to rely purely on their tools to get the job done. This will be Russ‚Äôs downfall.

Hunters know their prey well, especially their strengths and weaknesses. While Russ may be fleet of foot, he and his Stand are far from tanks. As they travel, Buffalo will fire WWW at the pair, prioritizing Russ, then any arms he‚Äôs travelling with, and finally the main body of the Stand and any stray pairs of arms. If the arms are deflecting Buffalo‚Äôs shots, he‚Äôll change his tactics. ATs will be slathered in SITM to make them difficult to deflect and fired at them, aiming to eliminate Russ and the arms with the C-power explosions. Buffalo will vary the general direction he fires towards, hoping to find a blind spot in Russ‚Äô defenses and score a cheap shot. A single decently-timed AT explosion is all that he needs to eliminate the 2-endurance user. If Russ has survived this onslaught despite the destruction of most, if not all, of his arms, Buffalo will take the final shot with his rifle, bringing Russ‚Äô stand-battling career to a debatably heroic end.",1535760216

So pride plus the hope it would be successful enough I could own it eventually and they were a bunch of investors so didn‚Äôt want to look like a quitter and yep didn‚Äôt want to look homesless. Pride more than anything kept me there and only when I finally broke I got out.

The point that broke me was working on my finances and the office finances it wasn‚Äôt looking good, had some other drama and getting pressure from the investors, it was raining and I drove  my car to Taco Bell all depressed. Got a big steak nacho and a Baja blast and was going to go back lay out my bed watch Netflix on my computer and eat these amazing nachos, I had looked forward to them all day. I parked my car 3/4 miles away at the apartment complex I couldn‚Äôt afford to rent and as I walk towards it the handle on my nachos broke and dumped all over the road. I picked them up threw a handful of nachos across the stress threw my drink at an apartment I was next to and sat down right there and cried. 2 weeks later I swallowed my pride and called my boss and said I failed. Those nachos broke me man, when I realized the only thing I had going for me were those nachos and the rest of my life was hell, my wife and kid lived in LA and I only saw them every other weekend, it wasn‚Äôt worth it.

"NFA","t5_2s7fq","I mentioned some of this in a comment down below, but here's how I do it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I scan the originals and keep an electronic copy safe somewhere outside my house.
2. I put the originals in a folder in my gun safe with my original trust.
3. That's it. They never go anywhere.

Step 3 is something I've gone off about before, but it is one of the biggest pieces of misunderstood lore / legend / FUD / BS around NFA stuff that you ""have to"" carry the stamps, or the trust, or copies of them, around with you when you carry or use the items. Unless your state has specific rules that say otherwise, **YOU DO NOT** have to. The National Firearms Act only requires that you provide proof of registration to ""the Secretary"" (of the Treasury, that power is delegated to the ATF) ""upon request."" It doesn't say when, where, or how, just that you have to provide it if the ATF asks for it.

Now, it might be easier in some circumstances to carry it with you, like if Joe Bob the local cop sees you shooting ""a silencer, and ain't those things illegal?"" or something like that but it's not required and I don't think we should normalize that behavior. Some private ranges also require proof of registration before they'll let you use NFA stuff there and they usually cry about ""we could be liable!"" or something, but they don't check the paperwork of anyone else who walks in the door with a Title I firearm like a Glock, and they could be committing a crime too.",1535760220

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","Might have to do with some steps being required in order to get to the point where you can make that kind of money with combat. Location matters, so does rank, and reputation with the local factions is also important. Assuming you've a ship fit for the job, the first thing you need is a system, and there's no easy way of finding one.

Whatever it is, it needs to have mission boards that offer a decent amount of the right missions to nearby systems, or it needs to have them go to a single system for the overwhelming part. By ""right missions"" I mean ""engage pirate lord whatever"" or ""assassinate pirate lord whatever"" or how the stuff was called. But no missions that take you planetary like ""urgent kill order for terrorist leader X"", as they're not worth the time, and preferably none where the target's a ""traitor"", as those avoid combat - unlike pirates who go after you way more often than they do not.

Your ""target systems"", if there's multiple, should ideally all be close enough together so that you can reach any of them from any of them, or so that you can pass them in a sequence that doesn't include any non-target systems.

E.g.: If Sol is the starting point, when I last was there a week ago assassinations usually went to Wolf 359, Wise 1506+7026, Luhman 16, Barnard's Star and so on. Those systems are mostly close enough to one another that you effectively will never have to jump to a system that isn't Sol or a target system when you're doing a circuit with something like a \~16LY jumprange.

The second thing you need is to get your reputation with the local factions up. It's necessary in order to be able to pick the missions with the highest rewards. Low reputation means low rewards, and while there's no easy way around it short of donations, getting it up is something you do just once. Some combat rank you'll also need, but it's been so long that I wasn't at Elite that I don't remember how much was necessary for some proper money. Shouldn't be that much though, and anything up to and including Master tends to come quick anyway.

Third thing you'll have to do is stack 20 missions of the type. Stacking requires board flipping. That is you pick whatever you're after, then you log out of open/solo, switch to the other mode, check the boards and again pick whatever you're after, and you repeat that step until you've stacked the maximum amount of missions. Depending on your system, station and luck with the RNG, this can take as little as three to five minutes.

And then you start your ""circuit"". E.g. from Sol you'd jump to Luhman 16, then then Barnard's and so on until all you're done. Usually there will be targets ready to interdict you when you jump into a system. And/or they'll try to a few seconds after you drop out at the Nav Beacon. And if there's still any after that, they can also spawn behind you as you're on the way to a target location, again trying to interdict you. And in order to save time, you submit. Sometimes other targets will join a fight like that if there even are any others left in the system, sometimes not.

Any mission that ends up going the ""find contact"" route and doesn't lead to a system you were going to jump to anyway you can abort from the get-go, or if the contact meet-up is on your way, you can do it after the meet-up if the target ends up too far away. Usually one or two missions out of a stack of 20 go that route, and when you abort them the reputation gain from the missions you complete will make up for the loss incurred from the aborted ones. If it doesn't, just pick up a low-$ donation while board flipping if there's any available.

‚Äã

That's basically it, again assuming that you have a ship that can blow up whatever you encounter quickly and efficiently, but you don't really need anything like a specialized loadout or whatever, you don't even need an interdictor, though a KWS can actually earn you a lot of extra money over time. Depending on your targets and your luck with the RNG, it can be as much as \~3+ or so mil. per circuit in addition to the \~15 mil.+ you'll be making from rewards. IMHO the hardest part about it is simply finding a suitable system.",1535760222

"WashedUpRP","t5_muy3n","# [Investigators - Raizen]

After Raizen spoke, Juan and Dragoon ignored him and kept fighting. Sighing, Raizen would give up on trying to talk them down and just ignore them. Unfortunately by ignoring them, Raizen wasn't paying attention when an attack was accidentally redirected his way. Luckily it was just an air blast so it wasn't able to do any real damage though it did blow him away. Raizen sighed, he could have easily come back to the group but he didn't feel like having to deal with Juan and Dragoon's bickering. As such he would yell at everybody as he continued flying through the air.

&gt;**Y'all nubs can continue bickering if ya want. I'm not gonna deal with you wankers anymore so Imma go solo. Team Raizen is blasting off again!**

Raizen continued sailing through the air until he was but a twinkle in the distance. Eventually Raizen began descending and ended up crashing through a window of a house in god knows where. Raizen got up off the ground and dusted himself off unhurt when he heard a loud scream from a half naked woman. Evidently Raizen had crashed into someone's bathroom. Oh bother.

At this point, an old man burst through the door toting a shotgun that he pointed at Raizen as he accused him of trying to peep. Seeing a gun pointed at himself, Raizen would use his devil fruit powers to turn his right hand into a three-tined [claw](http://i699.photobucket.com/albums/vv356/InaineKurosaki/VampireHottie.jpg) that would then turn completely black with haki before swiping it upwards at a speed that a normal person would not be able to see and cutting through the shotgun before morphing his arm back to normal. At this point the gun would finally separate into multiple sections and be rendered useless.

&gt;**Gramps don't jump to conclusions. Do you not see the hole where your window was? I clearly fell here. Don't think I was peeping. Also don't think so highly of yourself lady and think I would be aroused by you. I'm asexual. Now put on some clothes and one of you tell me where I am. Oh right, I'll pay for the busted window.**",1535760222

I'd argue that it's just where the peer pressure is applied that's changed. Whether that's good or bad depends on the subject.

There's also a lack of shame that's developed, which is good in some areas, but shame is an important tool for maintaining civilization as well. Avoiding shame can be a powerful motivator to do the right thing.",1535760225

"CFBAnalysis","t5_2xvqe","I don't mean ""pegging the prices"" necessarily. What I'm suggesting is that right now, the prices are essentially just ""random numbers."" There's no underlying attribute that drives the prices. So, for instance, if Ohio State goes 8-4, but a bunch of Ohio State fans buy the Ohio State stock, the price goes up regardless of the outcomes of their games. 

""Dividends"" based on wins would be one way to create real value. Or, real fantasy value :)

Another way would be to reset the prices every week to whatever you used to set them initially. You said you're using Massey's average ranking, so reseting the prices after the completion of each week would mean that people would actually get rewarded or punished based on whether their teams improved in the Massey aggregate rankings. 

From my understanding, however, right now, a popular team could go 5-7, and so long as the fans of that team continued to buy more of it than other people sold, the stock would continue to go up. ",1535760225

Now honestly I don't think Trump wanted it to be leaked, I could be wrong. I think its more that he really didn't care all that much and  sharing some 'juicy piece of dirt' 'off the record' with a bunch of media reporters, is just a way to stroke his massive ego.

Think about for a while why else do something like this? Either its deliberate because he actually wants it leaked, or its because it makes him feel like 'the man'. I just don't think Trump is the kind of guy who does things like that deliberatly. He just likes to run his mouth without much regard or planning for the conseuqences, just because it makes him feel important.

You are my go to ZFS expert so I have a couple questions.

I use syncoid and I had to cancel a ZFS send earlier today. Is ZFS fully built and equipped to handle this or are there any implications for this? Is there any risk of data corruption at the source or destination at any point of an  interrupted ZFS send? Would any implications be the same if for example you stop the ZFS send right at the beginning versus right near the end?

Most wealthy people don't actually hide their money away, they have it spread out over multiple businesses they are investing in. Almost all of the money they have is being used to make more money, it's active in the economy providing loans to individuals and businesses alike.

In the second case though, I could see how your sister thought it more of a personal gift to her and thus she could spend it how she liked, which would mean time with her gf. Long distance blows and I think it‚Äôs reasonable for alone time to be wanted/expected. However, you‚Äôre the one footing the trip and it‚Äôs clearly a family thing, so family time should also be expected. I think it was very rude of her to blow up at you for that. I guess if this money is literally just pocket change for you, I could see her being resentful that she can‚Äôt just spend the time how she wants as the money is meaningless to you but her time with her gf is everything... but regardless, it‚Äôs still tacky and rude of her and in the end, it‚Äôs your money and kind of you to fly her out so you 100%  have the say in what the trip is for.

"USLPRO","t5_2vnhz","It really comes down to money. PRO was a response to the shoddy officiating in MLS. Basically bring in an experienced Premier League ref and give him control and allow him to run camps and teach refs and assistants. The best PRO refs and assistants work MLS. The lesser ones work USL/NASL. Next year they will add USL D3 and maybe NISA. So you are already starting with guys in the lower divisions who might not be that competent and we know all the complaints about the guys working MLS. So worse versions of them are working USL games. 

More oversight would be helpful but if the pool is thin punishing bad refs isn't going to do much. A U.S. soccer ref isn't exactly a high paying or in demand job. These guys aren't baseball, basketball, or football refs. Obviously a solution would be to pay higher wages to bring in more skilled people. Another would be to import more foreign refs. But we just saw an article from The Athletic that shows the USL barely pays its players poverty wages or gives them health care. The USL can't afford that and MLS isn't going to pick up the entire bill. 

So Edwards is just going to have to stew since the USL clearly cannot afford to go out and hire its own officials. PRO's response is basically give us more time and you will start to see better refs and assistants just like it took time to finally see better and more skilled American domestic players thanks to MLS academies. If you are not in MLS you are going to have to deal with even worse PRO officials. And the ones in MLS are usually hated on. ",1535760236

I completely hear you on the point of how EMDR has become an ""It"" thing to the general public.

When I went to one of my required EMDR consultations during my training, the supervisor training us showed us her ""light bar"" at the end of training, acting like we were getting an inside tour of the Vatican to see the actual Holy Grail on display.  Hell, she wouldn't even let anyone look at the bar pulsing more than 10 passes, because that ""could be damaging"".  Really?

As for Titan Quest on console it has the ability to work fine, it's just they became lazy, or just can't get a grip on what they released. I'm fine with a game having bugs here or there, but when you have a huge amount of playerbase who deem your game unplayable you should either put more resources into fixing the game as opposed to porting more over, or admit that you can't fix the game and condemn it.

That being said, I've enjoyed my experience of the game on my Nintendo Switch, and have been lucky enough to not run into issues 100+ hours in. It just really bums me out that all I have to last me until Diablo 3 comes to the Switch is a half-assed port where I have to force myself not to use mechanics, or restrict myself just because the developers have no reassurance that they care.",1535760239

"Medabot","t5_2uj92","I agree, to an extent. The Medabots anime was to mainly promote the game series of the same name, a game series that almost no English speakers were aware of, made all the more baffling was the web game created to work as a sort of spinoff of the show but did not really bring attention to the game series. And you're right, there's no way of catching the magic of the first season of Medabots. It's almost impossible to catch lightning in a bottle the same way as a time before. Would a Medabots/Medarot (Japanese name for the series) do well in today's environment? I like to think so, will it have the same sort of charm the original had? Most likely not. Would it be fun to see a reimagining of the world that Medabots takes place in? Absolutely. The reboot, if it ever does happen, will likely do something new and different from what was seen before, while still holding onto the core components of the series. So, chances are if a reboot does happen we'll see a newer rendition of Metabee, seeing as he is the supposed to be the mascot of the series, and a Sailor-Multi, the model of Medabot Brass was, with what amount to a different supporting cast. Did the English version of the original have errors? Of course, translating the source material wasn't as capable as it is now, although the renaming of Japanese foods never helps things. Ikki in the original is stated to be a bit of an authority when it comes to his favorite food, Takuyaki, but the English dub called them ""Octopus balls"" and ""Octopus Fritters""

I would love to see Medabots return, but it just doesn't seem likely at the moment. The closet I got to a confirmation was a joke article from this past April Fools' Day, how's that for pathetic?",1535760241

I personally don't get into crafting normally, so it's a nice benefit to be able to have the chance to get mats to sell (or trade) to high tier crafters and also be able to buy gear from them to be able to raid more efficiently.

&gt;It's bullshit because calling them depressed is unfounded, it's bullshit because it puts an unattractive label on the people the person doing the labeling is already doesn't like, and it's bullshit because it gives an easy excuse for failing to connect with them and makes it their fault.

I reckon ""fault"" is the key word here. I don't fault people who look at the great Internet mass of unhappy white boys and think, fuck 'em, we got way more deserving people who need support. I sometimes think that too.

But these people exist nonetheless, and we need to reach out to them, not just because they need help, (and hopefully we're fostering a community that knows them and knows how to help them) but because if we don't they'll fall into some daaaark fucked up holes, the type of holes where far nastier monsters than Jordan Peterson live.

As you've discovered, Luna or the new bun may be very unhappy to smell another rabbit on 'their' human, so try to keep that to a minimum as well. How long have you had the new bun and how long have they each been spayed?

Don't be disheartened, F/F bonds can work. They're just harder and more labour intensive.  ",1535760242

&gt; Traveling Wilburys were a supergroup formed by George Harrison and Jeff Lynne. Initially an informal grouping with Roy Orbison and Tom Petty, they got together at Bob Dylan's studio in Malibu, California, to record an additional track as a B-side for the single release of Harrison's ""This is Love"". The song they came up with was ""Handle with Care"", which the record company immediately realized was too good to be released as a single ""filler"".

&gt; They enjoyed working together so much that they decided to create an album together. Co-written by all the group members, the songwriting and recording were accomplished over a ten-day period at Dave Stewart's house, as Dylan was due to go out on tour. Their first studio album, Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 was released on October 18, 1988. The band members were credited under various pseudonyms, all sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr. The album was immediately dubbed as one of the top 100 albums of all time by Rolling Stone, and was a critical and commercial success, spawning several successful singles and eventually reaching triple-platinum sales status in the US. Additionally, it was nominated for several awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group in 1989.

&gt; The death of Orbison on December 6, 1988 prevented further full collaborations, and the band continued without him. In 1990, they released a second studio album titled Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 3. The intentional misnumbering is attributed to Harrison's sense of humor; additionally, the pseudonyms for all members were changed. The album met with less success than its predecessor, and the group eventually disbanded in 1990, their final released recording being the song ""Nobody's Child"", the title track of a benefit album released to benefit Romanian orphans.

&gt; In 2007, a compilation of both albums was released, entitled The Traveling Wilburys Collection. As well as both of the original albums, the release included  bonus tracks and music videos; additionally, previously uncredited session drummer Jim Keltner, who appeared in some of the group's music videos, was listed as a member of the group, as was Dhani Harrison, the son of George who had assisted in some parts of the overdubbing of the previously unreleased material.

**Bio:** A State Alchemist of Amestris, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, also known as the Strong Arm Alchemist, is a passionate and powerful fighter and a staunch defender of the innocent. He takes immense pride in his incredible physical condition, often removing his clothes and flexing to show his passion for something, and can find a fast friend in anyone willing to match his massive musculature. Armstrong is a very passionate person who feels most emotions turned up to eleven, and his extreme pride in his lineage makes him a loud and dominant personality in any room.

**Research:** There's like 3 versions of Fullmetal Alchemist- Fullmetal Alchemist the manga; Fullmetal Alchemist, the anime from 2003; and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the anime from 2009. Depending on your reading speed, the manga is probably fastest, but iirc Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the most well-liked adaptation of the series.

"BeachCity","t5_3c6zb","Absolutely! Steven Universe is a great show with interesting characters, plot, and arcs. The first half of the first season is a bit boring, though, as it‚Äôs 90% filler. It gets good when the first ‚ÄúVillain‚Äù (Lapis Lazuli) appears, and you‚Äôll get real into it when the first major arc is done. Basically don‚Äôt judge the show by season 1, and the show gets better and better each season. 
The characters are interesting and colourful, and they all have flaws and strengths - no one is perfect. The villains even have loads of character development. Nothing is rushed, and the plot is easy to follow. Most character‚Äôs ambitions and determination are explained, and you can end up feeling sorry for the villains, the side characters, everyone!
apart from ronaldo, ronaldo sucks. 
Everyone gets a character episode or even arc, apart from 5 second villains (which don‚Äôt show up often). 
There‚Äôs also a LOT of foreshadowing, so when you rewatch the show (because it‚Äôs that good) there‚Äôll be many times when you go ‚ÄúOOOHHHHH, THAT WAS FORSHADOWING!‚Äù It‚Äôs really clever and thought out and you can see how much build up there is to the major events, and that makes you appreciate it more. 
There‚Äôs also loads of representation in the show. The main heroes and villains are female (apart from Steven), there‚Äôs a black love interest, non-binary characters, lgbt+ relationships, few people have the ‚Äúhourglass, perfect‚Äù body type, masculine girls, feminine boys. It also deals with subjects like depression and anxiety, as well as relationships. 
This show is just really good and some episodes are silly and goofy and others are serious and dark. It gets darker as the series continues but it doesn‚Äôt feel like the transition is a sudden drop off a cliff, and there are still happy moments. 
By the way, there is a lot
And I mean a LOT
Of singing and crying. 
I didn‚Äôt think I would be into that kind of stuff, but it‚Äôs done so well in the show so it feels more like a part of the show itself instead of an overused transition.

However, I want to clarify that I wasn't trying to insinuate that playing instruments is easy. I'm well aware that it sucks to begin an instrument for just about everybody. The attitude of self-deprecation and hopeless inability just rubs me the wrong way. If somebody wants to do something, they need to know that it just takes practice to achieve it. 

It's not just extremely difficult for ""some of us,"" it's difficult for ALL of us. All the time. Every time a musician, no matter how seasoned or virtuosic, plays their instrument, it's a ridiculous triumph against the incredible and always-present adversity from their body, their muscles, their brain, and the chaotic and imperfect world we live in. No musician has anything by virtue of being a musician that ""non-musicians"" don't have. It's not easy for them. It's hard. Every time. They might have a big ego, might tell other non-players ""how easy it is,"" but they're wrong. 

So, I mostly stand by my comment, but I'll adapt it a little, because I understand where you're coming from: GOOD musicians hate when people say [they can't do what they do], because it's so far from the truth; BAD musicians may in fact enjoy when somebody tells them they could never do what they do, because it makes them feel special.

The industry-standard was to be playing on monitors with 144hrz but the venue only provided 60hz display. This went against industry rules and made a small uproar in the community and the among the players.

Can you imagine if everyone was playing mouse and keyboard and all of a sudden one else shows up who has a special controller with social buttons and software? There isnt  really enough info to Guage what he's using is actually providing an advantage or disadvantage.

2. Theoretically yes, there will be a break-even point, but in a practical sense it will never be safer to not vaccinate because you can never know for sure who is vaccinated and who is not (or who *can not be*) vaccinated.  Until such a time as we can each have perfect knowledge of who is vaccinated and cannot be a possible carrier of a given disease, it's impossible for an individual in the world to know who is vaccinated and who is not.

3.  This mindset, when scaled, would basically ensure that the disease is never eradicated and that we always hover near this so-called ""break-even point"".  We hit that point, parents stop vaccinating and we dip below the break-even point, parents start vaccinating and we hit it again, etc.  The safest option is to vaccinate until the disease is eradicated.",1535760251

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","You could as some advise, try to put your head up your ass (again) or you could dive head on into this rabbit hole, this shit is deep and this kind of traveling can't be bought, or instragrammed, for that matter.

We could start with those feelings of you, you mention depressing and go straight to the pointlessness. **I am not trying to play shrink or anything here, trying to get to the point somehow.**
Lets explore feelings, what was the point from the beginning? getting a degree so you could get a job so you could sit in a cubicle for 8-9-10-11-12 hours a day, finding someone of the opposite sex who you could marry and ""start a family"" with in your suburban home from which you have to drive to work and get stuck in traffic for an hour each day?
Now, we usually joke about this, ""Love and Marrige"" the theme for ""Married with children"", shit like that. But there is levels in this, thought-boundaries which can't be crossed that easily.
Ok cut, to the chase: What if almost everyone is bat shit, totally insane? It looks like this planet is totally fucked because of us and almost everyone is only talking about shit like some fucking new series on Netflix.
To me it looks like no one has even a remote clue about what's going down on this planet. The whole dream about the next generation being better off than the last is becoming a nightmare. For how long has that even been the case? I mean, first there was always the same for each generation and then there was even worse for the next generation going into agriculture, then there was as bad for each coming generation (or as good, if you were one of the elites) and then we had some technological breakthroughs which we tell ourselves made our life to much better than everyone who came before us. 

Another angle, in Sweden we just added a year to mandatory school-years making it 10 years. And what we've always been told adults as kids is that we should be grateful to be in school. What if the only reason we go to school is because this culture needs us to? what if mandatory school is sprung out of a culture where everybody had a lot of children because they were workers, and our culture needs workers.

But a even more insane thought is: What if no one has control over this? I mean, what if this is a culture running in our minds, without any purpose. A culture without feelings, trying new meme-code on the fly just as DNA is. This culture will keep evolving and if looked as a tree of life, parts will and have been going extinct even since culture first came into existence.
So, can this culture be stopped? all attempts seems futile and so far from the root of the actual problem, almost as a charade played by culture itself. We get used and abused, even if you are born with the right genes for it, it takes a lot to be a herder, one of the elites. Let's step back once again.
What if the elites are no less cultural programmed? what if their values and feelings are just cultural? It sure makes fixing this mess a great deal harder. Our culture is a beast which will destroy anyone who tries to defeat it. It will code and spread memes for defense from any attack, like a mycelium coding new genes in real time when it encounters an attacker. 

So, where were I, skipping to a tldr:
Our culture is fucking whicked and it is speeding up but we've aint seen nothing yet. Really bizarre shit is in the pipe already. Let go of the fence and join the side of the real 0.001% because the rest will still have no clue about what the f is going on. ",1535760251

"DebateACatholic","t5_2teju","&gt; No, I don't agree with you. Good concepts don't cease to be if spoken by bad persons. And I disagree about the number, as I'm absolutely sure there's no ""vast majority"" of bad people inside the Church, and it's in stark contrast with the ""innocent until proven guilty"" principle. Your mentality is perfidious to say the least.

We can talk about my perfidious mentality, or whether or not the numbers of rapists in the clergy warrant the designation ""vast"" so long as you're agreed that I'm right so far: there is no good reason to believe your priests claims about religion. You see, we can talk about all these other subjects after we settle the OP.

&gt; There are about 420,000 priests around the world. Since 2004, the Vatican had defrocked 848 priests and sanctioned another 2,572 to lesser penalties, e.g. about 3,420, about 0.8%. The current pedophile percentage standard estimate is 1-5% of the adult population (worldwide). So the percentage of pedophiles in Church seems to be less the estimate. Let's suppose the same amount in priesthood waiting to get caught is 6 times bigger: 4.8%, still less than the upper estimate. That alone proves your argument is bogus, and I didn't touch any dogma yet.

&gt;You may disagree with what the Church preaches. It's your right. But using fallacies to undermine the Church only says about yourself.

I hear you saying ""priests rape children about as much as the general population so your argument is wrong because that means priests are just about as trustworthy and moral as the general population.""

OK, so you are willing to believe the religious claims of ...anyone? Everyone believes contradictory things, and the vast majority is not now and has never been Catholic...so if priests' opinions are no more trustworthy than anyone else's...why aren't you a Muslim or a protestant or a Buddhist?

Besides that, it's not just about the rape: it's about the systematic, coordinating, premeditated, LIES propagated by your clergy going all the way to the top. Right now your boy Donald Wuerl is slithering away to hide in the Vatican, just like that scumbag Law and the other scumbag Pell.

They're HIDING from justice, sneaking away because they KNOW they're guilty. Your pope is shielding them, he is covering and lying for them.

Why should anyone care what they have to say about religion?",1535760254

In actuality, I find the questions tend to confuse parents because they are referred for a specific reason (‚ÄúMy doctor said we should start EI because she‚Äôs 2 and doesn‚Äôt talk). They usually think we‚Äôre idiots for asking. 

I usually try to get some information to build up an informal sensory profile, like if they have any obvious aversions to textures, bathing, having their hair combed, frolic play (vestibular/proprioceptive), or issues with eating. Picky eating is a huge one in this age group.

&gt;My point is you can print out your own Passport Photo, get a passport, and then go to the DMV and use that to get your license and if having your picture taken/printed elsewhere is good and secure enough for US State Department why is it not good enough for you and the DMV? They don't seem very worried about it. Because of this do you feel that passports should not be accepted as valid forms of ID when voting? 

Ah, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, that's fine, but it still would need to be delivered in person.

&gt;Er, do you want a Voter ID law or a Driver's License Required to Vote law? Plenty of legal voting citizens do not and can not drive and have other forms of valid, legal ID. 

Just a state issued ID that ensures that you're a citizen is fine by me.

&gt;Furthermore, what specific law states that only citizens can get driver's licenses? 

http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/states-offering-driver-s-licenses-to-immigrants.aspx

&gt;Should legal immigrants and legal temporary residents not be allowed to get driver's licenses?

Yes, they should be allowed, as the law stipulates.

That literally is true.

That's not bigotry and I'm not insulting anyone. Check your artificial outrage.

No they fucking don't. Especially in this case where the result came from an accidental lack of communication with the ""rule"".

That article is literally from 2015 and does not cite anything more than an observation from before the 1990's, in fact only 3 of the 20 references are pre-21st century so if you want to show me an original source from half a century ago, then do so. Otherwise check your words before you spout falsehoods and absolute lies.

To expand on that article, it states *According to the simple scenario, the presence or absence of a Y chromosome is what counts: with it, you are male, and without it, you are female*. They rest goes on to describe the various exceptions that come about from accidental mixing in the early stages of pregnancy. Any spot on the spectrum between absolute sexes comes about from a mistaken process in the complex birth process. That does not create new sex identities in between, it mutates individuals from the default.

You are blatantly wrong, I'm not in the least bit surprised. How do you think evolution works? Almost every single trait is copied verbatim from parent's genes and over long periods of time the exceptions to those copies (mutations) occasional act beneficially but almost always do not and result in the discontinuation of that lineage. Just like I stated before. It's funny that your response is a version of what I statement but worded differently, contradicting your first statement that every single trait is accidental, because they're not at all accidental after the first occurrence.

If you want to continue patting yourself on the back for twisting facts, don't do so publicly where you cannot provide logical or honest references. In the mean time I'll just assume that you're aware that M to F trans people are objectively biologically different from women, the only relevant thing to my question which you have completely avoided addressing, let alone answering for an entire argument.

That's a real interesting thing considering I've explicitly pointed out for the last two comments that despite your falsehoods, that original question is all I'm actually here to inquire about.

Welding involves some potential irritants for your eyes, mainly UV (""flash""), particulates, and eyestrain.

Contacts also tend to exacerbate eye irritation issues, as well as potentially trapping dirt and grit against your cornea and preventing normal tear action from washing them out. Some (most?) contacts do provide some protection from UV though.

So, if you are particularly sensitive you may want to get prescription safety glasses, but if you're generally comfortable in your contacts, you should be fine to keep wearing them. Just follow good practices- never touch your eyes with dirty hands, keep your contacts clean and replace them on schedule, make sure to keep dust and garbage out of your eyes, and take breaks every so often to avoid eyestrain (20/20/20 is recommended- every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.)",1535760258

**Series:** One Piece

**Tier:** Spidey

**Respect Threads:** https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3reyge/respect_nico_robin_one_piece/

**Bio:** Nico Robin is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. She was born on the island of Ohara, an island renowned for its historical research and scholars. Due to searching for information that the World Government didn't want anyone finding, the government burned her island to the ground, and the knowledge she held left her on the run from the age of eight. She would spend the next 20 years of her life on the run from the government until she found herself as the second in command of Crocodile's organization Baroque Works. After the organization's defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates, with no where else left to go Robin essentially forced herself on the rest of the crew.

Robin's Devil Fruit ability is the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower-Flower Fruit), which allows Robin to grow copies of her body on any other surface instantly. This doesn't sound like much... until she grows a bunch of arms all over someone's body and uses them to pin the person's limbs in place and snap their back in half. Not limited to just arms and feet, Robin can grow any amount of any part of her body anywhere, letting her put eyes on walls, chain arms like ropes, or even combine multiple copies of a limb into complex shapes like crude wings or giant versions of those limbs. She can easily create over a hundred limbs at one time, meaning the limits of her power are really only her imagination.

**Research:** One Piece is long as fuck, but it's super good. Honestly as long as you read the very first (super short) arc to understand the world and the gist of Devil Fruits, you can go right to the Alabasta arc where Robin first shows up.

TBH though plenty of people on the server read One Piece, just ask us to explain stuff if you really don't wanna read shit.

#Part 2.5: I‚Äôm a Frayed Knot, A Loose End.

**‚ÄùStubborn. I like that.‚Äù**

In the initial section, we covered how our fellow hunter‚Äôs means of travel will be hindered. However, if he manages to overcome these moves, we have alternate means. 


**If Russ goes to pursue Destiny Showdown:** 

Buffalo will freely allow him. He‚Äôll be shown his place promptly, but right now, Buffalo has bigger game right in front of him. 

**If Russ pursues the Senator:**

Buffalo will not allow the other hunter to nab his prize. He will prioritize taking out Russ before he can even get close to the Senator. He‚Äôll spend the match closely observing Russ in case he makes a move, even if he seems to be moving towards Destiny Showdown.

Firstly, Buffalo will grab some ATs, and some SITMs. He will slather the ATs on one side with the sticky substance, setting them to the side for later use.

Now, any arms seem heading towards the car holding the senator will be swiftly taken care of. They will be shot at with WWW; they may be small targets, but Buffalo‚Äôs mastery of marksmanship makes eliminating the stray arms like hitting the side of a barn. Arms closest to the car will be prioritized if any are seen heading there, but all stray arms will be destroyed with prejudice at the earliest opportunity. 

An alternative scenario is that all the arms are sticking close to Russ to protect him from any possible shots, or that the arms are travelling in groups to increase the likelihood one will make it over.

In a case like this, the sticky ATs will be utilized. Holding the non-sticky side, Buffalo will fire the ATs at the group of arms/Russ, sticky side first. The timer on ATs is short enough that the arms/Russ shouldn‚Äôt even have time to throw them back, but if they somehow do it fast enough, they‚Äôll find that the AT sticks to their hands, effectively doing them in.

Additionally, there are many things around that Russ could attach his arms to. Namely, Russ could attach his arms to guards and use their guns against us, other guards, or even the senator. Only a coward uses another hunter‚Äôs weapon to bag their prey, and they will be dealt with accordingly.

If arms are seen heading towards guards, or if any guards are seen with an extra set of arms, they will be promptly shot at with WWW, ATs will be utilized as well if needed, especially if several guards are controlled. They will be stuck to the guards with SITMs to ensure they are cleanly eliminated. Russ and his stand must not be able to get their hands on a gun, and it will be prioritized that this not happen.

**If Russ pursues Us:** 

Prey making a move against it‚Äôs own predator! Foolish, but respectable. But a hunter is a hunter nonetheless, and must be dispatched with care. 

There is a considerable distance between us and Russ, plus a lot of open area for him to cover exposed to WWW. At this point, there‚Äôs a number of modes of transport he could be taking to pursue us if he‚Äôs made it this far.

If he tries to drive at us, either with himself at the wheel or using his stand arms to send a vehicle,  we take out the engine of the car using WWW and its matter destroying sand (or spring a tree in front of it to cause a collision) and then shoot the user as he tries to escape. 

If he uses his stand arms to spring at us, we snipe the user mid jump. The stand body can‚Äôt traverse far from the user, and the arms weaken the further away they go, so shooting at the swarming arms with Buffalo‚Äôs rifle can defeat the invaders and hurt Russ in the process. Buffalo has worked with a stand user who moves inanimate objects to attack, so he knows to be on the lookout for things moving at him when they shouldn‚Äôt. He will snipe the object to produce an oasis that eats the item, and then shoot at the connected arms. 

If Russ comes for Buffalo directly, he‚Äôll use the same sort of strategy he uses in Part 3, creating an oasis for the storm and using all the fruit at his disposal. If the gap between the two is ever closed by arms, Buffalo will stick briefly cooked ATs to the enemy and dive away as quickly as possible.

After Russ‚Äô elimination, the only thing left between Buffalo and his prey are the guards. Individually, they are obviously no match for Buffalo, but hubris is a hunter‚Äôs downfall. Buffalo will take up a sniping position on the Z-shaped rock, taking cover in an oasis foxholes, and fire an AT off into the distance, directly away from him. While the guards are distracted, Buffalo needs to work fast. He‚Äôll start by taking out the two guards below the limo, aiming for their vitals with WWW‚Äôs shots. He‚Äôll turn the sides of the vans into sand, hurling the sand away from the vans and opening the gas tanks to the air, then creating massive explosions by igniting the fuel of the vans with more ATs. Buffalo will use the chaos to his advantage, picking off the remaining guards with WWW. If he begins to get fired upon, he‚Äôll duck into his foxhole and bombard the area with ATs. Buffalo will also surround his perch with SITMs and STs quickly after the explosion, making sure any guards that try to close the distance will be stopped far short of their destination, and dispatch them with a well-placed shot shortly after they are caught.

#Part 3:Bagging the Mark

**‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù**

At long last, Buffalo is face-to-face with his target. There are two ways Buffalo will proceed:One if he has Randall to himself, and another if Russ is present or immediately threatening the senator. 


If Russ and the guards are already out of the picture, Buffalo can finally bring the senator down. He‚Äôll start by sticking the doors of Randall‚Äôs limousine shut with SITMs and the roots of STs. After the vehicle has been secured as much as possible, Buffalo will transform the windows into sand, throwing it to the side with his sand moving ability to avoid corroding the doors of the car. Buffalo‚Äôs hunted a variety of prey, but he‚Äôs never met one that decides to trap itself for him. 

Now that Buffalo has a sightline into the limousine, he‚Äôll open fire with everything he has. He‚Äôll attempt to stick down and restrain Deep Purple with SITMs, removing it‚Äôs ability to protect Randall. Buffalo will then attempt to eliminate the senator by filling the car up with ATs, held briefly before being fired to ‚Äúcook‚Äù them so they explode as soon as they make it into the vehicle. This will prevent the senator or Deep Purple from disposing of the ATs. Buffalo will continue to fire ATs until he runs out, or until the senator is eliminated. In the event of the former, he‚Äôll simply start firing with WWW, aiming to kill the senator or cause the limousine to explode.


If Russ ever nears the limousine at the same time as, or even before Buffalo, on foot, he‚Äôll create a an oasis, and then sandstorm, in the surrounding area, blocking Russ‚Äô visibility. Before allowing the sandstorm to subside, the area between Russ and the limousine will be covered with almost all of the STs and SITMs he has available, letting the sand settle on top of the traps to trick Russ into walking right into them. Any remaining guards will definitely begin to attack Russ, and Buffalo will assist by firing sticky ATs and shooting at Russ. Buffalo will also try to secure the limo as above, but will also create a very small sand-hole in the windows through which he can fire SITMs to secure the opposite doors.

If Russ begins to near the limousine in a car, Buffalo will block his pathwith trees, and attempt to shoot Russ through the windshield. He‚Äôll also attempt to render the car inoperable by shooting vital parts into sand.",1535760260
"GodofWar","t5_2ts07","Haha cheers. I would recommend you try out Immersive Mode atleast once. Really makes you appreciate the game's art style and attention to details. Once you've adapted to no visible HUD, you'll fight twice as hard and be able to read all the subtle cues the game offers you in the form of visual and audio signs. 

For example, let's say you're fighting a purple levelled enemy on GMGOW. If you had HUD on, you'd probably be intimidated by his huge healthy pool or get really greedy and get one shot when he's close to death as denoted by his low healthy bar. On immersive mode, you don't get that. You don't know if this enemy is higher levelled than you or not and you won't stop hitting him or change your tactics according to the health bar because you won't see it at all. You'll always have to fight at your level best until that foe is defeated. 

It's these kind of visceral experiences that really made me appreciate Immersive Mode even more. ",1535760260

It‚Äôs a messed up priority, but at that point in the show Walt‚Äôs money is the most important thing to him - knowing his effort and what he went through would mean something tangible.

Also, I disagree about Jesse. Walt couldn‚Äôt believe Jesse was a rat. Walt called him family all the way up to the point where Jesse bailed on their face to face meeting at the plaza. After that, his decision to call out the hit on Jesse was one that actually pained him.

For me the worst episode is Fly. I know it has a ton of symbolism and it was (like the rest of the show) executed well, but it felt like too much of a slowdown.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","India was a net ship exporting nation before the British came. One of the first industries that was destroyed.

It was also the world's largest textile exporting nation. The Indian textile industry was systematically destroyed - Bengali weavers were a threat to British industry, so their fingers were chopped off and their looms were destroyed. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/britain-took-more-out-of-india](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/britain-took-more-out-of-india)

This happened before industrialization in textiles took place. While looms were in the process of industrialization, the british taxes locally made clothes was taxed at 60%, while clothes imported from Manchester was taxed at 20%.

These economic incentives, enforced by the barrel of a gun, forced Indians to vacate value added professions (and textiles was a major value added industry until the mid 20th century) and regress to providing the cheapest raw materials in the form of cotton, which would be processed in england and sold back to the Indians.

Do you realize the ocean of difference between a) every single person ""deserves"" to have enough to survive and b) murder old people in nursing homes? What is it with the left and this habitual dishonesty? Nowhere did I ever even come close to implying that.

&gt;if a nurses labour, someone who literally works on average 50-70 hours a week and is constantly on call with the sole job of saving peoples fucking lives doesnt get paid enough to eat then something is very wrong. food stamps are not fucking generous. you get like 100 extra bucks max to spend on extremely limited produce. dont you think someone who spends the majority of their life working to save lives deserves a little bit more than tinned soup and bread to live off ?

Show me what nurse works 70 hours a week and doesn't have enough money to eat.

&gt;it proves fucking everything that is wrong with the world and it proves how completely fucked in the head you must be to not understand literally anything ive just said. you asked for an example and I gave you one. its an employers duty to pay a liveable fucking wage. greedy slimy capitalists shouldnt just be exempt because ""hey well the government can give them food stamps so i can pay them less !"" and thats just one fucking example out of the many industries that do this.

I don't think you understand what we're talking about. We're talking about people being compensated for what their labor is worth. Some people don't have that much to offer. That's just a fact. Nowhere did I say society shouldn't try to help people who can't help themselves. What I won't do is LIE about why somebody can't help themselves. I'm not going to pretend that literally every person in the country is providing enough value to warrant whatever arbitrary standard of living you have in your mind. It's just not reality.

&gt;no, not wrong. you cannot just outright literal facts that have been established as fact over and over again ad fucking nauseum based on your personal beliefs. or maybe its conservative propaganda. either way youre about as wrong as any person is physically capable of being.

What facts? You've not stated a single fact.

&gt;what third world countries exactly ? china ? the only capitalist property in china is the omnipresent exploitation of basically the entire population.

Actually yeah the success in China has only happened following Deng Xiaoping's market reforms in the 80s. Their relative movement away from socialism is what has lead to their relative success.

&gt;what do you want me to show you ? ive showed you that nurses are heinously underpaid. ive showed you that the third world is like ...... you know the fucking third world where uhhhhhh just about every single person is still suffering from the effects of colonialism and capitalist infiltration. do you want me to provide you a specific example like steve working 70 hours for that bonus but his boss said he didnt meet some arbitrary condition so he doesnt get it ? i dont understand ?

You haven't shown any of that. You are barely forming coherent sentences. Show me how nurses are ""heinously underpaid."" See if you can do it without going off on an emotional rant. Show me how you're defining ""underpaid"" and then show that they are in fact underpaid.

&gt;the worth of a person is infinitely more valuable than the worth of their labour.

The confusion on this topic between the left and the right is entirely due to your unwillingness to be reasonable and think clearly. Conservatives are not against helping people, in fact they're more charitable than liberals. What we're not willing to do is lie. So I'm all for helping people who can't help themselves, but I'm not going to let you lie about why they can't help themselves. It's not the boss' fault. It's not conservative's fault. People are paid based on what they provide.",1535760265

The word gaming gets thrown around left right and centre to sell basic hardware (generally) to make a product look better than it actually is.

Honestly, it doesn't have to have the word gaming in it to be specifically for gaming. If the hardware is more than capable, and it doesn't have the word gaming in it you're honestly fine.

My opinion? Ignore gaming specific hardware because you're more than likely going to be getting ripped off because of a current marketing trend.

You have every other day to be happy together  I think you could have it right but I don't think you necessarily have to scrap it although it might be wise to do that for one year. But I would suggest one of the two options below. 

1) make it clear that you don't give a fuck and on your birthday you just want to relax and spend time with her like any other day. It sounds like she might be a somehwat preoccupied person and just feels bad that she wasn't aware enough to be prepared and then handled it incorrectly in the moment (every year). I would guess that her birthdays are important to her but I could be wrong? (And doesn't actually matter - it just wouldn't surprise me that she would feel bad because she would be upset if you did it to her) 

2) scrap your birthday for when it is but maybe a couple weeks before or after tell her spontaneously you just want to go out for dinner just that night. You sprung it on her so she doesn't need to feel bad about not getting shit together ahead of time and then you can just have a good time together which it sounds like is all you really care about. 

3) scrap it all together or just have a movie nighr or something. It sounds like the issue really doesn't have to do with your birthday itself and I think doing anything to break the cycle is just the logical thing to do , especially considering the are clearly expectations now that things won't go well on that day ",1535760267

[The default brushes in Krita 4.x are described here](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/krita_4_preset_bundle.html) and there are two kinds of blending brushes in the default brushes bundle: those who color the surface too (""Wet painting"" brushes) and those who just blends what is on the canvas already (""Blender"" brushes). (In Krita you can of course have a mixture of this, but you'd need a little more knowledge about brush engines; you can learn it of course, [Krita Manual](https://docs.krita.org) is a great resource and playing with brushes is fun).

Also if you do a lot of lineart, learn how to use [Colorise Masks](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/colorize_mask.html) or G'MIC filters that colorize the lineart for you, it'll save you some time.

Kill the openvpn **server** but leave the client running on your machine. You shouldn't be able to get to the internet, and pinging an host shouldn't even resolve its IP address.

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","Yeah I'm aware that I'm in yet another post made by an arm chair game critique who thinks he's more imaginative than the people working on this game. I've seen countless posts like these and my opinion remains the same. If you genuinely think the game is a ""boring solo grind"" then this game is simply not for you. Fucking stop trying to force games to appeal to you, just find something else to do. No, the game wont die even if a bunch of whiners stop playing forever. 

First of all, there are many people like myself who will keep playing this game. There are plenty of people like myself who just want a good space ship flying experience, we're just not as vocal as the whiners ( on reddit ). The forums, where the true fans of the game reside, tell an entirely different story. The ""forum dads"" are going to keep playing this game because they enjoy it as it is. 

Second, this game does NOT cost that much to run for FDEV. You are misinformed about this game and how it works. If the servers cost that much to run ( which they don't ) the game would be monthly subscription based just like most MMOs out there. The most data hungry interactions are P2P and impose no server costs to FDEV. The only thing we communicate to a server for are BGS related stuff, exploration discoveries, mission transactions... There are no data hungry real time communications between us and FDEV servers, which is why when something goes bad the game only crashes when you exit or enter supercruise or try to click on a mission in the game menu.

Even when the servers go offline, which they eventually will, I'm pretty much convinced that FDEV are going to release dedicated server programs and a true offline mode for people to keep playing the game. Once they stop caring about handling the rules of the universe of Elite Dangerous they would have nothing to lose by letting players build their own dedicated servers with their own rules. I honestly doubt I'll ever lose my ability to play this game just because a bunch of whiners stop playing. ",1535760275

Personally not a fan of the system at all since if you feel scared to even be open to having your main shown (or at least prior main), then it just shows how horrid some of the community is when it comes to hero choice. If you main whatever hero, I don't give a damn as long as you either are good with it; and or what ever you are newly maining isn't completely bad compared to someone else who may be a direct main of that hero, or you just generally are able to play that hero without being a detriment to the team.

People who call anyone out on their main or kick due to them playing another hero (Which they might have just slightly less time on than their main) is just disgusting. If you're playing healer in a group; and main DPS/Tank. As long as you are able to play healers the other healer can't; or are just able to play healer in general. Then I don't see the reason why you should be kicked.

If at minimum, your team should *always* be able to see your profile if not the enemy imo.

If it is, I'd like to tell you this; you absolutely can overcome it, and posting it on here is the first step in doing so. How is your relationship with yourself? Do you feel like you have self love, a healthy sense of self worth and understanding that you deserve good things?

Often times, it's the lack of those things that lead to self destructive tendencies and inability to accept help from others.

You're self aware enough to know that you engage in self destructive behavior and have negative feelings towards people who are nice to you. That kind of self awareness is great. You can use it in a more compassionate way in order to understand the ""why"" behind your actions and feelings.

When you do these things, don't be hard on yourself about it. Instead, practice compassion and direct it towards yourself in that moment. Tell yourself that you are deserving of good things, from yourself and from others. Work on cultivating self love so you can take the necessary steps in order to help yourself and actively make good choices that benefit you.

Working on self love and self worth as well as truly understanding and believing that you are worthy of love, kindness, respect and help from yourself and others will also lead to you doing more for you, and be accepting when others offer that to you as well.

I don't want to assume that you don't have self love or a healthy self image &amp; self esteem; However, things like destructive patterns of behavior despite being aware that it's not good for you, not doing things for you, and not accepting help/kindness from others are signs of that. Thus, I have posted what I did above in hopes that it can help you, as well as the others that may see this post and resonate with it.

America is founded on dirty white people killing off natives with disgusting diseases. Europeans tended to think washing was either devil worship or unmanly. 

What really caused the increase in life expectancy was a combination of better birth procedures (women would often die in childbirth) and vaccinations.

Do you have any idea of the THC content of the bud that this trim came from? After a quick Google it seems to be suggested that it'll be around the same THC % as bud minus 5-10%. 

So if the bud was 20% THC content the trim should be 10%-15% (I don't really like using the word should here but it will have to do as cooking with trim is new to me)

Let's low ball it and say your trim is 10% THC, 9g trim = 900mg THC assuming 100% extraction efficiency, giving you up to 45mg per cookie. 

So from the above it *should* work out OK, however no one can tell you for sure as your THC content in the trim could be anywhere from 1% up.  ",1535760278

My landlord is registered with Zelle as well and they market it as instantaneous. I've sent money to that account from my Chase account and it got there within minutes. I switched to Ally because they have a higher daily limit so I don't have to split up my rent payment. 

With Ally they don't tell you is that there are a few different transfer speeds. Even if both accounts are registered with Zelle, the transfer speed will be selected automatically based on ""several factors"" (their words) and can't be changed manually (so they say). They didn't really explain what those factors were. I understand it being slow with the first large transaction as a security measure. Standard speed is 1-3 business days but my payments so far have taken longer. I also get no notification if the payment was received (or not, as the case may be) until the next business day. So if my payment was declined in some way I wouldn't know about it until it was considered late by my lease terms. I've started scheduling my rent payments one business week in advance to try to get it there on time but it's a craps shoot really. 

I would just appreciate more disclosure about their terms of Zelle and better customer service. As always: YMMV.",1535760280

"pytorch","t5_3gbwg","You should use Conv2d.

Conv2d is NCHW:

  - N for batch size
  - C for color/feature channels
  - H for Height
  - W for Width

Conv3d is NCDHW or NCTHW

D for depth i.e. 3D color images
Or T for time i.e. 2D videos

Your convolutional filters work on channel.

Initially it's always the number of colors in your image  for greyscale or 3 for RGB. Then as you go deeper you get more and more channels (and they don't correspond to colors) but imagine it's the way for the CNN to interpret the image beyond ""color"" information.

I don't know if that can help but look into this MNIST / digit recognizer example: https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/blob/de678ac12c2c3d3de3ec580cb7ecadcb11ea4b4c/examples/ex02_handwritten_digits_recognition.nim#L35. I've written this framework from scratch in a Python-like language called Nim, taking (hopefully) Pytorch and Keras best features:

Input size is [minibatch size, 1, 28, 28], 1 is the number of colors.

But then we apply a [20, 5, 5] convolution that means that after the new size will be [minibatch size, 20, _, _].

_ because there is a formula that explains how 5x5 convolution kernels reduce the Height x Width sizes from 28x28 to 24x24.

If you're curious it's:
`H_out = (H_in + (2*padding.height) - kernel.height) / stride.height + 1`

and

`W_out = (W_in + (2*padding.width) - kernel.width) / stride.width + 1`",1535760281

If you want an *open* diary for other people to read and discover, I agree with fattmattk that Wordpress is probably your best bet. I use [Wordpress.com](https://Wordpress.com), and it's fine, but Latex support is incredibly limited. If you use proper wordpress software (like I believe Terry Tao does for his blog), you have more options with typesetting.

&amp;#x200B;

If all you want is a personal diary of sorts that you can *direct* people to, something on Github would work well. This would allow you to type whatever you want in Latex, and upload pdf's or whatever else as you go along.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want something personal for nobody else really, but you want it to be online, you could just use documents on Overleaf/ShareLatex (which is combined now.)

What needs to be done is a massive block nerf and make lights and heavies slightly faster. If you block for too long or if you block consecuatively, you should suffer a consequence. Blocking is way too easy and riskless to do. Then, when you nerf blocking, make 50/50's only able to be done after the end or the middle of a combo or a certain move, like warden would not be able to bash from neutral but after landing 2 lights he'll be able to initate a powerful 50/50, rewarding the warden for landing two hits.",1535760285

"lawofattraction","t5_2rfq0","\*Why am I not receiving what it is I have asked for?\*

Because the Law of Attraction doesn't necessarily give us what we are asking for, it gives us what we are a \*vibrational match to\*, whether we want it or not, whether we are asking for it or not.  It's not called the Law of Ask so the Universe can Immediately Deliver It, it's called the Law of Attraction.   You have to attract what you want to you.   This is why you so often see people experiencing what they don't want, or why you see 'bad things' happening to 'good people' and 'good things' happening to 'bad people.'    For instance if you are really stressed about money it doesn't matter how much you want it or how hard you are trying to manifest it, stress about money will continue to keep attracting to you financially stressful situations and circumstances.

\*It almost seems like the more you care, the less you get what you want, and vise versa the less you care the more you get what you want.\*

This happens all the time, usually it's because the more someone wants something/cares about something the more stressed out they feel in regards to it, and if you feel stressed in regards to something it will keep manifesting in a stressful way for you.  The Law of Attraction is very literal.    The things we don't really care about manifest more easily because there's usually little to no stress involved to muck up the vibration which allows them to flow to us faster.

#Part 4: Cleanup

At this point, hopefully, Russ has been dispatched. But it‚Äôs very possible that we‚Äôve taken out the senator but Russ is still alive and kicking. We must change that.

Now that the senator is dead, we can focus full attention on taking out Russ. Nothing will be held back as we bombard the area around him with sticky ATs, as well as firing on him whenever we get a chance. On top of this, a sandstorm will be whipped up using the sands of the many oases littering the battlefield, with STs and SITMs rained down around the area where Russ is. On top of this, if he makes any advances towards us, there are still traps littered around Buffalo‚Äôs holdout, ready to catch him or any of his arms.

If everything goes according to plan, Russ should be dispatched, leaving Buffalo victorious.

However, there is one last thing to attend to. Destiny Showdown, also present on the battlefield, is a key member of the Hall of Heads, and Buffalo could easily kill him here and now.

But, he won‚Äôt. Buffalo is a hunter, and he‚Äôs no fool. Destiny Showdown is a fearsome beast in his own right, and more than earned Buffalo‚Äôs grudging respect. If anyone deserves such an undignified death, it‚Äôs not him. More to the point, any predator knows a single, simple rule instinctively:Don‚Äôt hunt a beast with claws sharper than yours. Buffalo could easily cut off the limb of a dangerous and unpredictable beast right here, but that would lead only to being bitten in return.

If there are any guards remaining that are engaging Destiny, Buffalo will assist in taking them out with a mixture of ATs if they‚Äôre not too close to Destiny, and shots from WWW.

After Buffalo ensures there are no guards left assailing Destiny or himself, he will get out of his foxhole and stand tall on the rock, raising his rifle in the air. Addressing destiny, he will yell out: **‚ÄúSaved yer life, little man! Remember that next time!‚Äù**

With that, Buffalo makes his way down, slinging his prizes, Russ and the Senator, over his shoulder. 

**‚ÄúAmaki‚Äôll love these‚Ä¶...Wonder if there‚Äôs any room left on the walls‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù**

#Part 5: Contingencies

**What if Russ and/or his Arms get to/into the Senator‚Äôs car before us:** If Russ and/or his Arms get to the car before us, we will utilize this distraction to our advantage, and strike swiftly so we are the first to get the kill.

The normal plan to kill the senator will be put into place, albeit with much more haste and urgency. Time won‚Äôt be wasted with sealing the doors, as the senator will already be dealing with Russ/the Arms, so a myriad of ATs will be slung both into the car and right outside it, to deal with both Russ/The Arms, AND the Senator. Additionally, after the ATs are done being volleyed, Buffalo will ready WWW and fire as fast as he can both at the senator, at Russ, at any arms he can see, and at any guards who may be shooting at him. In this scenario, the senator is top priority. 



**What if Russ tries to ignite us with fuel from the gas station?** Buffalo is making sure that the other hunter to the north is not assaulting us with items found in the truck stop. If he launches or caries over rags covered in gas or containers with fuel, Buffalo will shoot them and spread oasis sand all over the area. WWW sand erodes all matter, including flammable liquids. 

**What if Russ uses a means of transportation not accounted for?**: It‚Äôs highly doubtful that Russ will go by foot, considering his 1 agility, and it‚Äôll make him an utter sitting duck. If he uses any other means of transportation, Buffalo will attack him the best he is able to, using fruits and WWW‚Äôs bullets to dismantle and destroy it.

**What if the Guards rush Buffalo down?**: If for some reason the guards are drawn to Buffalo in particular, whether it be by means of the enemy drawing eyes to us somehow, or them simply seeing us as a bigger threat, Buffalo will be ready.

SITMs and STs have been littered around his emplacement, meaning a straight up rush from the guards would lead to many of them being trapped, making them easy pickings for WWW.

Additionally, if they‚Äôre charging as a group, that makes them easy targets for ATs, who would easily take out several of them at once.

However, Russ is still the most key target here, if he‚Äôs using the Guards rushing us as cover for an advance on the senator, we‚Äôll make sure he doesn‚Äôt get away with him, keeping the pressure on him with ATs, shots from WWW, and sandstorms from the oases to reduce visibility.

**What if Destiny decides to attack us:** He really has no reason to do this, but if for some reason Destiny decides to attack Buffalo, he‚Äôll have no choice but to take him out. As per usual, a combination of ATs, STs, and shots from WWW will be used to take out Destiny. This is only if Buffalo ABSOLUTELY has to.

**What if Russ uses his stand to float above our traps?**If he tries this, Buffalo will fire upon him, shooting with his gun as well as firing stored ATs to knock him back into the dirt, worse for his trip.

"allthingsprotoss","t5_2tkqb","Tell him that past cybercore he needs to think very carefully about his tech.

The tankiness|mobility|range|burst of Toss units means that often you're not making too big of a commitment on the battlefield.  Like, oh, those stalkers are in the wrong place, whatever, blink out.    Or, oh, we're face-charging in with Immortals, well, that's what they're made for and warp prism can get them out if it looks bad.  Oh, they killed all my interceptors, whatever, I'll just rebuild them.  Oh, my army is out of position, I'll just recall them all.  Etc.  

What *is* a big commitment with Toss is what you tech and what you build.  Your tech and your units are both gas-expensive.  If you go full Colossi while the enemy is getting mutas, you can find yourself in a [""you are already dead""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WChHqaO5SeI) situation.  A Terran that made the same mistake would still be in trouble, but could still fall back on their defenses and spam MM to buy time to retool.  As Protoss, your tech units *are* your defenses, and if you built the wrong ones...

One exercise that I think would be quite helpful would be for him to play Artanis in co-op and try to *not lose a single unit*.  (Say it's roleplaying).  Can he win this way if someone carries him?  Sure, so don't worry about that.  Instead, have him see how useful he can be while still adhering to that rule.  The tension between aggression and caution stimulates the right kind of thinking.  You find yourself in situations where to do what you need to do, you need a million more gas, and that shows you where you're perhaps being wasteful.",1535760287

"hockey","t5_2qiel","I'd speculate that there's a simple reason for the lack of history with any higher numbers.

For the longest time, teams simply had their uniforms made up with the usual numbers and players who made the team would then pick one.  There weren't any special requests; if your lucky number was 55, you could take 5 or 15 because there wasn't a 55.  And at the lower levels especially, jerseys would get recycled from year to year.

It's only been in the last 20-25 years, as jersey recycling has become less common and as more numbers have been retired, that there's been any real consideration given to player requests.  So there are probably a dozen or so Hall of Famers who have worn any given number below 20, with fewer than a dozen *players* who have worn any given number over 40.

(One of my favorite stories involved Tomas Holmstrom, who was issued 15 when he first made it; he then requested 96 to mark the year that he made it in the NHL.  Scotty Bowman was right there, and said, ""You might as well ask for 98 so you'll always remember the *last* year that you played in the NHL."")

I think there's also a cultural thing within hockey too, where players who draw attention to themselves on the ice are shunned to some extent.  Wearing 9 is one thing; wearing 66 or 99 as an obvious nod to a specific player is another, but wearing 97 or 83 or 76 isn't regarded as much better.  So there's not a lot of lineage of higher-numbered players, and likely won't be for some time.",1535760291

"regex","t5_2qr8f","I actually did use that first website you linked initially but it didn't really help me much. I've only used very timid regexes in the past, so this was my first taste of a much more complex one.

The objective behind this regex is for selecting what delimiter to use when reading in CSV files. Since CSV files are comma-delimited, but internal commas are dealt with via quotation marks around that 'field', when reading in a CSV file to import into a database, in say Java, when splitting the line of text by comma, it doesn't account for any internal commas. So that regex is used to select only specific commas.

Your post has been automatically removed because it appears to be asking if some aspect of someone else's or your own sexuality or body is normal or not. We get a lot of questions here that are about really basic stuff that *ought* to be taught in but that unfortunately isn't. Variance is the norm in human sexuality. It's more meaningful to ask questions like: is this safe? Is this consensual? Is this mutually pleasurable? There are a lot of great resources for this, including [scarleteen](http://www.scarleteen.com/) and [go ask alice] (http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/). You may also find relevant information with a search of /r/sex or in [our FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index). **If you feel like your question is more complicated or will be a topic for thoughtful discussion**, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsex) so that we can restore your post.

We love these little cute guys, but sadly Red Pandas are increasingly under threat in the wild, and as much as we love to look at how silly they are, they really need the help of us human beings in order to keep on being cute for future generations to see. In the last 50 years, their population has dropped by more than 40% , and estimates in the wild are as low as just 2500 animals. If this decrease continues, they could drop below minimum viability within our lifetimes, and become effectively extinct. 
If you are in a position to be able to help them in even a small way, we'd like to ask you to do so. 

Charities like [The Red Panda Network](https://redpandanetwork.org/get-involved/), [The Red Panda Trust](https://www.redpandatrust.org/) and [WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/red-panda) do fantastic work with local communities to help our favourite animals - and any donations you make are tax deductible (in the US) too. As well as direct donations, they also run eco-trips, awareness days and specific projects such as the first protected Red Panda forest area. 


You can also help by visiting your local zoo or wildlife park , who often will work with the above charities to give them expertise, donations and equipment as well. Red Pandas are amazing animals, but without our help they will only remain pictures and in gifs on this website, instead of roaming and napping in the trees and being derpy with pumpkins or playing in the snow like they should be doing.

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","At the minimum what you describe could be battery, which is ""the unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim"". The application doesn't need to be direct, and can be through an object so the fact that it is through a fork doesn't matter. The facts you give also appear to demonstrate the necessary intention to apply physical force. Battery can be punished by a fine of up to ¬£5000, or six months imprisonment, or both.

The other possibility is that it might be sexual assault. This is defined in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 s 3 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/3) The elements being:
1. Touching another person,
2. The touching being sexual,
3. The other person does not consent to the touching, and
4. A lack of reasonable belief that the other person consents

On the facts that you've given the only on of these elements that could be in any doubt is whether the touching is sexual. Touching is sexual where (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/78):
1. It is sexual by its nature, or
2. Its nature may be sexual and because of the circumstances, of the purposes of any person relation to it, it is sexual.

The touching that happened to you would be sexual by virtue of the second category if at all. I'd personally doubt that putting forks in a persons pocket is capable of being a sexual act. If all the elements could be demonstrated then on summary conviction the fine could be up to the statutory maximum, or a imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Sexual offences can also be dealt with on indictment, in which case the maximum sentence is 10 years.

Edit: But regardless as the other reply advised this is something that you‚Äôll just have to hand over to the police and let them deal with. I just wanted to let you know where the people who did this might stand in terms of offences.",1535760296

A lot of people on Reddit have an emotional connection with their accounts because it's a representation of who they are (their ideas, comments, interests). A lot of people post about and want recognition for their ideas, comments, and interests or at the very least, to discuss them with others. A Reddit user account is very often a semi-accurate representation of that person. A lot of people are either karma whores (see: Facebook likes), or wannabe karma whores as well.

Reddit is a lot like other social media platforms, with a thin veil of anonymity and minimal plastering of life in pictures (except for all of the personal pictures posted on Reddit, i.e. r/pics r/aww r/gaming, etc). In a way, Reddit is a plastering of your life in many other ways, and more personal ways, than you'd find on other social media sites because of the relative anonymity.

Even the consideration of risk is a matter of business reputation and the fallout of field returns / lawsuits (profit one step removed). It's gross, but anecdotal and irrelevant.

The idea here is that people can get better and back to being contributing members of society. That's the goal right? Healthy, working (in whatever field, artistry for example), paying taxes, enriching the tribe, doing the things a normal, good human should do. 

Generally, even in your statement, suicidal thoughts are regarded as *always* a temporary symptom. I don't think this has basis in fact, it is a hope. Some things don't get better (used cars, bad livers). Some people are born into hell, some fall into it and we say they **must** live in it. Sometimes, a quick end to a doomed life is the utilitarian moral choice and one should be allowed to make it. Without knowing the future, we can't ever say for sure. To say that a suicidal thought is grounds for revoking a person's right to choose is terrifying to me. 

What else are we going to say is so contrary to our idea of what is correct to think that the thinker must be incapable of rational thought? Walking alone at night? Sane people should always enjoy company, right? It's a straw man intended only to highlight an extreme at the bottom of a slippery slope, which incrementally implemented is not so far from impossible.",1535760299

"bourbon","t5_2rgos","the answer here is... (and this might be an unpopular perspective)... it depends. Perception, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes people care more about the name than the quality of the juice in the bottle, and there's very little we can do to change the perception of the average consumer. 

To answer your question however, in my experience with bourbon in particular the answer tends to be no, not so much. I've had plenty of bottles in the under $40(CAD)/$30(USD) range that are as good as anything I've ever tried. I love Henry McKenna 10 and until recently it was very affordable and easy to find in most of the US (though still an impossible dream in Canada).  I've also had very pricey stuff that was underwhelming, like Van Winkle Special Reserve Lot B 12 - which isn't as good as its much lower MRSP Weller 12 cousin. I've also had some mid-range bottles like a few Four Roses store pick single barrels that are amongst the best bourbons I've ever had.

Scotch however is a different beast. Given your quote from the Diageo chairman, his scotches tend to to not be all that great for the most part; Diageo charges an arm and a leg for things that are chill filtered, loaded with E150 colouring and bottled at lower proof than they ought to be to really shine. He knows that the names (Oban, Talisker, Lagavulin, Clynelish) carry a sort of cachet, and I am terribly concerned that Port Ellen's rebirth will result in overpriced, underproofed boring stuff. Hopefully it will also result in a few of the other Islay distilleries returning to traditional floor malting at their own distilleries rather than relying upon the malting facility PE kept open after the distillery itself was mothballed.

On the flip side Bruichladdich's hand filled distillery exclusive Valinch series is spectacular, both the Laddie and Port Charlotte iterations. If you can get to the distillery, the ¬£75/500ml bottle is something I have no qualms about paying for. I've been lucky enough to buy 3 and try 3 more and all have been excellent, well made and unique single cask offerings - and you literally get to bottle it yourself, which is surprisingly fun. Octomore is expensive but great stuff, too. And there are many independent bottlers who purchase interesting and unique single casks that are pricey but, depending on the cask type and the distillery it came from, often worth the price for a bottle. Would I pay $4000 for a bottle of Port Ellen from 1978 though? Absolutely not. Would I pay 40-50 for a glass just to try it once? If the occasion warranted it, maybe...

So the *tl;dr* version is this. While whisky price doesn't always mean quality (looking at you Dalmore, Diageo Classic Malts &amp; the secondary market prices for the BTAC), sometimes quality does come with a higher price. ",1535760302

"NurdRage","t5_3geub","The flaking is probably caused by small holes in the lead dioxide surface that expose the underlying lead or graphite, allowing it to contact the electrolyte and react. The best way to prevent this is apparently to rotate the electrode during the manufacture, as seen on these videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXSpqy2TNWo

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7bpoXKak-4

If you want to try other anodes, you could try to make one out of [glassy carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassy_carbon), which is more resistant to chemical attack than graphite and doesn't flake. It's made by pyrolyzing phenolic resins. You could also buy a lead dioxide electrode online.

Others have suggested nickel, but nickel isn't very suitable in acidic or neutral media, only strongly basic solutions work (and it may also be sensitive to chloride, many metals are, but I don't know about nickel specifically). Stainless steel is also sensitive to chloride by the way.",1535760304

If you want to try to move her,  why don't you move her bed next to hers?  My husband and I have only a mattress and it sits flush to my daughters bed 1 so that she doesn't roll off onto the floor 2 so that she knows we are there for her.

If they give us hokey storylines, Emmy staying or leaving won't make a difference.   Neither will getting Mickey back, Sheils or anyone else.  The show has been suffering criticism mostly because of the shallow stories, not the missing characters.  I could have gotten over losing JimmySteve and Mickey much sooner if there was something else for us to bite into.  Same goes for losing Fiona.  I was really sad when I first saw the news.   Im going to hate losing her.  But I love the other characters and actors just as much, and I for one will keep watching.  ",1535760307

&gt;However with just a mic on my own cue wedge, I don't see how that would be beneficial over just monitoring the buss except for measuring SPL,

What? It sounds like you're suggesting that just monitoring the  bus is preferable? As opposed to the actual output of the cue wedge? Sorry but that's really stupid. That's like suggesting that, at FOH,  we should SMAART the output of the console, as opposed to mics in the room. -- A significant part of the reason that I use SMAART is to discover the differences between what I output from the console, and what I hear.",1535760308

That's not to say that spirituality isn't important in addressing trauma - if you so choose, taking ownership of your spirituality can be an empowering and important step in recovery.

However, it's a good rule of thumb to do your due diligence where there are opportunities for others to monetise your spirituality and other life decisions. If you then decide to go ahead with it, and find good results, then great! Just remember to be and stay informed.

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Probably has to do with age and life experience. Most teens don't have any proper experience with the real world or even just in general to identify and attempt to fix the perceived problems that lead to a lack of sex. Obviously everyone has different experiences, but I think a big part of what happens is that this whole Chad and Stacey thing can be seen in action pretty prevalently in high school (at least in the one I went to) to the point where it's a storytelling trope. Jock gets the pretty girl(s) and they're all shallow and vapid little shits. It's rarely so exaggerated in real life, but the type of thing incels like to talk about aren't hard to see in that environment. So a sexually frustrated teen who's still in the process of reaching sexual maturity, all hormones and shit, sees the more mild side of incel ideology and they can identify with it because of the sexual frustration and the whole puberty thing.

But the reality is...that's not really how it works. You're just now reaching sexual maturity, you're new to the ""game"" as it were, and you're still figuring things out. In all likelihood it has nothing to do with this alpha and beta male shit or this Chad's and Stacey thing, that's just high school and everyone else handling their own sexual maturation at the same time as you. You have no baseline, no frame of reference, and little experience to really say you can't get women because your personality sucks or you don't look good enough or you're low iq or whatever other excuses they put forth. But like I said, they identify with this stuff because of the sexual frustration and the need to find a cause, something to blame it on.

I'm hardly an expert or anything though so take it all with a grain of salt. It's just my two cents on why teens can't really be incels.",1535760320

Just out of curiosity, could you tell me who the manufacturer of this fixture is so I can make sure it never goes near one of my projects?",1535760321

With that logic homosexuality is a mental disorder because you're wired to be attracted to the same sex. What I'm saying is most pedophiles find satisfaction in looking at what they shouldn't be allowed to look at. If female breasts were treated as something that isn't wrong, then pedophiles wouldn't adopt a pedophile mindstate for looking at them, because it wouldn't be considered wrong.

"AskHR","t5_2usvo","I don't work in HR, but I can sympathise with the difficulties of transitioning from academia to professional life, as the way you're taught to do things in your degree doesn't really correspond to what your working life will be. I've struggled with this myself, always wanting to do things ""right"" according to how I was trained, but my boss wants things done fast, even if that means sacrificing detail or quality. It's annoying, and goes against everything I was taught. What it comes down to is figuring out whether you can break out of what you were taught and adopt the habits they want you to have. If you don't think you can do that, you need to start finding ways to move on

As for surviving a PIP, that's what I've been doing lately. Ultimately, a PIP is what you think it is. It's a pathway to being let go, while avoiding accusations of unfair treatment. I know people who've survived them in my workplace, but if your boss has decided that you need to go, they're going to make sure you don't (mine actually falsified some details in my PIP, to make it look like I'd failed to meet each of my milestones, even though I'd met them, you can bet your ass I reported them and raised hell). If they're already showing such disrespect by mocking you via IM, it's a pretty strong sign that they're not planning on keeping you on.

A PIP can make you pretty miserable, and there will be a temptation to just quit, even if you have nothing lined up. Try to buy yourself some time and hang in there until you've got something to go to. 

Here are some of the things I did:

* Took part in a workplace coaching scheme, getting advice and support on communicating better, and getting over some of my bad/good habits
* Joined local professional groups in my field, so that I could get perspectives from others in the industry, outside of my workplace
* Created a dossier of any evidence of my being a good employee, or of my boss being shitty and unfair
* Went back through email exchanges during the period of alleged underperformance and looked for any contradictions in instructions (like my boss telling me to do something, and then criticising me for doing it), refusals of reasonable requests, or positive feedback that was later rescinded
* Went through every complaint leveled against me in the PIP and wrote down the reasons why there was an issue, and specifically ways that they could have been nipped in the bud, had my boss cared to do so

When HR finally waded in, I was able to present all of this information, and help them see that my boss wasn't being truthful, and had failed to intervene at an earlier point where things were still salvageable. If there's a risk that you could sue for wrongful dismissal, HR might slow things down a little, to make sure their asses are covered, or even look into the wrongdoing of others

Is there a way for you to gather evidence of the IMs being sent about you? Because that seems like pretty shitty behaviour. Some companies do keep records of IM conversations, so if your name was used in any of them, you could do a subject access request through your company's data protection framework to gain access to them. This could demonstrate that your boss not only allowed a toxic working environment to develop, but they also contributed to it. Is there a possibility that your supervisor knew you could see what they were doing? Because that behaviour sounds like the kind of bitch move someone might use to make an employee lose hope and just quit, rather than fight for their job


Bottom line: One way or another, if there is no opportunity for internal transfer to a different team/role, you need to start working on your exit strategy. Try to go on your terms rather than theirs, but don't leave until you've got something lined up. In the meantime, document EVERYTHING. Every time you're disrespected, any time you see the gifs starting up, write down when it happened and any content you were able to observe (and make a note of any witnesses). Create summaries of conversations you have with your boss or supervisor (and do it as soon as you can after the conversation), so that you have a record of what was said to you. They can come in surprisingly handy. If you ask for help or advice, and it's denied, document that too, including the reasons given. As hard as it is to accept, let go of the hope that you can get things back to a good place, and find a new way forward instead. 


This sucks, it's a really horrible experience, particularly with it being your first job in the field. It's especially bad when you excelled in the topic in academia, but keep getting told you're crap when you try to apply your knowledge/training. It's very hard to make sense out of this disparity, and it can really mess with your head. Try not to fall into cycles of self-blame (although it's important to take stock of your own errors, so that you can avoid them in future) or hopelessness. Focus on what you want out of life, and start strategising for how to get it",1535760326

- A second fund similarly allocated , dedicated to rehabilitating blighted areas into industrial-scale organic (or nearly so) hydroponic gardens growing high-value/rare spices and agricultural products, employing former convicts, on the condition that they make a best effort to get off drugs, get into schools and get educated, from there, once they graduate they'd be given the option to either stay on or we'd help them get new jobs. 

- A 3rd fund, to rehabilitate, and terraform small/barren islands across the world, such that the islands can support various forms of flora and fauna. Ultimately these islands can be used to rehabilitate and form new habitat for critically endangered animals or plants.

- Personally, I'd take some of the money, buy a small house in the best university town around, throw some money at the school, and enroll myself and my wife in the degree programs of our choice. 

- Lastly, Set up a recurring fund, to find and hire a team of lawyers and detectives, to investigate every single elected congressman/senator; tear their lives apart, their wives/husbands, lovers, children, dig every ounce of dirt up on anyone who's served in the public sphere in the last 10 years; expose all of it into the public domain.",1535760327

Daisy stated ""Rey's PAST is not flexible"". If I was playing a character I knew would not be of a known family, refering to the character's past would be the last way I'd refer to that type of character I'd be playing. She's instinctively implying there's something important there.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Have you actually read up on what consent classes or advocates for consent want to teach, or on how defenses in sexual assault/rape classes go? Consent is *not* well understood and is *not* as simple as just yes and no. Brock Turner's defense hinged on that; it was very much a ""what I did wasn't bad, she seemed into me, and she never said no"" situation. ""I thought she wanted it"" is a common enough defense that I *know* you recognized that phrase before you finished reading it. The world is not simply filled with bad people who do bad things because they're bad; there are plenty of examples of people pushing boundaries because they don't understand the severity or magnitude of what they're doing wrong.

For a salient example, look at Drunk Driving. Your arguments could easily be applied to say ""drunk driving can't be reduced! People know drunk driving is bad, and choose to do it anyway. No drinks means drive, any drinks means don't drive!""

But that's obviously untrue. Drunk driving used to be a massive problem. People didn't understand how alcohol and impairment worked. Societal pressures reinforced the idea that drinking and driving wasn't that bad. Cops let people off with a warning and told them to get home for drunk driving, viewing it as an inevitability. Then, culture changed. People were taught more about impairment. Drunk driving became something that was totally unacceptable, and that people intervened in if they saw signs of.

The same can absolutely happen with consent. People can understand more about consent. People can learn more about proactively looking out for signs the person they are talking to can't give meaningful consent, or whether they've achieved it, and how serious it can be to take ""soft"" signals for full affirmations of consent (even if it isn't criminal). Culture can shift to make people proactively intervene on behalf of bad situations. Things *can* get better, and defeatism is abhorrent.",1535760332

Yes.

What I guess I'm trying to say is that everyone's a little ""racist"" by the broadest definition of the term. 

No most people are not. Generally exposure to a multi racial society eliminates the racial prejudices. 

&gt;But we're confusing and alienating people by labeling people with the broad term but treating them as if they've committed a misdeed of the scale of ""classical"" racism - i.e. Jim Crow, police brutality, etc. When all they're guilty of is microaggressions.

Your main focus should be just going to the top left corner and stalling until you get all your ultimate jutsu's. It's been awhile since i grinded out this ninja road but if I'm correct the only thing you need to worry about is getting hit by 10 tails left arm(his right arm technically) and that is a skill(green) type arm. If you just place your S06P Naruto, BF Kakshi, and another heart unit or healer you should definitely have enough HP/ Damage reduction to tank the hits. Also make sure that your main priorities are taking out the 3 points above its head as 10 tail will constantly heal and the units you'll want to do that with is you BF Kakshi and your BF Madera as it looks like those are the only units you have that can hit all three points at one time.

It's strange how it works, but I've theorized it may be the withdrawal starting to creep up amid the daily dosing and continuing to take it creates this effect like an activation from a withdrawal effect kinda but it feels good. I made a post a long time ago about phenibut withdrawal and how taking more phenibut while in full blow withdrawal actually makes your vitals go up, and I have noticed a little bit of the empathic effect from those experiences but not as good as consistently taking it. I think taking it while it's leaving your system and withdrawing has some pharmacological effect no one knows about. Feels dopaminergic and serotonergic. This is where the nootropic effects are ime.

How so? Tyrants do not rise up overnight. They do not start out with their murders, they come bearing smiles and gifts for all good citizens. Looking at what Trump is doing to the States right now is regressing social policy back decades while selling the rest of the States to Russia.

Were this simply an issue of a CEO discussing his labour in a third world country then that would be a little different.

This issue is not only something that will impact Canadian and US relations but also does not help that the President is currently under a number of microscopes regarding his dealings with less than savoury politicians.

&gt; This news is nowhere near that example. You're right -- reporters made this call; however, in this instance, it was a bad call to make.

So you'd rather Canada potentially get economically fucked by the US? At the end of the day it's your opinion vs mine, personally though it looks like some reporters saw what Trump was doing, said ""fuck that noise"" and leaked it after seeing what he is doing to their country.",1535760337

I mean, obviously, the best way to deal with this is get some dental work done, whitening, or even veneers. However, this would all be pretty expensive I think. 

Other than that, avoid sugary foods, acidic foods, booze, cigarettes, etc. And just fucking own your chompers and accept that they are ugly. If you try to hide them and avoid smiling, you'll look more awkward and insecure which is not attractive to anyone. Fucking own it brah and be confident in yourself.

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","This is my first time seeing Zig. I'm afraid the language is too big (and too well thought-out!) to give a real assessment of. I'll play around with it when I have time, though.

I have one nit with integer types. I hate this new trend of making exact-size integers (e.g., i8, u8, i16, u16, ...) and nothing else. There are only two possible scenario where you could need an integer of an exact size, and those are (1) if you need to conform to some binary protocol (e.g., networking protocol, hardware device, protocol); or (2) if you're treating an integer effectively as a fixed-length bitfield (e.g., when computing hashes). In any other situation, if your code depends on an integer variable being an exact size, your code is fundamentally broken.

What most people actually want when they make an i32 (or whatever) is (in C's parlance) `int_fast32_t`. It's a type which is *at least* 32 bits in size, and is the *fastest* integer that is at least that size. On some platforms, that may be 32 bits. On other platforms, it maybe 64 bits. On weirder platforms, it might be 36 bits, or 80 bits.

What I'd like to see is something like i32 (`int_fast32_t`), i32le (`int32_t` which makes it clear it's only for serializing to/from little-endian), i32be (similarly). But that's just a pet peeve of mine....

The documentation doesn't seem to cover memory allocation? I'm curious to see how common data structures (e.g., binary trees) are implemented in Zig.

Overall it looks super cool, though!",1535760340

Regulation time and time again, economic study after economic study prove to benefit the economy. When a business has to innovate to find cleaner ways to do their stuff, they employ more scientists to come up with those methods. When they have to be more careful around dangerous substances they have to employ more specialised people to deal with it. When they can't just dump dangerous chemicals in a river but have to be processed at a processing plant you create jobs for people who transport the dangerous waste, you create jobs in the processing plant and the end result of all this is...... increasing jobs, increasing economy, decreasing unemployment, increasing safety, less sickness which results in more productive days of people working, less expensive clean ups, etc.

AS for deregulation, the last three times the Republicans had the white house, the senate and congress they undertook massive deregulation and caused the three biggest recessions..... deregulation doesn't lead to job loss... except the three bleakest periods of job loses and economic decline in American history.... yeah, except those.

Regulation means some people do paper work, but most of the jobs are people testing for compliance, but that is still a productive job. If someone was testing the water in Flint more often American's wouldn't have literally died as a result of them fucking up. ",1535760341

With that came a lot of insecurities, wondering what other people thought about me and my actions and other things you mentioned that just made me miserable and stopped me from enjoying life.

But boy, did deciding to make some changes flipped my switch. I feel much more confident now, even though running is the only thing I‚Äôve started so far. Working out starts next week haha, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll feel even better then, since I‚Äôm finally active again.

I have such a better posture now, walk more confidently down the street, don‚Äôt really overthink things as much, can talk more freely about pretty much anything, am way more comfortable around other people, don‚Äôt feel afraid to cut off those who are toxic, don‚Äôt care about other random people‚Äôs opinions about myself, feel healthier overall and like I can enjoy life fully. I‚Äòm not really afraid to try new things anymore. I‚Äôm just at the beginning of changing, but I just feel so happy now and I can‚Äôt wait to see how much better of a person I can become. This decision to change couldn‚Äôt have happened at a better time, since I‚Äôm starting college in a month and feel like it‚Äôs going to improve my experience there by a lot.

"flairwars","t5_htj2i","The problem that has been highlighted most recently with the departure of u/Thomaez (and an issue that comes up again and again with FlairCourt/FlairLaws) is that FlairWars is happening primarily on Discord these days. u/BrownBoognish brings up an excellent point, that the subreddits that every color has anyway would be very good for building a ""Unique Culture"" on their own.

Flairwars is a game on Reddit. True, it's not required to join all of the proposed side-servers, but anyone who cares to stay in the loop is going to join them, and those who don't care to stay in the loop are likely not going to join any server. 

Framed from the side of this being a Discord issue; This entire argument is immensely contentious. Is the risk of angering a decent part the active discord community (potentially causing them to leave entirely), worth the benefits that could easily be adapted by simply putting more effort into using Reddit?

Above that, though, there is *nothing* stopping you from going and making a green spinoff server *right now*. You don't have to conjecture about it working. You can go see if it works. This doesn't have to be a full blown flairwars issue.

If you want to see individual colors garner a greater ""Cultural"" image that Purple has taken to (regarding u/daXfactorz arguments for mock tourism), it's up to each color to build it. Facilitating rules that affect colors in a way that would require them to change the way this game works for them, is *very clearly* not the way to go. Maybe, instead of spinoff servers, urge people to do what has been suggested by mods in the past (it's pinned in the megaserver's #general, if memory serves); Find what makes your color important, post about that. Then, it's not the piss in the wind that is a Discord chat log (Also the reason why FlairCourt/FlairLaws decided to try to keep things on Reddit for transparency and \[easily archived &amp; reviewed\] public discussion). There's permanence to it. People can conjecture and comment publicly and other people can ""visit"" and comment about what's going on, too. Everything grows organically, and everyone can watch it happen. Otherwise, if an entire color is apathetic to the idea of having a cultural identity, that's a reality you have to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR/Closing Statement: This should not be a global flairwars issue. Go make a splinter server if you want it. The base issue that seems to be the main cause of people losing steam/quitting is the primary part of this Reddit game takes place on Discord, and people telling other people to play the game differently, than how it's been played the whole time.",1535760347

They were given Gaza to start their country with their own government. That is how you start a country. They chose to elect a terrorist organization and to fire thousands of rockets into Israel. That is the opposite of how one starts a country.

&gt;They wouldn't be able to have their own military or bring the refugees back. 

They wouldn't be able to have a military because, if you look at history and their basic children's shows, you would see that they are brainwashed into hating Jews and wanting to kill Israelis. Seeing how Gaza turned out it makes perfect sense to not allow a military...They would be 100% able to bring refugees back into Palestine, not Israel, why are you lying? No where did Israel ever say that Palestinian refugees would not be allowed to go into a new Palestinian country.

&gt;Israel started the war by declaring independence.

Empire collapses and new leaders control land. They split the land into various new countries. A group of those new countries is racist and attacks the only country that doesn't fall in line with their religion and ethnicity and you are blaming that country? Idiot lol

&gt;You think you can just go into some land and say it's mine without any consequences? 

No, you can buy land and say its yours because you bought it. You can start a country in a land that the world has carved out for you in a land that is no longer controlled by anyone. The Palestinians had no country and they were going to be given one so why is it cool for them to be given a country but not Jews?

"OPNsenseFirewall","t5_3lx1g","VLANs aren't that difficult if you have one router and one, or a few, switches. Just make sure you don't have anything looped unless you're running spanning tree. If you *are* running spanning tree, make sure the version you're running on each device is compatible with the other bridge devices (anything that can potentially create a loop) on your network. Alternatively, you can just ensure there are no loops, then spanning tree won't matter much.

When I say ""switch"" here, I mean a managed switch. I don't mean those little cheap ones you get for $20 on Amazon.

Basically VLANs are tags added onto an Ethernet frame. If you have a port set to ""tag"" a frame with a particular VLAN, the device on the other end should be set up to receive that particular VLAN tag. Usually on a switch it's called a ""trunk"" port, and on a router sometimes it's called a trunk, sometimes it's called subinterfaces. If the switch has that VLAN tag in its VLAN database, it'll forward it on to other switch ports as-needed that are configured to be part of that VLAN.

If a switch port goes to a host, like a PC or a laptop, it'll be an ""access"" port with a particular VLAN assignment, which means it'll send frames untagged (without a VLAN tag) to the host, and it'll receive only untagged frames from the host, then the switch will assign the frames to the appropriate VLAN internally.

If the switch port goes to a managed switch or a commercial (multi-SSID capable) access point, then it'll usually be in trunk mode, so it can send and receive multiple VLAN tags on the same physical connection.

If the switch port goes to a router, like OPNSense, then it'll be on a particular VLAN if there's only one network on that interface, but if multiple networks are assigned to that interface between the switch and the router, then it'll be trunked on the switch, and if the router is OPNSense, then you'll have to set up VLAN interfaces on the port with whatever VLAN tags (VLAN numbers) you want to go to the switch. You should usually not have any interface set up on the physical interface, just the VLAN interfaces. Each VLAN will act as a different network, with separate IPs and separate firewall rules.

You also need to make sure the interface on your OPNSense box can do VLAN tags. Not all interfaces support VLAN tagging. If you're in doubt, you should be good to go on Intel or Broadcom NICs.

It sounds like you had it all set up correctly with the wireless APs and everything working. If you remove APs, that won't have any effect on the speed of the wired connections, so your latency issues are caused by something else.",1535760349

I think the closest I could come to splitting the round, that I could seriously consider, would be splitting into movement and combat/spell phases.  So resolve all movement actions first, then go through and resolve any attack or spell actions based on the initiative order.  But even this overly complicates things imo.

Its lore doesn't have any sense. [Izanami was a jutsu for people who abused Izanagi.](http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/Naruto-chapter-587-page-4.html) Problem is you can only use Izanagi two times so there can't be any abuse case and it certainly couldn't go on forever with when two Izanagi users fought. And the cost of Izanami was eye sight as well, so it makes it entirely inefficient to use it on Izanagi user.

It also broke the canon. [Tobi stated that this power could be only used with Uchiha's and Senju's power](http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/Naruto-chapter-510-page-10.html), but in Itachi's explanation Uchiha seemed to spam it like there was no tomorrow.",1535760350

Easy 1-shot combos are only fun for the person using them, and as far as 1-shot combos go, hook+left click is pretty easy. Referencing ability economy is important when considering the overall balance of the game, but not so important when considering the fun of it.

Son of Gato by Sir Lucifer Morningstar is pretty good, the OC is an edgy teenager who uses very offensive humour and has a disregard for any of the characters lives, in fact, he doesn't see them as people, but quite literally calls them ""characters"". As the title suggests, the OC is the son of Gato. I'd give this a 9/10 but the whole ""Gamer powers"" cliche is cringy IMO, unless you like that, in which case you should read this. 

I recommend Dreaming Of Sunshine by Silver Queen, it has a huge fanbase (a subreddit, a big deviantart gallery and one of the biggest communities on FF.net). The OC isn't initially that interesting unless you think being reborn as a Nara is interesting.

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","Why not?

If there's a thousand solar systems each controlled by an AI with indefinite lifespan and they're all programmed to respect a common decision-making protocol, what does it matter if it takes a couple of centuries for a decision to be made? They're still capable of unified action.

Consider a simple situation where the AI based on Earth is considered the ""ruler"" of the civilization and each AI running each of those thousand colonial solar systems is programmed to obey commands from the Earth AI, while maintaining direct control over its local population and keeping them in line. Ten thousand years pass. The AIs don't change because they're programmed not to. The culture of the local humans are kept approximately in sync by the AIs managing them, if the AIs care to do that.

Then a signal is detected from Andromeda and the Earth AI decides it doesn't like the sound of that and sends out a directive: ""all solar systems build warships except Omicron Perseii 8, you build a gigantic intergalactic launch laser. Everyone send their warships there and we'll give Andromeda what-for."" The colonial AIs are still programmed to obey Earth AI directives, so they all do that.

In what way is this not behaving like a unified interstellar empire?",1535760353

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In the United States, family law is generally doing what's in the best interests of the child.  So the question then becomes will this change be in the best interests of the child? 

Well, this is how I see how it will probably go down.  The majority of child support recipient parents will not account for every penny spent on the subject child for various reasons.   To put things in perspective, the [rebate redemption rate for consumer electronics is only 40%.](https://www1.warrington.ufl.edu/departments/mkt/docs/janiszewski/rebate.pdf#page=5)  40%!! Forcing someone to keep receipts and effectively claim a rebate for every single purchase for a child is too much to ask of a single parent.  If the recipient parent then fails to document one more purchases, the paying parent will then argue that the child support payment should be less and a court may agree.  This will result in less money going to the child.  That doesn't sound like it would be in the best interest of the child.

Conversely, let's say that the recipient parent is super on it and documents everything.  The paying parent can then go through those receipts and make arguments like ""you shouldn't be buying potato chips for the child"" or ""you could have purchased this item for a lower price"" and then argue that the payments should be less.  Again, possibly leaving the child worse off. 

As a whole, I don't think this will result in improving the life of most children who are the subject of child support payments. ",1535760353

I thought the acting was excellent and believable. Nick Kroll surprised me (but he didn't have a big part). I'm so used to seeing him on old VH1 shows sharing commentaries LOL. 

The story for the most part was fairly accurate aside from a few things: (in the movie but never happened but yeah I get they added it since it's a movie)
*The father of Sylvia Hermann was never kidnapped 
*Sylvia and Klaus were most likely friends (not like this matters though)
* Malkin was not left behind due to a Nazi/Nazi sympathizer heist that involved Argentinian security (the Argentinians though did 100% protect Nazis)
*Never read anything about a girl stealing money from the agents
* There never was a Hanna/Malkin romance

7/10. I think if they added more at the end of the movie before the credits about other agents involved other than Malkin, that it would have been better as it really was a team effort. ",1535760354

"Crossout","t5_38ar9","If the difficulty curve is linear (which It seems to be) then its effectively at least a square growth rate beacuse the health and damage go up and they multiply together for an effectiveness value.

Even if you want to consider the overall difficulty as linear player power score on a well built build is pretty close to logarithmic in terms of how much better it gets. A 2k will wreck a 1k and a 4k will wreck a 2 k and so on but a 3k and a 4 k can be pretty competitive. So higher power scores are still a bad idea.

And even if someone argues that the scales are the same and ""my build does more damage and has more health so I do more work so my high power score is justified"" they health of defense objects, towers, trucks, ect., DO NOT SCALE so if you miss a melee bot at high difficulty it could drop a tower by 50% in a few seconds but if the same thing happens on low difficulty you can respond and lose 2-10% health at most. 

I can understand people bringing 7-8.5k but whenever I see a 9+k in a match I just accept that we are probably going to lose. The best response I've had so far was to message the offender (6 auger dual mammoth build over 12k in a medium raid) ""Hey you must be new to the game beacuse you don't know this, but bringing a high power score vehicle into a raid actually makes it harder for the whole team. Try to make a build under 6k and you will win more often."" It gets the message across without getting the community any more toxic than it already is and a lot of players who have these items to build dont know about raid scaling and they remember when you had to bring in crazy builds to finish raids beacuse you would get a teammate made of fuel barrels just to meet powerscore limits.

Tl;dr go as low as you can on raids but be encouraging and positive when you tell people about raid scaling, it's easy to be mad that you just lost fuel but being mad just makes the person more likely to ignore you.",1535760357

"wow","t5_2qio8","TL;DR: Bownsamdi's boss is the boss of all Loa, not the god of death or blood or anything else. It's the guy who made him, and who is still making more Loa.

People keeping suggesting all these evil things as his boss, but I really don't think that'd ever be the case. I think that we're going to be seeing the introduction of the Sun God, Elune's counterpart. We know she has a counterpart because of how the Tauren worship An'she, the Sun, and Elune is Mu'sha. An'she and Mu'sha together make the Earthmother.

Consider this: Elune created the first Naaru. She's the mother of Cenarius. She's basically at the top of the pyramid of all the life/light related, and is an actual deity, compared to all the lowercase 'gods' that we've seen so far. Elune is also known as the Moon. The Moon made Life and Light, the opposite of the Moon.

So, this tells me that whoever the Sun God (actual deity, Elune's counterpart) is will have been the person respondible for Death and Void, opposites of the Sun. If we follow this pyramid down from the Sun God the same way we do Elune:

[https://i.imgur.com/8TsqHna.png](https://i.imgur.com/8TsqHna.png)  (Sorry for shitty drawing, just slapping it out)

Bwonsamdi and the Old gods aren't on the same heirarchy. Bwonsamdi and all the other Loa proably have the same boss, and that boss is probably someone that was created by the real Sun God.

So, if we want to know Bwonsamdi's boss, the quest is not who is the boss of death, the question is who is above all of the Loa? Who created the Loa? Who is STILL creating them? We already know of several trolls who have historically become Loa, and even right now in BFA, Vol'jin appears to be on that path.",1535760358

If the Ravens offense isn't a dumpster fire like the 2017 Browns and Collins gets his projected volume of around 220 carries, I think he can easily live up to a late 3rd/4th round value (another main problem with Crowell was that I believe his ADP was in round 2).",1535760358

"latterdaysaints","t5_2uas2","Compliments of Elder Bednar:

&gt;To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us. **Rather, you and I ultimately determine if we are chosen.** Please now note the use of the word *chosen* in the following verses from the Doctrine and Covenants:

&gt;‚ÄúBehold, there are many called, but few are *chosen*. And why are they not *chosen?*

&gt;‚ÄúBecause their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men‚Äù (D&amp;C 121:34‚Äì35; emphasis added).

&gt;I believe the implication of these verses is quite straightforward. God does not have a list of favorites to which we must hope our names will someday be added. He does not limit ‚Äúthe chosen‚Äù to a restricted few. Rather, **it is our hearts and our aspirations and our obedience which definitively determine whether we are counted as one of God‚Äôs chosen.** (bolding mine)

You can choose to be chosen regardless of past sins through the power of the atonement. Satan doesn't want you to go on a mission; the Savior most certainly does (if you are able). I hope you don't count yourself out. If it is something you want to do, work for it until someone else says no, but I doubt that'll happen.",1535760361

As a result, you will need to reduce weight somehow by lowering the internal pressure or switching to a lighter gas (alternately you can increase the size of the big blimp relative to its payload) if you want it to stay at the same buoyancy.

Right, but cocoa powder doesn't block all the air like drowning would. That's why sources about drowning are irrelevant because it's clearly not the same as inhaling some cocoa powder

&gt; I didn‚Äôt read more than was necessary as I didn‚Äôt want to spend forever on it. 

I think that was the problem üòÇ

 

&gt;Firstly, I never said cocoa powder would for sure cause death by lack of oxygen

üòÇ Yes you did, that's why you kept posting about asphyxiation

&gt; boy would not have been fine from eating cinnamon even if his mother was around. (And I happen to be right - [here‚Äôs](https://metro.co.uk/2015/08/02/toddler-dies-after-choking-on-cinnamon-powder-found-in-mums-kitchen-5323615/)

&gt; Apparently she was there but didn‚Äôt notice him eating it till he started choking -

It never said she was in the room with him  you liar üòÇ

 
&gt;Asphyxiation is asphyxiation, no matter what it‚Äôs from. It‚Äôs a lack of oxygen - they‚Äôre all going to be the same amount of time

So if I have partial lack of oxygen and a complete lack of oxygen, you actually think you would die at the same rate? üòÇ

I was hired into this job and to be honest, I was not belong in that group and into the team kasi all of the members where atleast double degree and some even graduated abroad but what most strikingly shocked me is that my bosses (2 of them and they are brother and sister) is that their father is rank one of the richest in PH.

Everytime they feel good, they treat us lunch to ""anywhere"" literally even shangri-la, and the girl boss don't want to travel without escort cars and she don't carry large amount of money just cards and bodyguard is always around.

The guy also have body guards but they just follow him sometimes, I didn't even notice his body guards are around, they keep their distance so my boss doesn't have that VIP treatment of having entourage.

One of the guards grew up in my home town and said the guy boss is more ""filipino"" in attitude and everytime he eat in expensive resto, he make sure to get a take out for his body guards and the girl boss is more like ""americanize"".

‚Äã

What I like about them is that they give me the wrong perception of being in the 1% of this island, I thought they will drive ferrari, with huge cash and expensive jewelries just like in rap videos but then both of them drive ""decent"" cars like ford everest, cash in the wallet is around 120 Pesos or 2000, normal dresses and no expensive things attached to them except their credit cards and checking account.",1535760364

Theoretically it's not possible because you need two magnets that stayed at the exact same positions all the time but due to outside forces, that can't happen.

Everything I've seen on this talks about it is for religious freedom for everyone, but Sessions said ‚ÄúChristians are under attack‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt 100% true). So maybe he called that out but it‚Äôs not created to only defend Christianity. 


&gt; And how can you argue the legitimacy of this task force if you can't even find their goals. you don't Know what they do, they clearly have bias

Seems like you don't know what they do either. The article is very vague and it seems like everyone is making insane assumptions. I've read a couple other articles on this and they talk about it being to keep things civil and unbiased during court proceedings e.g. the Christian baker refusing service for the gay couple. Yes, Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump are Christians (I'm not 100% convinced Trump is though, but lets just say he is for the sake of the argument), but they never said they are *only* defending Christian rights. It just happens that Christians are one of the biggest religious groups (along with Muslims) to be under attack for their views/opinions (being against homosexuality, trans issues, etc) by a large section of the country. I see this as defending them and they're trying to back up people who are doing things due to their religion. 

If when this starts going into effect and they are **ONLY** helping Christians, I'll be right with you in speaking out against it.

Clearly the next step here is to say that, because he *had the ability to disapprove* of it and he didn't, then etc. To this, I can only say that he didn't ban child porn either. He didn't ban online gambling. 

The Bible is divided into several different sections, historical/factual (supposedly), poetry/music, teachings, records, etc. I mentioned this in another comment; God isn't going to outright stop all sin. He's letting humans do their thing. Any input from him is practically extra, but the Israelites were ""his"" people. God gave the Israelites laws about slavery but did he ever say anything about polygamy? 

I'm afraid there's so much close-mindedness in many of these responses, from both sides. Reading through these responses is even funneling my own thought process lol. I really can't explain it that well, maybe when I get home I can find better articles. I've read tons of books and articles about this; it all really makes sense in context. 

Thanks for putting in the time to have this discussion, I'm learning a lot myself here too.

"Dabs","t5_2th0s","**Entourage effect**

The entourage effect is a proposed mechanism by which compounds present in cannabis which are largely non-psychoactive by themselves modulate the overall psychoactive effects of the plant (these resulting principally from the action of the main psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)).

Cannabidiol (CBD) is believed to be the major modulatory component of cannabis, mitigating some of the negative, psychosis-like effects of THC, and is included in some medicinal formulations alongside THC. CBD co-administration also reduces the negative effects of THC on memory. Myrcene, which is recognized as a sedative component in hops, may be responsible for the sedative effects (""couch lock"") of certain cannabis strains (sedative effects are commonly ascribed to the indica cannabis type). Linalool may also contribute to the entourage effect, modulating the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems to produce sedative and anxiolytic effects.Though the idea of the entourage effect has taken root in the cannabis industry and among consumers, the concept is often based on conjecture and anecdotal evidence as rigorous scientific underpinning is lacking.

Generally second bachelors programs do not require you to take general education classes. As you already have enough math to start intro courses, this will mean that you should be completing your degree in 4-6 semesters of study, depending on how hard you push, how many electives you take, and the schedule of course offerings. 

I went back to get a 2nd bachelors in CS, and due to having started my first degree in an engineering program (before changing to Political Science) I could transfer in all the math/science courses, and ended up taking straight CS courses (+scuba for fun). Could easily have done it in 4 semesters, but took a 5th as part of my job strategy (rock an internship after being almost done with degree, and get a full time offer out if it, which worked).

I don't think GoT or the MCU has fallen into the logic/world building trap as Star Wars. Mostly because they attempted logic and world building.

Star Wars, through 10-ish movies, never has attempted to explain ANYTHING. Big fans of Star Wars have speculated everyone is illiterate to cover for plot holes.

"qotsa","t5_2sbyp","Self Titled - Sludgey roots stoner rock. Blarring power chords and heavy distortion.

Rated R - Begginings of evolution into progressive rock elements with still plenty of heavy riffs and more talented vocals.

Songs for the Deaf - THE album. First top 40 hits are on this. No One Knows and Go With the Flow. Album is a concept to imitate driving through the American desert scape listening to am/fm radio. Good amount of variayion with some more straight up rock n roll tunes and some really heavy creepy dark prog rock.

Lullabies to Paralyze - The soundtrack to a perfect nitemare. Dark dark dark songs with explicit and suggestive lyrics. Alot of guest musicians. First album without Nick Oliveri on bass. Retains a solid theme throughout the entirety. The theme being walking alone in the dark.

Era Vulgaris - A journey far away from public reception. Alot of wierd tunes and sound effects atypical to other QOTSA releases. Definitely leaning towards avant-garde rock.

...Like Clockwork - Back to the roots of QOTSA song writing with much more focus on post production. Tracks are clean and sound BIG. Alot more epic stadium style songs with a return to more rock oriented song structure. Overall a solid modern rock and roll album that doesnt get too heavy but stays ""hard enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls.""

Them Crooked Vultures - Josh's side project with John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin and Dave Grohl of Being Awesome. If this were an actual QOTSA album I'd say it'd indisputably be revered as the best album they've ever put out. This is all opinion based. I can't say anything else cause this is one of my top 10 favorite records of all time. Sounds obviously like QOTSA and Led Zeppelin and early Foo Fighters. A perfect super group. 

Villains - Dancey and poppy with lots of heavy rock sprinkled throughout. Definitely a broader crowd pleasing album with more basic structured song writing and a high focus on post production. Miles away from the self titled and Rated R feels so die hard earlu fans panned this one because it's alot softer and a more forgiving album than the first 2. 

Happy listening! Catch the first sjow you can when they book another tour. I've seen hundreds of concerts. Phish 60 times Paul McCartney 4 times Umphreys McGee over 30 times. QOTSA is easily the top 3 best concerts I've ever seen. I caught them three times for the villains tour in north eastern USA.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","This is the main problem with most of the BoTh sIdEs shit. Its not that bad things and people don't exist on the left, its that when they are found they are immediately denounced and shunned. On the right when those bad things surface they are at worst supported and at best ignored.

‚Äã

Look at something like violent protest or property damage or whatever. There are definitely some people on the left who want to go rough up some right wingers at a protest. Granted there are far fewer on the left than right, but they still exist. When left wingers see people on the left damaging property and being violent there is an immediate and nearly universal response of ""This is not the way to do things. We should all denounce this behavior"". What happens when right wingers see violence from the right? It sure as hell isn't a unified resistance against it.

It shouldn't require me shoving stuff into my socket to fix fitment. That kind of stuff should have been tried as soon as I suggested it. It was obvious that it was wiggling when I went in for my adjustment.

The fact that I'm gonna need to show him cad drawings to convince him that I could fit a different leg is just obscene. I shouldn't have to be designing the damn hardware. I'd basically guarantee that it's a part that already exists.",1535760377

Basically British citizens only get subject to residence requirements if they are foreign born citizens who have never lived in the UK, or have spent extended time in odd places. I spent 9 months in the states and a year in Australia and neither affected my residential status.

There are plenty of reported photos of bigfoot. You are acting like there isn't any at all saying there is no evidence with the rise in sightings. This argument of ""not having solid evidence because there isnt any pics or video of sasquatch is a bit ridiculous. Have you ever seen a wild life photographers set up? Thousands of dollars worth of equipment and lenses. Hours and hours of sitting and waiting for a shot. The pics you get of sasquatch reflect the situation good or bad. Mostly not perfect conditions for a proper picture or video. But there are a lot of them out there. Dont say there isnt any eveidence. And as far as evidence goes you dont need just photos or video. There are Plenty of reputable people who clame to have seen bigfoot. From military personnel to police officers to first responders. There have been plenty of sightings with multiple witnesses. There is an example of multiple police witnesses on the same incident. And these people are trained to do just that. Observe and report. Just because we cant explain parts of a mystery dosnt mean it dosn't exist. I think your reasoning needs a bit more research. Just my opinion though

If it‚Äôs 90s era X-Men, then WildCATS and Cyber-Force are very similar since Silvestri and Lee both drew X-Men back in the day!

"lowcarb","t5_2rlo3","&gt; My question is, eating 150g or less a day of carbs, will that cause my face pudginess to reverse a bit?

In the end, what will cause you to lose weight is how many calories you eat versus how many you use. Restricting carbs alone does nothing if fats and proteins are not controlled in some way. The (supposed) RDA for carbs is 130 or so, so 150 is not really all that low. But you're tall, and activity level will make a big difference.

""Low carb"" is generally considered to be 50 to 100 net carbs.

""Keto"" is any carb restriction that keeps someone in ketosis. The ""20 net carbs"" threshold is just a lowest common denominator that would keep almost anyone in ketosis. But many can go higher.

One reason keto works for so many is that ketosis gives them a natural appetite suppressant, so fewer total calories get consumed. But people on ketosis can still gain weight if they eat a lot of fat and protein. Even keto is not an ""all the proteins and fat you want to eat"" diet.

Second, believe me when I say this, it is definitely not better for you to stay a girl and live a miserable life simply because you are short. 

I was once in your position. For background info, I originally came out as when I was 14, but because of internalized transphobia and fear of what others would think of me I decided to instead try to be the most feminine girl possible. And I lived like that for three more years until I felt so miserable, depressed, and lonely that I knew if I had to continue this charade I wasn‚Äôt going to be alive by the end of the year. So I jumped into transitioning quick. Cut my hair again June 2017, bought all new clothes in July, came out to my family in August, and started T by September. 

Your situation is similar to mine. While all the women on my mom‚Äôs side are 5‚Äô8 and above, my mom and I both are 5‚Äô0. Everyone towers over me and I‚Äôm constantly aware of how short I am. Plus, I already had a baby face as a girl and even at 17 I was still being perceived as 14 or 15. Anyways, these are some of the main reasons I stayed in the closet for so long. I thought I was never going to be seen as a real guy.

I was totally wrong though. Although I still have a baby face, I still grow older and more confident each day. Of course there are days I feel like crap and like everyone is staring at me, but hey I‚Äôm ALIVE and happy because I‚Äôm getting to live as the guy I know I am and have been all along. Here are some tips for not only ‚Äúfitting in,‚Äù but also prospering as a short guy:

1) Be funny. Seriously. People tend to forget about your height if you can make them actually laugh. If you‚Äôre straight, girls LOVE a funny guy as much as they love a tall one. Guys and NB people too. Everyone loves anyone who‚Äôs funny. 

2) Be loud. Starting T as soon as possible is essential because your voice is less likely to deepen the later you start T. Regardless of your height, having a deeper, masculine voice will make people take you more seriously and make you seem more your age. My voice was extremely high as a girl, but after four months on T it deepened a TON. People are always surprised by how deep my voice is when they hear me speak for the first time because I look so young. And once you‚Äôve grown comfortable enough to, speak out as much as you can with as much confidence as you can.

3) Dress nice. And when I say nice, I mean fucking STUNT on everyone all the time. It may be a pain and you might have to wake up extra early in the morning to get ready, but it‚Äôs worth it. When people notice your height, they notice what you‚Äôre wearing too. If you‚Äôre wearing baggy clothes that don‚Äôt fit right or dressing in clothes that are just plain ugly, people will attribute that to your age and height. Clothing companies I recommend: 1) UNIQLO, UNIQLO, UNIQLO. Their men‚Äôs shirts are holy. No more shopping in boys/youth section if you check out UNIQLO. I swear by them. 2) H&amp;M. I would only recommend shorts or pants from them since their shirts and t shirts run long on me. Buy the extra short men‚Äôs (chino) shorts. Because they‚Äôre supposed to be extra short on the average guy, they fit pretty much perfect on me. Even if you have to push your budget a bit or save up for a large shopping spree, bite the bullet and get. your. pants. tailored. I mean it. Look good, feel good.

4) Be smart. Know what you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs always attractive and if you know shit you‚Äôll definitely be perceived as older. 

and with these things, you‚Äôll slowly start to feel better about yourself. You‚Äôll have to try harder than the average guy, sure, but you‚Äôll have all these great qualities about you. 

These are just tips and won‚Äôt all work for everyone, but they certainly can help. 

So in conclusion, don‚Äôt you DARE say you can‚Äôt be happy and prosperous as a short guy. I used to say that, but continue to prove myself (and others) wrong every single day. I hope this helped and if you ever need to vent or anything fill free to DM me. ",1535760383

Spelt (Triticum spelta; Triticum dicoccum), also known as dinkel wheat or hulled wheat, is a species of wheat cultivated since approximately 5000 BC.

Spelt was an important staple in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times; it now survives as a relict crop in Central Europe and northern Spain, and has also found a new market as a 'health food'. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (Triticum aestivum), in which case its botanical name is considered to be Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta. It is a hexaploid wheat, which means it has six sets of chromosomes.

Turns out all of Alberta is at a higher elevation than PEI, and both Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador have the same mountain as their highest point, with just 1 metre of difference between the two provinces.  The peak of Mount Caubvick is just 10 metres past the border.

Not conceptually the strongest album as a whole, but it‚Äôs only been 8 months and the bars more than make up for it.

other than that, I have no complaints. Lucky You is fucking incredible, Ringer, Greatest, Kamikaze are all fucking bumping. Stepping Stone is an emotional cut that I didn‚Äôt expect to love with how much the hook sounds like poppy Em. Fall is great, and a majority of Not Alike is also fire(although em don‚Äôt need to be dissing MGK). Both of the skits are enjoyable too.

now I‚Äôm anticipating the Eminem album where he raps over hip hop beats with hip hop features like here, but 1-2 years work instead of 8 months so we can get a fleshed out theme and shit. Right now, good rapping from Em is all I need. Probably a 7/10 for me.",1535760387

"ketogains","t5_2v5mu","&gt;Any guidance out there? My goal is to rid the fat I gained, and then rid  of more fat, and eventually build up my muscle and get fit. Is it  really possible to bulk while on keto considering protein can become the  main fuel source instead of fat?

I'm sure there's people that have done better,  but my first actual workout program I really took serious  was a 12 week program and I gained just shy of 8lbs muscle, bodyfat was only down by less than 1% but I wasn't really focusing on that. That number was from a BodPod at start and finish. On the protein thing, protein will never become your main fuel unless you starve your body of both carbs AND fat at the same time. Burning protein for energy is inefficient and your body will always prefer fat over it, just like it'll always burn carbs over fat when given the chance. Although you up your protein it doesn't have to be stupid high either. Remember a carb diet and a traditional bulk is gaining a lot of FAT as well, then getting it back off. Your avoiding most of that with a keto bulk, not all, but some.

 I actually believe is quite common in a large amount of horror/ghost stories that a female figure is the one haunting humans (we can actually see this in Asian horror stories as well), but depending on the culture the reason for the entity to haunt or the origin of the curse is completely different. In Venezuela, for example, these ""espantos"" act as some kind of punishers for men that cheat on, sexually assault or hurt women (and children in the case of La Sayona), but if we check mainstream J-Horror, these female ghosts are born from a grudge, hatred or any other negative feeling so intense it becomes an entity.

Maybe some folks here have something more to add to my analysis.

I spoke with a loan officer who basically told me the fact that I carried so much debt on credit cards but made payments (min but still counts) is way bigger than being sent to collections when Sprint overcharged me a thousand I didn't have. I settled with the collections agency for what I actually owed, but it's still a mark on my credit. Comcast also had me in collections for a while.

"RedPillWomen","t5_2xing","Marriage in American isn't just an official frame for a long term committed relationship. Marriage is a legal arrangement, an insurance policy and a way for the government to extract money from the richer party to redistribute it to the poorer party without care for what's good for the FAMILY. 

Go watch a divorce court for just one day. Marriage is an insurance policy in our current legal climate. Judges rip families apart and take away custody from good, law abiding men and make them pay alimony that doesn't take into consideration changes in income, in many cases.  

Marriage CAN work. And it's beautiful when it does. But it's absolutely disgusting when it doesn't. Signing on a doted line, speaking some magic words, and dressing up for a day isn't going to make a non-commited relationship a commited one. If the two people who got together were the type to stay together they wouldn't need the corrupt government to be an intermediary. Using a corrupt and grotesque family court system where the judges have a financial inventive to assign alimony and child support. Which is why so often grotesque amounts are assigned. No one should ever pay 800k in child support or alimony a year for any reason.

Look up Robin Williams and his story of paying the ridiculous alimony the court, the law, our system, assign and enforced. Something which helped drive him to suicide. 

Maybe at one point marriage was wholesome. That's no longer the case today. Two people can have a good marriage, but it's because of those two people, not the vows they made or the paper they sign. But because of their conviction. A conviction which would persist without all those other unnecessary and corrupt factors.

"mattcolville","t5_3f0mp","1. I'd start by taking hostages and establishing exchanges.

&gt;One of the best ways to control people with greater strength than you is to put barriers between them and the things they value. In fact, it's one of the best ways to control other people regardless of their power or numbers.  You can also do this ""nicely"": if your players have NPC friends, the opposite faction gives them homes and ""protection"".  You can hold resources hostage too: if your players need a blacksmith, or a mage with Identify, or food and supplies, either faction can provide access to those things in exchange for cooperation.

2. Both factions start taking control of different things that everyone (or maybe just players) want access to, and start building fortifications.

&gt;Depending on the number of survivors around, a faction could have 20-40 crossbows pointed over a wall to defend themselves. After a certain point, NPCs start treating the players like monsters: they shoot first, they go for the kill, and they triple tap the body to be sure, because powerful adventurers are a threat equal to or greater than beasts in the wilderness.

3. I'd also have the NPCs gain things **from the party** that help them keep up to some degree.

&gt;The NPCs don't want to be dependent on the players forever - they probably want to have some independence, to determine their own futures, and to survive by their own efforts. Maybe this means that the party gives them an artifact that creates a magic barrier, which protects a settlement while the party is out adventuring. Maybe this means that the town uses the party's spare or leftover gear to build their own magic weapons. Either way, these developments are intended to help the survivors fight off weak monsters, but later allow them wage war against each other, or even convince them turn against the players.

4. Finally, I'd start using insurgency.

&gt;People start switching sides between the two factions as tensions rise, but the players can't always tell whether people are actually changing their stance, or just infiltrating the other faction. Even if the players find out the truth about one character's intentions, other survivors make their own judgments and don't necessarily believe the players. The sensible group might still lynch an innocent person they don't trust. The violent group might accept a non-violent person and treat them well.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's a great antagonist in Suicide Island who moves from the sensible group to the violent one, and then goes back to parley with the sensible group despite having instigated most of the conflict and come out ahead. It still isn't entirely clear what his motives are, 50+ chapters later.",1535760394

 Course I don't know the exact location of your lump etc. If you've noticed a great change in the lump please go back to your GP. maybe print off a list of symptoms for lymphomas and show them why you're so concerned to make it very clear. As your title says, your symptoms are getting worse so go back and ask to be referred to the appropriate place.

Which makes me believe it is a GTS 450, but I'm still not 100% certain.

‚Äã

Here are pictures I took of it:[https://ibb.co/jno8Cz](https://ibb.co/jno8Cz)

[https://ibb.co/jWYKKe](https://ibb.co/jWYKKe)

‚Äã

From the memory chips, I figured it has 12Gbit of total memory. Doesn't make sense to me since that makes 1.5Gbyte, and I have never heard of a GPU with not 1 and not 2gb of memory, but 1.5gb. But that's what I found anyway.

‚Äã

So, say that it IS a GTS 450, how would I go about flashing the right BIOS on it? I have seen this database ([https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/)) of BIOS files and I'm most likely picking something from there, but I don't know what.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: After looking up the BIOS version displayed on GPU-Z, I found that the version corresponds with those of a GTS 450 on TPU vgabios database.",1535760396

I understand perfectly that people (men and women) shouldn't have to restrict themselves so much in other to avoid being a victim. The issue is that bad people will try to harm you and be more tempted to do so if you look like an easy target. I used to get out at night to visit a few relatives and I always was terrified of walking alone in the dark (public lighting could be nearly non-existent in some areas and there was some crime going on in the town). Thankfuly, nothing bad ever happened to me, but I knew it was a risk given I couldn't walk with crowds.

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","Maybe so but it feels like Soon^TM  to me. I'll believe it when I see it and whatever hidden thing they're *maybe teasing* that could replace the features (or that they already had done and planned to show) is worth it.    
   
Sorry. I didn't fully grok what you meant in the second paragraph. In any case, having a year of planning under your belt for both things and knowing what the plan is for both might make one expect better coordination or earlier forecasting that there could be issues. Idk. Other people have announced stuff on that scale and succeeded. It is what it is. Projects are different. Avoiding the problem or just  warning earlier would have been better than this on the consumer end.   
   
I'm not implying FDev needs to be perfect. I'm not implying any company is perfect. That was never the point. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with other factors besides whether or not people are ""flawed"". Companies everywhere have flawed people. Part of doing the public facing stuff is building the processes that mitigate the flaws of all the people involved and keep them from compounding into one big mess --processes to mitigate the effects of ego, tunnel vision, processes to pull in suggestions from the consumer, processes to communicate future plans clearly and accurately.   
    
But yeah, I don't know what Q4 will have besides what they originally announced but haven't yet cancelled. Hinting at secret extras doesn't count. They could be more ships, more unlocks, and more skins. They could be more puzzles or segmented away aliens. It could be role-specific slots for ships. It could be anything. Doesn't necessarily mean it'll be anything on the level of what was cancelled. If they're hiding it now, then they're not being transparent--especially since we were told what sorts of stuff was supposed to be coming. Just seems like it could easily be whatever's left and the extra thing they have. So yeah, that's where I am on this. I agree the ""season of promises"" needs to not happen again. But giving specifics hasn't helped either because they come in half finished fairly often as well.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;You seem to think women are completely incompetent wallflowers who can't handle anything. You're sexist against men and you're also sexist against women.

I think any group of marginalized people deserve to have spaces to share their voice. Some people don't need this space, but some do and it's important to have these spaces in order to support those who aren't as strong as those who don't need them :) 

&gt;""only over half the day"" ""only every panel""

Only 3/5 panels for 1 out of 3 days from what i can see so far. It looks like they'll also be covering past activities in the later day just in case you missed it. 

&gt;aka men banned event

If men are upset because they don't get to participate in a session for people who experience things that men could never experience then idk what to tell you. 

 &gt;The panels have nothing to do with women, they are general panels which can help everyone.

I already addressed this. A panel does not have to be focused specifically for women in order for a woman to experience it a certain way. 

&gt;Banning all men from panels which can help anyone regardless of gender isn't sexism according to you. Ok.

Not enough for it to make my radar, nope. Again, only on technicality.  

&gt;So that makes it ok to just ban all men.

I already addressed this with my safe space comment. 

&gt;I have most of a degree in history and my dissertation is on women's enfranchisement.

That's cute. Maybe you can mention your concentration and give us a link to that dissertation, i'd love to read it. I love to learn :) ",1535760407

From the phrasing he does sound like an ass hole but then again he probably spends more than his fair share of time working relative to the wife and yet is resented for but doing enough.

Mike, I really respect your overall vision and love this game, but you‚Äôre wrong here.

I posted this elsewhere, but I want to post this directly to you.

* Something not being addressed is that the game loses it‚Äôs immersive qualities if every time you interact with a barrel you get an overlay. The beauty of this game is in it‚Äôs immersion and it‚Äôs simplicity. 

* The equipment tab is completely redundant and is one more click in the way of getting to your cannonball inventory.

* Cursed Cannonballs should come in more than two colors. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to find the one you‚Äôre looking for during a battle. Either that or make sure the same cannonball type is always in the same position. 

* Cursed Cannonballs should have been stored as a third item radial with the cannonball types always being in a consistent location so it could become muscle memory.

* Cursed cannonballs should have been random physical spawns like maps and artifacts, not barrel finds. The prospect of finding a map in a barrel is equally uninteresting. I‚Äôm here for adventure, not opening up barrel menus every two seconds.

* Cursed Cannonballs are too common and overpowered. It all completely goes against the whole idea of ‚Äú a flintlock is just a flintlock‚Äù. A cannon is not just a cannon when a galleon is completely immobilizing your ship and crew in a non-stop barrage of curses. There needs to be a magic cool- down period, ‚Äúcannon overheated‚Äù whatever.

* Please, for the love of Bacon, do not create a hunger meter. It sounds like you‚Äôre heading down the Minecraft hunger mechanic route and that‚Äôs awful. I don‚Äôt need new ways to eat, I need to be able to *grab planks quickly because I‚Äôm sinking*

* Solo sloops cannot switch their crew type from Closed to Open??? How did this even get broken?

* You can‚Äôt feed pigs...?

* Metal Skeletons can‚Äôt rust from bucket water throws...?

* This response does not address that the Athena Chests no longer spawn.

* This does not address why skull spawns can‚Äôt be picked up.

* It does not address why Anchorballs RAISE anchors if already down.

* This does not address why the Reaper‚Äôs Mark stays on your ship after you sink‚Äî-even though the flag no longer appears to be flying.

The entire update feels like it wasn‚Äôt playtested‚Äîeither that, or the concerns of the playtesters were ignored to meet some arbitrary deadline. 

I would rather you folks have held off on the release indefinitely than push this down at us. I‚Äôd rather be playing cursed sails.

Whatever VP is pushing you guys to meet a deadline despite these major defects needs to be fired. You‚Äôre going to lose your audience if you keep this up. 

This is effectively a Game-Breaking update.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Please, please, please, listen to your players. You‚Äôre on the verge of losing a core audience. There are a million games out there we could be playing instead. This game was special exactly because it WAS so fluid and UI-free. 

You build the game for 40-60 hours a week; you live and breathe this game‚Äî- but you experience it as code and meetings and budgets and bug reviews.

Many of us spend 30-60 hours a week with our consciousness *in* the game world you‚Äôve created. While you may know everything objectively about the game, we may actually know more about it subjectively.

"VeigarMains","t5_34n2e","I thought this might be just really poor satire, but, judging by your previous post history, it seems like you are just unfortunately not quite good enough to know how bad you are. You seem to be a Zed main, so I'll tailor this advice to Zed. Zed has an incredibly easy time against Veigar. His ability to: bait out Veigar's spells with his W always threatening an engage which must be respected or responded to, dodge Veigar's cage by W'ing over it/ulting someone outside of it to avoid walking through it, all-in with the safety of Hexdrinker blocking a significant amount of Veigar's burst, trade harder with Electrocute in lane if Veigar goes something like Predator - or roam better than Veigar if Veigar goes for a lane keystone, all mean that Zed is favored in this matchup. Likewise, many other champions have very easy matchups against Veigar, so even if your Zed gets banned you will still have a plethora of available counter picks with similar playstyle. Since your favorite champ seems to have the upper hand, it seems incredibly unlikely that Veigar is actually broken. And, since you're still very low ranked, it seems incredibly likely that games which infuriate you enough to post about them are actually just games where you made a ton of mistakes and didn't realize you made them.

I'd recommend watching some Dopa vids where he plays squishy champs against assassins, so that you can learn what safe but squishy champions need to do to stay safe from you, which will let you learn about all of the mistakes your lane opponents in Bronze are making all the time. LS also has some really good videos. Even the stuff that is from like three seasons ago will be like 90% pure gold for learning about the fundamentals of how to play the game. ",1535760411

So like you say the article does mention 3 cases, but the only one resulting in any award was the doctor with the 10 year stalker, and again, the yelp review was hardly the reason behind it.  

Also, while I am generally too much of an idiot to do a google search, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  In terms of debate or arguing in good faith, that‚Äôs not my responsibility here. The person making the claim has the responsibility to back their argument up with sources. So, here we are trying to have what I would initially assume to be an argument in good faith. You make this dubious claim about some significant number of court cases, and for your source you link an article where the point made by the article‚Äôs headline is significantly if not totally diminished by the article itself (we call this ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù). I then read your source and point out to you that this source only supports your claim if you read the headline, and only the headline.  This basically nullifies your argument, but not in any permanent kind of way. In a good faith argument you would take the opportunity to find better sources and post them. Again, this isn‚Äôt my responsibility; it‚Äôs yours. It‚Äôs not up to the people who hear your argument to then go out and prove it for you. However, you‚Äôve proven my initial suspicion that you‚Äôre only out to either intentionally mislead people, or, your hunger for more outrage has you skimming headlines and articles and only seeing the parts you want to see, and in doing so you‚Äôre still misleading those who suffer from the same victimhood or outrage complex or whatever that you do by offering up bogus arguments backed by bogus sources.

"TapWizardRPG","t5_gka32","&gt; Does it not tell you how many charges it has and how many are needed?  Ah, I think I see what happened probably!  When it's charged, it just says, ""Charged!""  When not charged, it says: ""Charges: X/X""

I may have worded my points badly. Firstly I was wondering if the key would show how many completed charges it has if it stacks, otherwise it is fine as is, although some kind of visual indicator to show when it is fully charged would be nice. 

&gt; 2 things to keep in mind for Gauntlet Dungeons: it's shorter than a normal Dungeon, and you don't have to spend a key on it! 

As this is about the precursors the main point I want to try to make is the amount of precursors don't need to be as high as or higher than a regular ultimate dungeon, but more that the purchaseable reward scale with NG+. At NG+3 the difference between an ultimate dungeon reward and a Gauntlet reward is 5 precursors, which may not seem big but is a lot comparatively.

&gt; Overall, I'm pleased with your analysis of how much you want to run the Gauntlet.  It's actually spot on to what I was hoping for, believe it or not.  I want this mode to be an alternate game mode that you don't feel *forced* to play because it's hands down just better in terms of rewards. 

That's fair, forcing players into a gamemode (especially a time gated one) is not a good choice, the main thing I want from this however is a good reason to run it at least once per weekend, but the current set of multi-purchase rewards don't allow for that. 

&gt; I think even doing those 30 Gauntlet runs will be an accomplishment for most players.  If you do 5 raids each day of the event, you'll get 5 keys, and it'll take you 6 weeks to get the 30 medals for the permanent unlocks.  But that's 15 Raids and 5 Gauntlet Dungeons each of those 6 weekends...it's quite a lot actually!

When it's put into perspective like that the set up of the system begins to make more sense, it does seem like a pretty good accomplishment. 

&gt; So I'm ok if some players get the 30 medals then don't touch it again - but I expect some players will enjoy it just for the challenge and alternate way to play and whatnot.  And who knows, I could be totally wrong!  But it's very flexible of course, and we can change it later if it needs it.  Yahoo! :-D

It works for now, I've already stated my primary gripes with the gamemode (if I say them again I'm probably going to start sounding like a broken record) and as you mentioned some people will play it for the challenge, despite what I keep saying when comparing dungeons to the Gauntlet, I do quite enjoy making a build based around the modifiers so doing it basically for free each weekend doesn't sound too bad. 

&gt; I'm 90% sure that only utility runes will be rolled from here!  Hm, perhaps that should be changed or clarified...

So 17 utility runes, that's much more preferable, I'm more likely to get the runes I want from that. Part of me also would like if that doesn't include the cosmetic ones, they may be fun runes but personally I'd prefer to get a confirmed buff out of it. 

&gt; That is a good idea, and could be added in later I think!

Any chance I could get your thoughts on the multipurchase upgrades I suggested. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them. 

Anyway, keep up the good work, I'm looking forward to whatever will be coming next!

 But when it comes to Louis, the difference is that he doesn't *stand for masturbation*. He's a guy who has said what he did was inappropriate and was wrong.

It really just wasn't that bad, but more importantly by supporting him now you are not supporting his old actions because he no longer promotes that kind of jerking off.

IMO people shouldn't be able to go to universities full of young, impressionable adults and talk about how some people aren't deserving of basic respect (eg. using the pronouns someone asks you to use). Someone who has publicly endorsed enforced monogamy (ie. Jordan Peterson) shouldn't be given the platform he has.

I'm trans, and I worry for younger trans people. Their classmates are being exposed to really, really hateful stuff at younger and younger ages, before they're able to develop critical thinking skills. Some thirteen year old yelling ""lmao triggered!"" when a trans person talks about being misgendered is concerning to me. I worry about speakers who give credence to those ideas and make it seem like it's a fine alternative to being a kind person.

Bernie is secretly controlled by the deep state which is comprised of Hillary Clinton, Ali-A, G√ºnther √ñttinger and a small amount of Roblox youtubers.

But what are they trying to achieve? Very simple. Their secret plan all along is to manipulate gay frogs to steal the world's supply of walnut sauce in order to merge the souls of Steven Hawkins, Stefan Stefansson and Big Nigga in order to create a leader powerful enough to rule over the whole omniverse and all chromosomes within. Why? To eradicate Alex Jones. Why did you think did the following events all occur in a short amount of time: the discovery of chemicals that turn the fricking frogs gay, the death of Steven, Stefan und Big Nigga and the discovery of vaccines and autism?

As soon as their plan is complete they will press the red button, activating the vaccines and chemicals in our blood which will result in humanity becoming gay autists.

But who is the head of the deep state? Brace yourself because it's no one else.... 

Than Kony 2012. He will use the super entity to wipe out all the humans except africans. He hired the Somali pirates to intercept medical supply ships in order to prevent his vaccines reaching his people. As soon as every human is dead and Alex Jones defeated he will vaccinate the super entity, killing it and becoming the world leader in order to use all the resources on earth to finally solve the question he wanted answered for all of his life:

Overall it is actually a pretty decent lineup 

Ahn yujin-felt something really fishy with her rank. She has neither the best looks aka hyewon /Minju Nor good vocals. Charm is lacking as well so idk how she got up there.

Kim chaewon and Jo Yuri- I felt they were deserving to be of the final line up. Talented and well rounded individuals.

Hyewon and Minju - a lot of people criticise their rank but look at Tzuyu , who was favoured over other talented contestants for twice.

Chaeyeon and eunbi - nothing more to say, she deserves to debut

Wonyoung, Sakura, nako , yena - pretty much a locked in 

Hitomi - completes the Japanese line up. I would have very much preferred at least one more Japanese trainee though in favour yujin though.



Lee gaeun, chowon, Miho , miyu- personally I‚Äôm not too surprised they didn‚Äôt make it ; it is to be expected in a society which prioritizes looks over talent and with Yuri and chaewon going up (whom themselves are deserving of a debut), someone just  has to let ....

"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","You are still haunted with that guilt. Remember, they have been this way and treated him like a 2nd class family member for all his life.  This is first major life event.  They would have interfered no matter what, or pressured him and you (or whomever he married) into things just to be contrary.

Do you think you'd feel better if you caved and tolerated this awful behavior and let his family walk all over you?  Do you think he'd feel any more loved or respected, and do you believe you'd look back at your wedding with no regrets for not standing up for what you both really wanted?

If you caved during this wedding, you would've simply delayed the inevitable ""decision"" that he needs to make regarding how to engage with his family. They would have continued to treat him, and you, like crap. First house, first baby, first major move - they'd interfere, hurt, be contrary and deeply disappoint him.  

Don't even let your mind wander into guilt territory! And as you see, he is taking those very important first baby steps towards standing up for himself, like refusing to take down the FB post! 

You are actually showing him what unconditional love is, and what respect and care really mean.  All his life he normalized their behavior and just got used to their abuse, but with you in his life, he realized he deserved and was worth much more.  With you as his wife, he will feel true love, true support, and will have that confidence that no matter what, you are there for him. You will never treat him like his own family.

Tell him about your feelings of guilt.  I know it so heartbreaking for you to see him sad, especially during what should be a happy time. 

I hope you two can reach a happy decision jointly, and this final month of wedding planning can turn into something fun, special, and stress-free. MIL  and SIL want to be assholes? So be it. Not your duty to change them. Leave them out of all pre-wedding activities, or do the bare minimum to 'include' them, and then focus all your attention on the fun parts and the people who do care.  Don't return their calls anymore, don't interact unless necessary.

Simply put, stop playing their game.  That game only works if the have a willing participant. 

Wishing you the best for your talk tonight.  ",1535760419

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I'll represent this, roughly, by a segment; two extremities and a center, in wich we'll put the specific example of be yourself but not to the point of being completely selfish. Imagine that at one of the extremities we have ""make everyone happy to the point of forgeting one's own needs"". Inevitably in the other end that is supposed to represent the opposite of the first there will be ""be totally self-centered by taking in considerations only ones one needs"". Thoses are unhealthy behaviors. In this case what the center of this segment is representing ? Above all, there is going to be a pattern of behaviour based on a balance that draws its characteristics from both ends. So itll be something like ""being attentive to oneself while not forgeting that one lives in a society and that sometimes we have to make sacrifices for it"".
It is this balance center what i'm talking about, implicitly, when Im saying be yourself but not fully selfish.

   

I think its a proof of intelligence to be able to pinpoint the needs of oneself and those of the group we live in, being able to draw a consensus that will get it done for you without chagrin others. But as humans we'll never be this perfect, we'll never fully reach this absolute foresightedness to make the most balanced choices in our lives. Yet, we can still try to approach it. Thats my point.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Hoo man, making me think about what I've read this month.  I DO NOT KNOW. Fortunately goodreads does. 

Here's my [latest bingo card](https://imgur.com/a/PaGaKyX), a few updates, but not much in terms of filling squares.


This month I read:

**SiX Wakes by Mur Lafferty** - Easily 5 star reading. Isolated crew members on a generation ship wake up to find their previous bodies murdered, and their mental backup is from before the ship set off, oh right, they're all clones. As they try to figure out who the murderer is, and it could even be themself, they each become increasingly paranoid and things start going off the rails. We slowly construct their backstory leading to why they are each on the ship, the history &amp; cultural influence of clones and their complicated personal experiences as one.


**Graveyard Shift by Angela Roquet** - A story about a reaper set almost entirely in a peaceful, multicultural afterlife! The first half is solidly mundane fantasy, I loved all the day to day and infrastructural bits, the 2nd half things become more plotty trying to solve things going wrong with reapings and some secret missions and danger. Very fun. 

**Black Dog by Dave McKean** - This is non-fiction, but I think it goes here because it is a bit of a surrealism graphic novel, while also being a hard hitting biography about a war artist suffering from PTSD and grief.

**Artificial Condition by Martha Wells** - Even better than the first. Murderbot makes so many friends!

**Uncharted by Kevin J Andersen and Sarah A Hoyt** - A pulpy frontier explorer fantasy, following Lewis &amp; Clark on their journey west from St. Louis at the behest of renowned sorcerer Benjamin Franklin, in a dark magic filled world.

**City of Lost Fortunes by Bryan Camp** - Fantasy set in mondern new orleans post-katrina. Our protagonist has the power to find lost things, but after the storm he can hardly tap into it without crushing himself from the overwhelming loss, he manages to leverage it just enough to get by, or not quite. One day his debt is calle din by a trickster god, and he winds up at a supernatural card game playing with fates. A must read for fans of American Gods/Anansi Boys.

**The Merry Spinster by Mallory Ortberg** - A dark/creepy fairytale re-telling collection, a random library pickup that I wound up loving pretty much every one. 

**The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal** - Another one I knew was 5 stars pretty much right away and it thoroughly delivered. A meteorite hits earth, we follow a couple who are both scientist as they first deal with surviving it, then the impact (teheh) on their lives, finally become involved with an international effort to verify it's effects and get into space as a result.

I don‚Äôt feel sorry for Hillary if that‚Äôs what you are asking. Honestly it‚Äôs really more of an internal issue for the left, I find it odd that Trump supporters would really be so outraged that Hillary gamed the system versus Bernie. It also got conflated with her missing State Department e-mails, which in a way was more serious because it was an effort to avoid official transparency and not just political transparency. I don‚Äôt have a problem with the leaks that came out. I have an issue with Assange doing it specifically with the goal of aiding a Republican campaign for president. 

I think that statement by Assange was glib. The differences were there in things like the Supreme Court and the environment and immigration. I supported voting for Clinton in swing states and Jill Stein in safe states.

Merkel, Trump, and Putin are sitting on a beach by the North Sea after the G20 summit. Feeling the compulsion to brag in front of what he considers two of his international biggest rivals, Trump starts talking:

‚ÄúMy country has the best Submarines.‚Äù *hand gestures* ‚ÄúOur submarines can stay submerged for a whole year without fuel or oxygen.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù Says Putin, ‚ÄúEven our old Soviet submarines could stay submerged for at least two years!‚Äù

As the others continue to argue, Merkel is distraught. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù she thinks, ‚Äúwe Germans don‚Äôt like to have such a large military anymore, and we don‚Äôt have such good submarines.‚Äù

While Merkel is thinking of what she could say to impress her peers, a long, brown, misshapen, poo-like object begins rising from underneath bubbles out in the water.

I am not saying I know the root cause of why you have adrenal fatigue, but yes your job can be a factor. But also your lifestyle plays a role in it too. What I can tell you is to buy Ashwaganda and Rhadiola (herbs) on amazon, and add more proteins and veggies and less carbs into your diet. Also try napping daily, and making sure you have a fixed schedule of when you work/ take breaks. You should check out Dr. Axe on YouTube, he has lots of tips on fixing adrenal fatigue. Try to go to sleep no later than 10pm every night, and ensure to eat a HUGE breakfast every morning, that contains lots of protein. Also remember to stay hydrated.

You know me dax, I always feel we can disagree without being disagreeable. I hear your argument about individual colors developing their own culture. The part about that that is frustrating to me is the fact that colors already completely neglect their subs. I mean honestly why does Green defend from raids? Or how about Blue? When they‚Äôre not being raided they‚Äôre an absolute wasteland with no fresh content. The culture of the colors I‚Äôd prefer to see developed on the Reddit side of things.

The gift for Steve's birthday probably would have worked if you had planned it far in advance and given his best friend an itinerary to stick to. Paying for his friends to fly to see him is a nice thought but an empty gesture if you don't organize any party or activities for the group. Also, birthday gifts that involve third parties are difficult to execute. A simpler birthday present for Steve would have been a romantic trip with just the two of you, on a weekend of his choosing. 

With your sister, were there any definitive plans that she (and her partner) were clearly invited to? If not, then of course they'd prefer to spend time together and be in charge of their plans, instead of waiting to hear from you or from mom. I actually was in the same situation as your sister during a family vacation once (except I paid my own way). I brought my partner with me to the family vacation, but the planned activities weren't until the second day, so for the first night I planned a romantic dinner for just me and my partner. Got angry texts from my family when I didn't show up to the impromptu family dinner that was not planned at all, that I had been invited to 30 seconds before it started, at a location to which no one gave me the name or address. Like your sister, I told them it was not up for discussion. 

If you like traveling with friends, I would suggest you be more choosy about your trips. Choose a location that means something to you, and invite one person who you think will appreciate it with you. Plan it and choose dates together.

The first time the project comes to fruition feels like putting on a fancy hat that says ""I did this!"" Then I'll look at some inefficiencies and mistakes, fix a few, remember the rest... annnnnnd I'm bored. 

Learning anything further seems like a tedious repetition of previous topics that don't go much deeper, considering starting from little to no knowledge. 

I'll move on to the next new hobby, or reboot one that I got bored with in the past, build upon it and discover something new. Rinse &amp; repeat.

&gt; # [Barroso pede que PT apresente substituto de Lula em 10 dias - Politica](https://imgs.em.com.br/estadodeminas/logo_face.png)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; postado em 31/08/2018 20:27- - - - - -
&gt; 
&gt; O ministro Luis Roberto Barroso, do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), votou na noite desta sexta-feira, 31, para que o registro da candidatura do ex-presidente Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva seja impugnado e que o PT apresente, no prazo de dez dias, o nome de outro candidato √† Presid√™ncia para substitu√≠-lo.
&gt; 
&gt; Segundo apurou o Broadcast Pol√≠tico, plataforma de not√≠cias em tempo real do Grupo Estado, caso a posi√ß√£o de Barroso seja acompanhada pela maioria dos ministros, a decis√£o ser√° publicada nesta sexta-feira, produzindo efeitos imediatos. Como consequ√™ncia, o PT ficar√° impedido de fazer propaganda eleitoral de Lula, principalmente no hor√°rio eleitoral gratuito de r√°dio e televis√£o.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Declaro a inelegibilidade de Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva e, por consequ√™ncia, indefiro seu registro de candidatura para concorrer ao cargo de presidente da Rep√∫blica. Faculto √† coliga√ß√£o substituir o candidato Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva no prazo de dez dias, vedo a pr√°tica de atos de campanha, em especial a veicula√ß√£o de propaganda eleitoral relativa √† campanha presidencial no r√°dio e na televis√£o, at√© que se proceda substitui√ß√£o e determino a retirada do nome do candidato da programa√ß√£o da urna"", disse Barroso.
&gt; 
&gt; Em seu voto, o relator minimizou um dos pontos chaves da defesa do PT, que √© decis√£o do Comit√™ de Direitos Humanos da Organiza√ß√£o das Na√ß√µes Unidas (ONU), que recomendou ao Brasil que n√£o impe√ßa Lula de concorrer √† elei√ß√£o at√© que o processo da Lava Jato que resultou em sua condena√ß√£o transite em julgado. Para Barroso, a decis√£o da entidade ""n√£o pode ser acatada"" pela Justi√ßa brasileira ""nem como recomenda√ß√£o"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""O Comit√™ de Direitos Humanos √© um √≥rg√£o administrativo, sem compet√™ncia jurisdicional. Por esse emotivo, suas recomenda√ß√µes, mesmo quando definitivas, e n√£o √© o caso, n√£o t√™m efeito vinculante como √© pac√≠fico na doutrina. (A decis√£o da ONU) tem car√°ter recomenda√ß√£o e n√£o possui efeito juridicamente vinculante, √© o que diz a delega√ß√£o permanente do Brasil em Genebra junto √†s Na√ß√µes Unidas"", afirmou. ""A recomenda√ß√£o do Comit√™ de Direitos Humanos da ONU quanto ao direito de elegibilidade n√£o pode ser acatada por este Tribunal Superior Eleitoral"", complementou.
&gt; 
&gt; Barroso tamb√©m destacou o fato de o governo brasileiro n√£o ter colocado em vigor o protocolo que tornaria as decis√µes deste comit√™ relevantes para a Justi√ßa brasileira. ""Suas normas (ONU) n√£o est√£o em vigor entre n√≥s. H√° aus√™ncia de for√ßa vinculante das recomenda√ß√µes emitidas por comit√™ da ONU. A posi√ß√£o √© inequ√≠voca, o protocolo n√£o constitui direito interno no Brasil. A decis√£o da ONU foi proferida sem oitiva do Estado brasileiro"".
&gt; 
&gt; Por fim, Barroso recha√ßou qualquer argumento de ""persegui√ß√£o pol√≠tica"" por parte da campanha do ex-presidente. ""Todas as institui√ß√µes est√£o em funcionamento regular. O Judici√°rio √© independente"".

The laziness but also the disincentive to actually tackle the hard problems is a symptom with many causes but its exasperated by greed. Its why puerto rico is still on the rocks, its a model for the future where everything is bought out by private interests during the crisis and they have everyone by the balls because its literally life and death when the power/food/transportation/communications all breaks down.

Logically you would look at how it would affect emotions and all the outcomes, but an overall decision for nearly anything should be made of a logical ‚Äúdata‚Äù instead of emotional excitement. 

For example so and so took someone‚Äôs land back in whatever old or new era for their people.  Although it hurts the occupying settlement or civilization, if it helps their people survive and expand and reproduce then that‚Äôs logical based off what you said. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? 

Although there can be emotional backlash over hurting or whatever other people it wouldn‚Äôt be logical to let your own people suffer for the sake of another being. That of course brings war and people die and the outcome is defined then regardless of who wins, but based off a logical decision of survival it was a decision that would have to be made. Of course you can say that it was also an emotional decision for caring for others, but that would clash with the emotional decisions of people not wanting to hurt others. Logically it would need to be done if survival depended on it. If survival does not then logically it wouldn‚Äôt make sense even if people wanted to take the land.

Honestly, they don't.  They will sometimes respond in broken English, though, if for whatever reason they didn't understand you and think you might be a tourist.  

The reason this kind of comment gets downvoted is because it's usually some retard overestimating their language capabilities.

But that isn't what we're talking about, is it? The adult in this situation made a choice: to approach a minor. This doesn't sound like a guy who has bad thoughts but keeps them to himself; he's making the bold move of accosting a minor in public. Fuck him.

In direct talking with the person\* I'm prepared to, but it'll make me think of whether I want to continue that campaign. Like do I really want to play that way - if I want to play with that person either they have to change or I do. I can do a kids glove game...but do I want to? Sometimes, for a limited amount of RL time, maybe I do. Other times no. At which point I consider wrapping up the campaign early. Yes, it's a good idea to vet players for this before play - but in some respects you think the rules they are agreeing to would have done that already. But I guess as much as people gamble money they can't afford to lose, people agree to rule sets that will kill their PC and break their little hearts.

The coworker who stole my fucking commissions would openly admit that she didn't *neeeed* to work there (or anywhere really) because her parents were loooooooaded but her mom refused to buy her any more shoes, since she already had over 100 pairs (my jaw dropped. I owned only 3-4 pair and none of them expensive). So she needed a job to support her shoe addiction. Every time we got new stock or new styles, she'd buy probably 4-5 pairs, dropping over $200 easy in one go which just absolutely floored me.

The one thing that I remember is that we made absolutely shit unless we were selling the high priced expensive running shoes OR a pair of expensive hiking or work boots.

A couple of times I had customers follow me into the stockroom, which was super weird. There was also one night when it was super dead and a woman called, asking me to describe *in detail* every single black women's shoe that we had. It was super dead and I was bored AF so I indulged her. We had more than 50 different kinds of black woman's shoe. (Like black shoes that were for women, not shoes for black women.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I agree they are boring, but they are my favorite fiction books aside from Watership Down, which has almost the same feel as LOTR but is actually fun to read. Here's why I say this: I don't read fiction. I only read stuff that's related to history. I am a big fan of the LOTR movies and the LOTR secondary world. I am interested in the same stuff as JRR Tolkien (Beowulf, languages, medieval europe, etc.) and I feel a kind of spiritual connection to him in that I relate very much to his style and his purpose in writing. Even though LOTR are boring books and I can't believe people actually read them every year I still got so much out of reading them because they just wouldn't be the same without a 20 page expos√© on hobbits or the entire known history of Bree. That stuff is nonfiction writing in a fiction setting, and that's probably why I like it. You see, I ONLY read boring books. To me, if a book isn't boring, that is a surprising turn of events.

The spot, released Tuesday, also credits the freshman senator for securing federal aid dollars that Congress sent to the Lone Star State in the wake of the devastating hurricane that hit southeastern Texas in August 2017. The ad also suggests that O'Rourke, a congressman from El Paso who recently appeared within striking distance of Cruz's Senate seat in an NBC News/Marist poll, opposed helping his fellow Texans.

Are Cruz's claims in the ad accurate?
Did O'Rourke vote against Harvey aid?

‚ÄúCongressman Beto O‚ÄôRourke? So irresponsible that he even voted against Hurricane Harvey tax relief,"" the ad says.

It's true O'Rourke voted against a tax relief bill, though the claim leaves out the fact that O'Rourke did vote for several other bills that provided Harvey aid to Texans. O'Rourke voted against one bill ‚Äî H.R.3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 ‚Äî that contained tax breaks for victims of the hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

In Austin on Wednesday, O'Rourke defended his decision, saying he'd ""voted for more than $90 billion in aid for Hurricane Harvey victims"" and the bill Cruz is highlighting just wasn't a good deal for victims.",1535760439

"copywriting","t5_2qq49","First of all, nice work. You're on the right track.    
I think your best stuff is the Whole Foods, but it needs a tagline. Do more of these for national brands that pay for ads that everyone sees (cleaning supplies, tourism, banks,  etc.) . Don't worry if it's fake. Everyone knows it's just portfolio work. @ThrasherLA is correct. Do experiential, guerilla marketing ideas that would most likely never get made in the real world. Agencies want to see big ideas. It's their job to reel you back in. Do a google image search for 'guerrila marketing.' Even if there's no copy, it's about the idea.  


Think in terms of strategy and concept. Strategy = unique selling point, differentiators of the brand. Then use a cohesive concept to convey that strategy in at least 3 executions of print/digital/guerilla.   


Bourdain, LeBron, Felix, and Seam stuff I see working in your 'about me' as more of a link to another blog of yours unrelated to your portfolio. This is a good way to show that you're interesting. Other ways to do this are standup comedy, short stories, fun videos with friends, etc.   


Here's a good resource of portfolios: [https://creativecircus.edu/talent-search/](https://creativecircus.edu/talent-search/)

Set reps can stay the same but if you break out OHP you‚Äôve got some weird split to setup for OHP day that is supposed to dovetail with the other days somehow that have their own splits except one of them is now missing one of its main splits so you have to do something with that day and look, now you are not really doing CAP3 at all anymore. OHP is a T2 lift configured into leg shoulder split day. That appears to be fairly fundamental to CAP3. This is evidenced by the ton of questions on how to program more progression for OHP in CAP3. Clearly fundamental is a B-D-S T1 lift rotation with specific muscle group splits programmed against that backdrop.

I am not saying your point isn‚Äôt perfectly good. I am saying that your point doesn‚Äôt seem to serve the purpose of reconfiguring CAP3 for a 5 day program while maintaining the core features of what makes CAP3 the program that it is. I think you are really onto something with the idea that if CAP3 isn‚Äôt working for your schedule you might want to seriously look at doing something besides CAP3 because it‚Äôs actually pretty difficult to rework it into a 5 day program and keep it essentially CAP3.",1535760443

I used to feel dizzy over the notion that perhaps this life is all there is. After we‚Äôre gone, then what? What‚Äôs the point? While i cant say for certain I believe there‚Äôs absolutely nothing after death, I certainly don‚Äôt believe in the Christian version of the afterlife. All of this aside, realizing that this may really be all there is has caused me to slow down, to quit feeling guilty for who I am and the things I like. Christianity basically teaches you to deny yourself in this life so that in the next life you can live an improved version of this life. That‚Äôs a bit reductionist, but you understand. ‚ÄúWell have new bodies and walk on streets of gold...‚Äù this attitude really leads you to a pretty austere life. Leaving Christianity allowed me to more present in THIS body. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for but just my two cents.

Nose is cherry cola. Sweet and tart. The caramel and vanilla almost hide behind all this cherry. 

Taste is a little hot, but that‚Äôs to be expected. Hot in a good way though as it helps balance the sweetness. A little woody and still a little tart. 

Finish. It‚Äôs all cherry Coke on the back end.  Lasts for a while. Slight oak tannins back here too. 

This is basically cask strength Eagle Rare. And I don‚Äôt know if that makes me glad I can get a great sipper like ER straight from the barrel, or if it makes me mad that all the juice isn‚Äôt used to make this. Either way, I‚Äôm glad BT decided to bottle this. ",1535760447

I have read since I was a child, and fantasy has always been my favorite genre. 

Recently read Dave Barras lightship Chronicles. I just finished Butchers Codex of Alera. I'm halfway through Memories of Ice of the Malazan series...

The complexity of the world intrigues me greatly, and I have no issues keeping tabs on the many different characters. However, I am contemplating on ending the series after I am finished with this book. There's just something with the series that bores me and I can not put a finger on it. 

Should I continue with House of Chains? 

I'm also looking for a completed series that has a strong female protagonist. (I haven't ever read a series that focused on one before) I prefer for the writing to be less ""wordy."" There are times within Malazan books where the wordiness just becomes too much. Yes I am talking about Kruppe here! (: 

Any series focusing on a strong female lead would be interesting for me. My ideal scenario would be akin to Lawrence's Broken empire with some magic involved with of course a female protagonist. Thank you!

I wish I had facebook friended nice kids from my classes, and then...you know, tried to take them out for a cup of coffee, hung out with them outside class, learned what they liked. Something.

I wish I had asked to be invited to shit. I wish I had made a little effort. 

If nothing else - do not let this tank your grades/professional development.

eta: This is *not* easy. I felt very alone during college orientation, and lost. But try to do some orientation events, facebook friend people (our orientation group had their own FB page), and just...find a way to stay connected.

"NYYankees","t5_2rp0g","That's kind of misleading because of how good St. Louis is at 1B. Voit didn't really start to figure it out until he was 24/25 (not unlike Judge) when he started to play better, from 2015 to 2016 his OPS in the minors went from .765 to .816. From 2016 to 2017 his OPS went from .816 to .972 and he finally got his call-up to the bigs. In 31 starts and 62 overall games at first, he put up a .736 OPS with STL... definitely not great, but far from horrible in your first taste of the majors. In 2018 he only got to make 3 starts with STL in which he had a .762 OPS, super small sample size, but again not terrible. Herein lies the problem: St. Louis already has a platoon at first with Jose Martinez and Matt Carpenter, who are both really fucking good, and have career OPS of .857 and .867 respectively, that's excellent production. Mark Texiera has a career .869 OPS - that's how good those guys are. So there is obviously no place for him in that duo. If you look prior to 2017/2018, they had Matt Adams in 2016, who very much held his own at a .780 OPS so they really had no reason to replace him. Remember they don't have a DH in the NL so there is nowhere for a third guy in that rotation that really only plays 1B

So what about Voit? After doing very much average in his first 170 big league at-bats, he went back to AAA. Back in AAA he put up a .896 OPS, so not as hot as his time in 2017, but damn good and something that indicates maybe he is getting better at putting the ball in play. But there is still no room for him in STL, and it's not because he's a AAA player, but because they have 2 borderline all-stars in STL already at the position

I am not ready to write him off yet. He's old for his level of inexperience at 27, but for a guy that's been consistently improving over the last 5 years, and is only one year older than Judge, I'm hoping we see him get a shot to be our guy maybe for a few years there. I understand PROBABLY he isn't, but all the numbers kind of stack up to say his success so far this year isn't entirely out of the blue, and he's probably not going to keep that 1.000 OPS up, but he could be a guy that puts up .800 to .850, which would be an absolute GOD SEND considering our lack of first base production over the last few years",1535760450

I honestly don't know, it just seems like a paradox to me. It's Schroedinger's Understanding: I understand what you're saying, but my ""rational"" brain is saying ""that just doesn't make sense!"", possibly because society has always taught ""Women are feminine, men are masculine"".

&gt;The real issue is with you not quite seeing non-feminine women as counting as real, perfectly worthwhile women that plenty of people can be interested in, including straight people.

I never said anything about non-feminine women not being real or worthwhile, you're either misunderstanding what I'm saying or just taking it out of context. I'm accepting of everyone. I'm merely talking about the androgynous butch lesbians, since to some people they do look like men/boys, I'm not talking about tomboys, which I've always defined as a a girl/woman that dresses like a boy, but is still clearly identifiable as a female.

"texas","t5_2qho4","How kind of you to provide a link after someone else in the thread has already done so, and highlighted the rank hypocrisy of Ted Cruz trying to criticize Beto for voting in the same way Cruz did.

I am curious though. It is noticeable the way Cruz ""supporters"" are bombarding this sub with negative news about Ted Cruz today.

Why the negativity? Are you guys unable to think of anything positive Ted Cruz has done the last 6 years he's been a Senator? Is he so dull that there are no inspiring words he has uttered that you guys can post? Maybe Donald Trump is spot on when he says:

&gt; [Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/703984812105793536?s=19)

I must say the technique is very similar to the negative campaigning we saw against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Are you guys part of the Mercer/Cambridge Academia team, or the Russia team? Mercer of course used his experience in getting African dictators elected to aid Cruz in 2016. And the Russians left plenty signs they supported Ted Cruz getting elected in 2016. Just curious who you're representing.

Pretty clear that whether you want to turn the US into an oligarchy and/or destroy the US then Ted Cruz is an important part of that plan. Also in 2018.

Ik vind het zo raar dat we zoveel chineze studenten opleiden terwijl iedereen weet dat er uiteindelijk een clash van EU/NAVO versus China gaat komen.



China is een dictatoriale staat die hun noordse stammen uitroeit, Tibet vernietigd, Taiwan intimideerd en Noord korea steunt en waar Chi zich net als dictator heeft gevestigd terwijl hij een van de meest vergrijpende sociale controle systemen aankondigde.


In de Tiananmen Slachting hebben ze honderden als niet duizenden mensen vermoord, dit is een woord dat niet eens meer in het Chineze internet vermeld mag worden.



Maar dat ik op de universiteit zat waren er chineze studenten a plenty, en was er een beetje het algemene idee dat niet elke chinees het eens is met het regime. Maar.. Het is een communistisch regime. In china leven nog honderden miljoenen als boeren, hun kinderen gaan niet naar de universiteit in nederland. Enige Chineze studenten die je ziet in nederland zijn partijgenoten of de kinderen van partijgenoten. Dat is niet propaganda van mijn kant, dat is zelfs propaganda van China's kant, ze ontkennen dit niet. De studenten die je in Nederland ziet zijn pro regime, anders waren ze er niet. 



Ik vind dit persoonlijk erg raar. Waarom doen we dit als Nederlanders? Hetzelfde geld overigens voor studenten uit Saoedi Arabie. Of Rusland. Of enig soortgelijk land. Tijdens de koude oorlog deden we dit echt niet voor Russen. We gingen die niet opleiden ofzo. In mijn tijd waren er alleen nog colleges waar Iranezen dan niet bij mochten zijn.. 



We weten dat we kaarsrecht tegenover deze landen staan in vrijwel alles. En ik ben niet tegen mensen van deze landen, maar enige studenten van deze landen zijn overduidelijk, en per definitie, gesteund door het regime, anders mogen ze niet studeren. 



Dus waarom blijven we ze opleiden? Waarom blijven we wetenschap met ze delen? De veiligheidsdiensten en grote Nederlandse bedrijven hebben enorm veel moeite technologie en intelectual property uit de handen van Chinezen te houden.

What will happen on cam? We're not sure exactly! The clothes might come off, toys might come out... Either way, we're certain it will be an organic and fun time!

Access to the show is **$30**. If you want to see our full faces, it's an additional $60 (and we'll probably go even longer!)

We will be using a Logitech C920 for that extra quality ;)

***

We are together in person and ready to have some fun with you! Some ideas for the fun we can have together: Femdom (SPH, findom, humiliation, so many options!), mutual masturbation, JOI... Tell us what you have in mind!


$**4/min** for text/pics/some videos, or $**6/min** to make it video heavy from us both! We show both show full face for +$60. 10 minute minimum. Message here or on Kik (*purplehailstorm1*) when you‚Äôre ready to purchase!


**LIMITS**

- Penetration
- Kissing
- Oral/blowjob play


We accept payment through **Bitcoin**, Ethereum, Litecoin, **Circle Pay**, Indiebill (+15%), and Amazon (+fee).

I learned the facts very rapidly (not in the gradual way some learn about the lies). I was a convert, and it was more traumatic and horrifying than I can describe. It's clear now that my belief in the church was fatally injured the minute I learned just one HUGE part of what I had been told was false, but I honestly kept hoping there was a middle ground. I did not wake up one morning wanting to leave the church. 

Unfortunately, if your nature is to seek the truth and look for facts, there are no comfortable demilitarized zones in the church. At least not for me. I know some people who learned things in a different way (they were inoculated with the facts early on), and since the church is their heritage, they make it work for themselves. These are smart people, who I respect, and maybe they're the ones who decide to believe or want to believe rather than simply ""believe."" 

My own integrity would not allow me to remain a member. It took a few months for me to get up my nerve and also to fully accept I needed to leave. But when it's over, it's over. ",1535760457

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","Poverty should always anchor to an absolute standard instead of to the median. Poverty invokes the impression that one is going without necessity, not being slightly worse off in the land of Kings.

An average Joe in a first world country is in the top 1% globally. Saying someone is poor for having 40% less than the 1%er trivialise the struggle of the actual poor.

To put it in perspective, take the proverbial 1% in the '99%' rally, take the median of that (the 0.5%), and the bottom of the 1% say they are poor and the government need to step in to help them.

I would absolutely say there are poverty if the only food available is a loaf of bread a month for 50% +1 of the population where a median based measure will reject that's a problem, whereas I will reject that there is a problem if half the population is driving Toyota instead of Aston Martins, where the median measure will cry poverty.

Komami on the other hand had the high's of the 90's and 2000's with games like Slient Hill, Metal Gear Solid, etc but now also the lows of the 2010's where it turned those properties into gambling machines.

All of a sudden my lighter that was working fine was no longer working. After trying everything I decided to adjust the flame settings. Turns out while my lighter has a low setting, it will not work unless it is placed at a certain point. So play around with the flame settings, you might have it set too low for it to work, and while you may want it at a different setting the lighter isn't having it. Good luck.

So, what do you propose, that all corporations become cooperatives? That would be a form for theft.

If your argument is that cooperatives are always better than corporations, that's not true either. Cooperatives don't have an intrinsic business advantage otherwise, we'd see more major enterprises being cooperatives rather than corporations. 

Lastly, your argument stems around equality. Sure, I won't argue against the notion that corporations are a source of inequality for society, but that's not your change my view argument. 

Your argument was:

&gt; If Democracy is good for our communities and how we govern, then it follows that **Democracies are good for enterprise** and where we work.

The point I'd like to contend with is that employee run democracies are not good for enterprises. For enterprises, the metric of success is not reducing societal inequality but surviving in the business world.

And of course their other partner gets hit with some of that too. It's not good. It's rightly frowned upon.

But just because some of your feelings are related to stereotypical jealousy and double standards doesn't automatically eclipse the crisis you're in right now, which is a practical concern for your health and the marriage itself, and not about fairness, or how you *should* feel.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Not to be too alarmist but I just read a book ( [John Dean used it extensively for his book ""Conservatives w/o Conscience""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatives_without_Conscience) ) detailing 40+ years of studying personalities and specifically Authoritarianism and it's nuts. Not like in a ""this is another crazy day with Donald Trump and his supporters"" but more like, this is the beginning of real threats to our freedom, and safety. That real violence is coming and these ""trump supporters"" want it. They need it. These are people who would, if told by the Government, that if Journalists were to be killed, they would do it. And with a sense of joy.  


""Trump Supporters"", the core base, are Authoritarians. They have to do what the law/authority say. Even, in studies, when it punishes them. This core or about 25% of Americans, would end the Bill of Rights, and any protection provided by the constitution. They would, in fact, get rid of the Constitution if they could. This data is from many many studies. Authoritarians want a dictator, hate peace and are more afraid in general.  


That's 1 in 4 Americans, the ""patriots"" would love to end that very system they profess to love.  


The other most disturbing finding is that, not just Authoritarians but anyone who feels they are ""right"" or ""doing good"", are the ones who do the worst. The feeling of righteousness allows them to do mean ass shit to people.  


The other big take away from this free book is, that Authoritarians want people to fight them. They want anger and violence. That is exactly what they want. Antifa are only helping them when they fight.  


Any way, everyone who spends time on this sub or is having a hard time understanding how Trump got where he is, and how American got where it is,[this book has changed my entire understanding of the Authoritarian personality and who they are, and why they are.

"IdiotsInCars","t5_3aimx","I have to say I obey traffic laws at all times. With the exception of speeding up to 10mph over. I‚Äôve never been in an accident (not while I was driving) and I‚Äôve never even been pulled over. That‚Äôs twenty years of driving. (Ew, when did I get that old?!)

Who could possibly be mad at a cyclist breaking a traffic law to avoid an accident? It‚Äôs certainly not me. I couldn‚Äôt even be mad at a motorist for breaking a traffic law in order to avoid a collision. 

What I‚Äôm referring to is things like a cyclist on a one lane road with no passing and a speed limit of 40mph and they just maintain the middle of the lane. Some cyclists are courteous and will slow down and move over to right and wave for you to pass. That‚Äôs what I call sharing the road. Especially when it‚Äôs like 7:30am and the cyclist has to know the people behind him are trying to go to work. I would never speed up and pass in the wrong lane but I sure see a lot of people do it and it creates a dangerous situation for everyone. 

Then the real kicker is when the afore mentioned road meets up with a larger one where there‚Äôs a red light with some cars already lined up. The cyclist just blows right through the line of cars and through the light if it‚Äôs clear and adds to the line of infuriated motorists behind him. I see stuff like that here in Colorado on the daily. And for as bad as the motorists are here...I only ever experience road rage when it comes to cyclists. 

I‚Äôm not strictly anti-cyclists. But, admittedly when I see one I assume they‚Äôre going to be an a-hole until they prove me wrong. My old roommate was an avid cyclist and he‚Äôs been hit numerous times, even intentionally. So, I get why cyclists are super defensive/hostile towards motorists. But, why put yourself in that situation? Even if you do have the right of way or whatever, is it worth it to put your life at risk? I know people in cars can be dicks. But, it‚Äôs no reason to be a jerk or put yourself in that kind of position. 

I used to ride a motorcycle. So, I get it. I‚Äôm respectful of cyclists and I maintain a safe distance at all times. If I‚Äôm approaching an intersection or a situation like the one in the video, I try to make eye contact with the cyclist to make sure we see each other, etc. 

Being on a bicycle or a motorcycle, you‚Äôre automatically at risk for far more injury and should drive as if everyone is a complete moron no matter what even if you have the right of way. Even on a motorcycle, if I had been approaching the intersection in that video, I would assume the car might pull out in front of me. I would slow down and attempt to make eye contact with the driver to be sure he saw me. Especially since he sat there for an extended pause with no traffic and could have made the turn well before the cyclist reached that point. I would have been aware that the driver could very well have been distracted and I would have been cautious. 

But, hey that‚Äôs just me. I think I need a nap. ",1535760472

I used a Fire Heide for a while, which is awesome in some places, but not as good as my Ish in most.  

I did most of the game with Ish/Xita/Dark Dunk/Light Gretel.  That team will get you super far and the dunk and gretel are super easy to skill up, so you can drop all your buns into the Xita to max that damage.

They are just playing the same plays, from the same playbook that they always have since they invented pharma drugs, bullshit and lies to make people think the safe products (plants) are dangerous and the white powders (pills) are safe so they make trillions of dollars. The greedy corrupt bastards are generations deep, the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and their longstanding ties with the Bushes and other politicians goes generations deep. 
Reefer madness worked, ask a old person from that generation, they believed it. There was no alternative TV, or radio. There was only a couple of ways to spread the word. Ya they had free speech back then, but no one could hear them because the powers that be own the media. Well those powers most certainly own most of the media, which is painfully obvious when you see all the smear job FDA propoganda stories.... But, and this is a big one... We have the internet. Our voices can be heard and we can get the truth out there. Hence why the feds are trying to silence the internet. Movement of the masses is the only thing that works to change any of the corruption. The biggest fear of any ruler/dictator is a mob of hundreds of thousands of people coming for them. The Civil rights movement was won by mass protests in the streets. The women's right movement was won by mass protest in the streets. The war on drugs was introduced so they could have a war on the hippies and blacks (black panthers movement was huge back when Nixon was in) and stop the masses in the streets.. Mass protests in the streets scares the shit out of the evil fuckers. It is by far the most powerful and effective weapon the people have. Non Chomsky says this as well. Kratom was going to be banned but people hit the streets and signed the petition.

2. ‚ÄúActress goes braless to grocery store!‚Äù is worse, of course. 

3.  Male actors are also heavily sexualized, so they also get their fair share of questions about their looks and diets. That part doesn‚Äôt bother me as much because that‚Äôs what sells, unfortunately. If I have a problem with a particular question I always let the interviewer know. 

4. Not like that, thank god, but I can tell that that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre going for from the wardrobe and the shots. 

5. Oh that‚Äôs very common, but I never did anything like it. I always try to keep my private life private. 

6. That‚Äôs rare since I really respect most people I work with, and doing something like that is pretty risky. But less intense things happen constantly. Hands where they‚Äôre not supposed to be, flirting, inappropriate comments, etc. 

7. Well, it‚Äôs harder to have casual sex, but it‚Äôs not because of reputation necessarily. It‚Äôs not easy to find people you can trust - sometimes it seems like men are just approaching you because of their idea of who you are and because of your name and status, so maybe that makes the process a little more difficult.

"siliconvalley","t5_2qovh","An EMS's kit is going to be vastly more comprehensive than what you need. A home trauma kit should include detailed instructions on how to use everything in it (that's not, well, obvious), and a basic first aid book should describe how to handle just about any injury you're qualified to handle as a regular citizen without a medical background. Good to have in the house regardless. If you're super paranoid, there are plenty of classes that teach advanced first aid techniques and CPR too.

Basically, the biggest difference is that it has more stuff in it. Examples include quickclot to stop intense bleeding, a tourniquet for temporarily stopping bleeding in limbs (albeit controversial since often a tourniquet in the wrong hands can do more damage than just applying pressure to slow the bleeding, I still prefer having one and not using it over not having one and wishing I did while shoddily improvising one and hoping for the best), mine has a C-collar for stabilizing a neck (since it used to be for rock climbing, and spinal injuries are somewhat more common in that hobby), trauma shears for cutting away clothing rather than trying to delicately remove it, and lots of bigger bandages, compression dressings, gauze, and so on.

Remember, the only goal here is to patch yourself or someone else up just enough to keep them from dying until either medical assistance can reach them or they can reach medical assistance. It's first aid not field trauma surgery. Leave the medicine to the medical pros, just keep the person alive and away from danger.",1535760475

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Hey guys.  I am a budget, casual player who runs odd rogue/pala and zoo.  I have thought long and hard and decided since I have so many good shaman cards already, I should make both midrange and even shaman.  I know they are tier 2 but they look very fun to play and my goal is only rank 5.

&amp;#x200B;

For even shaman I just need TLC, kalimos and then al'akir.  

For tempo shudderwok I just need TLC, kalimos (as above), plus shudderwok.

&amp;#x200B;

Few questions

1) I see a lot of non corpsetaker even shamans and am leaning this direction to save dust.  Is it better/worse or about the same strength?  Is it really still worth crafting al'akir without corpsetaker?  I see VS has a non corpsetaker list that still runs al'akir.

2) Who is better for climbing - even or tempo?  Who should I craft first (I know a personal choice but want others opinions if you don't mind) as far as fun and competitive etc.

3) What is the best tempo shudder out there in your guys opinion?

4) I also have the 7 cost legendary shaman card make every minion a legend.  I saw tempostorm post something about using that in a deck rather than thrall.  I also have thrall, what are your thoughts on who is better or running both?

I plan to wait til next Thursday and then make my move.  I have enough dust to make either deck right now, then finish the other deck relatively soon (will get there sooner with non corpsetaker version, and could almost make both decks without al'akir).  I wanna wait to see what VS says next week but then very likely will spend all my dust for these decks.

Thanks as always for the help!!!",1535760476

Rokhan is just the troll connection to the Zandalari trolls in BFA. He doesn't even have a unique model, which means he will do very little or nothing for the rest of the expansion. 

Baine in a situation where it feels like Blizzard doesn't know what to do with him, as they already used the ""I won't go back to the horde"" card with Saurfang. So what exactly is Baine going to do in BFA?

As a mix of both Persian and Arab, I‚Äôve personally felt that Arabs are - overall - less cultured now than during my parents age, but I understand that in the context of how war shapes people in their societies (lack of stable educational infrastructure). Also, factoring in the brain drain from these war torn countries, and it becomes clear who is left behind.

The only hate I feel is after seeing Sunni Arabs try to justify genocide of Persians (we‚Äôre too diverse apparently). Also, there are Arabs that aren‚Äôt particularly skillful but consider themselves above everyone due to new money (see: Gulf States). They don‚Äôt contribute much - and their level of intolerance to anyone that is not of ‚Äòtheir rank‚Äô has disgusted me several times. But again, I don‚Äôt hate them because they are Arab, I hate them because they‚Äôre assholes. Assholes exist everywhere.

The sooner you can own it, and start making every preparation possible, the more mature and responsible you will appear ( and in fact, BE,) for everyone involved.  Your partner needs 100% support, and you can't afford to waste time worrying about what people are going to think if you are serious about being a father.  Get excited!!!!!  If they can't be excited with/for you, they'll either come around, or you will put some necessary distance between you to clear your head for what is to come.  As for actually HOW to do it, I recommend writing an email or letter, so you have time to think it out clearly, do some editing.  Focus on why it is what you want, and what you plan to do to make it go as well as possible.  Be clear about what sort of emotional/financial/practical support you may need, and be ready to have all of that denied; a man doesn't need anyone else to tell him his own truth about what he wants and what he is ready to strive for.
