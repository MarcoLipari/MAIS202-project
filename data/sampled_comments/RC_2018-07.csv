I understand we don't know who the mother is in the Afton family so it isn't crazy that a family member is unaccounted for, but Foxy bro was actually present at one point. Where is he now then if his supposedly younger brother is older and his Dad is just absent from his life since he is busy being dead and haunting people. I also am thrown by A) Foxy bro watching TV and Mike watching TV in SL (yes, anybody can watch TV, but this just doesnt feel coincidental to me) and B) UCN does seem to hint heavily at a brother rivalry with the Freddy/Foxy anime and one kid (BV?) haunting the player.",1530403200

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","You do understand that if you do not eat meat, you need to supply those nutrients with plants correct?

Different kinds of cereals and grasses can be stored long term. They themselves do not contain all of the nutrients necessary for a healthy diet. However, when fed to an animal the animal synthethizes the amino acids into the necessary nutrients.

A human in winter has two options, to eat the plants that provide the nutrients they need (which requires international importation of fruits and vegetables form other nations) or to eat locally produced chicken. 

You need to understand that not all plants are equivalent. See for example this article by scientific american:
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lettuce-produces-more-greenhouse-gas-emissions-than-bacon-does/

Some of the plants that HUMANS eat are more resource intensive than the plants that ANIMALS eat. So the net efficiency is higher for certain foods. Which is why locally produced goods consistently use less resources than imported goods, regardless of whether they are meats or not.

I understand that you're skeptical fo what I am saying but try to picture the entire situation.

"YOI","t5_3gv95","While I love YOI to death, I’m generally more into stuff with femslash and yuri undertones than shonen ai, so these may not be quite up your alley if that’s not your jam, I dunno.  

If you enjoyed the competition aspects of YOI, Hibike Euphonium is an excellent drama about a high school concert band striving for national competition.  Hibike’s animation is fantastic as well, and the show does an excellent job with establishing atmosphere.  Love Live is a guilty pleasure of mine too.  Lots of humor and drama, as well as an overall plot line about winning a singing competition—both the original and Sunshine are fun, feel-good shows.  You can debate over the queerbaitiness of both, but there’s none of that non-con or incesty gross shit that’s oh so prevalent in the yuri genre, and both have a sizeable queer female fan base, so take that as you will as far as quality goes I guess?  I love both to death though regardless.

If what you’re wanting is drama with a well-written same-sex romance, give Aoi Hana or Izetta the Last Witch a try.  The first is a high-school slice of life that actually gives a relatable, realistic take on its romances.  Izetta is alternate history WWII tale with witches and magic. The relationship between the two main girls reminds me a lot of how Victor and Yuri’s was handled.

Pm's manage the teams and set the product roadmaps and bring features forward and write a ton into our wiki and releases. They manage the how and we do the what.

We set global design patterns and review and sign off all designs, we also knock back less than stellar ux for rework. We have a really good healthy tension between PM and design, where they need to debate thd feature with us, before we even start. 

Edit: We designed a visual and ux language. We mock and test each component, then build libraries, each library of components is shared and used. Combinations of components and pages are made and tested. Once a few combinations are done we are good to go with all others.

Now, my parents were strict, and I was terrified of getting caught, plus my two best friends who lived on my street asked me to hang. I said no to her.

"somethingimade","t5_2r4wt","A bit overwhelmed by the positive comments, Thanks  everyone! Not sure how to post other photos to show build as I've only just signed up.

My wife suggested I made a steel circular bench for my brothers wedding anniversary, I bought a woodbending book by Lon Schleining. The first bench (the gift) was made of five pairs of concentric semicircles, the legs I designed I wasn't happy with, but there you go! Then I wanted one and on the basis of not making the same thing twice this bench was conceived, where the idea came from I have no idea but the benefit of this design all six wooden bits were the same.

I made a full size 'template' from four thicknesses of mdf in the form of the single turn spiral. It was mounted in a frame vertically so it could revolve. I bought some 'planks' of iroko 5m x 40cm x 8cm. Strips were cut off using a large table saw (with rollers on/off and a power feeder) each strip was then passed through the thicknesser to 5.5mm. and bundled in groups of 11, these were then glued (resorcinol) together and clamped round the template with f clamps into the 50+ pockets let into the template and the glue left to set. The end pieces were added latter. The legs bolt into brass threaded inserts, inserted from the top and then plugged.

I suppose I learnt that precision was key from the start, 5.6mm thick strips weren't going to work if some bits were 5.4mm! I made numerous templates for different stages. The angles were drawn out with a home made protractor that was fitted to the centre of the main template.

I neede at least four people to lay the glue with me and then clamp it up. the open and closed time for the glue was about an hour, a few dry runs confirmed we could do that in the time - it was a logistic exersise. I think eventually about twelve different people were involved in the six spirals.

The metal legs were constructed from laser cut steel sheet, they were designed and drawn out on a cad package and sent off, arriving back as a pallet of bits. They were welded up and then galvanised.

I suppose looking at it now it was a monumental effort, most people walk by it without any thought, nor do they wonder how you get it round the tree. Those that do wonder - woodworkers comment on the nice legs whilst steel workers coment on the spirals!

Time wise probably about 200hrs, Glue Lam is extremely wasteful in wood terms I suspect 75&amp;#37; ended up as sawdust.

Iroko because its an oily wood, it was available in the needed lengths and was affordable. Resourcinol glue (its a boat building glue) as the open time was long enough, its a two pack watterproof glue and its water to clean up, but it does need a high clamping pressure. Total cost with wood, glue and legs was probably about £1000

Overall it was the getting there working out how along with the logistics that was as important as the having got there.

A side note... if the joint pain has started/ increased since you started supplementing D, you may want to consider adding a magnesium supplement too.  Once your body starts getting the D it needs, it starts using it to repair stuff it was not prioritizing when it was deficient, and it can burn through a lot of other vitamins you aren’t thinking about as well.  IIRC, you can wind up with symptoms of magnesium deficiency - including joint pain, once you start supplementing vitamin D.

This year alone there has been 133 politicians murdered by the cartel. All because the didn’t comply with their orders or because they dared to stand against them.

I don’t have a great answer for this yet but propping up their dollar and using our influence for good instead of turning a blind eye to corruption. It’s weird we care more about Israel than we do our neighbor and second closest ally.

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","TLDR: totally and utterly go ahead with this fantastic idea!

I'm stoned in front of a Vietnam war documentary so this may go on a bit.

Bit of background: I put together a few Oldrim mods back in the day. Went in knowing basically nothing, learned through the Bethesda videos, CK wiki and experimentation. And lots and lots of forum trawling - Reddit would have been easier. Now with VR, I'm slowly porting my old mods to SE. I've got the bug again, and I'm surprised at how much has stuck in my brain. Here is some of it.

Creating a mod of any significant size is a much bigger job than it looks. My own efforts are all small, but took a huge amount of time to  nail down. Even [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57557).

Your idea is well-suited to the position of First Mod Ever. You can start small, just that dickhead in Falkreath. Figure out what you need to do to do what to want to do (hmm), get it working, and iterate slowly.

From what I remember (not much, never actually modded dialogue...), you'll need to add a condition to the dialogue topic, and a trigger volume to ""flip the switch"". This may require scripting, and you may require a dummy quest to hold things together. For sure this is like skinning a cat, workflow would be something along these lines:

1. Add a conditional check to stop the dialogue option appearing. Test. You shouldn't be able to ask him about the cemetery *at all*.

2. Add a trigger volume somewhere easily identifiable - directly outside the priest's would be a good spot. Set the trigger to unlock the dialogue option when entered. Test again, see if going there makes the dialogue option available.

3. Move, resize, reshape the trigger volume appropriately. You might find a **debug.notification** useful for testing the boundaries in game.

Document every change you make, and why. Screenshots of text fields are good for this. Makes it much easier to rethink your changes, and to duplicate them elsewhere.

If you want a funnish project to learn the CK on, watch and copy the Lokir's Tomb tutorial on the Creation Kit wiki. It's still relevant (the interface hasn't changed since 2011) and by the end you'll know your way around both the interface and the game data. There are other CK vidz on the tubez, if you can find a decent dialogue-focussed one then hooray.

If you go public, take the time to give your mod a name you're happy with. I'm dead proud of [Cats in the Dark](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51589/) - it's short, descriptive, and a pretty good song as well.

And a final tip- you'll be adding records whatever you do; prefixing them with your (or the mod's) initials makes them MUCH easier to find, as well as being a huge help to other modders who're patching or ""learning from"" your work. Also if you come back in a few years, you can see how you did what you did.

You've come up with a great idea and you should think about where else you can take it in future. Perhaps the confition could be clearing X dungeons, or reaching quest stage Y. There's a lot of potential here.

Best of luck and if there's any chance I can be of help, please do get in contact.",1530403210

1. Ang MMDA enforcers nasa tapat ng Farmers kasi roon ang tamang sakayan at babaan. Usad pagong ang mga bus kahit pukpukin ng batuta.
 
2. Since commission based ang mga drivers at konduktor, hindi aandar ang mga bus kasi gusto nilang mapuno. Ayaw din nilang matapat sa enforcers kasi papaalisin na sila sa loading bay/lane. Sa malayo sila nagsasakay. Expect a bus to stay idle in Cubao for around 30 minutes.
 
3. Sa north-bound, dalawa ang loading bay/lanes. Meron sa gitna at meron sa gilid. Yung mga nagmamadali na, bumababa na kaagad kahit wala pa sa tamang bus stop. Yung mga tangang pasahero naman na sasakay, sasalubungin na kahit alam nilang hindi rin makakaandar kasi marami pang mga bus sa unahan na ayaw umalis.

Your plan is to find Ad Naus into high tide/rituals and then kill them with Storn+Reservoir or Scepter. The core is extremely cheap (especially since you already play Azami and have some of the staples) and you fill out the rest of the deck with whatever nuts and bolts you have lying around, i.e. one mana counters/tutors/removal/discard. After you build the deck, you slowly upgrade over time with the power cards, the good black tutors and mana positive rocks etc (I recommend starting with YawgWin if you couldn't afford it while building).

When I built it it wasn't really that consistent and T3-4 wins were not common; you need more mana to kick off since you run less broken rocks and sometimes it will just spin its wheels even while goldfishing and you don't really do anything. (Tbf it could also be that I'm just a terrible pilot).

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","I agree completely-- I think it's more useful to learn to adapt recipes to your needs than to have to limit yourself to a narrow range of recipe sources. Swap butter for oil, yogurt for sour cream/mayo, milk for heavy cream; use less salt, oven roast instead of deep fry, skip the bacon, etc. 

That being said, Bon Appetit, Food&amp;Wine, Food Wishes/Allrecipes, and New York Times are some of my most reliable, go-to sources of inspiration, but I'll also browse other sites like Food Network. If I have a specific dish in mind, I'll almost always just google it and browse the top hits to see what seems best and most practical for me. These are all American, but I like that they have a huge diversity of cuisines and tend to be educational in addition to just listing recipes, which is a huge part of enhancing your skill as a cook.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Quite wrong. Your statement evinces obvious displays of emotion. The words you chose make that clear. My post shows no emotional attachment to firearms whatsoever.

In fact it's not even about me and firearms. It is about the fact that the necessity of a free people to be armed was enshrined in the Constitution, as a foundational value to this system. I happen to believe it's there for a reason, and I believe that the amount of deaths that actually occur are acceptable within the framework of freedom and rights inherent to being an American. If I were to believe, as many do because of outright lies by the media, that gun violence was an order of magnitude higher than it actually is, I might not feel that way.

 Expecting that only soldiers pay the price for freedom is rather like leaving it to the hired help.   We make the calculation that a certain amount of suffering will happen with freedoms all the way down the line, from freedom of speech to freedom of Association to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Put plainly, all of those things may very well have a body count attached.

&gt;According to a 2016 study by University College London, immigrants who arrived from the EU after 2000 contributed £1.34 to the U.K. economy for every £1 they took out.

The same is true for the US. Immigrants contribute more to the economy and commit crimes at lower rates than the population at large.

The UK shot itself in the foot by cutting off a flow of healthy working-age individuals that were a benefit to the economy.

Earth is an introduction, Water is about his Ni-ten ichi-ryu style, Fire is about timing in combat, Wind is about the failings of contemporary schools of fighting, finally Void is the epilogue and a description of his ideas on consciousness and mindset.

1.  My chickens know that I will go outside almost every time I hear them freaking out, making their distressed calls.  So they started to figure out. If it was getting a bit late in the morning and they hadn’t eaten, that they should start yelling for no reason to get me outside.  Once I’d come out, every single one would run up to me as if I had their food ready.  

2.  One of my hens figured out there was a crack in the bottom of my feed bucket.  She figured this out pretty quick when she saw a pellet or two fall.  So she will peck at the tape I put in there to fix it and pull it down to spill out the food.  I’m cheap so now I just hold up the bucket super high whenever I go out to feed everyone.

3. I’ve also had some chickens duck down into tall grass if I’m trying to round them up and can’t for the life of me find the ones that do this.  And they will *not* come out.  Three days later they show up like, “Yeah, you will never know my secrets.”

In general, they also tend to ‘complain’ if a water dish is low/empty or want food.  It’s this annoyed drawn out voice.  Just like a dog or cat would do as most can relate to.   

Just wanted to eliminate some bias here about chickens.  That is all!",1530403224

"ContemporaryArt","t5_2s6lg","Go to all the openings of the galleries you're interested in, and you can gradually get to know who the owners are and what the scene is like.  It requires networking like any other business.  Pay attention to what they're selling, what they put in art fairs, how many artists they have vs. the frequency of shows, etc.  You should know everything about a gallery before you approach them.

As a gallery owner, I disagree that artists should have 100 rejections.  You should really be much more selective than that.  Time is better spent on quality connections than quantity.  Even with a ""no unsolicited submissions"" message, galleries still get annoying emails from artists who have nothing to do with the gallery's program.",1530403224

"haskell","t5_2qh36","Leksah is 5.3GB including its dependencies like Gtk+ and ghc etc.  ([here](https://gist.github.com/hamishmack/54c8c3d0f842ffdb3a7e00dbd4f98e69) is a breakdown).  On top of that Leksah builds metadata and downloads the source for packages into `~/.leksah-0.17` and it is not unusual for that directory to go over 1GB (mine is 1.9 right now).

Even if Leksah is too big, I still think you might want to try Nix. Many open source projects seem to be better supported on Nix than anywhere else (not just Leksah). For instance running `nix-env -i inkscape` works and often seems to install a newer version than is available in `dmg` form.

Nix has binary caches of everything including all the Haskell packages. This is great if the machine your using it slow (no waiting for builds).  Unfortunately this is not true of Leksah on macOS right now (The atk C library in the nix cache does not work with haskell-gi on macOS, so if you do install Leksah it will take hours to build on a MacBook Air).

I use don't recommend using stack with nix.  Stack's raison d'être is to address issues nix solves better.  Instead I recommend using Nix with `cabal new-build` (and `cabal new-repl` etc.) as they work nicely with Nix installed haskell packages.  If you have a large `~/.stack` directory or lots of bid `.stack-work` directories lying around you might be able to reclaim some space there.

Similarly if you have installed GHC by itself you might get a lot of space back once you are happy with Nix by uninstalling ghc and clearing out `~/.ghc`, `~/.cabal` and `~/Library/Haskell` (check in `~/.cabal/bin` and `~/Library/Haskell/bin` in case you have something you `cabal installed` that you need to `nix-env -i`).

To uninstall a nix packages run `nix-env -e leksah-ghc843` then run `nix-collect-garbage -d` to GC stuff you are not using.

If you try Nix and it all goes horribly wrong the best uninstall process is to run the Nix installer again.  It will complain that Nix is already installed and give detailed instructions on how to uninstall it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So here's the story of how my great grandmother escaped Nazi Germany  and saved a Torah older than Germany itself.

My great grandmother (Uma) met my great grandfather in Tel Aviv while she was visiting her cousin. My great grandfather (Upa) had just recently emigrated from Germany and was in the process of building his house. Upa first saw Uma at the market, and approached her by asking for her opinion on which tiles he should buy for his kitchen, as one does. He said he wanted to get a woman's perspective. The rest, as they say, is history.

Uma wanted to stay and help Upa finish building their house and life together, but the mandatory government in Palestine had been cracking down on immigration, and particularly the marriage-based kind because of fraud. So to prove that that their love was real, Uma had to go back home to Germany for a certain period of time (idk exactly) and maintain regular correspondence with Upa. Eventually he had to invite her to come back so they could get married.

While she was writing letters from her small village in Germany, Nazi shit escalated quickly. So when Uma was preparing to leave (sometime in spring 1938), her uncle came to speak to her. He worked for the village rabbi and could see the writing on the wall, so he begged her to take one of their Torahs with her to Israel by smuggling it in the trunk where she packed her wedding dress and all of the linens for her dowry. She was already a bride-to-be, so it wasn't much of a stretch for her to become very protective and very secretive about her wedding dress while going through German customs.

Just a few months later and that Torah would've been destroyed in kristallnacht. The Torah she brought to Israel dates back to the 1500s; each of the wooden handles on the scrolls has a ribbon of text commemorating all the  people who donated to the synagogue so it could be written. 

It became first Torah to join the congregation in their new moshav. ~20 years later, it sailed across the Atlantic with my Uma, Upa, and grandma. A few years later my grandma got married and moved with my grandpa to West Virginia. The Torah has lived in my grandma's local synagogue ever since.

It is no longer considered a ""kosher"" Torah today because many letters have faded with time, and it's likely too old to be restored without any risk of harming the scroll. So while it's retired from daily use, it continues to steal the show at family bar mitzvahs, and every year at Simchat Torah - the holiday where we read the final portion of the Torah covering Moses's death, start at the beginning with the story of creation, and bring out all the Torah scrolls in the synagogue for a night of singing and dancing.",1530403228

"vodka","t5_2r0x5","Pre-Canada Day reviews continue, and we are, as promised, heading back to Beattie's Distillers to review their Farm Crafted Strawberry flavoured Potato Vodka. 

Now, to be perfectly up front, I am not a fan of ""flavoured"" anything when it comes to spirits. I have always told friends that I like ""Vodka-flavoured"" Vodka, and held to that maxim. I dislike the artificial nature of the concept. So Harrison has a steep hill to climb in terms of winning me over. That being said, he is on the right track. There are no artificial flavours, no preservatives, no nothing . . . just strawberries and vodka.

And, right off the opening, the smell of strawberries is almost overpowering, before my nose even reaches the glass it is there. There is no other scent to be found.

The first sip is smoother than the Potato Vodka that forms the base of this spirit. This is no surprise as this version is bottled at only 30%. Much like the Sweet Potato Vodka, this lower abv is necessary in order to preserve the palatability of the overall spirit. In short, it tastes better this way. And it does taste pleasant. Very reminiscent of strawberry popsicles, which is nice when considering the blistering heat outside today. But again, this a bit of a single note tune. There is remains a slight sharpness towards the finish that recalls the unflavoured version, but this is exactly what the label advertises. Strawberry Vodka.

Now, lest you think that I am being overly harsh, relax . . . there's more. While this may not be to everyone's taste as a sipper over ice, it makes one HELL of a nice base for a summer cocktail. Using the Strawberry Vodka as a base, my wife and I went two different directions, using Kiwi.
 
I am very simple and direct, using about a quarter of a kiwi, thinly sliced and muddled with 1 oz of Strawberry Vodka. Let it sit for a few minutes until the Vodka starts to colour and then throw in some ice and add 3 oz of sparkling water. Sweet and sour and all kinds of refreshing.

My wife is a little handier with the kitchen gadgets, so she pulverized a whole kiwi, a half dozen ice cubes, and two packets of artificial sweetener (she's a diabetic). Add 2 oz of Strawberry Vodka, top off the glasses with sparkling water, and you have two servings of a pleasantly sweet cocktail that sips very nicely. For non-diabetics, you could substitute a shot or two of simple syrup instead. Pictured is my creation.

"glow","t5_2qo7q","I watched this season with a sister who works in an industry that is rife with that kind of shit, and has experienced it herself, and when I voiced similar annoyance with Debbie, she had a different take on it:

Debbie has gone through that herself, and had to play along and placate the fucker's egos for the sake of her career. Probably several times over. Her anger was more about the situation itself--all of the injustice and powerlessness that goes along with being a woman in that industry. So she's mad at the sleazy producer for punishing the whole show because an actress wouldn't let him assault her, she's mad at Ruth for not ""playing along"" and getting the show buried (especially since Ruth had no problem banging her husband), and she's also subconsciously mad at herself for the times that she has ""played along"" and perpetuated that gross dynamic.

But Ruth was the one who was right in front of her, and the only power Debbie had was to tear her down. So she did, and took all of that displaced anger out on the wrong person. It was a shitty thing to do, but it was also a very human thing to do. It's kind of similar to what Sam did when he fired Reggie to knock Ruth down a peg after she made the title sequence. He was mad at a lot of things, and took it out on Reggie because she was the easiest target.",1530403229

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","So as a disclaimer, I'm no expert when it comes to college essays. On that note, this is my intuition from reading your ideas.

1. The anecdote might mess with the tone of your paper depending on how it's used. If you start with angry, desk-flipping teacher and then segue into a really cool and collected explanation of your interest in psych, it might read weird. On the other hand, it could work if you did something like put a spin on it where you maybe wanted to understand your teacher's behavior better so it inspired an interest in psychology. If this isn't the case for you, don't lie about it and say that it was, though.

2. The Family Feud idea is a nice story that might work if any colleges ask you additional essay-related questions about family. I had at least one college ask me a question like that when I applied, so I'd suggest keeping it in your back pocket for a more specific situation like that. ",1530403231

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To your last question. I've been explained this probably a dozen times by my brother who's in a related industry and likes to rant about it. (therefore I'm not an expert and can make mistakes) The reason banks don't have automatic transfers is because US banks still use ancient, giant computers from the early 60's that use an outdated programming language called COBOL that literally no one but the banks use. In this programming language, they create a ASCII (or maybe hexadecimal, can't remember which) representation of a bank transfer request from the 60's, into which they can input your information. Despite this system becoming more automated over the years, they haven't updated the actual transfer method. Imagine them sending a picture of a transfer request. I can't remember why exactly they don't operate on the weekends, maybe they still need some human intervention, but the point is that banks transfers of any kind are so slow because banks are cheap and don't want to bring their banking computers into this millennia, literally. As it's been explained to me, many European countries have legislation that requires a maximum of 10 seconds to complete ANY transfer, whether you're buying groceries or sending money, so pending charges should never be a thing, especially just because it's the weekend. 

TL;DR: Banks are cheap and more loosely regulated here, so their systems suck. ",1530403232

"TTPloreplaycentral","t5_32qsz","You and Mark travel through the portal created by Tom and find yourself in another, very different world. As you look around you somehow know what this world is called, Sanctuary. As your gaze turns from the desert surrounding you on three sides, to the city http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Caldeum?file=Caldeum.png you become aware that you are just outside a city known as Caldeum. Turning your attention inward, you feel an increased affinity for flames and fire…and notice that the clothing you are wearing appears to have metamorphosed into http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Firebird%27s_Finery?file=Firebird%E2%80%99s_Finery.jpeg, and you are aware that this is commonly worn by wizards from this world, which you now resemble. 


Thinking about this, you are pretty sure the portal made these changes to help you blend in with your new surroundings. Tom looks mostly the same, but graphically rendered slightly differently. Mark, on the other hand, is sticking out like a sore thumb. The portal doesn’t seem to have known what to do with either his time machine or his gun, and they are both looking very out of place and likely to attract attention if you wander into the city right now.


What do you do?

But Norway is a big country in landmass and borders Russia, both are reasons for relative high defense spending compared to if that was not the case. 

Therefore I believe it is reasonable to spend 2% of BNP on defense in the 2020's, because in a war we would be more vulnerable than most nations and would have a relative big landmass to defend.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My boyfriend is somewhat similar to yours in that he is very emotionally closed off, and he has to feel ""safe"" in order to open up. Sometimes this is when we are lying in bed before/after sex. Sometimes it's during a long car ride. Sometimes it's during a late night phone call. Rarely does he talk about his true feelings while he's in ""work mode"". That means he's thinking about work, concentrating on his problems or friends or family or whatever else is going on. His feelings (unlike ours, as women) are the last thing on his mind. But later, when he's relaxed and ""safe"", he's ready to open up and talk about how he feels.

I have severe anxiety, so I understand how this behavior is making you insecure and anxious. But my advice is to first, tell him how you feel. Honestly. Be sure he's open to talking though. Don't grab him when he's tired/stressed/preoccupied and dump this on him.

Explain your feelings. Then let him explain his. If he's like my boyfriend, he comes off as callous because he's just not defaulted to being ""emotionally available"" at all times. But that doesn't mean he doesn't love/care about you. He's just not thinking about expressing those sentiments at the moment. 

My bf is very sincere and appreciative of all that I do (I do little gifts and such for him a lot like you mentioned) and when he doesn't immediately use his words to express how much he loves them, I get pretty bummed. But he loves them all the same, and will mention how great they are occasionally, even years later. We speak different love languages, but we've learned each other's and we are amazing together. Perhaps it's the same with you and your boyfriend.

I think your issue is not so much ""he only expresses his feelings after sex"" it's ""he doesn't express his feelings as much I need him to so that I feel secure, loved, and valued even when I'm not naked"".

Please talk to him about this. My boyfriend never realized how closed off emotionally he was being until I mentioned it. His brain just doesn't work that way.

Best of luck to you two. &lt;3",1530403234

Use TP like you would Mei Wall, but for your team. Use it to get Orisa or Ana in good positions that their mobility normally wouldnt allow. For example, getting Orisa on top of the high ground on the right side of Anubis Point A. You have a very good vertical range on them, so exploit the shit out of it. Put a tp to Dorado point B high ground and allow your entire team to immediately challenge high ground.

There was a post on the main sub a year back that wanted Sym to have ""Photon Stairs"" use the new TP exactly how you would use that.

The wall is a massive middle finger to the whole enemy team. 76 ready for that phat 5 man aimbot? Put a wall up and have him dump bullets into that. You can put it just in front of the enemy team to give yourself free ground, if your running a rein or Brigitte, put it close to your team to force the enemy to fight you close up. 

Use the wall to make them fight closer than what they want to. Hanamura A where people just sit at the left side with an Orisa, Build a wall and stroll through that, you force them to come down. 

The wall isnt meant to be the mei wall, its meant to be a map wide shield. Use it as such.

The primary fire is kinda ""meh"" now that it takes a few seconds to charge, Secondary Fire is where its at though.

We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","&gt;Also wtf is kaiserrreich?

KR is the reason to get DH in this day and age. It's also great in HOI4

&gt;Can I make a holy roman empire in DH?

No

&gt;Can I make winged hussars?

No. There is cavalry but no specific winged hussars

&gt;Or did hoi4 just embrace the memes and went all yolo brolo, compared to it's predecessors?

Forming the HRE in HOI4 is deliberately hard and obscure to do to limit memes. 

&gt;hoi4 looks nice, but I ain't got the $$$ to get it + a billion dlcs

It's really not that expensive, and the dlcs are nice but definitely not needed. (also if you play MP only the host needs DLC)

&gt;and peopel say anyway that it sucks...

I've played HOI4, HOI3, and DH, HOI4 definitely has some questionable design choices but it is the most modern game, and the easiest to get into. I cannot in good faith recommend DH unless you want to specifically play the ""original"" kaiserreich mod. HOI3 might be something to look into though, as it is a good medium, modern enough to learn the basics quickly, but has plenty of complexity to have you learning for a long time.",1530403236

"February2018Bumpers","t5_3lcnx","It seems these days that families with kids are moving inwards from the coasts as housing markets become more and more extreme. Your money can buy you so much more in middle America and kids can have a yard to run around in.  The only problem is, pay is usually lower unless you have an in-demand job.

In my case, Hawaii is stupid expensive. We're lucky enough that my husband's parents own their home, and since DH is an only child, everything goes to him in the end (morbid but true). BUT in the meantime DH is trying to grow his business onto the mainland, and it's looking like San Jose is first. Only problem is we'd be moving from an expensive place to another expensive place. In fact baby and I'd probably be living with my parents in Sacramento for a while. That's why sometimes I'm eyeing up-and-coming locations like Texas and Colorado! 

I will say one thing about moving abroad and that is that you both have to be very into the idea and on the same page. I'm half Japanese and I thought moving to Japan for my year-abroad would be a piece of cake! But there was still a fair amount of culture shock and adjustment involved. Depending on where you're looking at, the move and settling in could be very stressful. DH and I loved London and Paris and we often half-joke, ""Let's just leave everything behind and start over there!""

I had planned on having a couple bottles of wine for toasts for those who were interested (myself and husband included) but most of my family doesn't drink so I wasn't too worried about having a large selection. Plus there was a wine bar and several other bars within a few blocks so I figured we could go hang out at one after with those friends who wanted to grab a drink since we had a morning ceremony/early afternoon reception. 

Funnily enough though when we went to open the bottles, we couldn't find a wine opener. I found my dad in the back trying to open one with a screw and a pair of plyers! So I told him not to worry about it and we just used the fancy sparkling grape juice we had. 

Also after the reception, no one wanted to hit a bar. We did an escape room instead before heading back to our house and playing cards against humanity (with the wine bottles we previously couldn't open).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So,I had a friend I went to high school with who claims that she's suicidal, depressed, has some sort of blood poisoning/liver disease (she never specified what it was; everytime I or a friend asked her she would avoid it), has iron-deficiency anemia, and claims that her family (parents and brothers) were abusive towards her.  I asked her and pleaded with her to get help. She always refused.

Every day, I had to sit in a first-period physics class and listen to her recount all of her medical, social, and mental problems. It was fucking torture and my grade suffered because of her, because all throughout the lectures she would actually keep talking. I really don't mean to sound callous or cruel; it's just that I quickly realized that she wasn't actually looking to change her situation and just wanted to endlessly explain her problems without acting on them.  The worst part?  When I asked my teacher if I could switch seats to somewhere away from her, he actually blamed me for not listening to her and swiftly refused to change my seat.  Even after I explained that I had tried to get her help, he still kept to her side and left me at a loss of what to do.  I decided to just rough it out for the year until I graduated.

Eventually, I learned from one of my other friends that she had told all of our school's administration that she was being abused by her parents and that teachers were told to be very cautious around her because of her suicidal tendencies.  But somehow, anytime a counselor or our school psychologist tried to get her therapy or actual help, she would quickly back out of it and claim that it was fine.

One day, she walked into physics with this huge, purplish scab on her face and she just had this extremely depressed look on her face (at least more than usual).  My teacher, who thought it was a bruise from her parents abusing her, contacted the police immediately after class.  Apparently, she was now claiming that it was an allergic reaction to a face mask she had used the night before.  

I don't doubt the fact that she was being abused by her family though.  The one time I had the misfortune of meeting her brother, he just had this super creepy look and kept looking at me like he was about to assault me.  Her parents are extremely religious and wanted her to get married to some guy twice her age back in Pakistan.  Along with that bombshell, they also don't want her to go to college, even after she got into one of the most prestigious universities in our state.  I truly hope that she gets away from all of the abuse and misery her family is making her go through and finally gets the help she needs.",1530403239

So much so, that it was unhealthy. In order to keep this from your friends, you only ever let it out at home or at the strip club. One night at the club, the owner came over to you and sat down. ""I see you in here pretty often, though you only ever watch the Asian dancers. Why is that?"" She asks. She was an Asian woman herself, so you had to keep yourself in check. ""I've just got a huge fetish for Asian women."" You reply sheepishly. She scoffs, ""You know it really isn't healthy to fetishize a race."" You look ashamed. ""I'll let it slide, you seem harmless. Though I would like a favor from you, go to the backstage door and tell the bouncer I sent you, he'll know where to send you."" She says, standing up and walking away. You nod and follow her instructions, being led to a room backstage by the bouncer. He leads you inside and closes the door. You look around and see a blue dress sitting on a chair. There is a closet and a vanity in the room. This must be a dressing room for one of the dancers. You walk to the chair and grab the dress. As you do, a strange feeling runs through you.

You feel quite dizzy as the world around you grows larger, or in reality, you grow smaller. All the sudden, you found yourself much thinner, and 5'2""(1.57m)! You tried to scream, but nothing came out. As if on autopilot, your body sat down in the chair and reached for the make-up. As you applied, your face softened and shifted. Your nose shrunk a bit and your eyebrows thinned and became manicured. Your lips plumped up, but the largest change was your eyes. They widened a bit, but soon gained epicanthic folds, giving you a distinct Asian look. You grabbed some earrings as your ears became pierced. You started working on your hair. It grew out down to your shoulders, and your body started to style it into soft curls. You stood up after your head was finished and you removed your clothes. Reaching down, you picked up the dress and put it on. Knowing what came next, you were not excited, but you were just a passenger in your body, doomed to watch it change. Your body hair began to disappear as your skin tone shifted to that of a beautiful Asian woman. Your stomach flattened out and your waist pulled in, leaving you with an hourglass figure. You felt a pressure in your chest, and soon it exploded, the dress filling with [huge breasts!](https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics1/2015-07-13/317951_02big.jpg) Your hips began to expand and you ass quickly followed suit, becoming plump and sexy.

Soon a vagina formed, and you were left a [complete woman.](https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics1/2015-07-13/317951_06big.jpg)

The owner walked in the room shortly after your change completed. ""Hey girl!"" She says, ""How's my most popular dancer?"" Your body smiles, ""Good miss, I go out on stage?"" You ask in your new accent. ""Yes! You're next! Knock 'em dead!"" She says, leading you out. You hear your introduction and your body struts out onto the stage.

TWO MONTHS LATER

You're back in your dressing room after a big night of dancing. You really were a crowd pleaser. Nothing got you more excited than the idea of those sexy white men getting off to your body. You saw so many sexy guys tonight, but one guy stood out. You told the bouncer to send him back to your dressing room. You knew it was against the rules, but who could say no to you?

"SEO","t5_2qhbx","It is the latest development from Google. Rather than drawing panic signals, this should be taken as a strategic input towards designing websites for information dispersals. It is a step centered at offering the best information in the best manner to users.

Mobile-first indexing is literally as it is read. It refers to the process of indexing and ranking starting from the mobile version of your website.

So what if you do not have a mobile- responsive or mobile-friendly version?

Do not worry. It is not mobile-only index. If a site doesn’t have a mobile version, then the indexing will start at the desktop site.

The lack of a mobile-friendly experience can impact negatively on the rankings of that site. On the other hand if a site has a good mobile experience, it shall receive a good ranking boost, even when searched on the desktop.

When does this start?

There is no timeline as of now with the rollout of this method. Google is presently experimenting and studying on a small number of sites, and the study is being analyzed and monitored.

What is the implication for businesses?

It is time that businesses acknowledge the fact that 80% of internet surfing happens in the mobile. Thereby a full roll-out of a Mobile-First Indexing should not be a surprise.

We got to make our sites mobile-responsive. A pre requisite, not an option.",1530403244

The 84-85 season is really weird. It was a definite step up but I also found it really....boring's not the right word, but it was really ""Safe"" to me.

Lots of great stuff and a pretty good cast. I think they could've been great given more time to develop. 

I do remember Pamela Stephenson being in LITERALLY, one sketch ( I think) the ENTIRE season!!! I was like wtf?! Lol. It was a Cyndi Lauper spoof that bombed worse than the Blitz, lol.

Martin Short, Chris Guest, Billy Crystal, Rich Hall, Harry Shearer, Jim Belushi (I love him, kill me), good stuff! :)

Also, the 85-86 season is NOT the trainwreck it's said to be, imo. It was pretty good 3/4 of the time. The cast was a tad awkward in lots of places but I remember waiting for a trainwreck and never really saw one. When it came together I thought it was good.

So then be creative and make a highly anticipated sequel like Bad Company 3 or maybe even a 2142 successor which would let them be as creative and innovative as possible.

&gt;You can be salty about it not being the setting that you wanted but the gameplay changes are awesome.

Clearly it'd be better in a different setting, Korean War, Vietnam, Future, etc.. however I'm not salty, I'm taking advice from the Dev and not buying it. These are just a few observations from someone who has bought every Battlefield and premium pass. 

So movement looks good and more fast paced like I stated before, that's the only major change I've seen. More destruction? So what it was like in Bad Company 1 and 2? Placing turrets? Cool I guess? Being forced into a squad? Wow how impressive.",1530403244

"lego","t5_2qhm7","I prefer to sort into no more than three basic groups in the beginning. I like bricks, plates, vehicle stuff (wheels and large body parts) and the rest goes back into a bin. Once I get through everything, I start over and pull curves, angles, clips and the rest goes back into a bin. 

On my first sorts, it’s hard for me to process more than a few categories at a time and I think it’s faster for me like this even though I’m touching the same part more than once. 

Sometimes I sit at a table or stand at a counter. Lately I’ve been sitting on my bed with a tray in my lap - it’s about the size of a large lasagne pan. I have 2 containers on my left and 2 on my right. I dump enough from the main box to cover the bottom of the pan then sort into one of the three groups (4th is leftovers). I can watch a movie doing this. 

Bulk sorts go into gallon sized bags. I use [this](http://brickarchitect.com/files/LEGO_BRICK_LABELS-CONTACT_SHEET.pdf)  for categories and number / label bags accordingly. 

Once the bulk sort is done I pass through again and do finer sort depending on how much of each subcategory I have. My goal is just to find things easily so I let the volume dictate now far to break it down. 

I *really* enjoy sorting. It’s relaxing and I enjoy the process of going through parts and discovering new ones I haven’t seen before. ",1530403245

 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

I opened his cage and went to take him out to hang out. He bit my finger pretty bad. His bites feel like a vice that just gets tighter and tighter! It hurt and I pulled away, closed his cage door and was checking my finger out when I hear him say something. He says “I’m sorry. I’m so so so so so sorry.” Over and over again! My cousin and I just stopped in our tracks and listened. I couldn’t believe it.

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","This is the issue with a two-party system that results from ""winner takes all"" voting. 

The simplest way that would address this issue entirely that will never happen as a result of the amount of money tied into our two-party system is if we switched our voting system to [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote).

Basically instead of going to vote and seeing:

&gt; Bob Republican (R) [✓]
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Democrat (D) [ ]


You would go in and be able to vote like this:

&gt; Crazy Conservative [4]
&gt; 
&gt; Moderative Conservative [1]
&gt; 
&gt; Moderate Liberal [2]
&gt; 
&gt; Crazy Liberal [3]

Or any number of candidates. So in this example if Crazy Conservative and Crazy Liberal each only got like 10% of people putting them as their [1], those candidates would be dropped and each person who voted for their respective candidate would have their vote be added to their second choice, and so on until you get a candidate that receives more than 50% of the total vote.

This would allow multiple parties to thrive and allow people to safely vote for ""fringe"" candidates without feeling like their vote is ever wasted.

Again, it'll never happen because we prefer our football team style of politics where you have two sides going head-to-head all the time, and if you're not with us you're against us.

I played a fuck ton of smite when it first released and i feel like the problem with that game was game balance and not servers, just let them fix their shit before you trash them on specifics. You can hate Erez and the decisions made by the company in other games but it sucks that people undermine the hard work the RR team is doing to make this game better by putting out patches every week and listening to the community for the most part.

It's worth investigating other platforms as lots of games of this era tended to be ported across multiple platforms and often some games did better on one platform and flopped on others due to the hardware of the time being a playability limit. You may just find you end up lucky and find the game on another platform fan site just by luck of it being preserved in their collective brains.

T-rex really kinda falls behind due to how slow she is, her attacks are very powerful, and hit like a truck, but her speed means she is basically gonna lose HP every turn (her niche is tank killing though, ankys hate her)

"Semenretention","t5_315ru","I have the feeling that you want to ""lose interest"" in women and sex mainly because you don't know whot to relate with them and have a healthy relationship, which makes you ""hate needing them"".

Don't. Just learn how to deal with women. How to relate with them, flirt with them and even have sex with them is a pivotal skill for your development. Just go and read ""Attraction is not a choice"", ""Cocky Comedy - Double your Dating"", ""Models: Attracting women through Honesty"" as well as other books on how to seduce women and confront your fear of rejection in general.

How do you know you don't want to get involved with them when you haven't actually got involved with a single woman? Don't fool yourself, be honest. It's okay. **The only way to know if you need something or not is by having it in the first place.** Don't deprive yourself from women before knowing them better in every single sense.

"Seaofthieves","t5_38oz1","My first encounter on a solo sloop with Meg was in the middle of a storm. It was an absolute shitshow and I just kept sailing in circles spending all my time fixing the holes she put in my sloop until the storm eased up enough to sail straight away at full speed.

I've had a few more encounters since but I never seem to be able to line up my canon to her so I dont even try to fight now, just speed away and hope to outrun her haha.

Today I had tried fighting her, was not getting any hits and so I hightailed it out and in my panic didn't notice I had sailed so close to another sloop. I shouted LOOK OUT on my trumpet to alert them to the giant shark on my tail and they started attacking me. Wtf?! I should have let them blindly sail into her jaws.",1530403261

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","&gt; Is there a lot of player interactions, do you meet other ships &amp; captains out in space?

If you just wander randomly, no, you're unlikely to see many players since space is very big. If you go looking, yes, it's pretty easy to find others. Any system with a current community goal will be busy, as will multiple other notable systems (places with engineers, starter areas, 'unique' areas like Maia etc.). Outside of the game, there are many groups/communities you can join, which will arrange for in-game interaction. 

&gt; how much time is spent actually flying through space from point A to B? 

It can be a decent amount (this is a space sim after all), but it depends on what you're doing. For long range (multi-jump) travel, you can typically assume 1 minute per jump, as that's how long the loop usually takes per system (arrive, fuel scoop, charge FSD, jump, witchcspace, arrive in next system). Travelling around a system should only take a few minutes at the most, unless you choose a poor system to fly around in that has things spread out (this is particularly true of one of the starting systems, so leave LHS 3447 and don't return). For other activities, travel can be less. For example, a good mining/bounty hunting spot could involve 1 minute of supercruise travel, then an hour of mining/fighting, before heading back to a station. 

&gt; I saw there is planet exploration in the expansion but is there anything worthwhile down there?

First, there are normal stations. So in general gameplay, you can find yourself heading down to a planet quite frequently. A main one is that all engineers are on planet surfaces, so you'll need to go down to mod your ship components. Weapons that can fight aliens are only found on planetary bases. There are specific missions that require going to planet surfaces. Driving around on the surface in an SRV is a good way of collecting raw materials, which are used in synthesis (restock weapons/other modules without needing a station) and engineer blueprints. There are also randomly generated POIs, some of which can give you a bunch of encoded materials. If you're asking about the expansion in general, it covers more than landing on planets, including ship launched fighters, multicrew, more ships, and probably a lot more I'm forgetting (I've lost track of what is part of the base game and what isn't).

"The_Mueller","t5_3n3f3","True, having a comfortable cushion tends to reduce your willingness to strike in some ways, but then we did see a huge boost in the labor movement and continued militancy through the otherwise ""comfortable"" golden age of the 50s-70s. As someone in the modern union movement, I just see a lot of guys more worried about making mortgage payments, for whom being on strike is a massive burden that many cannot afford, even with unemployment insurance, if they can get it.

I think you can get strikes with solid financial cushions, and strikes when people are extremely desperate. Unfortunately, we exist in the middle zone right now, where people both lack cushions but also lack a serious material crisis to push them towards mass movement.

And that's why I'm not so sanguine about any revolutions happening soon. Not only are we in this lukewarm middle ground, insecure but not starving, but there are so many institutional issues further binding us to constant work and income. And we're not even starting to talk about the impact of mass media, public relations, and indoctrination/propaganda.",1530403263

"FinancialPlanning","t5_2qwze","You should read on a concept called MVP.  Essentially you should build a web presence that is minimal enough so you can figure out if your business shows interest. Try to keep expenses low, if possible, don't rent new space, don't buy new computers, don't get a new phone line... Try to find out what you can do with the resources you have now.

Another poster mentioned it. Underpromise overdeliver. This doesn't mean for you to charge half of what your competition does, they charge that amount for a reason, not because they are greedy. Have a pricing that is competitive but not astronomically lower than anyone else, and give 110% to ths client.

Talking about competition, don't reinvent the wheel. Research people doing what you plan to do already, see what works and what you can improve, but there is jo reason to spend too much time on research and development.

There are many $10 Udemy mini MBA courses and small business courses. Spend at least three courses learning business skills or the industry your business is. You can use YouTube if you want to do it for free, but I feel that the structure of some of the courses are well worth more than $10.

2. Start saving NOW.
3. Get everything together you can about SOs finances for the years he hasn't paid taxes.
4. Talk to a professional. Get help figuring out what you owe, and figuring out how to tell the IRS that you owe it (Really. It is much better if you tell them you owe them money instead of waiting for them to tell you.

Truthfully I do think everyone is a little bit racist and no one race is more racist than another. Frankly, I think racism is a human trait. Call it tribalism or whatever. Racism becomes an issue when that racism changes your behavior negatively towards a person of another race. Unfortunately that's what happens too often in America and across the world. Racism begets hate and that hate festers and begets anger and violence. 

This issue is not a leftist issue. It's an issue that everyone should be talking about and addressing to minimize its potential damage. We all have to realize that we're human beings and the diversity of our species is what makes us amazing. The different cultures and music and food that I've experienced across the world and even just in the United States is what makes me truly appreciate every race for what it is. 

And despite that do i think about some people in stereotypes? Yea unfortunately. I'm only human. But when I realize those thoughts starting to affect my behaviors, I actively fight that instinct to condition myself to treat everyone equally. Because at the end of the day it's a skin color.

So when you bring this up with him, try not to make it accusatory. Ask for what you need. You might need to even figure yourself out first, like reading up on love languages. Then maybe approach with, ""I love how open you get after we go to bed, but I need to feel close with you throughout the day, too. It would really help me feel loved if you x, y, z.""

"WeddingPhotography","t5_2rdee","I shot my first wedding last week. Three or four weeks ago I stumbled upon Taylor Jackson's youtube channel. He has a couple 20 to 30 minute ""[Behind the scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8DClD_CStA&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLd75nhcnrBTXu0R6Q_sWK8HXfo6iCTLNk)"" videos where he mounts a gopro to his camera during the wedding. It was nice seeing the speed and method to how he shoots, with commentary, while also being shown some of the results. Plus it was very helpful just to see where he stands during the ceremony.

This other (now inactive) channel, by a photographer named Christine Chang, has a single video from 2015 about [how she shoots a ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHkN12Esr7w), done with toy models as she describes where she stands during which parts of the ceremony. Also very helpful for me going into the first wedding. Understanding the workflow of the day isn't talked about as much as compared to technique from what I've seen.

Gearwise... it was nice for me that we're in the longest days of the year because I had an outdoor ceremony and reception and didn't really need lights throughout the day, and no need to even bounce flash off the walls/ceilings because there weren't any. I did eventually pull out a speedlight with the magsphere by magmod for when the newly weds went table to table to take group shots because it was finally getting darker. 70-200 for all the hellos and hugs, and 35 on my other camera using TTL and on camera flash+magsphere for the group shot of the table.

I overshot because I wanted to make sure I had something, so editing is going to take a while. But I'm pretty pleased with the results with one major exception for part of the day where I somehow had my main camera on +2 EV for the first look. If it was even just +1 EV all the photos would have been totally fine, but now I'm having to do some creative editing to salvage what I can. I was planning on doing a update with some photos soonish in one of the ""How was your weekend"" threads.

Edit: Also... bring your extra memory cards with you or check how full they are and swap out when you can. I didn't do that and because of my overshooting, I got a memory card full message on my 128gb cards... and in the moment I popped out my SD card and put it in my pocket and formatted the CF card on the spot and then kept shooting. I lost my ability to have backups right then and there, and was able to keep going, and thankfully nothing was lost and it's all backed up now.

Batteries too. I asked for advice about batteries (and got lots of very helpful advice from this subreddit on all my questions on all kinds of topics), but more experienced photographers are able to comfortably and confidently shoot fewer images than me. So I ran through more memory and battery than they would have. Gotta take their advice and compensate for the newbie factor.",1530403266

&gt; &amp;#039;People with any autoimmune disorder are around 40 percent more likely to develop psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia,&amp;#039; researchers from King&amp;#039;s College London concluded.

&gt; The primary analysis found that individuals with any autoimmune disorder were 40 percent more likely to have a psychotic disorder.

&gt; &amp;quot;Our study shows that overall, people with any autoimmune disorder are around 40 percent more likely to develop psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The finding that psychosis is associated with non-neurological autoimmune disorders, which are not known to directly target the brain, is particularly important,&amp;quot; lead researcher Dr. Alexis Cullen said in a press release published on the KCL&amp;#039;s official website.

  edit: People didn't like my answer so here is a better one: This is from an article by BBC, that can be found [here] (https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35120965). 

  &gt;In 2001 forensic anthropologist Richard Neave created a model of a Galilean man for a BBC documentary, Son of God, working on the basis of an actual skull found in the region. He did not claim it was Jesus's face. It was simply meant to prompt people to consider Jesus as being a man of his time and place, since we are never told he looked distinctive.

  So this is realistically similar to how Jesus may have looked, but not definite.

I’ve heard great things about their cake and the price is $18.99 for a half sheet (feeds 48 people). We expect around 120 guests, so that is around $60! Then we might do a local place for our small cutting cake.  Much like you, my fiancé isn’t a dessert person and has no interest in the cake! That’s mostly why we want to cut costs on it. But even as someone who likes cake, I feel it’s ridiculous to throw $600-$1000 at something that, in the grand scheme, is not super crucial in making a wedding a success.

I never said I don't deserve anything from people I said I don't EXPECT anything  currently to protect my well being as well as others. I feel its detrimental to this illness to do otherwise. I was messagimg everyone I thought would give attention and just completely get what im going through and it's just unrealistic. After receiving similar to identical responses and unanimous distancing it was obvious that my approach was only worsening my symptoms dramatically increasing feelings of abandonment. My issues would take hours to vent and I've came close if not surpassed til 5am if they kept replying. This is draining on others and imo unfair to expect a perfect answer to it all. It's hard for me to keep up with my issues so a ""normie"" has zero experience or idea how to react. I hate that term. Just because they don't have bpd doesn't mean they're free of difficult trials life throws at everyone and automatically able to show you compassion due to reasons you may be unaware of  and not acknowledging that is selfish. Their not our psych drs. Not saying you treated anyone as such but I fucking did and I'm not alone. It just becomes to much and toxic to repeatedly bombard people with the same problems expecting answers to constantly. This makes people distance for their well being and I'm tring to respect that.. Since entering dialogue without entitled motives, engaging in dialog that is inclusive and not just self driven, and still divulging some problems but immediately dropping it if I was angered at the response or the persons interactions halted showing they dont want to discuss it for whatever reason people have been more open and feel less pressured and im not hurt and lashing out. A close friend that had completely distanced commended me taking responsibility along with expeessing support. Something I convinced myself she lacked for me due to delusional expectations of what her support should consist of. This is a very new approach I've taken but I'm far more at ease. I'm not saying this thought process is perfect or for everyone I can only say it's helping me personally and only tried this from trial and error. I can't speak on your  loss of control as I'm not familiar with you're symptoms. It'd be amazing if there were an instant mindshift globally regarding mental illness but that's not our current reality and have to make the best of it.

"alcoholism","t5_2rgl1","Well done for reaching out!

You're not naive at all, and you're very wise to be asking the questions...

I'm sorry to hear about your Dad...

Addictive tendencies can certainly run in families...

Genetics 'loads the gun,' and environment (exposure to addictive substances, particularly **before the age of 25** when your brain has finished maturing) 'pulls the trigger,' as the saying goes...

You are very sensible indeed to have resisted the peer pressure and stayed away from substances so far!

In your shoes, I'd strongly recommend continuing to stay away from all forms of alcohol, as it can be a very slippery slope indeed if you are genetically predisposed to becoming addicted to it...

Nobody *starts out* as a raging alcoholic, it creeps up on you over time, and can easily start with perfectly normal social drinking...

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45bndo/the_myth_of_the_functioning_alcoholic/) describes the typical trajectory very accurately... I started drinking as the typical 'rite of passage' at about 17, found I liked it, and by age 33, I'd made it well into the Stage 3 described in that post, and it was utterly awful... wouldn't recommend it!

[This article](http://real-recovery.co.uk/addiction-treatment/addictive-behaviours/12-characteristics-addiction/) gives a good overview of addiction, and I found it very helpful...

You might also find the book '*Alcohol Explained*' by William Porter a useful resource - I wish I'd read it when I was your age!

'*This Naked Mind*' (Book and YouTube channel) by Annie Grace is also very good - it does a good job of debunking all the cultural brainwashing about needing alcohol to socialise and have fun...

[Addiction and the Developing Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8z23MIDKiA&amp;t=235s) by Ruth Potee is well worth a watch too...

My advice would be to find friends in college who don't drink, and who aspire to something better in life than merely getting smashed every weekend... in the long run, it'll be a much better strategy... 

Learning how to be comfortable in your own skin as you enter adulthood, and how to socialise and form meaningful relationships with other humans instead of with substances will stand you in very good stead, and ensure that you don't repeat the same patterns that your Dad did...

r/alanon is a support group for loved ones of addicts, and r/adultchildren is a sub for those with an addicted parent... I believe there are also 'alateen' meetings in some places which you could look into... Having an alcoholic parent can leave you with lasting emotional baggage which you may not be consciously aware of, so having contact with others in a similar situation can be very helpful...

The [Laundry List](http://www.adultchildren.org/lit-laundry_list) from ACoA would also be well worth a read...

Let me know if I can be of any further help!

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; but only for making laws 

This one is strange to me. It's just so instinctive to think that government is the one to make laws... But government is shitty in so many things. It is just so absurdly rare to see something good AND efficient coming from government. It is either good and wasteful, or bad and won't cost much, but usually it is bad and costs too much.

I don't want government making cars, computers or clothing. Why the hell would I then want government to make laws which are much more complicated and important?

I'm not sure what the answer is here.

&gt; and enforcing them

Not sure either. Private security seems to do well to those who can afford it. So many products and services get cheaper overtime, why hasn't this happened to private security? Well, in some sense it has. I live in a shithole south american country and some poor people (not the poorest, of course) here can live in small condos and then they can hire private security, since the cost is distributed among people who live in said places. Also you can self-defend yourself. I'd say you need to self-defend yourself, since the police isn't omnipresent. There is a delay for them to come to your rescue. I'm not going to ""hey, rape me and my wife while we wait for the police"", I'm going to defend myself.

It's tricky. Enforcement of laws can be done privately with some ease in most cases I believe.

Also enforcing court rulings can be done privately. It has been in iceland from the tenth to thirteenth centuries. It broke down because power got concentrated and rich people couldn't have judgement enforced upon them. But this kinda happens today. At least in my country rich people win the vast majority of cases in courts and in the rare cases that they lose, they never go to jail for long, sometimes they don't even go to jail. And I've seen over and over again from americans that they can't go to a civil court vs a rich person, you'll get bankrupt before the end.

So I don't know here either. It's complicated. It really is. People oversimplify how good/bad they think the government is and how hard/easy an alternative would be to be implemented. 

An important thing to keep in mind is that I shouldn't think that government is good or the only way to make things just because I can't think of a non-governmental alternative. I'm not all knowing. Someone among the other millions of people can come with a better answer, system or solution to problems which I can only see being taken care of by the government.

&gt; Is having a military ok?

Probably? If you don't, then someone with a military can take over you and make you have a military. I don't know. Either way you end up with a military? Maybe you should just have yours? Maybe not? I don't know.

The American system is complete shit though. I really don't understand why they pry into other countries' business so much. I mean, I do, it's to perpetuate the idea of the necessity of the army as it is, I'm saying that I don't understand it as an expression to ""I think it is bad"".


In short I don't know anything. I'm on the fence. But you made an argument that if ""X"" is ok, and also ""Z"", then give me ""W"" too! That is bad logic. Using this method, we can derive that government should just give us everything, and that is nonsensical. I think there are better arguments than the one you used.

Sorry for any bad englando. It isn't my native language.

With astral travel it is possible to enter an animal and borrow its body for a while. I have never tried this with a wolf.

They refused to actually buy it, OR take over payments OR allow me my SO to move back in. (Paying mortgage and rent? Nah!) Drama drama drama. She'd go through my room and took my extra pain meds after I had surgery.

I gave them eviction notice in September, vacate October. We moved back in mid-september. Unfortunately I went from my niece's hero to her worst enemy.  They made her house her face in the couch when I walked by.  Wtf.   I ended up popping in one day at my mom's, she was there, and my niece refused to speak to me (I didn't say a word) my parents anyone. My mom took her home and they were proud to admit that they taught her to ignore grandma if I ever showed up. They also taught a 9 year old child that I'm a bitch that ruined her life.  Seriously.

&gt; The EU 28 agreed that they would share the burden of welcoming refugees; that &amp;quot;Controlled centres&amp;quot; would be set up within the bloc to accommodate them; that &amp;quot;Regional disembarkation platforms&amp;quot; would be set up to process migrants outside of Europe; and that the EU would invest in strengthening its external borders.

&gt; To deter crossings in the Mediterranean, migrants rescued at sea from outside Europe could stay at these places, in co-operation with two UN agencies, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.

&gt; The problem is that, thus far, no third country has offered to host such places to receive migrants who have been rescued in international waters, where there is the vexed question of how to distinguish between irregular migrants and eligible asylum seekers entering the EU in accordance with international law.

Exchange by itself does not capitalism make. For example, Native American tribes frequently traded between each other and, later, with French and English fur hunters. The existence of exchange there didn't mean there was capitalism, nor even a ""market"" per se.

But to the question of whether this would cause a re-introduction of the wage system, it likely wouldn't. The people who are helping Bob out aren't dependent on Bob for the means of survival, and Bob isn't the only person who makes tools. But since Bob ***is*** dependent upon the rest of his community for his and his family's own food, raw materials, utilities, etc., there's a built-in incentive against Bob acting in anti-social ways.

The only way the kind of extremely lopsided concentrations of wealth and power can occur and be maintained — a prerequisite for a return of capitalism — is through either a state or a similar coercive structure.",1530403278

Plus they couldn't decide if it should be damage or time based so we ended up with the mess it currently is. I don't mind if they want it to be damage based but the half-assed charge it has now needs to go.

As for the Milk/Jarate, a longer cooldown would be a good change to make them less OP and perhaps a global change to throwables such that resupply charges 50% of the meter instead of 100% would make them less spammable on last while making the resupply cabinet still serve a purpose for those items. If you make the items only fully recharge upon a respawn caused by death and not loadout/class change it would make it very hard to spam them.

 For the cooldowns/charge, if it was up to me I'd make Jarate/Milk 30s and the Gas Passer 40s. If its going to charge based on damage it should be like every other weapon in the game that does that and reset on death. ",1530403279

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","You're the second person to say the cop was in a position to cuff him. That's flat out wrong. That's not now police are trained to behave there. The purpose of having him extend his legs is to get him into a position he's least likely to pose a threat. Imagine if he had got close to cuff the perp and the perp spun quickly with a concealed blade in his hand. This could instantly end the police officer's life (and most likely the perp because the partner would most likely open fire). Police are trained to subdue perps they view as potential threats. The easiest way to do that is to get them to lay down which is exactly what the officer's end goal was. 

As for your white college kid comment, I've seen police officers force (aggressively, I might add) 2 of them to the ground on separate instances. I knew neither of them and both were being total dicks from what I saw. They deserved to be roughed up. I dont know if any lawyer dads got involved afterwards, though. No tasers were drawn but the police threatened to make one go to the ground if he didn't comply. He didn't and the officer proceeded to make good on that threat. 

I'll remind you, as I have others, that I stated I believe the officer went too far. The only thing I wanted to point out was that this wasn't completely unprovoked. The perp was being belligerent and was warned of the consequences. If he had extended his legs any of the first 5 times he was asked, the other cop wouldn't have started yelling confusing orders and this whole incident would have most likely gone down without any injuries.",1530403280
"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; So you don't think political affiliation would be covered under the same umbrella?

You need to read the SCOTUS opinion as well as all of the case law on protected classes.  Political affiliation is not a protected class.  A private business can discriminate on the basis of political affiliation any time they want without violating the civil rights laws.  That's why the Red Hen could refuse service to Sarah Sanders without violating any civil rights laws.

&gt; You are right about polygamy because common law marriage is a thing.

There are only a handful of states where common law marriage is recognized, PA and SC are 2 I can think of off of the top of my head, but I don't think there are even 10 states that recognize common law marriages any longer.

&gt; I doubt you would support getting rid of common law marriages though.

Again, my opinion doesn't matter, what matters is the law. Very few states even recognize common law marriages any longer.

Speaking of danger and close calls, on another outing I decided to take a shortcut by scrambling up the side of a canyon rather than hiking out the way I came in.  It always looks easier than it is.  It looked like it had a safe slope, similar to to others I have scrambled up, but about 3/4 of the way up the ground went from large rocks to loose gravel that threatened to give way with every step.  It was probably not lethal if I slid down but I could have easily been injured in a way that would have ended that trip.  However, I did manage to traverse sideways to an area that was more stable and I scrambled the rest of the way out.  Once at the top I discovered lots of evidence of searchers having frequented that area too.  Every rocks was overturned and there were even several holes dug.

Alex Sandro wasn't very good this season (according to some Juve fans) so maybe we should be going after Alex Telles or Grimaldo instead.
In addition to that I feel that we should try to get Pavard, he has impressed me during the WC and with a declining Alves and Meunier who isn't that good defensively he could fit in, but I'm not sure he would want to play RB though. 
Also, I hope to God we don't buy a new GK, Areola has improved very much this season and with Buffon coming to mentor him I think he is going to improve even more",1530403285

It sounds like you've decided you want to, and that's great, but if you change your mind abortion is a super common, super normal, super reasonable option that would allow you to choose when you want to become a parent in the future.  Having twins in your situation at age 21 will drastically change the rest of your life.  Not to say you should choose one way or the other, but it should be a conscious choice, not something you are doing because it just happened.  And you have that choice!

I became unexpectedly pregnant in my 20s with someone I was casually dating.  At first I assumed I would have the baby, but after a few weeks of reconsidering, I decided to have a medical abortion.  It was a hard decision to make because of all the what-ifs, but once it was made, I have never regretted it.  Now, years later, I'm 7 months along with a baby I feel much more prepared for, with a husband and a plan for raising it that I didn't have back then.   

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have.  I don't want to sway your decision!  Just want to point out that you do have options, and you deserve to make the choice that's best for you.",1530403285

"factorio","t5_2wabp","By 'dummy stop', I was referring to the original comment from /u/artentus. Essentially, at the start of the queue for your station, you put a stop, and make each train visit it for 0 seconds before entering the station.

Do you play with enemies? When you do, space is more precious. And radar coverage means running power to it (or building a power generation set-up next to it), hence meaning you can't just run a train to the middle of nowhere and put it down. Plus, radars attract biters in a way that rails/stations won't.

And onerous may be the wrong word, but I've started playing with Bob's mods, and my smelting station has around 30 stops (I can't get at that save until tomorrow to check), and I've got at least a few more to add.

&gt; The daughter of top Nazi Heinrich Himmler was hired by West Germany&amp;#039;s foreign intelligence agency in the 1960s, officials have confirmed.

&gt; The head of the spy agency&amp;#039;s history department then corroborated the newspaper report about Burwitz&amp;#039;s activities in West Germany, which reunited with communist East Germany in 1990 to form the present German state.

&gt; German organisations such as the BND have grappled with how to address their own Nazi links in the post-war era.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","If you want the manufacturer to do it, most of your options are newer Gretsch archtops (if you are considering the archtop route).   Many of the newest Gretsch models, including in the Electromatic line, offer pinned bridges.    Gibson and Ibanez generally don't.  

What Gretsch does is basically put a setscrew into the top - this is a headless screw, with an allen key socket on the end - and route a small channel on the either side of the base of the bridge.   This allows forward and backwards but not side to side movement of  the bridge base, and that's exactly what is needed on that type of bridge.      

If the bridge is properly located, the intonation issue won't be any different than on any guitar with a screwed-into-the-top bridge, including Les Pauls, SGs, 335s, etc. 

On a guitar with poly finish, which is almost anything other than a Gibson, Eastman or Collings, tape shouldn't attack the finish and clean off with naptha.    However, it does add a deadening layer and I'm not a fan of that approach.  

Some archtop players use a bit of bow rosin under the bridge base feet to help deter it from sliding.  ",1530403290

The biggest issue is our system playing with inverted wingers is extremely reliant on wing backs getting up the field and being dangerous on the attack.  McCrary and Francis are absolute garbage, they turn the ball over and create counter attacks against.      

The next issue is both Ozzie and Roldan are not true out and out defensive midfielders, they're both at their best when they can play box to box and roam.  The issue with that is that they need to play in tandem with one always hanging back to shield the center backs. They're not doing that effectively and thus once our midfield and wing backs turn it over we're getting crushed.  

Lastly Dempsey and Bruin are repetitive players who occupy the same spaces and try to make the same runs.  You can't play with both of them unless everything else is clicking behind them because they're both reliant on getting service and being finishers in front.    ",1530403292

He speaks day after day through His creation and His word.  That is His answer to you. He is *talking to you now.*  a few more words..

&gt; For His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, *being understood through what He has made. As a result, people are without excuse.* For though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became nonsense, and their senseless minds were darkened.

But, I don’t think this is the system screwing us.  I think the system is working as intended.  The capitalists have been pretty open about reinstating slavery by systematically reducing everyone by the hyper rich to the point of work whatever hours they demand or die of starvation.  These are people who see children dying in the streets and instead of thinking how they can help they gloat about how much more fit they are than the children.  Who claim it is the child’s fault for not being rich while they sit on a fortune of resources larger than they can reasonably spend in a life time.  

They are ghosts haunting the system.  The dismal world of social Darwinism they represent ended a lifetime ago.

We have learned that life operates under a complex system of interactions of enlightened self interest and enlightened altruism.

I know that's wayyy easier said than done, but it sounds like you're really stressing out and panicking will make it worse :(

Second: it's okay to 'overshoot'. Actually, I think it's a valuable time to really think about the way you view weight. Part of the disorder is tendency to obsess over 'numbers' (like those '10 lbs' etc). Another part is tendency to obsess over weight gain/loss rather than what that means for your health. Your questions at the end of your post sound a bit like this--there is a lot of focus on weight gain/eating less/exercise-as-weight-loss, but recovery is about more than that.

I don't really have any answers for those questions, but I do think there is value in exploring *why* you are asking them, because they are part of the problem (in my experience)

I think it was in 1997 when my uncle was arrested for the murder of Gianni Versace in Sydney airport because the killer had the same false name as my uncle and they assumed it was him. (He was let go after a few hours of dramatic interrogation)

My grandmother is on the terrorist watchlist of New Zealand because she has the same name as a terrorist (my family apparently has very illegal sounding names) and was almost deported a few years ago when her indefinite leave to remain expired when she left the country on holiday.

I was the first baby who's parents were legally changed in the high Court of Wales/Cardiff after being born via surrogacy. So that's something.

"4Runner","t5_2vdiz","Yeah not sure if something is wrong with that guys AC or what but I live in Texas and my 2017's AC works very well. I went with the SR5 base model because I didn't like the limited look and have no use for crawl control. Putting in a rear locker is easy enough on these anyway. I've owned several vehicles with leather seats and in my climate, unless the seats are ventilated, it's misery in the summer - so I went with cloth seats. I gave them two weeks and found them to be way too stiff so I grabbed some nice, cushioned mesh covers from cover king. They made so much of a difference. It's a really comfortable ride now and my lower back never sweats anymore. I can't recommend them enough if you end up not getting the leather. Oh it's not real leather anyway unless you get the limited. 

On the topic of having a rear locker and crawl control I just feel like I should say that the ATRAC system on my SR5 is seriously amazing. I've gone everywhere my buddy with a rear-locked Tacoma has gone. I haven't found a need for one yet but I'll still probably drop an ARB air locker eventually just for fun - and only after I spend my money on a full suspension lift etc. ",1530403294

I'm not really sure what you're trying to say (not trying to be a dick honestly, your comment is just unclear EDIT: now it's clear since you edited your comment after I replied. Bad form to do so without stating you've edited, btw)...The journalist is a native speaker? Of English? I'm sure she is, or at least is fluent, otherwise she wouldn't have the job she does. If you don't believe her you could take it up with her or the paper, but printing something like that if it's not true is libel and is a big fucking deal, and no journalist who cares about their job or their reputation would take that risk. Especially over some little restaurant (which has already pissed off so many people apparently) being shut down... She hit the jackpot when he started running off at the mouth like an idiot when she interviewed him lol. 

I agree that it's unbelievable, but only in the sense that only an asshole or a moron would make statements like that to a journalist. However based on the plethora of stories about this place and the staff there I'm not at all surprised that he's refused to accept responsibility.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is fun, but you’re not really missing much if you’ve played MK8 on Wii U.

The only other multiplayer game I play is Paladins, but the game will be free in a couple months, so you might as well wait.

*****
&gt; At least six protesters marching against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega were shot and wounded Saturday, as thousands to the streets across the country.

&gt; &amp;quot;I have always marched, and today more than for our dead, for the children, I grieve for the murders of Ortega and Rosario. I was in 1979 against Somoza and now against the new dictatorship,&amp;quot; said Cecila Cruz, 67.

&gt; The march, supported by the powerful business union - formerly an ally of Ortega - had been suspended a week ago due to the violent incursion of riot police and paramilitaries in several areas of the country.

If circumstances that would have allowed an abortion are still relevant after birth, they argue that the abortion is also still morally permissible.

How do we say detention only until X date when the court date can always be X+N? I would be open to having them be allowed to move about the US freely and just come in for the court date, but there is no assurance they will show up. We can hold US citizens who are only charged until bond is posted. We could do the same to these immigrants, but they don’t have money so it will basically change nothing. Perhaps we can use ankle monitors and just let them go freely and find them if they fail to show up. IDK, really. I don’t like the situation and I even proposed alternatives. My final idea is to create a DMZ zone where illegals can live freely along with US citizens within US territory.",1530403304
"canada","t5_2qh68","It's not just a reddit thing, but it's not an issue that's widely discussed. But the fact of the matter is, both Harper and Trudeau won majority governments with 39% of the vote, and both times, people were angry about it. And yet, there's still no national discussion about electoral reform. When Trudeau made it an election promise, naturally, the people who care about this issue would support him. Even if they weren't normally Liberal voters, if the Trudeau government instituted proportional representation, they could vote for a party more in line with their political beliefs in the next election without worrying about ""throwing away"" their vote.


And I'd disagree with the claims some other people in the thread are saying that people who care about electoral reform are just Conservatives finding an excuse to hate Trudeau. If I were a die-hard Conservative or Liberal, I'd be glad Trudeau isn't touching electoral reform since those are the two parties which benefit most from the current system. If we had some form of proportional representation, neither party would win a majority, and we'd see more smaller parties entering government. It would force the Conservatives and Liberals to make coalitions to have a majority, meaning they'll have to make concessions and work with smaller parties just to stay in power.
To renege on this promise, and not even have an honest discussion about it shows that he never cared about the issue to begin with. It's the same reason I strongly disliked Harper's elimination of government subsidies to parties, which gives a greater advantage to parties that can raise more money on their own (you can guess which one excels at this). His excuse was to save money, but the actual amount was so insignificant in the budget, and was an easy way to hamstring the other parties, so it's obvious that's not why he did it.

If a bleed-blue Conservative partisan wanted to find a Trudeau policy to criticize, breaking this promise wouldn't even show up on the radar since it would hurt his party. I could see small-c conservatives supporting electoral reform, though, so it's not just a ""left-wing"" issue, either, as some others would suggest.",1530403304

### Low-Effort/Low-Quality Humor Is Not Allowed. 

We all enjoy a good laugh, especially about Fortnite! We have a high standard for humor; attempts at humor need to have some effort put into them so that the community can find more value in discussing and developing any humor created on our subreddit.

**Humor must be original/user created**

 * This means that all humor must be created by you, and not a template, formula or something similar. Show off your creativity! 
 * No low resolution, pixelated or [""deep fried""](https://www.google.com/search?q=deep+fried+memes&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivmKj7oMXbAhUow1kKHV6JCRsQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=966) images, gifs or videos.

**Humor can't be simple ""pastes""**
 
 * This means copy and pasting assets from Fortnite onto something non-game related is not allowed. If it took you a few minutes to make, it is likely not high quality.
 * There has to be a minimal level of effort into creating something new.
 * If something was made in Paint and is noticeably done so, it is subject to removal.

**Humor posts can't overly saturate the front page**

 * If the community is overwhelmingly jumping on board to a new meme/topic, and it becomes a trend that floods the subreddit, they are eligble to be removed as low effort/spam posts.
 * If they become too commonplace as a trend they will be eligible to be removed as spam/low effort.

Do you mean padding them as in adding a insole? Id recommend getting a pair of womens pumps inlays.

That same company bought out United Fruit who had massive shares in Cuba with its subsidy A$W. They have organized many unethical military dictatorships in Latin America because those governments are friendly to American business. 

Than there are state affairs like in Nicaragua where the contras, and the Sandinista fought for control of Nicaragua. Reagan’s administration illegal sold weapons to Iran, to fund the contras. The same administration bought cocaine from the contras and brought them back

Strategically you want to keep extending truces as much possible. Attacking allies of strong coalition members drags them in. You want to separate peace with the strong people and demand a bunch of stuff to stretch the truce out far, and then ask little of the week one later so that truce ends sooner and you can repeat the whole process.
If you're constantly expanding...that's aggressive. There's no way around that. Eventually you get so powerful that you can get away with nearly 200 AE before they'll actually bother attacking you.
Also helps to have strong allies of your own, and use all your unit slots, which discourages people from wanting to move against you.
Also attack a coalition when it's still small and you know you can win.

1)  You can trust Trump as far as you can throw him.   Given his obesity, for most people that isn't very far.  You'd have to be a lunatic to think ""America First"" Trump will sign a better trade deal with us than we have now.

2)  The gov already tried a divide and rule strategy with the EU, in fact it was pretty much the first thing David Davis tried.   It failed abysmally.  So why is the telegraph feeding its readers sh** like this as if its something that has a chance of success?

3)  What pressure on Brussels?   There is no pressure on Brussels.   All the pressure is on us.   We are the ones who will be utterly f***ed if we don't get a deal, not the EU.   They'll take some pain to be sure but nothing remotely like we will.  They know it too, as do we.   Ergo the pressure is on us.

4)  My f****** God.   Why are they still arguing over whether we go for a customs partnership or MaxFac, do they not yet realize that the EU has emphatically said no to both options?  And why does the telegraph not mention this fact?   Surely they should want an informed readership?   Oh wait this is the daily telegraph we are talking about....",1530403309

&gt; At the height of election season in Mexico, contraband means mostly political campaign ads: Guards confiscated thousands of banners and posters, from every major political party in Mexico, in just a few weeks.

&gt; These ads, along with the political parties that produce them, are completely banned in Cher&amp;aacute;n, and have been since 2011, when residents overthrew their local government and started over.

&gt; For many in Mexico, especially in an election year marred by wanton political murders, Cher&amp;aacute;n stands as proof that, in the country&amp;#039;s entrenched cycle of violence, the key ingredient is the state.

"Nepal","t5_2qs6h","Sure. Other governments have controlled demonstrations by Tibetan refugees, set up tight security in Tibetan heavy areas like Bauddha, etc where self immolations took place. This was different. This was a Nepali play about a Nepali experience. This wouldn't have any direct effect on Chinese internal security. I know. I know. Chinese sense of internal security is paranoid, as their recent effort to wipe Taiwan off airline websites has shown. And even countries much stronger than Nepal don't protest. So, it's likely that someone at MFA took a stock of this situation and pre-emptivley shut down the play before the Chinese, who are very ridiculously sensitive, could protest.

So, on it's own merits, the shutting down of he play can be seen as a foreign policy compulsion. However, as Mulmi says, this act falls in line with other efforts by the Oli government that are sinister. Mulmi mentions the National Integrity Policy and the proposal to accredit journalists. There is also the home minister's project to shrink spaces for dissent, however minor they may be. My point with this post was to to give an alternative view how Oli's government has been doing so far.  It may be doing good for itself by applying that the power that it has obtained, but what it is doing in some areas is not good for Nepali society has a whole.",1530403312

Rather than saying a character is OP, pick up their counters.

I find WB's grappling hook pretty difficult to use for the limited use you get out of it, and it's extremely situational. So at best he can just roll about; a mode in which he cannot attack and (aside from no headshots) takes the same damage. That leaves the shield (which works great to counter dive but not much else) and the ground smash, which is extremely situational as well.

As far as I can tell his best feature is the primary fire, which is like a more accurate Orisa. I see him as a speedy Roadhog: more a meaty DPS than a tank in a lot of ways. So, like Roadhog, expect him to get torn apart by CC.",1530403312

The thing is, she had the most unhealthy eating habits while trying to pretend they were natural too. She would leave leftovers forever in the fridge, claiming she was going to eat this nasty crap that looked like cat barf that had been in there for weeks and weeks. And sometimes she would actually eat it, of course becoming deathly ill in the process. And she is one of those extremely obese people with end stage renal disease who should be concerned about her eating habits and not hassling me because I'm drinking water out of plastic bottles! She also had a cat and when she cleaned the litter box, she would put it in a bag with days of cat poop until the whole apartment stunk. She was also crazy and had the poor elderly landlords who lived above us convinced that she was this sweet little old lady who wouldn't hurt a fly (like Norman Bates mother!).

&gt; At the height of election season in Mexico, contraband means mostly political campaign ads: Guards confiscated thousands of banners and posters, from every major political party in Mexico, in just a few weeks.

&gt; These ads, along with the political parties that produce them, are completely banned in Cher&amp;aacute;n, and have been since 2011, when residents overthrew their local government and started over.

SC2 kinda fell behind because of Heart of the Swarm. They did a lot of changes into the game's multiplayer on the release of it and had a lot of people move away from it or back to Brood War.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","Honestly, I didn't have many common interests per se with female friends - but everyone at my college is fairly 'academic' and so it was much easier to have normal/meaningful discussions and conversations in comparison to my high school. I mainly met girls just through hanging out in common areas/at study spaces, through classes, or at college-sponsored events. However, I did make connections with male friends through club sport teams like soccer and through other college societies - like a film society. Obviously once you make friends it becomes easier to make more because you get introduced to mutual friends and can become acquainted with them and what not.  


I tried therapy a couple times - but didn't find it to be particularly helpful. I was too caught up in the mindset that I was too unattractive to be involved sexually/romantically with anyone. The therapist would preach that I had to love myself first before being involved romantically with others, but I found this advice to be quite unhelpful. Truth be told, I did 'love myself' and was proud of what I had accomplished so far in life. However, if others found me unattractive because of physical features that I couldn't change - why should I not be upset about the experiences that I would miss out on as a result? I didn't see how this had anything to do with me 'loving myself'. Anyway, I had a difficult home life and wanted to escape it through education, so in a way this was generally a welcome distraction from the feeling.",1530403314

There are several stories about parents who have been deported and their children are still in detention centers in the U.S. Hell, we're having to do genetic tests to figure out which kid belongs to which parent because the government wasn't tracking it. And while the Jews were being rounded up before then, extermination didn't start until 1941. Hitler had come to power in 1933, so acting as though Trump is moving slowly is a little strange, as it took Hitler quite awhile to actually start killing the Jews. He ran on stripping them of their citizenship status (what Trump ran on for permanent residents/citizens who had committed any crime, no matter how minor), not on exterminating them outright. 

On consolidation of power, well. . . It appears Justice Kennedy may have had some sort of quid pro quo arrangement with Trump due to lengthy financial ties, and McConnell won't allow anything Trump might not sign to go up for a vote in the Senate. Meanwhile, they're packing the courts with judges Trump nominated. So while he hasn't officially consolidated power, one could easily argue that Trump is doing the smarter, more subtle play and ensuring he has sycophants in each branch instead of simply declaring himself the be all end all.

Joel Little imbibed so much production value, creating a deeply moving and unique album that changed the entire art-pop genre. Been listening to PH almost daily for 4 years and still never feel like I can get tired of it, it's the audio equivalent of The Office in that listening to it feels like a wearing a warm blanket and everything works out so good~. There's not a single song on PH which I dislike, from the vocal detail in Ribs to the way there are two different ""Yeah"" layers in Tennis Court to the hard-hitting relatable lyrics in Buzzcut Season to the absolute masterpiece which is the 2nd chorus of White Teeth Teens. I literally invested in a sound blaster, dac, amp and HD600s just so I could listen to White Teeth Teens and try to weed out a bit of the bass distortion and boy was it worth. There are a couple of songs on Melodrama which come close to evoking my obsession, in particular Sober and Supercut, but in the wider spectrum of Lorde's entire works (Magnets, YFB, Easy, Good Fights, Ladder Song etc.) I've found even the small tidbits of Lorde we got in the interim between the albums retained more of the lo-fi art-pop type of sound than Melodrama did. Obviously Melodrama was produced mainly by Jack Antonoff who is an entirely different person living in an entirely different country with entirely different influences so we couldn't really expect a 2nd PH with the same kind of sounds/emotions being evoked, but unfortunately Melodrama is just missing something to me and i'm not sure if anything will compare with the pure unadulterated gold that is PH in the future. I think it shows in her live performances even in 2018 she still always plays a mix of PH and Melodrama rather than a pure performance of her newest songs.",1530403315

&gt; At the height of election season in Mexico, contraband means mostly political campaign ads: Guards confiscated thousands of banners and posters, from every major political party in Mexico, in just a few weeks.

&gt; These ads, along with the political parties that produce them, are completely banned in Cher&amp;aacute;n, and have been since 2011, when residents overthrew their local government and started over.

&gt; For many in Mexico, especially in an election year marred by wanton political murders, Cher&amp;aacute;n stands as proof that, in the country&amp;#039;s entrenched cycle of violence, the key ingredient is the state.

Remember, a commercial glaze is only “safe for food” if fired to the listed temperature over a bisque fired to a specific temp. So use cones when you fire those glazes to ensure even and complete firings. 
Most colored commercial glazes are made with Frits. Those are glazes fired then reduced to crushed powder that fire to a predictable color every time. Frits are much safer than raw ingredients. The raw colorants are already safely melted into the frit. 
Mayco Stroke and Coats have been on the market for more than 20 years so I’m thinking there would have been notice if they were poisoning people.

In the ATBC study, beta-carotene supplements (20 mg daily) were also associated with increased mortality, mainly due to lung cancer and ischemic heart disease [26].

Pex plumbing is dead easy, and you use crimped metal bands around copper fittings with pex.  Crimps wouldn't be used on PVC which is glued, or on copper pipe which is brazed/soldered.  The crimps are good forever if you use the right size bands, with the right tool.  Pex is amazing.

"yoga","t5_2qhq6","I frequently deal with impingement issues and I have RA and it affects my shoulders quite often.  It really can interfere with my yoga practice, and it can be quite frustrating when i *know* I am strong enough to do a particular pose/movement but i *can't* at the moment (such as chaturanga to upward dog-- when my shoulder is flaring up, I have to do knees-chin-chest to low cobra instead).  

**My biggest advice is to listen to your body.**  When you know your shoulder is inflamed and hurting, do not push it too far or you'll likely damage it more.  Some areas your improvement will be slower than you'd like, but in the long run, you'll be better off for it and your shoulders will be healthier.  

More personal experience:
when my shoulder is flared up, I have to skip most side planks and anything that really puts a lot of pressure on that shoulder.  Sometimes I can do down-dog, sometimes I can't.  Same with ""regular"" plank or forearm plank.  Sometimes I can barely raise my hand over my head at all so I have to modify EVERYTHING.  Get comfortable with modifications and look into PT for your shoulder impingement.  Do what you can and remember that just because you can do something today, doesn't mean you can do it tomorrow and vice versa. 

For me, I've had to accept that I may never be able to do certain poses, or that it will take a VERY looooong time for me to get there.  My body limits me in some ways, but I can focus on other poses instead.  :) ",1530403323

AKA plot armor.

The main character has some kind of godly ability that lets him win a gun battle...with his signature sword weapon.

&gt; If ""stats"" that only matter when it's about the main character getting unique powers are an valid excuse for LLENN, then the same must aply to Kirito. You can call one a plot armor but not the other.

At this point you can't complain about the downvotes.

Fuka's stats were higher from the second she created her character because of her account (she is a very seasoned VRMMO player).

LLENN spend x amount of time training, fighting bosses and dying before she became the pink devil.

Pitohui became obsessed with VRMMOs since the aincrad incident.

And still, none of them would dare to use a sword in GGO multiple player match to slice bullets.

&gt; US President Donald Trump allies Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani on Saturday urged regime change in Iran, saying the prospect was closer than ever after the Islamic Republic was hit by a wave of strikes and protests.

&gt; &amp;quot;The only way to safety in the region is to replace the dictatorship with a democracy and that has to be our goal,&amp;quot; Gingrich told the Free Iran rally, organised by exiled opponents including the former rebel People&amp;#039;s Mojahedin which is banned in Iran.

&gt; The latest protests follow dozens over the new year which left at least 25 people dead. The People&amp;#039;s Mojahedin were founded in the 1960s against Iran&amp;#039;s royalist government and went on to fight the Islamic regime after the 1979 revolution.

The loop itself might be rendering graphics or performing very light calculations etc, so that it can get affected by a fully loaded browser.""

Essentially this will make it so that the POW you do will be unnoticeable to you when it comes to speed/loading a website etc, because the fragile loop does not allow it to use too much CPU. Do you think they haven't thought of the problem you mentioned? Their goal is to make it as user-friendly and invisible as possible.

Also a couple of my friends have seen the Dark Tournament, and the opinions varied from ""I was hooked from the start"" to ""the Dark Tournament sucked until Toguro killed Genkai"". I can sympathize with both sides but I feel each fight in the Dark Tournament had something interesting going for it that made it engaging, whether it be our heroes having some sort of obstacle to overcome or just an interesting villain with cool abilities.

I do think HxH handled Gon vs Hisoka in a more realistic way, the Toguro fight kinda had Yusuke pulling some things out of his ass (spirit cuffs for example). But Toguro was such a good antagonist and his last appearance and interaction with Genkai was great.

I'm gonna have to go with Dark Tournament though, and it's kind of unfair because we're comparing HxH's small tournament arc with little narrative significance to the arc YYH is most famous for that had every character grow in some way.",1530403326

Best ones for me personally are:  
[Collector Store](http://collectorstore.com) - they don't usually put product on site until about a week or so prior to release.  
[Sports &amp; More on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sportsandmore) - can pre-order CYHO now.

* orisa halt enemy
* upon detonation, set your hook flying, this is like guaranteed hook if you do it when you see detonation
* Sombra hack enemy that is pulled in

Whatever that enemy is, D'va, another Hog, Orisa, Rein etc he will be face to face with Hog and rest of the team with no abilities. Including movement abilities.

Mei had it worst because when pulled in she can't turn into icycle, put up a wall or freeze anyone. And when she is pulled in, all those stuff are already disabled. Entire enemy strat crumbled.

If the location in which cursed doors/chests spawn is changed, then there would be less problems, but as it stands now the way it's designed isn't really fun. Nobody should have to run through a level to confirm the number of mobs left either. 

Another simple solution could be to have a counter in the corner somewhere, displaying the number of remaining enemies; there really should be a change here to make the design less frustrating. Or, make the curse givers inform you of the remaining enemies. That would be pretty neat too.",1530403328

In Australia, water is precious. And expensive. So we help others monitor it using lorawan on very large farms. 
Flow, presence, height, quality. 
We amped it up by adding controls so pumps and valves change automatically as water comes down a row or furrow, or a tank goes dry. 
Saving water. Reducing electricity usage. Which means less coal burned, and less CO2 and reduced runoff to the Great Barrier Reef. Totally a win/win thing. 
We are working on improving our sensors (10+ so far) and systems to make them general public suitable, and with global RF approvals enabling exports. Goal is to drive the cost down to 1/10th of a typical system (eg PLC and licensed Spectrum) so everyone can afford to monitor and manage their water. If you have a spare million, I’m interested - I peg RF testing, engineering and development at $500,000 and our customers can’t afford that just yet ;-)",1530403330

To make it quick, let’s just say they almost got bought by Vivendi, a big company, that’s why they changed their strategy and made more games with less quality and filled their games with a big in-game store. But now they got rid of Vivendi (2-3months ago) and it’s a big victory for them.

Ubisoft wants to stay independent, and anyway Vivendi would’ve made their games very very super bad (Big P2W games)",1530403331

The key is to never stop getting up after you fall, to never stop fighting or believing God can’t help you rise above sin, and to earnestly and humbly seek God’s mercy no matter how many times it takes. 

Don’t listen to the devil. He wants you to believe you can’t succeed, can’t fight back, and can’t conquer sin. Well, let’s just say he’s called the King of Lies for a reason. 

You CAN succeed. Doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. Doesn’t mean it won’t be a long journey. But you CAN do it, and if you rely on God completely, you will. God bless. ",1530403333

Sassafrass definitely tasted like root beer and birch like birch beer.

I find it hard to tell whose ""fault"" it is. Both sides, I guess. Both speaks to bad planning and lack of foresight and I have a feeling the books will have some let downs in store as well. Simply because everyone now expects them to be better than the show and high expectations come before the fall.

Hi there! I'm starting to get into 2D Animation after doing some shorts in 3D. I've never learned how to draw until recently and still am trying to get things down. RIght now I'm in the process of designing some characters for a cute 2D short I wanna do, but to make sure I understand how this works:

- I don't have to draw the background every time, right? I can put that on a separate layer and sort of scroll over different parts of it if the camera moves?

- For different scenes like close-ups or camera angle changes, I really do have to draw the character again, right? That's why we make turnarounds, so we have something to look at when drawing the character again?

- For complex motions like drastic changes in poses, I also have to redraw some parts of the character for that, right?

- In a nutshell, is there some technique to save time, or is there really a LOT of drawing to be done when working in 2D? It's not like 3D where it's mostly puppeting the rig?",1530403336

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","The big takeaway here is that block IDs don't refer to classes, they refer to *instances of* classes. Same for item IDs and the like.

As an example, vanilla's `BlockStairs` has a constructor that takes a blockstate as an argument. It means you don't need to make a whole bunch of `BlockStoneBrickStairs`, `BlockBrickStairs`, `BlockPurpurStairs` classes, one for every stair in the game - you can pretty much just call `new BlockStairs(Blocks.STONEBRICK.getDefaultState())`, and poof - it's already a stair block, that behaves in all the ways you would expect stairs to behave. And, despite using two block IDs, there's only one `BlockRedstoneTorch` class; it just takes a boolean parameter for whether the torch should be ""lit"" or not. Same for `BlockRedstoneLight`, which is in charge of both redstone lamps. Iron bars and glass panes are both `BlockPane`s, a class that takes one `Material` argument and one boolean determining if you need Silk Touch to collect it.

Frankly I'm really surprised they didn't start doing this much, much earlier! Slabs are horrendous. They tried to shove as many slab types as possible into 16 data values, which (surprise) ended up being a *nightmare* to maintain. There is a wooden slab that behaves like a stone slab, an artifact of *Minecraft 1.2*, that still exists in 1.12, simply because it is so hard to remove. Not to mention they ran out of metadata values so they had to make a `stone_slab2`, then came to their senses and made a `purpur_slab`... Fuck. Metadata.

The best part, though, is that the way a block *looks* is nearly entirely defined by its model. If you want two blocks that behave in exactly the same way, you *don't even have to pass in an argument in the constructor* - you just have to make another instance.

Vanilla Minecraft actually already does this in a couple of places. There's a handful of blocks, such as iron blocks, coal blocks, purpur blocks, end stone, etc. that don't even *have* a class all to themselves, being registered only as `new Block()` with a handful of setters chained on to the end. There's a similar thing going on with `BlockFence` and `BlockFenceGate`.

(Of course there's some historical weirdness in vanilla Minecraft - there's a `BlockNetherrack` class, for example, which extends `Block`, but only consists of things that could have been set without using a custom class at all. Ah well. Hopefully that goes away in 1.13.)

And by the way, ""flattening"" and removing metadata actually allows for simplifying a bunch of things. Right now, most blocks that use metadata for distinct ""variants"" (such as how stone bricksm chiseled stone bricks, and cracked stone bricks all share the same block ID) need to have a class all to themselves, so they can work out which item that the block should drop. You won't even need to make a block like that in the first place in 1.13.

As stated before, you don't get to determine what hate speech is, your government does - when you advocate such garbage laws. Therefore, what you've commented right here right now, can be considered hate speech. In a free country, the individual decides.

The difference is, I can say what I want, where I want and face no *legal* repercussions. You can't say the same. 

Regarding the AR15, you're really contradicting yourself here. First, you claim you're an advocate of gun-laws and it's what makes your country safe. Now you're claiming your father-in-law got one ""easily"". Which is it? 

It's incredibly ironic you're sitting here advocating your hate-speech laws when it ""infringes on other people's rights"", yet here you are, spreading ""hate"" against a religion because of your beliefs. The left is most famous for their hypocrisy and it's not hard to find, as seen here. Under leftism laws only should apply to others, not them. 

That's what's great about America. Here, you have every right to do that. I would fight for your right to be able to have the anti-religious beliefs you have and be able to say negative things about it.

There **will** be job losses. That's not even debatable, and the number of losses will far outweigh the gains made in a handful of steel plants that absorb some domestic production capacity.

&gt;My dad made 75k at his Union job last year and was paying 48% taxes overall with state and federal taxes, the new tax calculator shows his federal tax rate on that 75k is only $5,400

Just so we're clear... Did you think 48% tax meant he was losing just under half his income before?

Taxes are applied x% on the first say $25k, then x% on amounts above that as your income climbs into higher brackets.

Only a fraction of his income was taxed at a 48% rate.

When people try to say that they ""made less after getting a raise"" because they entered a higher bracket, it's simply not true.

I'm not saying there wasn't any benefit to your families income due to Trumps tax cuts either. There probably was. But eroding that much of the countries tax base without replacing it somehow is why the deficit is going to be much much worse by the time Trump is done.

It's a continued pattern for Conservative government to cut taxes for the wealthy in particular, while cutting back on health care and other social services that benefit everyone in order to pay for it. Income inequality is bad enough already. Our governments shouldn't be enacting policies that add to it in my opinion. ",1530403341

It must be brutal to drive truck near cities.

When I was fresh on the road though, I'll confess right here.  I used to cut off truckers doing +20mph.  It was so dumb.  I figured if I was going so much faster than them, cutting them off didn't matter since they didn't really need to slow down.  That's the most insane stupid faulty logic ever.  Inches from their bumper.  By all rights I should have died in a car crash long ago.

Count your lucky stars right now people.  RIGHT THIS MINUTE.  You've escaped death how many times?  It's not going to last.  One errant nail on the road while you're trying one of your ""this will be ok"" moves and you're dead.  Everyone in your car is dead.  People in other cars are dead.  EMT has to come out and have a shit day cleaning up your organs.  Huge traffic backup while they clean up the remains of you, your car, your friends, some stranger's car, their family.  The risk isn't fucking worth it.

Think about it right now.  Look at the difference in mass.  Look at stopping distances.  Give trucks room.  You're commuting, but they're already at work, the road is their office.  You are in their world and you need to give them preference.

It gives them an idea of what it's like to care for something for a few days. If they don't like the commitment but are cool with fostering, that's great too!  


It's never easy though. I cry every time I have to give my foster cats away but I know in the end, they're going to their forever homes and they're going to make another person happy. We need more foster parents since our shelters are at full capacity. Animals are getting euthanized every day because of limited space!

Part of the reason I think that therapy is not very effective for people with bipolar disorder is that we run through these things over and over again in whatever various mindsets we're in. We have someone to talk to because we are a shifting base.

I understand wanting to help people, lost quite a few friends to drugs, and I've done a decent amount of volunteer work for homeless housing and stuff. 

Check out Bojack Horseman if you haven't that show is like liquid therapy for me. It's like I feel like everyone understands depression now, there isn't a veil over it anymore, and it's the biggest part of a Pixar movie. Nobody is going to make a pixar movie about us, because it's hard for people understand the pain that manic brings about in me.

"news","t5_2qh3l","**Edit: I'm not in any way saying that I'm totally free of danger. I'm just explaining the steps that we take to try to minimize risk. I often see threads about heroin being discussed by people who have never used or been exposed to heroin, so I wanted to give some perspective from an actual heroin addict.** 


Here's the processes my current dealer and my bf and I go through when there's a possibility of a batch containing fent:


When my dealer gets a new batch or a batch that he's been warned has been reported to be strong, he dumps everything out and mixes the powder together to try to make sure that any fent is mixed well. He, his gf and his brother then do a couple test shots, I'm not sure about the details of how because I'm not there for that. If it's okay to sell (and he has trashed dope before because his brother fell out) he rebags it either by weight or by individual bags depending on how much he's selling. Then he texts my bf and tells him whether it's good and how strong it is. 

By the time it gets to my bf and I, we know it's unlikely there's going to be a deadly amount of fent in the dope. I'm **not** saying it's impossible, but there's more of a chance that at least one of the three would have overdosed if it was heavily cut. 

So if it is stronger than usual, my bf insists on doing a test shot before me. When he does a test shot, he mixes everything we have in water so it all dissolves evenly and there's no uneven distribution of fent. Usually we would only mix up one shot at a time. Then he does a small shot, waits a bit to see how he feels, and does more depending. 


At this point it isn't really to test whether or not it's going to kill us, it's to test exactly how strong it is so he knows how to dose it. Of course there is still a risk of overdose. Again, I'm not trying to downplay the risks of shooting fucking heroin, especially fentanyl laced heroin. He insists on doing it instead of me because he's bigger, has a higher tolerance, he's been using for 6 years and he knows how to test out how much to dose because he can feel how it's reacting to his body. In our situation, it would be more of a risk to both of us to have me be the one to do the test shots. Its not that I don't care about my bf, it's literally safer to do it this way. 

So when I said ""I'm not in much danger"", I guess it was the wrong choice of words. I just meant that we go through as many steps as we can to minimize risk, compared to just throwing caution to the wind and crossing my fingers as I shoot what I'm hoping is just heroin in my veins. That's all I meant.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Or alternatively, you don't see them systematically attacking your hobbies, havent been attacked directly by them and are living blissfully unaware of them pushing their identitarian politics into everything and I do mean, EVERYTHING.

I'm a gamer, you see, and I like to compare ""LGBT"" characters from before SJW influence and after.

Before; two of my favourites are Kaine and Emil from NieR, who are an hermaphrodite and homosexual boy respectively. They don't make mention of it unless it's necessary to the scene and for Kaine, it's a major point of her character and informs her behaviours due to the bullying and harassment she received as a child.

After; Well you have a bunch of people in Assassins Creed that I can't remember because they're insignificant characters who are physical embodiments of the identity, literal token characters. There's the sister from ""Gone Home"" that I remember nothing about except that she was lesbian because that's literally her entire character. And that's all of them that I can remember because generally, they're background characters that are meaningless to the plot and can be completely ignored.

The quality of writing in games has gone through the floor too, and while I'm not going to blame it on the writers' ideology what I will say is that it doesn't surprise me that the writing is awful when you have people who would otherwise be spending their days writing fanfiction on Tumblr. It doubly doesn't help that they hate the players.

And to bring it to something more modern, TLJ was a complete shitshow and was pushing a political narrative while also shitting on the previous Star Wars films. Why do they feel the need to push a political agenda in a Star Wars movie? Why can't they have an overarching complex theme, rather than a simplistic one? Why am I a better writer than the people who're running the entertainment industry nowadays?

At the end of the day, it keeps going. They inserted themselves into Magic the Gathering and started pushing their politics and ideology there, they're going after Warhammer 40K, a grimdark sci-fi franchise as I type this and any time something bad happens journalists immediately start blaming Gamergate - a movement for ethics in journalism - because those nasty gamers didn't like them all working together to push their shitty products on the market and were calling them out, only for them to shift the blame and pretend it was about ""harassing women"".

And look at my account, it's been around for twenty-two days. Twenty-two days, and you think that I have a warped view of reality from spending too much time in certain subreddits?

No, good sir, I am embroiled in a culture war against people that see everything as political and act accordingly because believe it or not, I don't want everything to be political. I want to go home, pour myself a glass of whiskey, and play some video games that happen to have nice anime tiddies in them but that's not allowed now because SJWs are the modern-day puritans, the Jack Thompsons of the past that were mocked to no end have come back and they've got dyed hair and problem glasses.

I don't hate women, I don't hate gay people and I don't hate minorities - I am one. I just don't want any more damn inserts for modern politics in my games. I don't want to hear what some upper-class white guy thinks about race relations, I don't want to hear what some upper-class woman thinks about masculinity. I just want, if even only for a couple hours a day, to escape reality and enjoy a world where I can be who and what I want. I hold equal disdain for authoritarians of all stripes, be they Christians, Muslims, Feminists, Communists, Fascists or Ethnonationalists. I just want to be left alone, but instead I have to be perpetually on guard against a horde of loud, angry people who aren't the intended audience, aren't the political norm and aren't remotely a majority but have disproportionate effect in society because of how they hold positions of power and never stop screeching.

I'm just a lower-class guy trying to save up for university so I can improve my life but in their eyes, I'm the goddamn devil.

I wish I was like you, I wish that I didn't see what was going on around me but I've always been an individualist, I've always wanted fair treatment and equality.",1530403346

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I’m glad to hear you’ve got a good outcome! The medical team has been more positive than I have been, so far. Especially the perinatologist from yesterday. I’m keeping his comments at arm’s length (he said several times that he thinks we’ll be okay considering how rapidly the CH is disappearing). He’s one of two that my MFM was willing to send us to in this area (down to expertise), so it would be really easy for me to run with that, y’know? We just want her so badly. But I’m not up for another startle right now. I can’t afford to bury my head in hope. When the tests come back, we’ll start to breathe a little (or not)- I told the MFM that heart stuff scares me considerably less considering all of the amazing things they can do surgically now, but the rest of this is nightmare fuel. Luckily the MFM is on it and already has dates in mind for the first couple of echos. 

You’re so right about a support system being important. I... haven’t been willing to tell very many people in my life (maybe three friends, none of them geographically close, my mom (very recently) and my brother. Honestly, I’m finding the same kind of road you did where my husband is the only one who seems to get it (apart from the medical team and they all do- I can’t say enough good things about these people). The husband and I have been together more than half my life, so even outside of this issue, he knows what I’m thinking probably 95% of the time. Especially now, he can see the panic on my face from across the room before it starts to get unmanageable. And of course he can relate. Most of the other people I’ve confided in either have no idea what to say or are leaning more towards positivity and not researching too much, because “it’ll work itself out, what’s meant to be will be”- none of that is bad advice but it doesn’t... help, really? They’re wonderful for trying. Luckily no one has said anything absolutely unforgivable (the fear of that is the main reason most people have no idea). Actually, most people don’t know I’m pregnant. Not because of this, just... have felt the need to keep it private from the beginning. 

We’ve got two more days to wait for FISH. It’s gonna be a long couple of days for sure. I skipped one event tonight because those people all know I’m pregnant and I don’t think I can do the baby chatter (as much as I love them). Just kind of holing up at home this point and waiting.",1530403347

I also realized that happiness is more important than enlightenment. So I learned to stop questioning things that gave me anxiety, and just live in a way that made me happy, for me I found this in religion. 

It sounds simple, it's not really that easy, it took me hitting rock bottom before I could even make sense of what was important for me in life.

I had to change what I found meaning in really, anyways, hope this resonates with someone.

Their systems are better, students are supported, and they come out with a better education.

In the USA, closed minded individuals get upset when you bring this up... here’s the issue: people are not upset about higher taxes, they’re upset about HOW THOSE TAXES ARE SPENT!

Think about it: hypothetically if the government taxed 100% of your income but you lived in paradise and had everything you ever wanted, itd be great!

Of course, you suggest that and you’re called a socialist or something... But the issue with previous socialist systems is that the taxes were still not spent in an ideal way. 

Why? Because governments are corrupt. 

So would it ever actually work? Probably not... not unless we achieve some sort of enlightened state as a society. Perhaps even then, it wouldn’t be great. 

But here’s the thing: again, just remember that if you’re upset about high taxes, you’re actually just upset about how those taxes are spent. 

Europe has very high taxes and their countries are really fucking nice. They get a lot for those taxes. 

In the USA, our government has no fucking clue what in the fuck they’re doing, so it’s shit!",1530403349

It has seemed to help compared to last summer. They aren't as lackadaisical this year which is nice. If you don't have a reason that you can't, you might try putting down several bowls of water just scattered throughout your home. That helped  us before. In the colder months, we can get away with 2-3 water bowls (3 animals), but in the summer sometimes we have 4-5 bowls in different rooms. Pretty much any room the animals could be in has a water bowl in the high heat months. Except the bathroom, no water bowls in there obviously. :)

Sivir, I think genuinely  she is.

She spikes harder, has a superior level 2 and level 6 powerspike as well as not being a crit ADC like Sivir/Xayah meaning she spikes much harder on just one item (unless Xayah goes storm razor).

"antiMLM","t5_2swge","Hi! I personally am a consultant for Pampered Chef and while I am thankful that your friends have had good experiences with the company, I’m afraid that has not been the case for me. I was roped into the company by the mother of a good friend. I was given the guise that it was a supportive, fun environment of my “co workers” as I had come to think of them. My “boss”es (my recruiter wnd her recruiter) pressured me into the business without much thought. I asked them questions and felt that I knew what I was getting into. As I still live with my parents, I ran this by my mom. She seemed apprehensive, but still tried to support me nonetheless. So, I signed up, purchased my $250 starter kit, set up my personal website, and was immediately affronted by my recruiter’s upline. She called me at 11 something at night when I was just settling down for bed. 

A week later, I got my kit, tested out everything that I needed for my grand opening show, and off it went. I was scraping by trying to convince people to buy things from me, to come to my shows, to have a show. I eventually hit my $1250 in sales from my first 30 days, got the 50% rebate from my kit, and my $275 commission. 


No one would host parties with me after this. 


At our team’s monthly “meet and motivate” meetings, which always happened late monday nights in a neighboring city, where it took me an hour to get home on a school night where I still had homework to do. I’d get home around 10:30 and have to be up by 7:30 to get to class by 9. At these meetings, it was explained to me that I was expected to spend my own money to keep myself active, to harrass my friends, family, neighbors, other coworkers, the parents of my friends, my professors, my advisor, and anyone else I could get go talk to me about “the business.” I ended up LOSING money (thankfully I caught this quickly, which was when I decided to quit.) almost immediately through this. 

My mom, trying to support me, ended up buying things she never wanted or needed. She wasted her money when I was only getting a fraction of it and would have been better off giving me an allowance again, despite being in college. 

When confronted about ahy I wasn’t doing well in sales, my recruiter and her upline shamed me for not trying hard enough. They wanted me to change who I am as a person. They wanted me to harass friends and family that had already blocked my phone numbers and social media trying to get sales. They told me that I would be succeeding more if I were to carry a pampered chef tote instead of a backpack (as though I was going to cause my tempermental body any more pain by putting all of my school supplies on one shoulder). They told me to ask EVERYONE about it. Strangers, even. 

When I told my upline that I wanted to leave, they told me it was normal to rack up debt my first few months, that it would eventually even out and then I’d start making a profit. 

They were wrong. They wrongfully have kept me in this loop. My recruiter has been trying to make me give her my login credentials so she can keep me active and make herself a director. She never had my best interest at heart, she only wanted to help herself make more money. 

Like I said, I’m glad that your friends haven’t been screwed over by this flawed system, but PC is just like every other MLM company and I’m done with it. They went after me the SECOND I turned 18 and then acted overbearing until I decided to quit, and now are trying to manipulate me further.

Me: You get another lollipop?  

Her: No, I get a wish!

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","No and it's a terrible platform for them to be on. Trump is always speaking about how he supports Law Enforcement and that's fine and mostly meaningless; at least it was until the Democrats themselves validated the opinion. The Democrats now appear to be the party of Anti-Law Enforcement. They now appear to be against those who keep our nation safe and dedicate themselves to enforcing the laws. So this puts them in a tremendously bad situation, not that their situation was good to begin with, and really gives the GOP fire fuel. It really puts the left on a bad footing.

Now, I want to say something on their base. It is not energizing the Democrat base. It's energizing a very tiny radical fraction of the Democrat base. In fact this week alone the #Walkaway movement has exploded. If you don't know what that is let me tell you. It's a mass exodus of Democrats who do not want to be associated with the Democrat Party anymore. They don't necessarily want to be Republicans but they definitely don't want to be Democrats. In another point this energizes the Republicans and pushes the Independents to the Republicans. I would imagine the number of people who actually want ICE gone, who want open borders, who want laws ignored, is minuscule compared to the population.

As a Conservative &amp; someone who does a lot with politics you can bet I'm going to use a lot of what's gone on this year against the Democrats. I'm storing these moments and they're all going to come back to bite them in the ass; and I'm only one person versus many. Should the Democrats push for this? No. They should distance themselves as far away as possible because no one is going to defeat the Democrats in a midterm election where they do not have a majority more so than the Democrats themselves. The other point is us conservatives welcome the walk aways and network with them.

In a normal election this would be an easy power turn over. This year? I can't even imagine what might happen.",1530403358

His interviews with NSA vet Bill Binney are very very interesting and eye opening. Even if you HATE jimmy and think he’s a ridiculous little man, at the end of the day all he really wants is to get progressive policies enacted.

Looking down on them, he knows that they need another omnipotent dictator, but as a prudent autocrat he has ensured that no one with even a little authority has the ability to rise to the top level. 

His health is failing, and the surest way to pick the right successor, someone with the perfect balance of intelligence and brutality, is to topple everything. In the ensuing chaos, of course the person most qualified to rule as a tyrant will rise to the top.

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","I plan on living a lavish lifestyle when I retire. Or at least more lavish than I am now while I'm working. My current budget is around $2500 a month or 30K a year (post tax). I probably spend around $1600 on actual living expenses and the other $900 on going out, eating out, fun stuff, and random crap.  By no means am I living a ""balling"" lifestyle, but I'm not exactly penny pinching or being as frugal as I could be.

I throw the rest of my income straight into investment and retirement accounts. The first thing I did after finding a good job, was build an emergency savings account, eliminate by debt, and then start saving. I started off saving 6000 a year, then went up to 15000 a year. Currently at around 30k a year. My goal is to put my self in a position where I am able to save 50k to 60k a year, while maintaining my current comfortable lifestyle/budget. I estimate I'll have around 2.5 million by the time I'm 45, at which point I plan on no longer working. That amount of money should net me around 100K a year. My spending budget will literally triple.

The trick is to find a yearly budget that you're comfortable with, and then actively seek opportunities that will increase your income. If you avoid lifestyle creep and invest all that extra money. You'll eventually have a ton of cash. It's a lot easier to save for a lavish lifestyle, if you don't life a lavish lifestyle.",1530403365

By my logic, I believe that medical decisions are best made by qualified professionals advising people of their options.

I believe that the pseudo experts of reddit aren’t qualified to decide who should have medical procedures nor which procedures they should be allowed to have. I for one, don’t view my circumsized penis as “mutilated”. 

When it comes to female genital mutilation, there are so many differences that it’s not even a comparrison. Male circumcision done at birth has valid medical benefits, but should be weighed heavily by the parents giving consent and the qualified medical professionals performing the procedures. Female genital mutilation is done without sound medical practice, often by unqualified providers. They’re performed to destory the function of female genitalia without any medical benefit. It’s done to control and to punish.

Domain Authority:

Domain Authority is a score measured by MOZ out of 100. It predicts how good any Website will rank in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

Whereas DA measures strength of entire Domain or Sub-Domain, Page Authority (PA) measures strength of an individual Webpage.

How it’s Calculated:

It is calculated based upon the inbound links quality and authority score. To improve you need to get backlinks from sites with Domain Authority DA Score more than your Website DA score.

How DA &amp; PA Score can be measured?

You can measure DA &amp; PA Score using MOZ's Open Site Explorer or MozBar (Firefox Plugin or Chrome Extention) i.e., MOZ's free SEO toolbar",1530403369

18x is a glorified ""undesignated infantryman"" program for the Army. They only have it because big army wanted to compete with the Navy for entry level guys enlisting. But they are structured entirely different. BUD/s does have timed PT runs, class evals and academics. But fundamentally, if you're still putting one foot in front of the other you can keep progressing till graduation. The catch is they make putting one foot in front of the other *really really really fucking difficult.*

Army SF is a 3 week tryout. They psych eval you; they have an old fashioned job interview. It's tough but they are taking notes on your teamwork and problem solving the whole time. Only half the class will DOR by the end, pretty light for special ops programs. But then they look at most who have just finish and say ""good job but you're not what we're looking for right now. Keep being a good soldier in your home unit and we'll take another look at you in a year or two."" 18x students that pass on their first try are...basically unicorns. SFAS is not set up for you, its set up for a SPC/CPL/SGT whose deployed once or twice and is already a subject matter expert in light infantry.

Yes, fans attacking fans is fair game. Because the attack always starts with japril fans attacking Kelly and Kelly fans lashing right back. The cyber bullying always starts with the japril fandom. Kelly’s fans retaliate and it’s necessary cos it’s the only thing that gets them out of Kelly’s mentions even if just temporarily. 

It doesn’t make sense to me either. I didn’t get it too seeing tweets of japril fans making fun of Kelly’s hair and her big nose.  Saying she’s unattractive and ugly next to Sarah and unworthy to be Jesse’s acting partner.

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsnapchat).

I agree with a lot of what you've written regarding Amanda being unfairly unliked, but I don't know about this part.  For one thing, the Favorites on the jury were split on their votes for Parvati and Amanda (Ozzy &amp; James vs. Eliza &amp; Cirie).  And for another thing, Parvati herself was just as much of a ""Who even IS this chick?"" casting choice on the Favorites, what with the relatively muted reaction when from the Fans when she walked out.  Maybe you can speak to if you know whether or not Parvati was particularly in with the Survivor alum social circles at the time of FvF filming, but I feel like Parvati herself didn't have a great standing within the Favorites early on (not sure if this is true, but hasn't it been said she would've been first out if not for Fairplay giving up?).  I think a lot of her victory just came down to Parvati getting closer with Natalie and Alexis (and to a lesser extent Jason) to vote out Ozzy earlier than Amanda got close to them (Amanda was never even on a tribe with the three of them until the merge).",1530403373

"iamverysmart","t5_2yuej","As someone who is not an atheist, but who studies mysticism extensively, it's not good practice for one to pray for someone to think or act a certain way. Because really, who are any of us to know what is ""best"" for anyone else? Every person and every force in the cosmos serves a function and no one function is more important or correct than any other function. Prayer is something that should be done as a form of introspection and meditation, and is also a form of invocation. People think it's a way to get things or barter with a greater entity, without having to do the work on the material plane to get what they're asking for (example: God please get me that job I want) which is rediculous (you have to be qualified for that job and prove your worth. It's entirely up to you) . 

If someone asks you to pray for them, you pray for them. Otherwise, to tell someone you're praying for them, especially if it's to change them somehow because you think your way is the best way or only way, is so selfish and accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone.

Edit: every time I mention I'm not an atheist on Reddit I get down voted. Do you guys want other people to  present our side of things or not? I'm literally agreeing with the other person about it being intrusive to tell someone who is an atheist that you'll pray for them. ",1530403374

"manga","t5_2ql0i","First of i want to say that i fell in love woth this manga the moment i started reading it, i think that the idea itself is original and great, and that the mangaka managed to convey how things that arent socially acceptable might be the things that will bring the greatest happiness to some people. I want to specifically reply to what you said about him being the son of a criminal, because there might also be other options. It makes more sense to me that his decision was more implusive, rather than well planned, and that he just kidnapped her because it was the fist solution that cane to his mind, also in the latest chapter we discover that sachi went through her home before she got kidnapped, so that leaves the option where she ran away, and he just took her in, without force or any kind of aggressive measure. It makes more sense because it fits the whole ""air"" of the plot more, at least in the way i see it. It would make more sense if he didn't actually plan to help her and by chance he did, because that will continue the whole ""hypocrisy"" theme that is going on in the story.

Now what you all forget, sometimes, is that going into that match that the Prime Time Players were your tag team champions, w-going in. So every time I get draaaaagged back here to good ol' Brooklyn... I always get someone answering the same question. Whether it be one of them broke brothers from Bushwick, or one of them uppity hipsters from williamsburg. They ask the question: ""Was that the worst day of your life?"" I look at em. And I say no. That wasn't the worst day of my life, cause when I flash this million dollar smile, I tell ya right now baby, that was the BEST day of my life. It wasn't the worst day of my life cause I dropped the tag team titles, it was the best day of my life, because I dropped the dead weight that was Darren Young. Oh no no no, let's let's let's let's be real. There's no Ride Along - there is a reason there's no episode of Ride Along with the Prime Time Players. Pretty difficult to do when it's only one Prime Time Player. And he would not be relevant - Darren Young would not be relevant if it wasn't for me. Much like Jay-Z wouldn't be relevant if it wudn't for Beyonce. Oh yeah you booin', but it's true, think about it! Bob Backlund. How is Bob Backlund gonna make Darren Young great again, when he wasn't ever great to begin with? I would be all over the main event. You would be wearing my T-shirt. Hell, I would be your Universal champion right now, if it wasn't for Darren Young. Y'all wanna talk about some Bobbbb BACKLIN. Well tonight, I blame YOU Darren Young. I blame YOU for all the failures that I have not ha-no-had since I been here. I blame YOU for not being in the main event. I blame YOU for not being the WWE Champion. And I'll tell ya tonight, tonight. You come out here tonight so I can bury you, and be done with you, all together. Come on out here Darren Young, give these people what they want. They want you, come on out here. Come on, we gon' make Darren Young great again, come on Darren.

"IronThroneRP","t5_345ny","*Takes place during [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/8u7g7i/from_the_ashes/).*

Imprisonment had not been kind to Daena Bittersteel. This became clear as she stepped into the light, hands bound in front of her and wrists rubbed raw by rope, squinting as the harsh glare of the sun cut into dark violet eyes that had long grown accustomed to shadows. Her once-glossy auburn hair, now stringy and clumped, reached her waist. Her features were gaunt, pale skin grown paler from lack of sun and stretched tightly across her face. 

She held herself with the last vestiges of her courtly training, her back straight and her chin high, fire burning in the depths of her Valyrian purple eyes, as she walked, almost calmly, to her death. Bitter fury mixed with guilt in her stomach, so strong as to almost make her sick, but she refused to show it in front of the scattered observers, staring on as though her execution was a mummer’s farce to gawk at. The faces stared at her from windows and balconies, round-eyed gazes stabbing at her skin. 

She kept her composure until she saw the pyre, and then she began to hyperventilate. Breath heaved in and out of her chest raggedly, uncontrollably, and she stumbled. She had thought she was going to the gallows or the block. That… that wouldn’t have been *good*, but it had been… expected. But this…

This was cruelty.

She stumbled, staggered, her well-learned grace abandoning her in the face of the overwhelming terror rising in her gut. She nearly fell, but one of the guards walking a pace behind her caught her roughly beneath the arm and dragged her back to her feet, shoving her ahead impatiently. 

*(i don’t want to burn i don’t want to burn i don’t want to)*

The other prisoners were escorted up onto the pyre, one by one, and one by one they were lashed to the poles, hoods pulled over their heads. For the sake of the dramatic reveal, no doubt. Her love had displayed a taste for showmanship in recent moons. This was all a show, and that hurt perhaps more than it should have. It shouldn’t have been a surprise, after what she’d done and what he’d done to her in turn, that he would stage her death as this grim spectacle, but it still hurt.

The guard shoved her up onto the pyre last, the ropes around her chest choking off her frantic breaths and the hood darkening her vision. She could see a blur of movement through the roughly-woven sackcloth that cloaked her eyes. A crowd was forming. An audience. 

Maybe the hood was a mercy after all. With her face shielded from the stares of the onlookers, the frightened, furious, guilty, bitter tears that had been welling in her eyes were able to slip down her cheeks without judgement, drip from her chin, and vanish unnoticed into the piles of dead wood beneath her feet.

She heard the crowd roar, and knew that the king had arrived. He was saying something, no doubt some grand speech or proclamation, but she couldn’t hear it over the blood rushing in her ears, the air rasping through her throat.

*(father below and father above i’m sorry i’m sorry i’m so sorry)*

Someone pulled her hood up to expose her mouth and tipped her head back, pouring something between her lips before she could think to close them. She recognized the cloyingly sweet taste almost instantly, and held it in her mouth a moment, hesitant. Some prideful part of her recoiled at the thought of being sedated, drugged through her own death, but the rest recognized the gesture as the mercy it was meant to be. She swallowed, and immediately felt her fingers begin to go numb, the sleep creeping up her arms and legs. 

*(father forgive me)*

The hood was ripped roughly off of her head, and she blinked reflexively against the light of the sun as it bit at her soft violet eyes. 

She was looking directly into the eyes of the king, purple on purple, and his eyes were cold. 

*(can’t you see all i did i did for you)*

Darkness was wavering around the corners of her vision.

“Daemon,” she gasped, nearly choking on her own tongue as it went numb, fighting to keep herself awake long enough to get just a few words out. Her head was so heavy. “Don’t do this. It isn’t too late. Please… Plea-”

Her vision went dark, and her head slumped. Her last thought, before the sweetsleep took her mind and the flames ate her body, was a simple one.

*(my king)*

*(my love)* 

*(i hope that you burn)*",1530403379

There is the funding issue:

donors from traditional funding sources to run their campaigns.

Diversifying campaign funds may be a successful strategy to draw voters that might otherwise be apathetic.

I vote. Other people may have legitimate complaints about the voting system that leave them feeling disenfranchised. Inability to recall representatives is just one of the problems.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","In the evening you may want to use a cleansing balm/oil before your regular cleanser to help remove sunscreen. Some options are Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil and Hada Gokujyun Cleansing Oil. Cleansing balms/oils are applied with dry hands and rubbed onto a dry face. They are easily rinsed away. If you don't want to use one, just use your regular cleanser.

Your skin will more than likely dry up on Accutane.  Use a hydrating cleanser (also sometimes called a cleansing milk). I recommend Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Creamy Formula or Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Hydrating cleansers are used on wet skin. If you want, you can skip cleanser in the morning and splash your face with water instead.

Apply moisturizer over damp skin. You'll probably want a thicker cream like Vanicream Skin Cream. If you'd like, you can add a gel with hyaluronic acid, such as Neutrogena HydroBoost Gel-Cream for Extra-Dry Skin, to your routine. Apply the gel on damp skin before your moisturizer to help retain moisture in the skin.

For sunscreen, get one that is SPF 30-50 listed as Broad Spectrum ( or PA+++ or PA++++ if you're buying a sunscreen from overseas). Sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide (inorganic UVA and UVB filters) are going to be thicker and may leave a white caste, especially if your skin is tan or darker. However, they are more photostabile than avobenzone (organic UVA filter) and some people are irritated by avobenzone. Find a sunscreen that suits your needs best. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7vX0cT-z0) has many examples.

Your lips will also most likely become chapped. Use an ointment with moisturizing ingredients such as Aquaphor, Vaniply, or Cerave Healing Ointment. You can apply this ointment to other parts of your face/body as well. Look for a chapstick with sunscreen. Vanicream has a lip protectant/sunscreen however it leaves a noticible white caste.

You may already know all the information for Accutane but just in case here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9LcbySaPTM&amp;t=) from a dermatologist. I also suggest you look up videos from people who've been on Accutane on YouTube to see how their experiences were.

Example Routine

AM

* Use hydrating cleanser (or splash of water)
* Apply hyaluronic acid gel on damp skin
* Apply moisturizer
* Apply sunscreen after moisturizer is absorbed

PM

* Use cleansing balm/oil on dry skin (if needed)
* Use hydrating cleanser
* Apply hyaluronic acid gel on damp skin
* Apply moisturizer

Apply ointment and sunscreen liberally and as needed.

It may take a few weeks before you need to moisturize heavily but it's good to be prepared.",1530403381

In my experience: i've had sexual encounters rather similar to what u described, and the girls were never as cool with it as u.

I told her it was my first time and all, but after that date, she just ignored me and we never spoke again. 

My first time having sex, i ended up having trouble keeping an erection too cos i was super nervous- fiddling around trying to put on a condom.. so u can guess i was totally flaccid by the time i got the darn thing on. It was so embarrassing. This chick also got super pissed, and said she was angry because ""i musta found her unattractive"" if i couldnt even maintain an erection... tried to tell her i wasnt in control of what was going on down there (cos of anxiety etc) , and that i found her totally attractive, hot and cute- but she also left me and went straight to another dude within a week.

An example that i recall from undergrad is a photon emitted at sea level, travelling straight upwards.

The space at the surface is compressed by earths gravity, and the space far away is effectively flat, or uncompressed by gravity.

As the photon travels into this uncompressed space, its wavelength is correspondingly stretched out, meaning its energy is lower than it was when emitted within the high gravity space at our planetary surface.

This is a result of general relativity, but you can think of it as the photon expending energy as it ""fights"" against the earths gravity. Note that this is not an entirely faithful analogy, because there is no exchange of mechanical energy here, and the photon travels at light speed the whole time without being slowed down.

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","&gt;. I've heard some broad criticisms, but nothing that I feel has really turned Peterson's theories over. 

Peterson has some weird ideas about ideas themselves, such as the DNA strand being in ancient art ect, and always seems to hinting that there is some sort of metaphysical reality but never has the gull to say it outright or clearly define it.

But with that a side he seems to think that Christian ""values"" are the best or the best there is currently and that is one of the main reasons for the wealth and success of the west(i.e. America).  But the problem is these ""values"" are nebulous in themselves because mainstream Christian thought/theology has radically changed several times throughout it's history. But what's worse is that you can make a strong argument that Christianity is more murderous than communism, millions of people have died in the name of it or it was used as justification.

Furthermore there are tons of countries that embrace Christianity way more than the U.S. but are way worse places to live. So that kind of discredits the theory. I have no doubt that culture can play a huge role in the success of a country but there is very weak evidence at best that it has anything to do with christianity, and the thing is that culture is constantly evolving and changing so the values/culture are not the necessarily the same ones that made the country successful in the first place, and even if they were the environment likely would have changed giving them far less utility in the modern world. 

And not too mention the various countries that aren't christian but are decent places to live like Japan.

But lastly, mainstream christian theology is pretty demonstrably false as there are many historical errors and contradictions in the bible so I do find it a bit dishonest of JP to be promoting christianity even in the soft way he does.",1530403387

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","I can't stress enough the first benefit that Jaehwan had that gave him that #27 position. He was allowed to show singing and dancing **separately**. All company evaluations should show both skills in singing (or rapping) and dancing. Hweseung had to combine them, but Jaehwan for whatever reason was allowed to have 2 separate performances, one dancing with the independent trainees (the main performance) and one solo on his guitar. That footage was only shown for a select few trainees, Jaehwan included. Jaehwan also got a favorable edit from Mnet showing those performances, while Hweseung did not. I also want to add that Jaehwan had appeared on a previous vocal show God's Voice and those videos were being circulated. All of the above reasons are why Jaehwan ranked so high and Hweseung did not.

Even if Jaehwan was placed in Be Mine instead, and ""slayed"" it, it wouldn't have the impact that Sorry Sorry did. Hweseung's Be Mine group was at the bottom of the ranks. Some of Hweseung's groupmates in Be Mine finished in the 90's, and out of his groupmates, only Yehyeon's rank rose, for a completely different reason outside of that performance.",1530403388

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Look OP, I know it can be hard but here's what I can advise you.  


Never make someone your world, that's a sure fire way to get destroyed after a break-up.   
Realized that human nature is so complex that we can lose anyone at any given time for even the dumbest reason.   


I'm going to give a counter intuitive advice here.  


DON'T seek closure. That's right, the harder you try to contact someone who ghosted you the more frustrated you are going to get. Just make up a reason why she left and stick with that. If she contacts you again then you can talk to her but don't expect.

You're young you have a lot to go through, work on yourself man.  


Tip: Never invest in a woman more than what you would invest in yourself. Always invest in yourself more. Also, be outcome independent, always be prepared to lose the girl. This doesn't mean you don't treat them right of course you should be respectful and appreciative but always be prepared that in a snap anyone can disappear. That's the reality of life.  


When you are most invested in yourself more. NO ONE out there and I MEAN NO ONE can destroy you by leaving your life.  
Love yourself and good luck!

Being the very definition of masculinity already  that didn't sound like I route I wanted to take - so there was no point in paying money for piece of paper to say ""yup, somethings wrong"".  Maybe I didn't understand or didn't listen very well though - so I suggest talking to the doctor at your clinic.  Chances are you aren't the first patient of his who has had this issue.  

Yeah - the sweet tooth got so bad for me I actually ended up getting cavities. A lot of cavities. Throughout my entire drug using career, a decade of speedball shooting, crack smoking, hustling for heroin and I never had any problems with my teeth.  I slow down, clean up, get on methadone, make candy my habit instead of dope, and start fucking up my teeth.  No joke.  I'm scared to go to the dentist because I feel like he'll want to pull my whole mouth.  I want to reiterate that these problems only started occurring once I got clean.  Obsessively brushing my teeth was one of my ""junkie ticks"" to the point it wasn't odd to see me walking around chewing on a toothbrush.


Anyway yeah, I'm sure it's just sympathy weight.  It probably has nothing to do with the methadone, your metabolism, or the junk food.

If you read through this thread,  the majority of the critiques of Peterson are fairly superficial and don't really discuss his point of view in any real meaningful way,  just basically repeating the idea that he's bad. 

Even when you're correct,  that's about the most boring and superficial way to discuss anything. 

I think I'm yet to read a single negative article about the guy that actually engages him on the level of ideas. And that's the level that I find interesting. 

Realize too, he doesn't have to be right about everything to provide food for thought. 

Even here,  amongst us rational atheists,  we're more intent on attacking the man instead of his ideas. Notice there's zero engagement on the idea of religion consuming itself... I mean,  that's a fascinating idea, and I'd entertain it regardless of its source. 

I'll say too, I like the idea of getting input from people all over the political spectrum. I think that at the moment,  it's the only way to have a clear idea of what's going on. 

Anyway, you're absolutely entitled to your opinion, and I don't particularly want to quibble over whether the guy is,  as a whole,  right or wrong.  I think he's an interesting character with some interesting ideas. ",1530403400

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","I was told I was a monster for most of life. That I had a mental illness that meant I was going to hurt people. I became a machine where I couldn't even think for myself because of it. My doctors were wrong and I never did hurt anyone, but in accepting my own darkness I saw the darkness of everyone else. I realized how similar people really are. When I almost died last summer I woke up to what I remember as a glow. I wanted to change the world. I wanted to save it from itself and as I slowly began to understand myself I began to understand the world too. But, I couldn't handle. 

Sometimes I think that this isn't my story. I am simply meant to be the writer of other people's stories. I would love to travel and help tell those people's stories. I like to think of it as a guardian angel. I'm having a hard time wanting to keep moving, but I can't go anywhere yet. I still have people in my life who have stories to tell.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","Where you draw the line is totally arbitrary - the universe has no morality and doesn't value one type of existence over another.

As others have pointed out a common place to draw the line is ""consciousness or sentience"", but as you've pointed out, plants may have their own subjective ""experience"", and, although different from central nervous system based experiences, it is probably nonetheless still an ""experience"". In my mind it seems ""privileged"" of humans to value sentience based ""experience"" over other kinds, as to me this seems like a strong, un-tested value judgement (i.e. we value consciousness over non-consciousness because we as humans are conscious, but it's possible that non-sentient experience may be the richer one on some level and who's to even say what ""richness"" of experience means).

There are metaphysical arguments that consciousness is universal, i.e. panpsychicism (keeping in mind this is just one view about consciousness amongst many and I'd wager that most are unverifiable at this point in time). I've personally considered whether an entity's existence (or really the breaking apart and processing of molecules for energy) is unethical as that entity is non-consensually ""extracting"" the energy of other objects in the universe (this sounds super circle jerky and wanky as I write it but I think it's still an interesting thing to consider). In this sense existence of any entity requires the destruction of other structures within the universe (increased structure within or around the entity, increased entropy outside of the entity). I'd say the most entities' existences privilege the preservation of that entity and the expense of their environment and the environment's other occupants (which may be ""unethical"" or an individual level but again arguments could be made for some kind of environmental ethical framework that considers the health of the system itself).

I'm mostly vegan (I believe in vegan actions, not in holistically vegan persons) because to me it seems ""morally good"" to not kill animals for environmental, climate and harm reduction reasons. However, I don't think I actually care about whether entities or conscious or not and I  disagree with the often reflexive vegan argument that consciousness itself is inherently a good thing. I think that eventually (maybe in 1000 years?, who knows) the vegan debate could progress to one that considers harming plants (or anything ""alive"") as unethical (maybe ""people"" are powered by solar powered batteries at that point) and the arbitrary line could be redrawn. For me, I draw the line where it ""feels good"" or ""makes sense"" for me to do so but I don't try to frame it within an ethical framework as I find none wholly consistent (although I reject the notion that arguments need to be consistent).

Sorry if a bit rambly and circular, I'm still sorting out this kind of question too in my mind.",1530403401

If it is all of them, then it may be the mic itself. As I said above, I have a separate mic from the headset, so it's better than a headset mic (Or at least one I can afford), but it was a cheap-ish mic. So that may be where the poor quality is coming from.",1530403404

As far as this issue , 64% of democrats are for ""secure borders"" instead of ""open"" borders according to a Harvard Poll.

Republicans on the other hand only 39% person ""oppose"" family separation as opposed to 90% of democrats according to a CBS poll. 36% straight out support and 24% are undecided which is expected in an issue like this but I doubt any republicans are ashamed to say they oppose this.

So it seems the misrepresenting isn't equal.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt;First off, it's a flagrant ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy.

No it isn’t. It’s only a no true Scotsman is what he is doing is irrelevant to his status. Like if I say that Richard Spencer is not a “true atheist” because he is a Nazi. That is irrelevant because he still doesn’t believe in God. Or if a Christian does something bad, I can’t say he isn’t a “true Christian” because being a Christian is not defined on whether they follow the Bible all the time or not.

However, whether you are okay with gay sex is very relevant to whether you are a progressive or not. You are not progressive BY DEFINITION. That’s like saying “well I’m a socialist, but I believe in free trade.” Well sorry to say, but you ain’t a socialist.

&gt;When you start dictating what opinions are acceptable for people to hold, you start becoming the thought police.

Because apart from the fact that sexual intercourse with a close family member is appalling to most people , there is nothing wrong with it. You don't have any arguments against it apart from the fact that you find it disgusting. That's how many people think about homosexuals as well, doesn't mean the thought is justified or has a moral reason, it's just a result of cultural sensitisation . Imo everyone can fuck whomever they want as long as no one is harmed, everyone involved is  a consenting adult and in the case of incest don't reproduce or at least reproduce with prenatal diagnosis due to the much higher risk of disability.

I think you're taking too much offense in the thought of fucking your own mum. Guess what, you don't have to.

Women find attractive men attractive, that is the point of being attractive. If given a choice they will sleep with an attractive man over the less attractive man, thats the whole point of attractiveness levels.

Men are same too, or I will say a bit more harsh. They will help and risk more for a girl who is more attractive. Everyone will say that if given a choice to save one girl from death out of the two, they won't bring attractiveness into the factor. But the truth is that your subconscious primal mind will for a fact favor an attractive girl. Men are more physically capable than women, and in old times females who werent able to attract much attention of men would have died without reproducing. And the women who would have attracted only the weak men who were not capable of protecting them, would have also died. Attracting a wide shouldered male meant for them more chances of survival. Can you really blame their subconscious mind for trying to stay alive if they choose the top genes man.

They prefer a man with such appearance i.e tall, wide shoulders, defined and wide jawline and strong chin. That is a fact

But here's another fact, men who don't have all these things are getting laid too. You can cry all you want that such men have to work for it or you can focus on getting the woman with top genes which will reproduce a chad son for you, who will have to work less hard to get girls.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Those were good things about it, but I couldn't enjoy them the first time through because of the frustrating way the gameplay was designed. So much of it didn't make sense. The radios setting off the collar was...gimmicky, but okay, I could have lived with that since I could destroy the radios.

Except when I couldn't, for no really well-explained reason. Alright, then, I'll sprint through toxic fog to safety if I must, while my health is at a sliver because of the environment. Then, at the end of all that, a bear trap.

Seriously? If the ghost people were setting up these traps, they had an unbelievably keen intuition for where to put them, considering that it didn't really appear they had the faculties to understand the nuances of the bomb collars. Elijah wouldn't have put them there simply to sabotage himself. Dean definitely put some of them up, but where he knows about them why didn't he warn you about their exact locations, and why did they seemingly coincide with exactly the places the courier would be running through to avoid fog and indestructible bomb collars.

The only explanation is that the developers wanted the player to suffer. Oh and don't even get me *started* about how hologram projectors work around corners to produce hard, indestructible, absurdly powerful enemies.

Second time through, yeah, I felt like maybe I got to enjoy the story a little more. First time through, hardcore mode, I was too busy having to memorize every detail of the Sierra Madre just to get to the end. Then I exploited the game to keep every bit of loot, because *fuck the developers and their stupid prick message*.

I’ve never understood the mentality of:

1. God loves everyone 

2. God is all powerful and can do anything 

3. You need to specifically ask god to stop doing shitty things to you and your loved ones otherwise he’s just gonna turn a blind eye to all your suffering due to him allowing crap to happen.




The very act of praying for things is sacrilegious in my opinion. If god is omnipotent then he knows all that has ever happened and all that will ever happen, and god “has a plan” for all of us. Therefore praying for him to do something for you is essentially saying “Hey I know what I need better than you know what I need so change things at my request.” If the very concept of faith is accepting things without question... then praying is questioning.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","&gt; Who said you have to be part of some fated bloodline to he powerful in the Force?

Midichlorians. 

&gt; The Skywalkers came from powerless slaves. 

That's true. Anakin was thought to be the Chosen One, but whether his existence was because of Darth Pelagius' doing or the Force's is unknown.  

&gt;  Luke and Anakin were both ace pilots and mechanics with no formal training. 

Not necessarily true. Anakin was a good mechanic because of his slave work and Luke worked tech on his aunt and uncle's farm. 

&gt; Luke was also one of the best shots hunting womp rats 

Again, not necessarily true. He says that he shot womp rats back home but was not ""one of the best shots"". Him making the shot at the end was due to him using the force, which he was trained in by Obi-wan earlier in the movie and a random rebel pilot made the same shot he did, but the torpedos didn't hit the reactor. 

&gt; The Force doesn't need extensive training, just someone willing to let it take the wheel. 

This is a very stupid statement no matter what you apply it to. You need to train in the force to be able to be good at it, like literally anything else. 

&gt; He was a berserker who threw all his anger and rage at the enemy and showed little of the finesse and skill master Jedi show. 

He wasn't trying to be like a Jedi Master. Jedi Master ""finesse"" didn't stand much of a chance against blaster fire or Palpatine's lightsaber. Windu only survived against Palpatine because he used ve pad, aka using his anger, whereas Jedi Master got 3 of them killed in seconds. Kylo was trying to emulate Vader's form (form 5 or 7, I forget), which is why he is aggressive in his fighting. 

&gt; Stopping the blaster was cool and intimidating but hardly was a sign of better combat ability given he's lost to every Force User yet 

Luke. The Padawans he killed. Snoke. The only force user he lost to was Rey, who is an established Mary Sue. 

&gt; The Praetorian Guards didn't have the Force and we're just pale imitations of the Imperial Guard Palpatine had.

The same guards we literally see nothing do? The Praetorian Guards nearly killed 2 powerful force users, despite them not being force users themselves. They are pretty powerful despite them not using the force.    
 
&gt; You also forget when Ben sacked the New Jedi Temple he had half the student backing him who became the Knights of Ren. 

Nope, he killed them himself. Here's something from the [the wiki:](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Destruction_of_Luke_Skywalker%27s_Jedi_Temple) 

""Ben left the ruins of his room and lit the Jedi Temple aflame before attacking his fellow students, murdering all but a handful who left with Ben as they fled the Jedi Temple."" 

&gt; Kylo isn't even close to beings like Vader in skill. 

I know. I don't know why you're bringing Vader up. I never compared Kylo to Vader or said that he was as powerful as he was. ",1530403415

Ditto for numerous extremist beliefs. As long as one doesn't vote from extremist false beliefs, they cause no harm. But, I still oppose such beliefs. I would not support outlawing them. I would just argue strongly against them.

&gt; They don’t “weaken our sense of truth” because that’s not the ~~general~~ consensus. 

Consensus already includes general, especially if it is the traditional meaning of unanimity rather than the more lax meaning of the overwhelming opinion of the majority.

&gt; I personally don’t know what to believe on the matter.

Which only serves to emphasize the problem. Why do you not know what to believe about something for which there is zero evidence?

&gt; humans don’t have the answer to everything on this Earth

We have never arrived at a single true answer, ever, not once in our history, by preassuming the existence of supernatural crap. So, while we may not know all the answers, we know that believing supernatural bullshit is never ... ever ... not once ... the right path to the correct answer.

&gt; As long as the behavior doesn’t become toxic to the rest of us, I say it’s okay

But, if 3 billion people believe crap and only a million of them become dangerous as a result, that is a million people who became dangerous by believing crap. And, they were enabled by the 2,999,000,000 others who believe the crap.

"boating","t5_2qm9s","If you have spark (on all three) it's not going to be a stator. Those ignition systems are however known for crossfiring cause by the power packs (black boxes before the coils). A quick check is to pull the plugs, and find your timing pointer. Ensure your key is off and rotate the flywheel by hand. Insert a screwdriver into #2 cylinder, and in sharpie, draw a 2 on the flywheel when #2 piston comes up to top dead center. Do the same for cylinder 3. You can draw a one on the 0 mark on the flywheel as that's obviously #1s top dead center. Insert plugs and have someone turn the key (it's not running at this point, so you'll have a difficult time rolling it and reading it at the same time). Use a timing light and go around the flywheel, looking for where all three cylinders are flashing, if two numbers end up flashing in the same location, you are crossfiring. Change the power pack. 
Secondly, another issue these things suffer from is a well vented float bowl. If this motor has sat, it is possible that the fuel in the float bowl has evaporated, leaving just a heavy two stoke oil deposit that drys up and gums up the jets and inlet needle.

Those kids would actively pretend not to hear you yelling their name to get their attention while they're trying to light their shoes on fire or just play out the first dumb idea that come to their head. I work with a kid like that, lets call him Johnny. None of the counselors have been able to get him to do what he's supposed to be doing. I just recently got Johnny to consider listening to me. I saw him and his friend playing Pokemon all alone on the other side of the gym while everyone else was sitting where they were actually supposed to be. I only got Johnny to put away his cards by telling him that I play pokemon. And listing all the cool pokemon I have. I was telling him about the shiny Zygarde I obtained and it impressed him so much he actually didn't say anything rude to me. The only problem is I don't actually have that many cool pokemon. I'm running out of these to say. I could just lie to him but he can tell when someone is lying. He sniffs out fear like a blood hound and he attacks any weakness he sees. I need one of these codes or I fear he's going to stop listening to me. My head will soon explode if he stresses me out more. I have actually lost my voice from shouting literally shouting and having kids pretend not to hear me. It's 92 degrees outside and I've drank only hot tea my throat hurts so much. Please save me from my obituary saying ""Here lies Nova, he shouted so hard his head exploded.""  My throat hurts so bad. Johnny is also very popular. When I told him about my corn snake he told the other children and they all became impressed with me. I work as a substitute and only show up a few times a week. I only have a few chances to build up my cred. If you can make children think you are cool then they may listen a little better. Please for the sake of my health and job I need a code.

*this is dramatized. I actually don't care if kids think I'm cool or not. I have actually lost my voice tho my throat hurts so bad.

Agree. I figure it will happen within the next 6yrs.

She's 64. By 2024 she will be 70. Avg age of death with type 1 is 68. In January she had to have 911 respond because her blood sugar dropped low enough to cause permanent damage. In April, she again passed out and broke her shoulder - [badly](http://dailycaller.com/2018/04/19/justice-sotomayor-collapsed-supreme-court/) - had to have replacement therapy. That's usually want does type 1 people in - either they slip away in their sleep or they fall and the injury kills them. Plus she lives alone, so if something happened at night, no one would know for awhile. It's a shit way to go, I feel bad for her.

Don’t smoke weed at the peak of 2 tabs. 4. For the love of god don’t get destructive on acid, it’s all downhill from that point. 

Thanks for reading though bro, brought those memories back, though having to pull out your tooth twice a day to brush to brush the 31 surviving teeth is always the fattest reminder. I recommend that y’all don’t learn the hard way like I did.",1530403422

"ContemporaryArt","t5_2s6lg","You should definitely submit your work to open calls at local and non-local galleries before thinking about doing a solo show. It’s a good way to build connections and gain experience with the whole process. Even if you have all your work together already, having a solo show is EXTREMELY stressful and daunting. You want to have a supportive gallery staff and you want to go in knowing what to look for in a space, being confident in your prices, and having extra cash on hand to take care of any incidentals. 
There’s tons of websites where you can find calls for art from tons of different galleries hosting tons of differently themed shows. Enter as many as possible. You’re going to get a lot of rejections but you’ll also get some admissions. You can ship your work just about anywhere unless you’re doing ceramics or working in some other uber-fragile medium, but even then you can still ship with care. 
Get some group shows under your belt, make some sales, tweak your pricing if necessary, build a clientele and make some connections with gallery managers who like your work and want to give you advice/support. 
This job is all about connections and who you know. Your first solo show will be WAY more successful if you’re not going into it completely green. Plus, galleries will be more willing to work with an artist who has some actual experience.

"WormFanfic","t5_33pt9","\&gt; How do I flesh out my stories without taking away from the core plot?

Add sub-plots, details, red herrings, ""fluff"" character interactions that help the characters understand each other (and the audience understand the characters) better. For more specifics, I recommend r/cauldron , a subreddit for worm fanfic authors. Has useful resources, like canon timeline information and Word of God quote repositories.

For details: I usually have difficulty writing body language and non-visual, non-audio details. So, I'd take my rough draft and re-read it, adding in notes where body language or non-visual cues would add to the scene. I don't know how you write, so I can't give more specific suggestions.

For sub-plots, keep it light. Usually, these revolve around otherwise supporting characters, and ""end"" up letting those characters develop, partially off-screen. Prank-wars, romance (or failure to romance), Mad Science!, and so-on. Of note: Mauling Snarks is basically made of sub-plots, and no primary plot.

Red Herrings can create dramatic tension (the audience expects one thing, and the protagonist, another). Usually this uses plot meta-knowledge to subvert the reader's expectations. An example: in Tyrant of the Bay, we get an interlude of a PRT agent dealing with a Master victim. The power superficially seems like Valefor of the Fallen... but it turns out to be a plot by Heartbreaker.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","THIS IS LONG, BUT HOPEFULLY HELPFUL. 

All big life changes cause stress on marriages. This is what no one tells you. Moves, children, deaths, illness. They put the marriage to the test. You expect your partner to rise to the occasion and when they don't, we're disappointed. I feel you. I got very sick and I expected my husband to become my bedside nurse. Instead, he pretended I wasn't sick for a year. If I could have walked out, I would have. But now, it's FINALLY dawned on him that I need help. We're in therapy and I'm realizing some people are just frickin' slow ass learners, can't deal with the stress, or have their own stupid ways of dealing with things. Not my way. If my husband was sick, I'm jump into action. I bet you would too. You know why? Women are built that way. Men, not so much. They want to fix everything and when they can't, they feel impotent and crumble. 

One of the things we women do is take on ALL the burden, expect our partners to see us in action and jump right in and help. I mean, come on...how hard is it to wash the dishes? Except, guess what? This perfect man who cooks and cleans and changes diapers without being asked? Doesn't exist. Women are efficient, hard working machines. We can multi-task and get it all done. You currently don't like him because he's not the man you expected him to be. No man is. I guarantee. 

So what's the option? Leave him? Do you really want to? Honestly, strangers on Reddit can't decide for you. You have to decide if it's worth it. Me and my husband got into couple's therapy. At first I was resentful...why can't I have a relationship that doesn't require couple's therapy? Because no one can. Marriages and relationships go through phases. Shitty ones, good ones, amazing ones. There have been plenty of times when I feel that I don't like my husband. But I also love him and I want to work it out. I bet he has the same feelings too. Raising kids is really, really, hard. It takes a toll on your love life and on your sanity. 

You're probably like most wives that do everything, hold it in, and then explode. Communication (and often) is the key to every marriage. He needs to know specifically (spell it out) what he can do to make it better. For some reason, they don't know that washing the dishes makes it all better. I swear. I don't know why. They need to be told what to do. Now, if this sounds condescending, it's not. Men are great when they know what's expected of them and they fill the role of big strong provider. Before you walk away, take all this into consideration. Perhaps seek therapy. He might need to hear how you're hurting from a trained professional. My husband hears it from the therapist, things I've been saying FOR YEARS and then goes and does it. Whatever works. 

There's also his side. What's stressing him out? WHY doesn't he want to participate? If after counseling you still don't like him...move on. You loved him once and all relationships have their ups and downs. Sometimes the downs feel like the end, but when people say relationships take work, this is what they're talking about. And this isn't the last of it. You two will go through lots more. How you handle it defines how long you'll last. He's not disposable tissue. He's a husband and a father. ",1530403433

And speaking Spanish or Nahuatl or whatever, not even proper Murican.

Meaning she doesn't feel remorse or guilt for betraying you...

She isn't trustworthy. Your wife isn't trustworthy.

There's nothing you can do to fix that, unfortunately, because any promise she makes, will more than likely just be another lie, another attempt to deceive you. Her last attempt worked, will her next?

If you have a vet that takes exotics you could also call them. They might charge or they might not.  I'm sorry I cant be more help.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","“Abolish ICE” isn’t the totality of what Democrats are calling for, but seems to be what most commenters think in this thread.

The movement centers around the transformation of immigration law enforcement into an almost singular focus on deportations. INS was not like this. In fact, INS couldn’t even do home raids. ICE is an amalgamation of many different law enforcement programs, all centered around how to prevent another 9-11, but it has become a deportation force that’s not even really about national security. Deporting undocumented immigrants has taken priority over drug cartels, money laundering, gangs, and a host of other things that ICE was originally created to address. ICE isn’t putting much into investigating criminal organizations, developing sources and intel, or working with other departments to come up with real solutions to much bigger national security problems. It’s all just arresting people in their homes and deporting them.

That’s what the “abolish ICE” movement is criticizing. When they’re calling to abolish the agency, they’re calling to de-prioritize deportation as the single-most important enforcement action of our border protection, customs, and immigration law system.",1530403441

You want everything to play out the Behringer.
Look to ""exclusive mode"" is in the settings for the device.
You can disable this and try it, as you may have another device locking your audio device off and preventing chrome from accessing it.
If the problem is happening where you have the Behringer as default and the only app open is chrome then I would look to ASIO
Question does ASIO open when you run chrome ?
You could try ASIO4ALL( its free) it may give you more options than the inbuilt ASIO in the  Behringer. 
or also JackAudio(from Linux but for Windows) but this is normally to  interconnect also can use Jack &amp; ASIO giving people more options.

&gt; Kingston Wall was a psychedelic/progressive rock group from Helsinki, Finland. They were formed in 1987. Influenced by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, the group combined eastern themes, mysticism and vivid psychedelia with their unique, hard-edged acid-rock.

&gt; Group members were Petri ""Pete"" Walli (guitar, vocals), Jukka Jylli (bass) and Sami Kuoppamäki (drums, percussion). 

&gt; During their existence, Kingston Wall released only three self-financed albums on their own label, Trinity. The albums were Kingston Wall (also known as I) in 1992, II in 1993 and Tri-Logy in  1994.

&gt; The group was disbanded by Petri Walli in December 1994. Walli went travelling to India and Norway. The definite end for Kingston Wall came on June 28th 1995 when Walli jumped to his death from a church tower in Helsinki.

&gt; After the band's demise, the three Kingston Wall albums have been re-issued as double CD's with bonus tracks by Zen Garden record label (Finland). In 2000, a remix album titled Freakout Remixes was released, which featured trance/techno remixes of Kingston Wall songs by Finnish electronica artists, and in autumn 2005 a 3-disc set titled Real Live Thing was released, which featured live bootlegs from various live shows, available now for the first time ever.

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","Judging by your last couple of replies, I'm a bit dubious of your actual desire to talk about this with any nuance or depth, it feels like you want me to lay down a one sentence answer of what Peterson's 'God' is so you can prove it wrong and pwn me.

But, saying that, I am going to take you on good faith and give an honest answer. But the answer is complicated and so could really easily have parts of it cherry picked out of context and scoffed at, but I don't think that would be fair. So lets see what happens.The answer is that its really complicated. And Peterson doesn't like to define God, *because* it's very complicated. But I have a feeling that its something like this:

If you read my other comment, I outlined religion as an evolved consequence of memetic/genetic co-evolution. Certain memes were selected for because they were beneficial to man passing on his genetic material. Take an idea like 'sacrifice'; the idea that you could forgo something now in order to have something better later. This is a meme that can be transmitted socially through culture and symbol and ritual, but it's also something that when taken on board actually helps you survive and thrive. Monkeys who got into the idea of sacrifice might have saved food for later, and thus had an evolutionary edge over monkeys who didn't. We, the builders of society, are the children of *those* monkeys.

Now this is where it gets complex. Lets say that those memes that work, those ideas, correspond to *something in the universe*. They work as rules because the universe *is such a place* where rules like that work - so that means that the universe has *some quality* that makes that rule work, or means that those rules work.

Lets say I’m playing a game. I draw something on a piece of paper, and pass it through a curtain. Often, nothing happens. But sometimes, when the shape I draw has particular qualities, a coin gets thrown back through the curtain. Like the game 'mastermind', I realise that the reward has something to do with the shapes I draw on the paper. Some shapes tend to give a positive result and return me a coin, others are a waste of time. I sit there trying different shapes, working out what the rule is.You could say that even though I can't see what is behind the curtain directly, I am using what limited interaction I can have with it to work out the rules it is imposing on me.

Imagine that what is behind this curtain is *completely unknowable in any direct sense*. It is beyond our comprehension as human beings – like trying to explain cosmology to a dog – we lack the capacity, the language, the ability to even begin thinking about it, and no amount of schooling or revelation can do it. It is simply not of our world. And I don't mean this is some supernatural quality. I mean that it is unknowable in the same sense that the true essence of *anything* is unknowable. You can't experience your fridge as it *really is in itself*, you don't experience it as atoms or electrons or quarks or vibrations, but rather through the prism of human senses. In the same way, the actual thing *causing* the rule, the element of the universe which *makes* your action beneficial rather than detrimental, is unknowable. We can only know it by how we can interact with it.

But we can ACT, by passing paper to it. And it REACTS by rewarding us, or punishing us, or being indifferent. By doing this, we can try to work out the RULES.

Now lets look at an example

We have worked out that one of the rules of the universe as humans perceive it is that sacrifice is generally beneficial. That is, if we can give something up now in order to have something better later, then generally things will work out better if we do that. I’m not asking you to imagine this is some rule about society, I’m saying THE UNIVERSE – that it is true for human beings everywhere, at all times, that it is linked somehow perhaps to the idea of entropy and the fact that things are in a sense of continual decay and so to consciously sacrifice X now in order to have 2X later is generally better. Or somehow linked to the fact that we experience time in a linear fashion, and thus its somehow a safer bet to save for the unknowable future. Something like that. But as I have alluded to, we can’t know *exactly* what it is *as a thing in itself*, because its behind this curtain. But we can see that the general rule is that sacrifice tends to work out well.

Now

You’re an early man. You notice that some patterns of behaviour seem to work out better than others, in the long term. In other words – you do certain things, and the universe pays out. Other things you do and things tend to go badly. You notice that people who sacrifice tend to do better than those who are impulsive. How might you conceptualise this?

You might say that it is AS IF there is someone judging these actions. Its like you are being watched over by a father, and he judges some actions as good and others as bad. There seems to be an arbitrary element too, for sometimes people work really hard and get nowhere, whereas others do nothing and succeed. He seems to work in mysterious ways. But, generally, you seem to be able to give yourself what gamblers call ‘an edge’ in this casino of life by following certain guidelines, one of which is sacrifice.

Are these savages IN ERROR to talk about the father figure?

How else would they conceptualise it? What else could they draw from?

I argue that they are not making a proposition. So its not a matter of right or wrong. They are acting expressively.

It’s not just sacrifice – there are lots of ‘rules’. That is, there are lots of patterns of behaviour that man has realised are generally beneficial in the long run for him. **Whatever this complete set of rules is, whatever shape this takes, whatever is hidden behind this curtain -**

**This is the logos.**

*The logos* is that which transcends all possible games (hierarchies) throughout time. It is the thread that runs through everything. We seem to be able to roughly recognise a basic set of rules that we seem to be able to follow at any time, at any level of analysis, at any level of application, and gain an edge over just acting in pure impulse. The logos is that from which these rules are being derived. The directly-unknowable thing that we are groping at in the dark, and able to rough out very very slightly.

The symbolic conceptualisation of the logos, is what 'God' is. Or at least that's one of the things God is, and the best I can do in a reddit comment.

Peterson, then, believes that both he with his lofty philosophical conceptualisations of God, and the fundamentalist idiot who believes God is a man with a beard in the sky, are essentially talking about the same thing, since the man in the sky is just the abstracted symbolic representation of that same logos he is talking about. So there is no equivocation, although that is what I anticipate you will come back with. And he also seems to claim that there are very few 'true' atheists, since almost everyone acts as if the logos exists and is important.

That's the short answer.",1530403444

Furthermore, you realise that immigration, legal or otherwise isnt a racial issue? When you say 'white europeans'' are under attack are you purposely disregarding non-white european citizens?

Also not all immigrants are non white, would you say that that britain is under attack from polish immigration? Or how about australia from greek and italian immigration?

Lauren has been called a racist for a bunch of different things, including openly associating with and promoting generation identity that mourns the death of nazi officers. Criticism of her stance on immigration does not exist in a vaccum.

I'm not dismissing the media, I dismissed the left-wing media. And the reason I dismiss them for the exact reason YOU stated - they would prefer that their side wins. 

And history has not shown us that abandoning the media is always dangerous. That sounds like something that sort of sounds profound, but when you actually look at it, it's absurd. 

The fact is, in many cases, abandoning the media has led to freedom. It would amazing if somehow the North Korean people could abandon their media. South Africa as well. Hell, that would be great for the UK right now. 

Once media becomes a tool of propaganda and control, it SHOULD be abandoned. ",1530403455

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","The Silicate Planet is rich in Silicone, silicone carbide, silane, oxygen, and sulfuric acid. The ground has a thin layer of crystal clear quartz above smooth black silicon carbide with rainbow iredescence. Surprisingly, there is an abundance of life, but it is nothing like the life on Earth. You see, the life on this planet is silicone based, not carbon based.  
 
The life there is bizzar, much different than anything from Earth. There is plenty of quartz bugs, metallic moss, crawling animals and flying animals. Plenty of strange plant life. But the most interesting life is unlike a plant or an animal.
  
The terrain is extreme and jagged, the mountains are constantly changing and nearly indestructible. Some think that the extreme terrain is due to plate techtonics, but they are mistaken. The mountains are living. The very ground is living and growing, and it covers nearly the entire planet. The living mountains are made of organic silicone carbide (OSC), the strongest super material known to man.
 
The dominant species, the Silicates, are highly intelligent. They have advanced technology, and access to the Galaxy's only supply of organic silicone carbide, and they don't like sharing.",1530403456

This is what I was getting at when I was saying that the current system is super broken - for *many* people the path with highest probability of success for becoming a legal resident of the US is to enter illegally and then make an asylum claim.

I don't dispute that this is broken at all, what I think I (and many others) are objecting to is the manner in which the current administration is attempting to close this path to immigration.

However let's set aside immigration for a second. Imagine you are incredibly poor and your family is on the brink of starvation, so you steal a loaf of bread for which you are arrested. In the US today, your appointed attorney would instruct you to plead guilty and ask for minimal sentencing given the circumstances. You'd be heard by a jury, a court, and prosecutors to evaluate whether or not you have a valid defense, whether you are a threat to others, and what should happen to you.

Now consider if you stole that loaf of bread, police immediately threw you in jail without a bail hearing, threw your children into a detention center, and threatened you that if you didn't immediately plead guilty *before having a court hearing*, you'd never see your kids again.

The problems here are that (1) your 8th amendment rights protecting you and your children from cruel and unusual punishment are being violated (2) your 5th amendment rights to due process are being violated (3) obvious human rights violations to your children.",1530403457

My partner and I help out this homeless guy called 'Phil'. Phil has been in the process of trying to get a temporary place for a while, but has been faced with a lot of red tape due to the extremely specific housing laws that they have for homeless people. There were temporary housing options, but you had to wait all day for a bed and therefore couldn't leave to look for work. Unfortunately, this is the reality for a lot of homeless people- they want the help of organizations, but face a bunch of legal difficulties in getting it. 

Yes, we can and should advocate to change these laws, but that is solution that doesn't fix the immediate problems for a lot of homeless people. Phil had an infection last year and needed antibiotics. We helped him out with the money needed for the antibiotics. Sometimes we give him money for bus fare so he can go to one of the shelters when it gets cold out. I realize this money doesn't fix his long term problems, but sometimes better solutions just aren't accessible and money can help solve his immediate needs. ",1530403458

"Blackfellas","t5_2xfe1","All these tips are good. Here are some more that you won't usually see:

- Marry a career woman, with earnings similar or greater than your own.
- When you have kids, do not have either parent decide to quit working to stay with the kids.
- Live near the grandparents, who are retired of course, and willing to provide free daycare.
- Once the need for free daycare is finished, the grandparents should start giving you tens of thousands of dollars each year, or they should die and will you a few hundred thousand dollars.
- Public school. Because you live in a town with great schools, of course.
- Buy a house in a town that has rapidly increasing real estate values.
- Get the most expensive house you can afford, as the real estate appreciation will be larger.
- Never get laid off.
- Never get sick. Nothing drains a bank account faster than cancer.
- No divorce, unless you plan to remarry someone wealthy.

My mom would act a lot like that, though. 

Obviously what you do is up to you and you did the right thing by blocking her and calling her out. Gaslighting like she did in your linked post is abusive behavior. 

Everyone always acts like going completely no contact with a parent is an extreme measure, but if you think about it, it really isn't. If your SO were treating you like that, you'd break up. If your friend were treating you like that, you'd leave. Parents don't deserve a place in your life of they can't respect you as an adult. And I can say personally that ending my relationship with my mom was the best thing I've ever done. 

It's tough and no one wants to think about doing it but I think you should think about it. Keeping that kind of stress around in your life isn't going to do you any good. I think you should consider what kind of relationship you'd like to have with your mom, evaluate whether or not your ideal is feasible, and if it isn't then consider severely limiting or completely ending contact.

A good example is the picture of that little girl crying that was on cover of Time magazine.

Her husband works an ""ok"" job apparently and she wasn't happy with her situation with him. She doesn't deserve asylum...but somehow her child was made the posterchild of this whole situation.

If anything, it’s usually shy guys who never have a girlfriend, not extroverted men. Shy guys are usually too awkward or most likely it’s that they don’t have enough confidence to feel as if they deserve a girlfriend, so the shy men I often see or meet are almost always single, unlike the extroverted men I meet.

I don’t get intimate with anyone for several months. I’d never hook up before around 10 high quality dates. And when it gets to date 10 with a shy man (which it basically never does), we aren’t to the point where we would be hooking up yet bc most likely he hasn’t even kissed me.

SO screw the names of Zintan, Sirte, and Misrata and replace them with Al Nasr (Victory) Al Raad (Thunder) Al Salb (Steel). Plus each militia member ought to be split up from their faction in serving this new military force, so a group of Zawiya fighters will join a brigade in Misrata along with other Libyans from Adjdabiya and etc while you would have Misrati fighters in Benghazi, Tripoli, Ghat etc. These new fighters will also need better wages and training let alone the establishment needs to be super meritocratic and transparent, the commanders will also be held accountable for their respective divisions.

"PvZHeroes","t5_3d3mh","I have tried it, and like I said, it'd be outclassed by defensive end even if it costed 6. Decks that can't hard remove aren't going to give you a high enough health total to even play it, let alone play it with it getting decent stats, and won't be able to remove stuff like defensive end anyway along with it actually disrupting their plays. Decks that can hard remove it will maybe let you get a good health total on it... that they subsequently don't care about because nothing over 6 health is going to die from damage anyway, and defensive end remains better due to the trick disruption, even disregarding the fact that it also costs less.

Cryo yeti costs 5, which is low enough that being a ball of stats and not much more isn't disastrous, and, more importantly, it actually does something when it's played, which allows it to impact the board even when hard removed. It also has actual potential to become a better card if zombies get more freeze synergy, while wannabe is just liable to get even worse as other high drops that actually have abilities are made.",1530403462

But thats not valid in most cases, most people dont know shit about 4/5 tridolon caps a night, hell i've even encountered a player with 150 harry caps that didnt know how to do 4 cap properly. 

Same goes for old Raids, you either want people who ran Raids a lot, or you want to do a teaching raid. Sometimes i just want to do it fast and clean, and sometimes i just feel like teaching. And i do the same for eidolons now, since raids are removed. 

While we had old Void, people also wanted players with high MR when running 2-3 hour long surv/def runs. You dont want players who dont know what they are doing in such a hard run, you want people who know their shit. People who have more experience, and more frames/mods/weapons which know how those runs are done.

Explain controlling the means of production means controlling supply, controlling who works where, and who gets what, and they stare at you because they think you're completely nuts.  They fail to make the connections between a socialist system and the same problems they see with their rapid dislike for police, crony capitalism and those who get into power they don't like.

"Ask_Lawyers","t5_3m13w","This is an extremely loaded question, so maybe someone with a lot more experience in this field can chime in. My understanding of this is extremely elementary, but hopefully it will satisfy your curiosity until you get a detailed answer from someone who works in criminal defense/prosecution.  

A lot of times when police officers commit a crime, there’s a bunch of administrative processes that happens. They’ll likely put on administrative leave, and an investigation will be carried out by the police department or some other agency. At that point, the jurisdiction that the police officer reports to will decide whether to bring charges against the officer. If no charges are brought, then the officer will never see a courtroom for their actions. If charges are brought against the officer, then we get to the jury selection and the court hearing. 

In America, the idea is that you’re judged by a “jury of your peers.” The process starts with the courthouse sending jury summons to a randomly selected group of candidates who live in the jurisdiction (usually the county). These people are separated by groups randomly and sent to different courtrooms to begin the jury selection process (voir dire). 

During this process, the attorneys from both side will ask qualifying questions to see if the juror can remain impartial during trial. Each side will have a certain amount of attempts to strike a juror (eliminate them for bias or for whatever reason). This depends on the jurisdiction and the number of available strikes varies. The attorneys from both sides will obviously try to select people who they think will side with their client, so it’s definitely feasible to think that the attorneys are selecting people with the “proper attitude.” 

Also, we practice a system of “innocent until proven guilty.” Whether this works in practice is something that has been greatly debated, so this might account for a lot of the non guilty pleas that you see on the news. Our judicial system would rather set a criminal free than put an innocent person behind bars, but it’s not a perfect system. 

In your example of officers getting off even though there is hard evidence of them killing someone can often be attributed to self-defense. In most (if not all) states in America allow for the use of deadly self-defense if you truly believe that your life is in danger. More times than not, these officers will often claim that they feared for their lives and truly believed that it was necessary to shoot their gun to save their own lives. Again, this is something that would be shown to the jurors and they are the ones to make the determination on whether such deadly force was necessary.",1530403463

Taking the cost of parts out of someone's paycheck is rarely if ever done except for missing company property such as tools and measuring equipment.

The machinist would have another job weeks or months before they can replace him.  The laws of supply and demand apply to people as well.  That machinist could very well get a higher hourly rate at the new job.  I have a skilled trade background and was laid off once.  I had a new job earning more money in less than six weeks and the only reason it took that long was because it was over the Christmas holiday.

A good machinist would have to cause a fire or actually have the bad parts shipped before he jepordized his job due to one incident.

A precision machine shop isn't Mc Donald's or Walmart.  A few thousand dollars worth of material is nowhere near as bad as it would look to someone not familiar with such things.

And yes he did know that he would get away with it because they needed his skills.  He was obviously correct.

**Week 13 rankings and comments:**

Rank|Anime|Change|# Eps|Comments|Final Score
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1|Darling in the Franxx|-|23|Either this episode was paced really fast, or they can just travel really fast. Either way, the space battle was pretty impressive to look at and I liked the Nines' sacrifices to protect the rest of Squad 13. I also really like the scenes where the storybook was animated with Hiro and Zero Two as the characters. Though I was definitely caught off guard when Strelizia transformed into Zero Two. It was also nice to see Mitsuru and Kokoro have their talk and make up and the brief moment between Nana and Hachi, but that too also seemed fast. I bet next episode will be the battle for the first half with an ambiguous ending and then a timeskip to end it - hopefully a happy one!|**-**
2|Food Wars: The Third Plate Part 2|+1|12 (FINAL)|Really liked this ending. As usual, Soma pulls through with his talent and creativity and the rebels end up sweeping the Elite 10 in round 1 of the RdC. I also really liked Erina complimenting Soma at the end (even if he wasn't there to hear it...) and her reaction. I really hope Season 4 gets announced sooner than later! Ending in the middle of the RdC is major blue balls, but from what I understand it only just ended in the manga and would probably only take 12-13 episodes to animate, so I could see them taking a year to buffer.|**10**
3|My Hero Academia Season 3|-1|13|This was a pretty fun episode through and through with the ""room king"" competitions. Not too much to say aside from me liking it overall! Though I did think at first that Tsuyu was avoiding having her room looked at because she was potentially the traitor, which would be a huge blow. I was glad to see it was something else and that everyone made up. No episode next week, but looking forwards to hearing the new OP and ED!|**9.5** (cour 1)
4|Tada Never Falls In Love|-|13 (FINAL)|Happy end, yay! Although it did seem incredibly rushed. The first 3/4 were good and really seemed like it would be bittersweet, and the last 1/4, while giving me the ending I wanted, seemed like it was tacked on at the last second. I also would have liked to see what became of some other ships, especially Pin-Senpai x Hinako (my favorite one of the show). There also seemed to be some mutual blushing between Yamashita and Yui, so... Either way I still really enjoyed the show, the characters were great and the animation was also really good. This was my favorite ""new"" anime of the season.|**8**
5|Love is Hard for Otaku|-|11|-|**8**
6|Sword Art Online: AGGO|-|12 (FINAL)|The fight between LLENN and Pito was great (both music, animation and direction), and I was caught very off guard with LLENN cutting her hands off and biting Pito to kill her. And I thought it was hilarious when the team who had been hiding out swooped in out of nowhere to kill LLENN and Fuka to take the win... reminded me of quite a few games of Fortnite that I've played. And then the two online friends finally met in real life, which was nice to see and also exactly who I expected it to be. All in all, this was a really fun series and I'd love a season 2, especially if we could get a team of LLENN, Pito, M, and Fuka all together for SJ3.|**7.5**
7|Hisone and Maso-tan|-|12 (FINAL)|Solid conclusion to a series that, while initially disappointing me, won me over by the halfway point and then consistently stayed there. I was glad that we got a happy end, though I would've liked to see Hisone reunite with everyone. I wouldn't have minded an epilogue episode either, but as it is the ending is already solid.|**7.5**
8|Golden Kamuy|+1|12 (FINAL)|The psychic stuff seemed creepy at first but ending up being pretty funny with all the horse betting. I don't remember if it was stated, but I'd be shocked if she wasn't a prisoner as well, especially considering she seemed to know Asirpa's dad. The end with Ogata seemingly joining the samurai seems like that'd be a power combo too. And wooo, season 2 announced for this fall! Definitely looking forwards to it.|**7.5**
9|Comic Girls|-1|12|-|**7**
10|Tokyo Ghoul:re|-|12|-|**7**
11|Hinamatsuri|-|12|-|**6.5**
12|Caligula|-|12 (FINAL)|Mu out of control at the beginning was pretty cool, but everyone suddenly being whisked away felt a bit sudden. That being said, I was glad Ritsu was able to stop her and everyone was able to return to reality and try to become better people there thanks to what they learned in Mobius. The last few minutes were pretty satisfying/wholesome. This series overall was alright - the animation and soundtrack were great, and the pacing was generally good, but I felt like the story was still a bit all over the place, which is too bad because the concept is cool. Probably could've benefitted from a longer runtime.|**6.5**

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","I think you must overthink first. What are the reasons you feel depressed. What are you missing that is making you feel miserable. What are your thoughts on the moment you feel miserable or what makes you cry. 

There are some starting points in turning the tides. 

First of all accept that what you think you are experiencing as truth is simply not true. As plain as some things look they are different. 

There are some guided mediations on spotify from Sadhguru, one is called the power of succes. With some breathing excersice he will guide you to a level where you are imprinting the thing you really want to achieve. Ofcourse here you are not wishing to not be depressed anymore but focus on the thing you mis in life. The things you want but didn't yet accomplish the things that make your life feel incomplete and depressed.

When you are doing this exercise you will truly see changes in your daily life because someway the body is acting to the positive wishes you imprinted in your subconscious. 

At the same time, try to live healthy. Maybe go jogging. Its releasing endorfin into the brains which makes you happy. Eat less meat and dont watch or listen to negative influences like the daily news. Do this for some time to prepare your body for silence mefitation but be sure. When silencing the mind your subconcsious will come up and meddle. Try to be positive about anything and wake up beeing blissfull even if you didn't dealt the best hand. 

Depression is a hard fact and i wish youand everyone good luck. If you have any questions please feel free to ask at anytime.

The veterans did not have histories of diabetes. The researchers linked that patient data with the EPA’s land-based air monitoring systems as well as space-borne satellites operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). They used several statistical models and tested the validity against controls such as ambient air sodium concentrations, which have no link to diabetes, and lower limb fractures, which have no link to outdoor air pollution, as well as the risk of developing diabetes, which exhibited a strong link to air pollution.

I've had a batch of older game masters for a while now, but I never had a reason to decode them. (now I do)

I can now double check and correct my error with the files from 14-Feb-17 -&gt; 18-Feb-18

This other being is locked in a perpetual war with yet another being who is named Lyria, and both are trying to get more powerful by amassing souls. The sun itself doesn’t really have any power- stars are essentially giant, ownerless souls which attract other souls to them. Lyria’s whole plan is to use the stars to amass as many souls as possible which it can then take for itself, while the other, currently unnamed being is using agents such as the Sable King to hijack Lyria’s plan, taking those souls for itself. 

When the Sable King arrived on the planet Miren, it crashed in the northern region of the continent of Kalain. The area where it landed flooded and became a huge in-land sea called the Loridian Sea. The Sable King is able to harvest the souls of those who die in the countries surrounding the Loridian Sea.",1530403477

I still don't understand how to parse it as ""I will protect"". Is it 𓐍𓂤[𓁐] with 𓇋𓇋 added erroneously for the 1cs suffix pronoun?^1

The 𓅭/𓅭𓏏 confusion could possibly be explained by the loss of the final t in pronunciation, except it's written in the previous instance, so that's not very satisfying. I guess it could be ""I will protect the son of the great royal wife"" i.e. Ramses, son of Tuya, but that doesn't seem to fit nicely either.

1.	I’ve now convinced myself that this is correct. The verb ends in a vowel and the suffix pronoun forms a glide. Like -aya in Akkadian. ",1530403477

There's just something about the turns of phrase, ""your little helper"" and such, that has people like this use. In my case it filled with me with a white hot rage, and I proceeded to hatefuck them (legally) with a great and terrible fury. 

People like that are used to having people back down immediately when they get Shithouse Rat style responses. They don't actually have legs to stand on, but they're used to people thinking they do. In my case my initial contact with them also included legal deadlines and government guidelines, and the response was also atomic.

When I come in and the manager was covering the desk with my new supervisor and they could not do an online order return so they told the customer to leave the product so that I could process it when I got in... just stuff like this goes on nearly every day and I don't even bother paging for backup because nobody else in the store knows how to do a simple return so nobody comes. The company should really give incentives to associates for getting a PK or learning other departtments. I mean out of 5 key carriers 3 ASMs and 1 SM maybe 3 of them can process a return or check a customer out? 


I asked the store manager what it takes to become an ASM and he said ""I would look for somebody who knows how to do everything in the store."" So that's what I did, aside from placing complex millworks orders, metal roofing, and some receiving things I can do everything. If you have an issue with an order I solve it, if management runs into a customer care issue they bring it to me first, if somebody needs to cover specialty because there is nobody in the store I do it. Working the on hand and 30 day reports, being inventory captain, etc. I have done as much as I could have to get promoted and have asked multiple times to have a chance in another department but still I get told I am too valuable at the desk they just can not afford to move me. Well that mentality has caused them to lose me, the store manager even asked if he could match the offer to try and get me to stay and I didn't even give him the chance.

My goodness you are seemingly one so easily offended snowflake if you honestly think men think too highly of themselves and want more than they offer generally blaming rejection on women is worse than red pill nonsense. Bye dude.

I have nothing to be bitter about. There is no personal bitterness in stating my opinions on observed male behavior and reported male behavior from credible studies and surveys.

It's proven by studies men overrate their attractiveness. Study https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-sports-mind/201507/when-men-arent-good-looking-they-think After study after study. Heck men even overrate women's attraction to them https://www.ozy.com/acumen/the-scientific-reason-men-think-youre-into-them-when-youre-not/76373  Perilloux explains that men could be projecting their own sexual interest, reasoning, “I’m interested in her, so she might be interested in me.”

It's proven by studies men tend to shift blame. You can see it in society ala niceguy mindsets and incel mindsets.

It's proven by studies men tend to seek partners far better looking than themselves. You can see it in society with how most male dating advice by men and for men is how to get a hot girl.

You don't see shit that bad on the red pill. Seems you're quite delusional when the redpill is all about how AWALT with shit ton of downright heinous negative shit- golddiggers, whores, cock carousel, hitting the wall.

Your second point is about enforced monogamy and how we already do that, it’s just called something else. I’m not really sure what you’re getting at. I wonder if we’d have a more violent society without monogamy. It seems like he’s calling for the preservation of monogamy. It just doesn’t seem like a despicable idea to me. Idk.

STEPHEN MCFEELY: ""I may be speaking out of turn, but I think Thanos could kick the Hulk's ass without the stone.""

[https://movieweb.com/infinity-war-writers-thanos-beat-hulk/](https://movieweb.com/infinity-war-writers-thanos-beat-hulk/)

CHRISTOPHER MARKUS: "" Even without the gauntlet, this is a guy who has gone unopposed through the galaxy, slaughtering half of every planet he lands on. He’s got an army, but he’s about the best you’re ever going to come up against, physically and mentally. ""

[http://collider.com/infinity-war-interview-christopher-markus-stephen-mcfeely/#avengers-4](http://collider.com/infinity-war-interview-christopher-markus-stephen-mcfeely/#avengers-4)

B) Powerful enough to defeat Dr Strange, Iron Man and the Guardians without the Stones:

STEPHEN MCFEELY: ""He's unbelievably powerful without the stones. I think they would have been very disappointed when they got the glove off of him and he still beating the stuffing out of them.""

Disney Food Blog has a [site](http://www.disneyfoodblog.com/) and a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnpWedLQdHpZqhgTLdB9Yyg/featured) that both have TONS of info that can help you figure out what your MUST-EATS are.

For example, our last trip was in 2014 and we ate so much good stuff but since then, I have done a ton more reading online about the different food offerings AND a bunch of the menus have changed. For our trip coming up this December and my ""MUST-EATS"" consist of the following:

* Tangerine Cafe (Epcot - Morocco Pavilion) - I didn't know this place existed on my last trip but I read some rave reviews on a few different Disney sites and we LOVE Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, so we're going to try it out this time around.
* Les Halles Boulangerie &amp; Patisserie (Epcot - France Pavilion) - I just can't resist French pastries, so we always stop here for a sweet snack. 
* La Cava Del Tequila (Epcot - Mexico Pavilion) - The margaritas here are killer. It's our little tradition to start our trip around the World Showcase here. 
* Be Our Guest Dinner (Magic Kingdom - New Fantasyland) - Be Our Guest has been on my radar since it opened in 2012, but I haven't been able to snag a reservation until now (and the only reason I have one right now is because of the [Reservation Finder tool on TouringPlans.com](https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/reservation-finder)). We're eating dinner at 4:25 PM and I don't even care because I'm obsessed with Beauty and the Beast and I NEED to try The Grey Stuff. 
* Sleepy Hollow (Magic Kingdom - Liberty Square) - This is a snack stop that I have to make on every single trip because I absolutely adore the waffle sandwiches PLUS they've added a churro ice cream sandwich to the menu that my husband wants to try
* Aloha Isle (Magic Kingdom - Adventureland) - the Dole Whip Float is another snack that I can't leave Magic Kingdom without eating.
* Satu'li Canteen (Animal Kingdom - Pandora) - we haven't eaten here yet because Pandora just opened last summer, but again I've read a ton of rave reviews on the Disney blogs.
* Yak &amp; Yeti Local Food Cafes (Animal Kingdom - Asia) - on Disney Food Blog, they will not shut up about the Mini Mango Pie that you can get here so I'm planning on trying it for myself
* Morimoto Asia (Disney Springs) - This is another place that they won't shut up about on Disney Food Blog and I love Asian food, so I figured it will be worth a shot
* Amorette's Patisserie (Disney Springs) - As I already explained, I can't resist French pastries, but this place is new since my last visit so I'm dying to try it. ",1530403485

The goal should be to minimize the use of force and maximize the creation of wealth, along with ensuring that the wealth is not concentrated so highly at the top. I personally subscribe to Georgism as a method of achieving this. By taxing land we can achieve a better capitalist society that creates more wealth and divides it more evenly.",1530403489

Racially motivated murder has been a federal hate crime since 2009. The new bill criminalizes any other murders committed by a lynch mob, e.g. killing an intervening police officer. The sponsors have vastly overhyped their proposal.

There's no reason for the federal government to step in here barring some major failing by the states (as in the 1960s). Only the states have the police power, and we're well past the days when they failed to use it against lynch mobs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to be depressed, and the moment I realized I needed help was when I was seriously considering ending my life, thinking about how I could do it as soon as possible. Luckily my household didn't have a gun or a place to hang myself so all I could do was desperately try to find a reason to keep going, at least for a little while. I was luckily able to last long enough to see a therapist to help me through it, though I was still down even after I stopped seeing her. I never got suicidal again, but still struggled with self-loathing. It took time but now I've found ways to cope and no longer spend several hours a day thinking about how much I hate myself and wished I never existed.

I guess to pay it forward to anyone who went through what I went through; the thought that kept me alive was that, yes, things could get worse, but it's rare that you will feel as bad as you did in that moment where you wanted to end your life. It may take time, but you are strong and you can learn to overcome any challenge that comes your way. These feelings will pass, but you must be patient.

One of the major things I struggled with after the suicidal episode was dwelling on the past. Mainly those moments I regret and the ones that made me feel embarrassed for myself. Most people will say to think about your mistakes as a learning experience, but that didn't help me. What did help me was using different language in my internal monologue by separating my past self from my current self; separating who I was yesterday from who I am. It's all easier said than done and different things work for different people, but I hope that someone can learn from my experience.",1530403493

Scholar is a tank. He can tank practically forever, and with TLT giving him more card draw, he can keep those two Flesh to Iron's out indefinitely.

Parse' deck manipulation is top notch. She can do both the Environment and the villain deck with reliability, and has even great 'oh crap' cards to get passed cards like Jail Break or Devastating Aurora if you can't get past them otherwise (the discard this card to discard the about to be played card)

Hunted Naturalist is a damage dealing beast. Combined with boosts from Legacy and Parse and he can tear through any opponent. He also works really well as a secondary tank or a secondary environment control.

TLTach is the card draw engine for the team, as well as the nuker. Sure, TL variety takes longer to build up to a 3 hit barrage, but you have Scholar/Nat to tank as need be.

And legacy is all around goodness. Damage Buffs. Heals. Tanking. Even some light control.


Hunted Nat and Parse are kinda flexy. If you don't feel like you need that much damage you can take another DD (Knyfe is a good choice, or Ra) or someone a bit more team oriented (Argent Adept or CapCosmic perhaps) or someone tanky (Nightmist). Parse can replaced with any other controlle r- Visionary, Wraith in a pinch (and with Smoke-Bombs + Lead from the Front + Scholar you can set up a 0 damage situation from the villain, and IReyepiece can give you the warning against the oh crap cards like Aurora).



Truthfully told, if you build a team with a Tank (Scholar, Nightmist, Legacy, Naturalist in Rhino, abzero), a Deck Manipulator (Wraith, Parse, Visionary), some solid damage (Sentinels, naturalist in croc,  knyfe, ra, abzero, tempest, wraith...) Good card draw (TLTach is the best, but even regular tach is good, Dark Visionary, OmniX base power is psuedo card draw, ) and whatever else you want in that fifth slot, you'll be solid. Diversifying makes the game a lot easier. its harder when you end up with a low damage output team or a low control output team.",1530403495

We have some decent wealth on a middle-class income:  
1. Delayed gratification.   
2. Live below your means.    
3. Pay Yourself First - into a retirement account. 
4. Income goes up? Save more!  
5. Always look for deals. No reason to spend more than you need to.   
6. Keep looking for good deals.  
7. Buy used cars, never new. Keep as long as possible.  
8. Learn to fix things yourself around the house.  
9. Use your library for movies, books, music.  
10. Thrift stores.  
11.  Cook and eat at home.  
12.  Avoid precooked/processed foods.  
13. Buy a home if you can. For the long-term.  
14. Get a roommate.  

Just save more and live a simple life. Learn to live with what you have. Cheap or free hobbies will keep you busy. Ride a bike. Watch a movie at home. Work on your garden. Read a book. Go the park or beach. Spend time with the kids.",1530403499

"PrintedCircuitBoard","t5_2wl1s","The pitfall with bringing the flood fill over pads or combining pads is that pads will heat differently than single pads and can cause the small light weight parts to turn during soldering. 

Second issue is that soldering is partly controlled by how much copper and how much paste is used on the pad. If you don't define the amount of copper by the size and shape of the copper you don't get the same lever of control. Of course masks have an impact but the mask to copper alignment is not always ideal. For very fine pitches the board manufacture might even delete the between the pad sliver. Your copper between pads design can starve the pads of solder. For volume designs where yield is important I like to bring the connections out from the pads in a symmetric pattern. 

Issue three is inspection. If you allow between pad copper the solder filet will be different than a normal pad. In some case this starts to look like a solder bridge. Ideally you don't want to make the inspector or system's job any tougher. ",1530403502

"Blackops4","t5_2untl","The game is still on my buy list but the season pass is not unless I can get it on sale at a hefty discount (like $30 or less). I buy this game for the CoD multiplayer so I don't give a damn about zombies or battle royale. This season pass has even fewer multiplayer maps than previous entries so it has even less value to me.

Frankly, the multiplayer maps need to be free from here on out. Player retention is going to be CoD's biggest problem. A Black Ops  game is supposed to be a big deal and while I expect this game to sell better than WW2, I really think that this game's player base is going to get  mauled. CoD and the Black Ops brand are no longer enough. Red Dead 2 and Fallout 76 alone are going to steal away a lot of players when they come out. Those people getting distracted by all the other games out there won't drop any more money into Black Ops 4, if they return to it at all.

And you are right. The people that buy the pass for the multiplayer maps are going to tend to be the tryhards. That's kind of always been the case for the season pass but it's going to be especially true this time around.",1530403502

"hajimenoippo","t5_2tru3","Ya there is not a lot of way to support the series legally outside of Japan or France (and maybe a few other countries in Asia) since there is not that many places that licensed the series in another language.

The only thing that was licensed back in 2000 was the first season of the anime (Fighting Spirit) that was dubbed in English (episode 1 - 75) and the Championship road movie.   However due to poor sales at the time, there wasn't a lot of DVD's made for it where it is hard to find copies of some volumes of it with out paying a lot of money.  Even then the company that licensed went bankrupt/decided to get out of the anime selling business, so there is no chance of getting a reprint for it.

Beside the first season of the anime and movie, the only thing else that you can buy is the video games for it for ps/ps2/wii.  Even then it will probably be hard finding a copy for it.

Side note, if the series did get licensed in English, it is going to be an expensive series to buy with 121+ volumes in it.  Most manga volumes tend to cost $7 or 8.  So you are looking at spending over $850 for it.  At least in Japan, manga tends to be cheaper like $5 a volume, where it a little cheaper price of $605+.

I mean, theoretically yes but they are pushed out of the bomber with force X.

After a while the magnetism systems kick in. Like rockets &amp; mortars these days only arm after a distance XYZ and not directly after being fired.

The magnetic system uses the force Y.

So, to have the bombs „fly back“, the force Y first needs to stop / negate the significante force X and then slowly speed up (rebuild force X) the bomb in redirection to the bomber.

But the bombers in TLJ are carpet bombers designed to break up ships from above from a short distance.

The bomber would have to stand still for a long time and be still closer to the bomber than ""insert complex formula explaining the exact distance needed etc."" to the original target.

But we are talking about Star Wars and high-tech equipment so we can assume there is some kind of fail-safe system. The most obvious &amp; easiest would probably a simple computer inside checking distances &amp; radio IDs.

If friendly ID closer than unknown ID. Do not activate.

That’s all that is theoretically needed. Or it’s only directed into one direction. 

The magnetic systems then guide the bombs onto the targets. Even if it’s moving.",1530403504

1. Sticking everyone in suits as a cost-saving measure. BORING. More interesting garments can be acquired as cheaply as suits, go and raid a charity shop, do something abstract, there are ways of keeping costs down without just having people wear suits. If I wanted to look at people in suits I'd have a real job. 

2. Updating without solving the problems it creates. If the plot can be solved with modern technology, it doesn't work. Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy if they've got Snapchat. No way Antonio doesn't know where his ships are, he's able to track their exact location through GPS. Women can marry whoever they like, own property and have jobs, so no way Kate is going to be tamed. You can't just ditch swords for guns since they have completely different effects on a scene's power dynamic. I expect directors to get creative and solve these problems if they want to update Shakespeare, and I get furious when they don't.

If I had to wager a guess, I think the Isles are at 8x$8m per....Sharks at something absurd like 7x$13m per, and Leafs at 7x $10-12m per...say.

In said hypothetical, Brisson is leveraging the time he has available to entice the Leafs to up their offer as high as possible...to maximize his players contract.

"lyftdrivers","t5_30lxq","Before, you got paid a percentage of what the passenger paid for time and mileage. (Let's stick with your made up numbers)

Passenger pays 2.60 for booking fee (always has and always gone straight to lyft) plus the $6 so you get $4.80

Today: Passenger pays 2.60 for booking fee plus $10.00 in estimated time and mileage based on where they're going. But you have a flat payment rate of 1.60/mile and .20/minute so your pay is still only $4.80.

In the end, yes, it's the same amount in your pocket, but it's how it's calculated that makes all the difference. And now they're finally disclosing what the pax paid which is doing two things. 1) confusing people into thinking the booking fee is part of what they should be getting and should be figured into ""lyft's cut"" based on commission, and 2) showing people that yes, they really are as fucking shady as Uber these days. 

It's not that Lyft is taking more from us, it's that they're charging pax more based on estimates and pocketing the difference when they overestimate. 

And let's go one step further in this conversation. When you're looking at small fare rides, Lyft will ALWAYS make a significant amount more than you expect because of that booking fee. So that pax paid 8.60 and you got 4.80 of it - so it looks like they got more than the 20% they're supposed to ""take"". But if you do the same math with a high fare ride (let's say a 50 mile/1 hour ride in 25% PT with your numbers), the pax pays 146.35 (assuming straight time and miles, none of the estimate bullshit) and you earn 115.00, which is 78% of the total paid and much closer to the 80% you should be receiving. So long story short, you have to remove the 2.60 (or whatever the booking fee is in your market) before you calculate what your cut should have been. THAT'S what you used to be paid a commission on. That booking fee has never been a factor in driver pay.",1530403506

Warlocks of the Pact only get one extra attack at level 6. A Booming Blade at 5 is already ahead of the extra attack since you get your weapon damage + a D8 every time and potential 2d8 after.

Can show me where current Supreme Court rulings on section 7 and 15 suggest that you don't have a right to timely access to healthcare

Healthcare is not a positive right in Canada - it's not an explicit part of the charter, but the lack of healthcare is a negative right, because an absence of access to healthcare would deprive you of "" life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."".  Violating that right has been ruled unconstitutional both in chaoulli v. quebec (a section 7 case, but with a 3:3 tie federally) and Eldridge v. British Columbia on section 15.  

Court Rulings on section 15 have basically said - if the government imposes a barrier on your access to care (e.g. if you're deaf and they don't have interpreters) that is a violation of your rights.

So you don't have an explicit right to healthcare.  You have a right to not not have healthcare.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","The problem with liberals isn't that they are pro-choice.

The problem is that they are *not* willing to determine when human life begins, so they are really saying that without abortion restrictions ALL unborn babies aren't human.

There is some reason to believe this is resulting in the deaths of premie children. Current abortion law basically works on the premise that elective abortion is legal up to viability and after that point it is up to the discretion of the doctor to *agree* that the mother's life is in danger or baby will not have quality of life. Viability has been increasing over the years and now some babies are being born at 22 weeks and living relatively normal lives.

Abortion is rare past the first trimester so that's not what I'm getting at here, nor am I talking about children with obvious disabilities in utero. However, I think the fact we haven't decided when human life begins and when human rights begins means that doctors are probably being influenced by the idea that babies don't have the inherent right to live because they are only fetuses and not babies.

Doctors are less likely to resuscitate a baby at 22 weeks when a woman goes into preterm labor *even though* the child has the potential to live. Japan treats all babies at this stage as babies, not fetuses, and the survivability of these children is higher.

We need to overturn Roe v. Wade and subsequent rulings not to outlaw abortion, but to determine when humans have their constitutional rights and when they deserve life-saving medical care. The left does not want to have this discussion.",1530403512

The suffix -or, on the other hand, comes from Latin, and is used much more seldom, basically where Latin would do it. Just try building the words drivor, runnor or drinkor, and see for yourself. In fact, Wiktionary lists only a handful of terms that were derived using this suffix, such as actor, author and sculptor, and goes on to provide the following usage notes:

English generally appends this suffix where Latin would do it—to the root of a Latin-type perfect passive participle. For other words, English tends to use the suffix -er. Occasionally both are used (computer vs. computor).

Since Reddit is a play on words ""read it"" of English origin or would stand to reason that a Reddit platform user would called a Redditer.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Pain management really isn’t the issue here. It’s tempting to throw a blanket fire approach because of fear of opioids. Insurance will and does pay for alternates to opioids. This kind of attitude comes from the desire to save lives. Pain management patients have a considerably reduced likelyhood to develop addiction to the same substances that people are dying from on the street.

The reason for this is twofold. One, the drugs are prescribed in controlled amounts, two, the desire to alleviate pain out weighs the desire for intoxication. I have a severe degenerative disease of the spine. Every second of every day for the past 7 years have been full of pain for me. My spine is fusing into a solid block of bone and cartilage and I struggle to get any opioid pain medication. My medication has been cancelled without warning, I cannot travel with it, and I am drug tested like a criminal. This is the side effect of opioid crisis. We’re the accepted casualties of the public’s war on opioids.

I want to be able to walk more than 5 minutes at a time so I can be a son, a brother, and a partner. I want a life. I’m not alone, there’s millions of people quietly suffering. Many patients kill themselves and are currently in the process of doing so. Patients with terminal cancer are denied morphine because we’re scared of this monster we’ve created. 
Pain management isn’t to blame for this and neither are the people who suffer. People are scared and when humans want to protect those they love they unknowingly doom others to suffer.

It’s not your fault, fear will always be persuasive. I just hope that an individual might read my comment and feel something for strangers who are barely gripping on to life and just want a chance at some happiness.",1530403516

Other than that, it's always good to get at least 245 stamina on every style since stamina plays a huge role in every fight. And for damage I would recommend adding more points into strength if you have a slower heavy hitting deck or more into dexterity if it's a fast hitting one.

How do I know it isn't because of violence? Because as a white person in Duplin County everyone thinks you think less of black people.

1- Husband and I taught him to ring a bell on a string when he wanted to go outside. He learned it after maybe 2 times showing him, but we made sure to be really consistent in responding when he rang it. 
One time I came home from work with a migraine and was laying in the couch. He was hungry and it was normal feeding time but I was not easy, so I kept shooing him away. Finally he rang the bell, so I got myself up and walked to the back door, but ran into the kitchen. He knew I'd get up and got fed when he wanted. 

Before I met my husband, when the cat and I lived with my parents... they had to have their house jacked up to install new support beams. So the workers had to cut a part off from their back deck, detaching it from the house and leaving a ~2 foot gap between the back door and the deck (the deck was about 12 feet above the ground level). My dad was watching TV while sitting on the couch that faced the back door. Then he noticed the cat jumping up in the air. The cat was on a walkway in the back yard that was about 40 feet from the deck/back door but was eye level with the house, jumping to get my dad's attention so he would open another door to let him in.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","""Mystery Method, The Game, and Revelation,"" all started from Mystery. Neil was Mystery's direct trainee. ""The Game,"" was a book that covers a story of a man who went from dud to stud. Although, ""The Game,"" covers maybe 50&amp;#37; of the material in, ""The Mystery Method,"" if that, it is primarily a story. If you want the actual lesson, you can get a hold of, ""The Mystery Method."" I will say, ""The Game,"" does introduce many of the early PUAs. So, if you want a good story, and to understand a bigger picture view of the movement, you can read, ""The Game.""

People keep slinging, ""outdated,"" around for, ""The Mystery Method."" Maybe, just maybe the material, and direct canned phrases and stories are outdated. However, the book tells you to go make your own material. Also, a neg will always be a neg, even if we put prettier terms on it. I see negs, dhvs, qualifiers, building attraction, comfort, and many of these other terms in modern pickup books by any other name. The only modern trend that is different is to focus more on your lifestyle, networking, working out, taking care of yourself, building confidence, etc. Maybe, ""The Mystery Method,"" will seem hokey and goofy if you copy it verbatim, but it was obviously intended to convey a method that you attach your own life stories to. After all, Mystery wrote in his book, ""Don't just talk great, be great!"" I paraphrase.

Which is what, ""Revelation,"" does a little more. ""Revelation,"" adds just a pinch of inner game, and simplifies the M3 method from a 9 step to a 5 step process. This is what I got from skimming it. I will stick to M3, so I can stick to one method. Practicing is better than reading, but you should start with at least ONE framework before you jump out into the lion's den.

"modelSupCourt","t5_35iea","Your Honours,

And if it may please the Court, I am here to try and convince the Court to not grant this injunction. For, as noted, a number of reasons. Firstly, the application mentions a request for ""injunctive relief in the form of preventing the federal and state government from continuing their exercise of the death penalty, and to stay all executions until this case has been decided."" Yet, in the Court's granting of the case, the Court said that, in reference to my brief which attempted to convince the Court to throw out the case from which this request is birthed, "" In consideration of the amici submission, the Court requests that the parties limit this case to review of the federal death penalty statute."" The application for preliminary injunction does not hold itself to the same standard, as it requests that the Court also stop any executions at the state level, which is not under the Court's remit due to the Petitioners having not challenged the constitutionality of any state's methods of execution at the appropriate state supreme court. Even if the Court grants the injunction, it must do so only on a federal level.

Further, the Petitioners claim that ""the sentence of death, as qualified by the Act, serves as a degradation of human dignity, is authorized and enforced in a wholly arbitrary and random fashion, and serves no legitimate penological purpose other than to inflict pain and suffering upon the sentenced"". Of course, once again the Court has said different. As noted in Gergg V Georgia 428 US 153 (1976), ""Rejecting the contention that death by electrocution was ""cruel and unusual,"" the Court in In re Kemmler, supra at 447, reiterated: '[T]he punishment of death is not cruel within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.' Again, in Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. at 464, the Court remarked: 'The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.'; And in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. at 99, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, for himself and three other Justices, wrote:
'Whatever the arguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of accomplishing the purposes of punishment . . . , the death penalty has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.'"" 

Nor is the death penalty enforced in a arbitrary fashion, indeed, the Court has spent decades making sure that it is indeed not. Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, (2002) required a jury find the aggravating circumstances required to put a person to death, and not a judge. This was further refined in Brown v. Sanders, 546 U.S. 212 (2006) and Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, (2006), with Marsh requiring that if mitigating circumstances and aggravating ones are equal, the state may still impose the death sentence without the sentence being arbitrary per se. In addition, the mentally disturbed or disabled are not allowed to be put to death (see Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986) and Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, (2002)), nor those convicted for their crimes under the age of 18 (see Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, (2005)). Nor does that include those convicted of rape on children or women (Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008) and Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977)). Woodson v. North Carolina 428 US 280 (1976) ruled that mandatory death sentences were unconstitutional, and it was refined over several other cases (Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982), Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987), and Sumner v. Shuman, 483 US 66 (1987)) to mostly apply only to those convicted of felony murder, and not those merely associated with a felony murder who does not attempt to or intend to kill in the process. (Of course that does not include the myriad of other crimes who have aggravating factors associated with the death penalty, but I digress).

There are a number of factors which must be considered by a jury before someone is sentenced to death, as upheld by the Court on multiple occasions. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978) required mitigating factors to be considered during sentencing. Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980) ruled that the Jury must be able to consider lesser sentences than death, and in addition to that or acquittal. Aggravating factors must be narrowly defined; ""Thus, the validity of the petitioner's death sentences turns on whether, in light of the facts and circumstances of the murders that he was convicted of committing, the Georgia Supreme Court can be said to have applied a constitutional construction of the phrase 'outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that [they] involved . . . depravity of mind. . . .' We conclude that the answer must be no. The petitioner's crimes cannot be said to have reflected a consciousness materially more ""depraved"" than that of any person guilty of murder."" (Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980)) This standard has held for the nearly 40 years since. Indeed, aggraviting factors may be found in the very definition of the crime itself (Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988)), as long as it is specific. 

As for pain and suffering, the Plaintiffs would be wise to remember that ""simply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of “objectively intolerable risk of harm” that qualifies as cruel and unusual."" (Baze v. Rees, 553 US 35 (2008)). Further, as I have previously referenced in my initial filing on this case, the Court has ruled in the following cases that various methods of the death penalty are not in violating of the 8th amendment - Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1879) (firing squad), In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436 (1890) (electrocution), Federal Republic of Germany v. United States, 119 S. Ct. 1016 (1999) and Stewart v. Lagrand, 526 U.S. 115 (1999) (gas chamber), and finally Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573 (2006), Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35 (2008), and Glossip v. Gross, No. 14-7955, 576 U.S. ___ (2015) (lethal injection). The vast majority of states with the death penalty, as well as the federal government, use the same drug cocktail, which has been ruled to not violate the 8th amendment in Baze. The death is painless when preformed correctly. As for the claims of the application that ""the sentence of death... is likely to fail and become botched"", a study from Amherst College (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120529133458.htm) found that only 3% of all executions from 1900 to 2011 had some sort of problem. Whatever the court's definition of ""botched"" is, that is statistically small, considering the approximately 9,000  executions that went on during that time period. That number, by the way, includes everything from the gas chamber to electrocution (a method that is much more prone to failure than lethal injection) It is statistically improbably, particularly when using the lethal injection cocktail that is used by almost every state and the federal government.

I ask that the injunction not be granted in light of this informative brief, for the Petitioners have no precedent behind them, nor scientific fact. The death penalty is applied on a narrow set of circumstances, for a narrow set of crimes, and administered humanely. That is, on its face, completely different from what the Petitioners allege. I beg the Court to throw the injunction out.

Thank you.",1530403524

1. Harass women for lewds of their character and/or themselves.
2. Makes conversations sexual even when told to back off.

Which was written on the statue of liberty 113 years after the US had established immigration laws.  It was a sentimental message but it was not the rules of the land.  Hell, there was a expansion of the US immigration laws the year that that statement was inscribed on the statue of liberty (1903).

&gt;Except, there really isn't much of a problem 

If it's not much of a problem, then why are their nationwide protests going on right now about it?  

You can either protest about it making it a big deal or you can say it's not a big deal.  You can't proclaim both at the same time.  It's not logical.

&gt; It's well-known that in the ~1950s that the United States purposefully lent money to most of the related nations (along with corrupted parties, along with idealistic political newcomers) knowing full-well that they'd never be able to repay them outside of unsavory political capital and corrupted practices.

That's not the reason why these countries are in the position they are right now.  It might have been a symptom, but to pretend that the US is the sole reason is misguided at best.  Countries like Venezuela have done it to themselves given that they are sitting on one of the largest oil reserves in the world and they can't even feed their own people.

&gt;Eh, no thank you - and, pardon the uncivility, but go fist yourself, Mr. Trumpty Dumpty.

I don't give a shit if you don't like Trump.  When you start conflating your hatred and intolerance of Trump with actions that have PROVEN to work, then you are being a stubborn child.  You can kick, scream and yell, but the simple fact of the matter is that walls work.  They work whether you like Trump or not.  

But please, make sure you keep your credibility with the comments you are making because you are doing a hell of a job of making yourself out to be a giant ass who ignores logic in order to scream your bigoted hatred.

&gt;However, quantitative research has consistently shown that being foreign born is negatively associated with crime overall and is not significantly associated with committing either violent or property crime.

I am not going to go fist myself.  I'm going to act like an adult.  You would do best to start acting like one because the childishness of your posts is not helping any of your arguments.

The problem with the study that you linked to is the same arguments that have gone against it since it was originally published.  It constantly conflates LEGAL and ILLEGAL immigrants.  In one sentence, it will state immigrants and in the next will state illegal immigrants.  This back and forth nature conflates anything that it's trying to state as a conclusion.

The other thing that this study does not account for is any of the countless non-reported crimes or the more important change that has been made which doesn't report on the immigration status or ethnicity of the people involved.  This directly lowers the amount of crimes that are involved in this.

&gt;Except, again, you're pretty much wrong when it comes to the here and now and the words people use who are in the administration. Sessions is quoting Bible verses like the theocratic, extremist nutcase that he is.

No, I'm not wrong.  Nothing you posted actually states that I'm wrong.  You just got your panties up in a bunch because a country that was founded on religious principles would actually cite religion in their enforcement of the laws that were passed through democratic means.

Some people are too young, some are too old, some are immunocompromised, and a very rare few who react badly to vaccines (no, not autism, things like allergies and rare autoimmune responses).

When people choose not to get vaccinated, they weaken that protection and allow diseases to spread.
2. Not everyone gains full immunity from vaccines or their immunity fades over time. It's why some vaccines need multiple shots and/or boosters. Even if you're current on your vaccines, you're not 100% safe from getting sick. Every unvaccinated person is a potential danger to everyone.

first of all, thanks that's very nice of you. it's not JUST the dating although admittedly it plays a very big part.

"muacjdiscussion","t5_342em","I do occasionally use Porefessional/other smoothing primers under makeup (I'm also of the opinion that it's too much effort for daily use, and some foundations don't agree with that type of primer it seems), but one of my favorite uses for Porefessional in particular is using it *over* my foundation. I have some foundations that work well on my skin in general but reaaaally bring out my biggest pores in an unfortunate way  (primarily thinking of Neutrogena Healthy Skin here, haha). Setting foundations with powders usually smooths things enough for me, but with these foundations I'll also dot Porefessional in the spots where the foundation just looks weird because of my pores – primarily in the corners of my nose – and it basically makes them disappear (so I do this step after applying foundation but before setting it). And no risk of foundation sliding around because I used Porefessional under it!

The only point you could possibly credit to Trump is his first one, arming of the Ukraine.  And even then, its unclear who was pushing for it and the reasons why it happened.  The rest of it was him throwing shit at a wall to see what stuck.  Trump gets credit for being tough on Russia because 200 Russian mercenaries died attacking a US allied base in Syria?  Please, Trump had fuck all to do with that.  Giving Trump credit for that incident is absurd and desperate.  On top of that, a short time after the attack took place, [Trump announced he wants troops out of Syria](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/29/trump-syria-military-isis-491856).  That sounds more like appeasement than toughness to me.  His third point, Obama's comment of being ""more flexible"" to Dmitry Medvedev, is irrelevant to the stances and policies he actually pursued.  The European Missile System went through anyways, and that same year, Obama signed the Magnitsky Act.  Something that got Putin's panties in so much of a wad, that impotent petty-shit stopped the adoption of Russian children by Americans. Crimea was annexed on Obama's watch, which he responded to with strong sanctions along with our allies (or at least what use to be our allies).  Being tough doesn't necessarily mean using force.  When we talk about punishing Russia, what we really mean is Putin and his cronies.  According to Bill Browder, targeting their money is where it really hurts them.  They don't care about more people dying in Ukraine.  [Trump on the other hand appears willing to accept Russia's annexation of Crimea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/trump-leaves-door-open-to-u-s-recognizing-russia-s-crimea-grab), something I've never seen Obama come close to suggesting.

Have 10-20 and people actually have a choice, and more people have a voice instead of lame ‘the better of two evils’ for every race. Have even more on state level. Do away with ridiculous delegates, in a time and age where votes can be counted, processed and transferred immediately, they have no place. ‘But what about the American heartland people who get snowed out by the coastal areas’, doesn’t matter, their vote shouldn’t have more weight than another persons vote. That will also fix your educational problem, but it will never be implemented because it doesn’t serve either party. 
Also remove as much money from politics as possible, it’s ridiculous that a candidate **needs** to prostitute himself to several industries to stand a chance. I really hope somehow DJT fucks up so bad that you have to change, but I fear it won’t happen. ",1530403536

"PlantedTank","t5_2szbf","So I started my planted tank a couple of months ago with a vision, but unfortunately it wasn't quite growing into what I wanted it to. This is what it looked like when I first set it up: [**Picture 1**](https://i.imgur.com/mI3ioMU.jpg) - [**Picture 2**](https://i.imgur.com/l99Ojuq.jpg)


It looked quite a lot better 2 months later, but it still wasn't doing what I wanted it to, so I decided to start over and change it up. I basically just emptied the aquarium, but kept the precycled pump and some of the water. I also saved the plants by replanting them in another tank and I reused the S. Repens and the Anubias. Here's the aquarium after I cleared it out: [**Picture 1**](https://i.imgur.com/RtKAJik.jpg) - [**Picture 2**](https://i.imgur.com/y2gdytb.jpg)


So setting up the new aquascape I basically just used things I already had. The substrate was technically new, but I have had the bags lying around forever.. the stones are from the ""old"" aquarium (pictured above) and the plants are also from the other aquarium. I kinda wanted a carpet all the way across, but I'm gonna see how the S. Repens grows in and go from there. I know the filter is a bit of an eye-sore, I am looking to get that replaced eventually.

I then used the pre-cycled filter and used the 50% of water from the established aquarium and 50% dechlorinated tap water, speeding up the nitrogen cycle. A week later and this is the result, I got 3 fish in there doing fine so far (*Siamese algae eater*, *flying fox* &amp; a *Chinese Algae Eater*). Here's the final picture once again: [**Picture**](https://i.imgur.com/ldeJFnR.jpg)

EDIT:
I forgot to mention, I initially used a small dosage of ""Colombo Bacto Start"" in case the filter wasn't established enough. I also used *""Colombo Flora Grow""* tablets in the substrate to give nutrients to the plants, as well as supplementing with a small dosage of *""The Aquascaper Liquid Plant Food""*.

 Penguin from Batman rocks a rotund body shape, and a beard won’t throw it off much. There are big guys in games too, like Roadhog in Overwatch.

If you want crazier, you can do traditionally sexy characters like Slave Leia. If you’re not super body confident, get a skin coloured whole body suit and paint or sew the bikini on.

The more striking your costume, the more likely you are to get a two second sound bite on local news, so also take a minute to think of a good terse answer to questions like “what do you enjoy most about [event]?”.

Later on she appeared to be a mastermind, and a manipulator forcing things forward and dragging the story to unfold more and more things. she also keeps saying "" I just want to set things as they should be."" So I was starting to think she may have been the author, not the audience.

Why does this matter? The lesson you clearly haven't learned is that assigning blame doesn't accomplish anything, and millenials will suffer more from Trump than any other generation.

You're basically blaming voters that will be dead of old age before there's a chance to replace Trump's Supreme Court picks. Sure, piss on their graves if it makes you feel better.

Millenials that stayed home in 2016 hurt themselves more than they hurt the Democratic party. Vote because it's in your best interest to do so. You're the ones that will have your prime work years and have to raise kids during the era of Trumpism.",1530403538

"TalesFromTheKitchen","t5_2viez","Getting ready for dinner service, I was training a new kid and left him to finish some prep by himself.

We had these huge long metal lids that covered all the cold prep stuff. They were pretty heavy and had to be kept closed. 

I hear a BANG and look over and this kid is just standing there, white as fuck, with half of his hand under the lid. 

He slipped when closing it, and dropped the whole edge of the metal lid onto his fingers.
I go over and open it up and there is a lot of blood and TWO FINGERNAILS just chilling there IN THE COLESLAW. 

Was pretty horrific, amusing amount of blood, me and the other line cook had to redo everything and sanitize the whole station before dinner.

He stayed on for another two years though and turned out to be a really great dude to work with. Seriously injury prone though. This is the same dude who literally knocked himself out on  the side of the oven vents.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I think the complaint is less ""the three tiers don't line up reeee!"" and more that cruisers and frigates have and very frequently take the option of sacrificing fitting space elsewhere in order to ""up-fit"" certain modules.  The 1600mm plate being a prime example, when a cruiser wants an assload of buffer and doesn't need much else.  And of course the 100mn cruisers from hell.

Battleships don't have this option.  In the past they made up for this by having a generous number of slots and often an abundance of PG and/or CPU.  Where cruisers could fit ""oversize"" mods, BSes could fit multiples of them, or fit them alongside damage/utility mods, or use fitting mods without making huge sacrifices, which led to a lot of variety and a lot of advantages.

These days we're seeing a lot of very small ships with very large numbers of mids/lows, which makes the BS flexibility less distinctive and makes ""oversize"" modules that much easier to use, making the lack of them at the BS tier that much more glaring.

I don't necessarily agree with it being a dramatic, pressing issue that should be immediately addressed, but I do think it's a kink that's developed in the overall game design, and should be kept in mind if/when they make a balance pass that strongly affects the use of BSes.  My personal thought is that they probably don't need to introduce a ""BS+"" tier (besides, they would most likely just get slapped on BCs), but instead some sort of broad effort should be made to preserve/restore/enhance the flexibility of fits BSes have historically enjoyed.",1530403543
"DuggarsSnark","t5_fl4tn","Agencies base their particular rules on things they think are important and make sure they accord to state laws.  There isn't anything wrong with an agency having certain policies that may seem overly cumbersome or exclusionary to some people. People are drawn to adoption agencies for various reason and either have to deal with their policies or look elsewhere if those guidelines don't fit their situation.  Many agencies look at their experiences or those of other agencies and recs from social workers, therapists, etc when they make their guidelines. Some prioritize some findings and go from there. Some people find a good fit with an agency that has some different rules. It really isn't that remarkable or controversial really.  I know a couple that found an agency that didn't require either party of the couple have current income. Both were transitioning jobs and had no employment but had assets well into the millions. They didn't like some of the other agency policies but didn't really have access to another agency that didn't require at least one of them to have an active paid income.

In the words of mall cops, move along. There may be plenty to talk about with agencies and rules, but swiping at each other for using an agency with certain rules doesn't really get us anywhere here in snarking on these fartknockers who in general see children as arrows for a culture war.",1530403543

There were obvious hints about the flashforward, like the frequent flying, Jack's Motorola Razr. At the time watching  I just thought it was an ok Shepherd episode about Jack dealing with his father's death.

But man, that ending. When Jack met up with  Kate, it didn't register for me like that. I thought it was a big reveal that they knew each other before the island and were keeping it a secret or forgot it or it somehow would just be explained later. 

BUT WHEN JACK SAID ""WE HAVE TO GO BACK KATE"", I WAS SHOOK. I remember just saying ""What!"" out so loud my mom and dad came in the room to ask me what's wrong. I couldn't believe it, I had so many thoughts going through my mind. 

To be fair, I was 15/16 at the time, I hadn't heard of any primetime TV shows doing a flashforward narrative change like that. That something had happened in the future and they were gonna show all the build up and lead up to it. For me it was just mindblowing, like there was confirmation they would leave the island soon enough, and it felt like maybe the writers did have it planned out (they didn't, as we now know).

"amiugly","t5_2rgjh","When I first opened the post and saw your opening pic I thought you were a little ugly. You do have facial asymmetry and a big nose. 

Then I read your post and thought wow, this is kinda the most self aware person on here. You know how important an assessment in either direction (ugly or less ugly) would mean to you. I have actually saved your post because of how you have worded yourself. 

I went back to looking at your opening photo (the one I see when I click on your post, not your link) and put my finger over the three zones of your face: covering your eyes, looking at your bottom 2/3, covering middle, looking at eyes and chin, and covering chin. 

I think you have attractive eyes and eyebrows. Nice chocolatey dark color eyes and eyebrows have a well defined groomed look. You have attractive lips and chin. Nice soft kissable lips and defined, masculine chin. 

Your nose is less attractive. But then I clicked your link and saw you with the beard and thought you looked fine. Your hair and beard actually diverts attention to the upper and lower parts of your face where you are more attractive. Also I think a beard tends to make large noses a bit more handsome. . . Like look at pics of people who suit beards and you might see their noses are on the large side. Small noses don’t work as well. 

And then I saw your face from a farther distance and the nose did not look so bad. From a distance I wouldn’t single it out as something to be worked on. Because you have nice skin it just sort of blends. 

For photos try angling a bit to the side. It’s what actors do. 

Plastic surgery may help you. With your face in particular I think it could help. But I think plastic surgery will only thin your nose, not make it straighter. I don’t think you should try to make your nose straighter. Whether or not you like it your nose does align with your face. I wouldn’t change the angle because then it wouldn’t fit. I think you will just have to learn to like your asymmetry because it’s there to stay. 

The other commenter is right about the boxer look. You have a beat up face but there’s an attraction to it. Mark Wahlberg and Channing Tatum are pretty beat up looking. Like them I think the best thing you can do for yourself is gain some weight and muscle. That way your face makes sense. As is you don’t look particularly underweight though. Look at those actors mentioned for the type of muscle and the type of wardrobe that might work for you. You may have to look for darker or clearer tones though, like burgundy, because you have a clearer skin tone. 

I’ll give you a 6/10 now. I don’t see why anyone should be repulsed by you even if you’re not the best looking person. As I mentioned you seem self aware, articulate and it looks like you have proper hygiene. And your attractiveness is there, though it might take someone to look a little longer to find it. 

Getting plastic surgery for your nose is up to you but I think you should make peace with your asymmetry beforehand because there’s not much more for it you can do. I would also say do make attempts to gain that muscle and wardrobe and go with your assymetry and create that narrative of a boxer look, even if you are not coordinated as you say. Like for example, please don’t wear overly symmetrical prints like stripes or checks, which will exacerbate your asymmetry. Instead try for like selvage jeans or like likewise asymmetrical patterns or other worn in, imperfect things. There’s a beauty to the irregular too. I would want you to try your best in these areas, because plastic surgery is not a fix all and I don’t want you to give it undue expectation or be disappointed if it fails to bring you the amount of social inclusion you want. . .  That is a more continuous area of growth and development, internally and otherwise. Anyway, I don’t think you’re far off from being a person of obvious social value. . . Your emotional intelligence and personal insight is very appealing. It might just be a process of letting people see it. 

Best of luck to you. ",1530403544

* [Scotch/Japanese/Irish Whiskies Gift Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/5eufjb/scotchjapaneseirish_whiskey_gift_recommendations/)

&amp;nbsp;

Please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request. Tell us:

* your budget
* which whiskies you or your giftee have enjoyed
* which bottles you’re considering now
* where you live (pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region)
* if your shop has a limited selection or you might have trouble shipping bottles so we don’t recommend something obscure

&amp;nbsp;

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.",1530403546

"news","t5_2qh3l","I mean, you're right, but only in the sense that, upon administration, heroin is immediately metabolized into morphine. The exact lethal dose of morphine is very dependent on how addicted the person ingesting the drug is.

I dont disagree that giving people access to pure drugs could cut down on accidental ODs as a result of impure products, but to imply that people wouldnt OD any more is just wrong. 

Edit: You could argue that it is unlikely for someone to consume several grams of morphine, but I'd argue that that's exactly what would happen if it was sold in corner stores all over the country. Maybe the best option is to sell it in pharmacies where youd need to show an ID and theres a whole electronic database so that pharmacies can make sure people only buy a maximum of like 4-5 grams a day.

But is it really breaking the Masquerade? If you ghoul him then no, it isn't. If you don't, you just told a mortal that vampires exist.

There is a more interesting point here, I think.

You said in response to another comment that your character is self-conscious about this stuff involving people from his past. Is he really willing to enslave a past friend?

# Sovereign Sages- Alliance

# NA- Dalaran

**What are we looking for?**

We're currently looking to bolster our ranks with some new members so we can really hit the ground running with BFA. In particular, we'd like to find some ranged  DPS and healers to help fill some gaps in our raid team. We do not need main tanks for raid but spares for M+ is always nice.

**What kind of guild are we?**

Our guild got its start during BC, and after a server transfer a year ago, we are looking to re-bolster our numbers.  The Sages is comprised of a diverse group of players who have become a close knit community. We welcome people from all walks of life (women, raiding couples, people of all ages) and promote an environment of acceptance, humor, some cynicism, and frivolity. We are also a helpful bunch of people who are down for helping you gear and get better as a player (and maybe as a human being, though we can't promise results there).

Our membership is interested in a bit of everything from achievement hunting and mog farming to pushing Mythic+, and during Legion we've started pushing hard with our progression raid team. Though our raid team got a bit of a late start, we have our 11/11 N Antorus, and are sitting at Heroic Coven. Based on our current rate of progress, we expect to get our AOTC achievement. In addition, we have a few players who enjoy PVP, and are looking to push that with the new expansion. As a group, we are pretty much up for anything as long as someone suggests it and we have the bodies online. We also try to do guild events, such as drunk raiding, betting gold, member issued challenges, drunk runs to Stormwind, scavenger hunts, and more!

**Raiding Schedule:** Wed/Sun 8-11pm EST

**Are you right for us?**

Here's an easy way to tell if you’re a good fit for us: Are you not a complete and total asshole? Are you a returning player, or someone with at least a lvl 100 toon? Do you want to make a bunch of friends who you look forward to spending time with?  Do you like progressing in current content while maintaining a relaxed vibe? Do you remember to stand in the green druid healing circles? If you answer yes to those things, then the Sages might be the community for you.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","I'm going to help you out here because I'm going to guess you're definitely not familiar with supply-side rhetoric or concepts.  
  
If this author really cared about growth in the short-term, he would look at multipliers in different states. As an example, [In Japan,](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/swp2017-40.pdf) the effect of government spending on growth is normally bad, with a multiplier of 0.6. However, right now it could be very good indeed because Japan is stuck at the zero lower bound and the multiplier is projected around 1.5. These are almost the same results as [in the USA.](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/696277)  
  
Because countries like the US and Japan and areas like the Eurozone are stuck at the zero lower bound, it might be worthwhile for them all to massively increase government spending if they want to fix their stagnant growth. That's what [Eggertsson seems to think.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23093) (Added note: I am not implying the Secular Stagnation or the ZLB are steady state changes, as those take ~36 years to determine.) 
  
But because this person is a supply-sider, they'll probably counter you with observations like [this.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0VDoaXaIou8SzltVUVMWXVXOWM) Highlighting a specific point, they may remark that spending only during recessions or at the zero lower bound is not credible because instead of tapering off, new spending almost invariably becomes permanent.   
  
&gt;Andrew then appears to pluck a statistic out of thin air  
  
You missed the conceptual shift here. He's talking about something called the BARS Curve (Barro, Armey, Rahn, and Scully), which is basically the Laffer Curve for spending. It's supposed to be used to cue us in to the location of the growth maximizing point on the Laffer Curve, so we can plan accordingly.   
  
&gt;For one, any such turning point would like vary considerably between countries at different stages of development, position in the economic cycle etc.  
  
So? You wouldn't tell a policymaker ""Hey, we can't figure out how the economy is going to work exactly in two years, so about that new top tax level... just don't set it."" By implying that a perfect point can't be ascertained, you're making the perfect the enemy of the good like an Austrian, and there's no sense in that.  
  
He's correct on his ""general estimation,"" but those are liberal estimates because the optimal point is dynamic and tends to shift down. Quoting from above:  
  
&gt;An examination of 150 countries over 25 years shows that as economies grow, the optimal size of government — the government spending per dollar of GDP that is associated with maximum economic growth — declines. It may be that when a country is small, private investment is commensurately small, financial markets are less developed, and government can play a useful role in funding industries that require large start-up costs. This need would diminish as the country’s economy develops.""  
  
Normal attempts to determine this growth maximizing point tend to overestimate it because they're restricted to using too little data and not capturing the period in the 19th century when governments were smaller (Ravallion, 2016). I'll copy and paste a few more examples:

Sure there's a lot of evidence that government is too large for maximizing growth under normal assumptions but not all of us want to maximize growth. Some want to increase HDI or score better on the Gender-Related Development Index (GDI), and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). There's some evidence that optimizing for growth undermines performance on those measures, so if we want social justice, we have to make the sacrifice.

"wildhockey","t5_2rp0l","I am kinda thinking that the Wild are going into a serious, very low-key rebuild. There is no way anyone in the front office looks at this roster and thinks ""yeah, we're in contention."" But they cannot come out and:

1- announce it: that they are wanting to rebuild. It would just highlight the fact that we have burdened ourselves with Parise and Suter's contracts, not to mention toss in the towel on their twillight years.

2- actually rebuild: because the fan base would be on to any moves that offered up guys like Nino, Coyle, etc., and know that there is nothing down in Iowa to replace them.

Every move we make must look like we are trying to get better now. Which is impossible as we have no trade bait or cap room to get someone who could actually make a difference.

We're kinda fucked for the next few seasons, sadly.",1530403552

You need to see the way you react to these comments. If you hear the hurtful comments and think ; ""she is angry at herself, I don't need to react to this and the feeling is not mine."" you will be able to react correctly.

It is very hard in the beginning. Someone that is not angry won't say comments like she says to your friends. She is not doing well but don't let this affect you, have empathy.

We just need to rally the original thirteen colonies under a heavy propaganda machine touting us as the original Beermerica.  The other Blue Moon states will fall in line after losing their east coast comrades.  Our biggest challenge is the blocks of Budweiser across the western expanse.  I think we can win over California; one halfway decent movie about Sam Adams starring Ryan Gosling as Sam Adams crying a few times and we can net that most precious California demographic: people who think they know movies.  After that, we prop up a liquored up Jim Koch (Sam Adams founder) and get him to announce a cannabis infused ale.  Boom!  We instantly win over Northern California and about 37% of Southern California.  Then we use that Beerijuana to win over Colorado (Sorry, Coors) and the border states.

Time of Ice cannot stop the onslaught. In Game 2, I get to Clutch his Valduk and put On Serra's Wings on it.

Round 3. Game 1 - Grindy, but my Excavation Elephant with On Serra's Wings does the trick. Game 2 - I have Gideon's Reproach, Clutches, and On Serra's Wings in hand. Two turns and two kicked Skin Witches later I'm basically dead. Game 3 - Eldest Reborn forces me to sacrifice my Cold Water Snapper, which the opponent reanimates.

We dont want to pay for 5 subs and still have access to only 10% of all anime. But if i could donate 1$ a month to kiss to get the site with no adds, i would (so long as i cant be traced and it was safe) And if they ""have the site visits to maintain it"" there would be no reason to ban adblock unless they were losing money and are hoping to make money off of a far smaller amount of people who dont adblock. Yes, a large amount of users used adblock.

And there is a total difference between being angry over being banned because we were adblocking without reason, and being mad at being banned over the fact that we had no option but to use adblock.

You say ""not everyone uses adblock or worries about it"". yet anyone with any tech knowledge what so ever would know to use an adblock. I dont use adblock because of some sidebar ads, i use it to protect my computer from viruses. You cant deny that kissanime was forcing malware on its users and you cant deny that a lot of the popup adds made navigating the site very difficult. There are dozens of other sites, equally as good as kissanime- if not better out there. ill go to one, turn off my adblock and try to use the site. If i cant use it without an adblock, im turning it on. Kissanime admins wanted us to use their site without adblock, yet did nothing to allow us to actually do so. They shot themselves in the foot and are blaming the users.

If a site cant maintain a semblance of functionality without adblock, its not going to last. If your site is a toxic dump of malware and popups no one is going to use you for long. I have TRIED several times to use kissanime without adblock, and you would have to be either very naive or be totally ok with redirects and running a malware program every day to use kissanime without some sort of ad filter. The site in general was a huge headach to use without adblock. In the years i have used kissanime i have never ONCE heard ANYONE say ""yeah u can use it without an adblock!"",  its been a default ""here use kissanime, BUT MAKE SURE TO TURN ON ADBLOCK"".

Its nothing about Kissanime owing me anything, its about the fact that if they want to function there are just things people wont tolerate. If they didnt want us to use adblock, they needed to have changed ad providers. Im sure they could find adult theme ad providers that wouldnt spam us with malware. I have used kissanime for 5 years because it was just a habit. There is almost 0 hassle to find a site to replace it. And the fact that it was a perma ban without even being able to come back without an adblock? Is laughable.

I would LOVE to see the traffic kissanime gets before and after this ban happened because Im willing to bet almost no one will recommend kissanime after this whole fiasco.

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","**Since MTX was introduced into RuneScape, have you made any purchases?**  

Never did with real-world money. I must have bought about 10-ish bonds in total since they were introduced into the game 5 years ago. I used them either to buy a few weeks of membership, for TH keys (once iirc) or for Runecoins to buy some cosmetics.  

**Do you feel the overall impact of MTX has been positive or negative?**  

I would say both. I feel that overall the updates quality has increased over the years in terms of size, graphics, sounds, etc. although they haven't always been very successful in their core gameplay. IMO this increase in quality is due to higher budget (= more staff) but I don't have any real data to prove it.  

On the negative side, I would say that MTX in RS are badly implemented in the game. Especially TH which is basically a gambling simulator where you never really knows how much money you'll have to spend to get the items you want. Solomon's store is okay (I'm perfectly fine with MTX that includes cosmetics and light conveniences) but is currently underused by Jagex and very unpractical to use by players (the UI is meh). Bonds are okay too because in the end they have a neutral impact on the game and reduce RWT issues.  
I'm against selling direct XP, I bit less against selling XP in form of bonus XP since you have to actually go skilling to make use of it. The game integrity regarding hiscore and XP related achievement has been completely ruined a long time ago anyway...  

**What are your thoughts on the impact of MTX on the games industry as a whole?**  

Most of the time it's cosmetics or small conveniences so I'm fine with that. But sometimes it can become very unhealthy especially when some form of gambling come into play. When the targeted audience is children and teenagers I think it can become a real issue due to the lack of proper legislation on the matter.  

**For those of you who have not spent any money on MTX, what would push you to do so?**

That's actually a good question. I decided a long time ago that I wouldn't spend a single real world cent on Runescape's MTX. Since then I did it indirectly through buying bonds with in-game gp but otherwise, I stayed true to my words.  

Last January I began playing Guild Wars 2. During my first two months, I spent about 50€ for both game expansions. It's a one-off, the base game is ""free"" and there is no subscription. In addition to this I spent exactly 35€ to buy some story content from 2014-2016 that are optional (free for those who were playing at the time of release) but to me are important to understand the whole game universe ^#lorehound and some conveniences (bank space and QoL item). Since then I've never felt the need to purchase anything more in the game ""MTX shop"" except for some cosmetics which were extremely gorgeous.  

So why did I spent 35€ in mtx on a game I barely knew and why didn't I spent any money in mtx on game I've been playing for years? After thinking, I think there are two main reasons for that:  
1) In GW2 I knew exactly how much it would cost me and what I would get from my money.  
2) I'm already spending money every month to play RS. Maybe if the game were turned into a real free to play I would consider spending money on some extra.  

Hopefully my answer will help you. Good luck with your work!

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","First, I would report it to your local police.  I would be sure to tell them that you have determined that it appears that a Wells Fargo employee in another state is making the deductions.  That should be sufficient for Interstate Wire Fraud charges, along with Interstate Bank Fraud.  Ask you local police if you should notify the FBI or will they call the FBI.  The problem is that this keeps occurring - even though you are getting the missing funds returned.

* Also, did your bank statements come via the US Postal Service?  If so, you could probably go down to the local post office and talk with the US Postal Inspectors, who would probably work with the FBI.  https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/ 

* I would also call the Colorado State Banking Department about this since you are doing your banking in that state.  https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dora/division-banking.

* There is also the FDIC which also handles Interstate Bank Fraud.  -- https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/8000-1250.html 

Essentially, you want Wells Fargo to act to stop this fraud - whomever and however it is happening.  Since it's across state lines, push the Federal aspects of this.

"PowerShell","t5_2qo1o"," See this is why I’ve been putting things out there, it starts as a script that I use for something, and as I’ve been getting looking into the module implementation a lot lately, I have just been updating components so they “work” haha.  


Position 0 was just a set I had as I did initially have a 0/1 for input and output but just removed the output location to auto set to same path.  
Was also going to be implementing option 2 for implementing single PC use only. but it definitely doesn't need 0 for now.

More of a personal preference there i suppose. 

With lines 32/34 it actually used both in the script (doesn't need to, but as i did have this as a script initially before converting it, each had its own options.) it only needs file path and to have content reference updated to file path.

Ive cut it back to its initial reference. 

For the stage 7 - it was initially implemented, but i cut it back to 6 - forgot to remove that reference :) but it was only using the 6 encoding reference itself. 

With the global usage - yes its not required anymore - but as it just initially started out as a bit script i was working on, i had to reference it from that perspective, and just left that as is.

With the code indentation - i do agree, layout wasn't fantastic, but it was understandable for me, so i just indented it for my reference.

As for double line spacing - was using it as my preference in just writing the content itself - just makes it easier to read.

Double quotes were more for easier output reading.

Now, as of reading this, i have made changes to the content itself and following most of your advisement's (Still maintained the global stuff - will pull later)

But this is exactly why ive shared the content - someone will know what should be changed - and with that, this is why there is an update :)

I really appreciate your advisement's there /u/root-node

it has certainly helped me look at things in a fresh perspective.

Thank you very much!

Well, now the loan is costing you money. A checking account is (should be, anyway) for just holding money to pay for upcoming bills. If you have an appropriate emergency fund, there's no reason to have money sit in checking.

As far as keeping me a secret, I asked him to because his mom flipped her shit when he initially brought me up. I don't live with his parents, I live with a roommate. I can get to work because the bus route is on the main road and I work off the main road at a Starbucks. I work full time there and I make enough to pay my rent, bills and food with a tiny bit extra as long as I don't go overboard with anything. About an extra $100 a month. I doubt my pay will cover insurance and a car payment and if I buy off Craigslist I would have to take out a loan or save up enough to drop the full amount in one go. He goes to school and works almost full time at a restaurant, he's currently paying for his phone, a monthly payment for a laptop he uses for programming at school, his gas and any repairs for the car. His parents paid off the car a long time ago and pay the insurance. It's in their name. He doesn't make enough to afford the car payment and insurance for a car, since she s obviously not putting the car in his name. Together we could possibly scrape buy to afford the car payment/loan payment and insurance, but my roommate has stated even if him and I share a room, she expects the rent and bills to be split 3 ways, so we would be paying for that plus whatever other bills we have.

I think it's because when I was in HS myself, I decided I was going to try to read [Modern Libraries Top 100 Novels](http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/) and some of those books are some seriously dense reads. They had another list on the site at the time that had a lot of Ayn Rand, and while I loved the books, Atlas Shrugged is well over 1000 pages long and it's not a quick read like the GOT books. 

I was just about to say how rough of a read Moby Dick was, as it's basically just a whale encyclopedia, but then I remembered how much you loved whales, so it might be right up your alley. Then again, it's mostly about the killing of whales, so maybe not.

And I never did finish all of the books on that top 100 list...",1530403574

Bumblebee is made by Travis Knight who directed the excellent Kubo and the Two Strings and is the CEO of Laika, the studio that made the great Coraline and Paranorman. Plus the movie looks very well done and heartfelt in the trailer (a lot of people are actually hyped for it because of that). I could easily see this film being a surprise critical darling (at least by Transformer standards) and the box office will reflect that strong word of mouth. Plus the international audience will at least make it successful due to their insane love of the franchise even if it underperforms in the USA.


Aquaman has some stuff going against it. The messy DCEU being connected to it does it no favors. James Wan has never done a movie like this and could be horrible at it. The lead was one of the many bad parts of Justice League. And the hero is still seen as lame in the mainstream. This one may win only if it's well done, any less and it will probably not win, but it will still be successful.


Then there's Alita. At least Aquaman has a good chance due to it at least being connected to DC (even if it is the messy DCEU), Alita has a nearly impossible task ahead. First, it's a niche source material (even by manga/anime standards). Speaking of which, the negativity against adaptations of Japan visual media (especially after the meh Ghost in the Shell and atrocious Death Note adaptations from last year) doesn't help it's chances. The artistic choice of Alita's look (specifically the eyes) has turned many people off. The trailer doesn't really sell the scope or intrigue of the story well or how big of a passion project this is. The budget is too high. The PG-13 rating will piss off fans (the manga was horrifically violent). And Robert Rodriguez has been associated to bad quality for awhile. While Cameron being attached will help this do better than it would without him, this looks like a lost cause. Even if it's fantastic and has strong word of mouth, I honestly think this movie will bomb hard.",1530403575

Having pretty well followed what’s happened with the band and Chester over the last year, I really enjoyed listening to it through for the sake of the lyrics and message it contained. I really wanted to hear what mike had to “say” through his music. I think knowing the context behind what’s happened over the last year really helped me to enjoy it more.

I think the best way to put it is that 80-90% of my interest in his music/album is solely based on the fact that Mike’s part of Linkin Park. This album is the closest think to any kind of “new Linkin Park material” there is. If his album was released exactly as is by some artist I’d never heard of before, I don’t think I’d take much interest in it.

I feel a little guilty saying that, and I hope I haven’t offended anyone, but that’s kinda how I feel. It’s not that his music is bad, it’s just a little outside he gente of music I like. ",1530403578

It seems Im in the same boat cause yeah I do listen to a wide range of music and that is pretty important to me too as well as gaming. I have had the Logitech G930(probably pretty old now) and then I went to the Razer Kraken USB, they fucked out and I went to the Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma. They fucked out since the latest Windows Update and In sheer frustration I smashed them on my doorstep. Ive been watching reviews and reading comments on headsets for the last couple of days and Im so torn between what to get. I play RUST and ARMA3, so surround sound or really good immersive sound is a must for those games, I need to hear the footsteps, the small sounds that matter, and for music yeah has to be decent.

"SCP","t5_2r4ni","Hey,

Unfortunately, I've realized that some Wikidot silliness makes this impossible to do in a simple way.  Certain SCP articles have ""offsets"" (e.g. http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2998/offset/5), and detecting such subpages is difficult because it requires searching through the raw html to see if there's a link containing 'offset'.

I do actually know how to handle this type of thing, but it'll take a while to make sure it's actually well-behaved and doesn't download a lot of garbage (since presumably the actual word 'offset' is used in articles and could trigger false positives that would download many copies of the ""[This page doesn't exist yet](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4444)"" page).

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","I suspect a lot of people posting pretty good work, yet saying ""ugh this is trash..."" probably KNOW their work is pretty decent. It's hard being an artist because no matter what, your skill and technique will always lag behind the vision in your mind for how you wanted the piece to look. And that's good. That means you are always naturally, instinctively reaching for things that are \*just\* beyond your skill. That's how we improve!   


The curse - and blessing -  of being an artist is that we are doomed to almost never be 100&amp;#37; satisified with a piece. Now and then, I have had that moment, playing music or drawing, where I sit back when done and am able to nod and say ""Yes. Yes, this is what I meant to express."" Those rare moments when the vision you had exactly lines up with the upper limits of your current skill. But even those pieces, I can go back years later and review them, and see tons of things I would do differently.  


Point being, I understand the frustration on finishing a piece and saying ""Well... it could be worse, but it's still not what I saw in my head.""  And criticizing your own work harshly, when it doesn't deserve it, can be a way of getting people to respond by saying ""Oh no, it's great, don't be so harsh on yourself!""  
But that's not a healthy way of getting viewers to engage with you, plus it doesn't get any useful feedback about the art.   


And, as OP very rightly said, it's unintentionally hurtful to every artist out there who isn't as skilled as you yet, because they automatically get discouraged to see someone calling their work trash, when some of them would have sold their soul and firstborn child to do something at that level of skill. We can model a much healthier attitude for the artists coming along after us - saying ""well, I'm not totally happy with it, I couldn't get these specific parts of it how I wanted them, but I guess I'll try again someday.""   


The other reason I think artists pre-criticize their work harshly when posting it, is as an attempt at immunization from what jerks and trolls - The people who, when you post work saying ""I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, actually..."" think ""Oh yay! Someone was happy and proud of themselves! Time to ruin their day and put them down as harshly as possible!""   


So, by pre-emptively insulting our own work, it's like we're saying ""Look I know it's not perfect. I'm not 100&amp;#37; happy with it. It has flaws that frustrate me. I already know this. No need to be cruel about it. Look, I already insulted it, so no need for YOU to insult it too.""   
It's like we've let those types bully us into being afraid to openly be proud of decent work, because if we show pride and self-esteem, they take it as a signal to attack and try to destroy that.   


Well, you can't appease those types by picking on yourself. I went to school with a lot of really awful bullies. It has damaged me for life in ways that I will be overcoming probably as long as I live. But it also made me very strong in certain ways and taught me a lot about the differences between negativity, criticism, vs actual valuable critique.  


When we post work, WE get to set the tone. There's no point to just being negative and insulting about your own work. Bullies and trolls will insult it whether you did so first or not. It might be healthier to post something more like ""I was mostly happy with this piece. I loved how the hair and eyes turned out. Still very frustrated with hands. Constructive criticism and suggestions for specific things I could change are welcomed. Trolls can f\*\*k off and die in a fire.""  


Self-critique is different from self-criticism. ""I need to work on understanding the shapes behind hands"" is critique, and it tells you an actual action you can take, without being negative or insulting to the overall artwork.   


So it is productive and useful. ""I suck at hands"" is criticism, but at least the implied answer inherent in the comment is ""...so I need to practice drawing hands more.""   


Not as productive as the first version, though, because there's an insult in the comment, and negativity discourages most people from trying again as much or as often.  As the quote goes; ""The expert has more failures than the amateur has total attempts."" Anything that makes you want to give up and not keep attempting, is negative and to be avoided. A huge part of art skills are muscle memory and repetition, so anything that stops you or slows down your enthusiasm for doing multiple repetitions of a skill or technique, is unhelpful.  


""This picture sucks and is garbage scribbles"" Is as useless comment, totally useless criticism. First of all, it's just based in totally subjective opinion. Much of art is based on taste, on how the image impacts the viewer. One person's garbage scribble is another person's Mona Lisa. ""Sucks"" or ""Great"" is so vague that it's really based on what the viewer likes or dislikes.   


Second of all, it contains nothing the artist can take action on. It's as if you walked up to a barista, growled ""coffee, now,"" slammed some cash on the counter, took a sip of your coffee, then threw the cup on the floor and yelled ""this coffee sucks.""   


Okay... well, I could make you better coffee... but you're going to need to tell me some information about how you like your coffee, and how the coffee I gave you was different from that. Otherwise I can safely assume you are being grumpy and childish and I can just ignore you.   


Now, if you can tell me WHAT you like or dislike about the coffee... or art image, and WHY, we are back to useful critique again.",1530403582

I could be anyone from anywhere? What difference does my identification with form make to you? If I belonged to a category of physical characteristics you were comfortable with, would this be an easier conversation for you? And what if English was my second or third language, do I then not deserve to state my experience and opinion in a public forum?

Do you have to have any of those attributes to be entitled to the same?

I did find this on stackexchange, the edit makes the law really unclear, like you’re just talking a chance:

&gt;This device is legal as long as you do not publish the video. In case you want to, you need to pixelate license plates and faces. Also you are not allowed to have a specific person ""in focus"", meaning: You are not allowed to sit in the car and point it at specific people. Regarding your comment, having a camera in there that does not record is perfectly fine, no need to remove it.

&gt;You can present the camera in Germany in case there is an accident but the validity of the video as a proof has to be decided by the judge. So while there is no guarantee, the chances are high of course that this will help you a lot.

&gt;Be careful though: If the police takes the camera as a proof and finds you crossing red lights earlier in the video, they can take that as a proof to get you in return.

&gt;Update: A recent high profile court case affirmed at applicablity of dashcam footage in court (on accident-related case), but also affirmed the general non-legality of dashcams (not only sharing, but dashcams in general) - they may be semi-legal if set to overwrite in ""short""(undefined by court) loops and stop overwriting only on accident-detection.

As for how you'll do vs the meta decks, Kirik will stomp you. He can already kill normal decks on turn 4 and considering that your deck will probably deal 1000 damage to you for free, I don't think you have any chance of doing anything to him.  
  
Sherry can very quickly establish a board while also disrupting you, so I don't think that you can force through enough damage against her.  
  
Gill should be a fairly easy matchup, but this would be the case with most aggro decks.  
  
Basically, Frayla doesn't really do anything unfair. Those 3 decks that you mentioned all have the ability to completely take over the game. I personally think that its more fun to play some of the weaker rulers (and most people would agree considering that even in GPs half of the playerbase refuses to play the top tier decks) If your goal is to have a good time then I would say this deck is great for that. If you just want to win, you should probably switch to kirik. ",1530403588

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Something functional, writing compilers/interpreters is the perfect task for a functional language.

I wrote a complete native code compiler in ML for my programming language. ML is old, but there are ML-based languages that are very popular nowadays (OCAML, Haskell, etc).

You could also choose to write it in some kind of lisp. Scheme/Racket, Lisp, Clojure (I don't have much experience with this one).

But ya, due to the way functional languages tend to work, and since you're going to be using tree structures *very* heavily, a functional language is absolutely the best way to write it.

If it's a compiled language, you could also bootstrap your compiler, and actually write the compiler *in* the language you're writing. Sounds confusing, but that's why they call it bootstrapping, because it's like lifting yourself off the ground by your own bootstraps :D

I highly recommend writing your own compiler, it will likely be one of the biggest projects you've ever written, if not the biggest. Compilers are serious business, and it is pretty complex and complicated, you will learn a ton.",1530403591

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","This is what an anchor is for. Because if you stay fully conscious while trying to sleep, you won't go to sleep. You pick an anchor, or a focus point for your attention that can stay through the falling asleep process. Some anchors (like counting) are very heavy, and some people can't carry those all the way to sleep and just stay awake (for some, counting is perfect). Some anchors are light or easily dropped (like feeling the difference between awake and asleep) and these are the ones that you will fall asleep unaware with. 
If your focus is too vague, you will fall asleep, too broad, you will stat awake. It needs to be sharp and specific. Like slamansuca mentioned. Change what you are focusing on and what you do at different points of the wild. Wild is pretty much trial and error. I usually tell people to try and wild 3-6 times a night if they want to get quickly proficient at it and to try an anchor about 10-15 times before changing. Also to ""lean towards sleep"" instead of towards waking, because if you dont sleep, you won't have any other tries for the rest of the night.

What happened was I walked in, said I had a 1pm appointment, she asked me if I was willing to work nights bc that's all that was available.  I picked that night shift.  Then she took my badge picture, I did the drug test, and left.  She actually told me to expect a week and a half wait for the results, but it was Friday and I got the email on Monday 😂

So I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing.  Everything up to my results went so quickly, and it's now been almost 3 weeks since that.

My partner assured me that if need be, I can take our cat and a handful of smaller things in the car and move out to Ohio before her, and she'll pack the  big stuff and take the uhaul days later.  But that's only if I get a start date that's too soon for us to properly make our move.

That's not to say that long term marijuana use doesn't leave you in a hole, fun wise. The lack of constant, powerful stimulation to your endocannabinoid receptors does play a big part in what you feel, or why every might seem less fun or shiny or bright. It has to do with dopamine, too: one of the effects of marijuana is making the brain less responsive to dopamine. Now that you're not high all the time, you notice the lack of dopamine in your brain and everything doesn't seem worth it, in addition to actually *doing* things not really being fun or happy.

People say God is a moral being. Yet the bible doesn't make that claim. Is God good? Sure. But the bible teaches commitments and consequences.

You listen to what people say too much. And with out the critical thinking you should be enjoying. I don't know a serious Christian that thinks God gives a RIP who wins a game.

&gt;but ignore people who want to escape the torture chamber he has built?

I did have a close guitar playing friend who'd struggled with a wicked meth habit for years. His guitars were about the only thing he loved and he played all the time. He wrote and played a lot of his own stuff and several of his ""friends"" used to tell him he sounded much better when high, which only pushed him deeper into that hole. Eventually he got bad enough to where he'd call me on the phone, crying and telling me he didn't have any money to fund his habit and had to sell his gear for it. To this day, it is one of the most painful conversation I have ever had with someone I loved.

I ended up buying all of his gear. His guitars, his amps, his pedals, even his fucking straps and cables. While I bought it all for insultingly low prices, giving him money and knowing what he'd spend it on was not easy for me. I did it because I didn't want any of his shit going to a pawn shop or anyone else but me, just in case he'd get clean. I didn't use it. I kept it all hidden in my attic.

After a few years, he did get clean. I called him the day he received his 6 month coin and gave it all back to him. We stood there and cried like children. We played together 3-4 times a week for a long time after that day and his music had never been better. I knew he was still tormented and dealing with the urge every single day but he was taking it one step at a time.

Unfortunately, it was simply too difficult for him in the end.

It was even MORE obvious in D1, because the color of damage numbers specifically told you if your damage could be improved: White damage numbers: You can increase the light of your weapons to do more damage to an enemy, past its level. Gray numbers: You have hit the overlevel cap, and higher light will no longer increase your damage.

I use `ghci`'s `:reload` or `ghcid` for most changes (and also ghci for testing whether the code works, e.g. via `:main`) and only compile when I'm done.

The slow bit is always codegen (unless you do some ultra fancy type level lists stuff, which when done wrong can blow up typechecking and coercions exponentially). So by using `ghci`, no codegen is done, so it's ~10x faster than building.

If I remember correctly from my last chat with /u/chrisdoner, right now Intero uses `-fobject-code` which does codegen. It may be a good idea to add a mode where it does `-fbyte-code` like ghci instead, allowing the user to trade the ability to resume across interpreter restarts (`-fobject-code` is incremental in that case, `-fbyte-code` isn't) for faster reloads.

&gt; it could use the ghc-pkg unregister solution and ask you whether it is okay to transitively delete all the dependents

That sounds feasible, but I'm not sure how useful it is vs deleting the entire snapshot (e.g `lts-...`). Since package DBs are always per snapshot, the UI would have to look something like `stack uninstall lts-123 mypackage`. So you would have to already know very precisely which package from which snapshot you want to delete. That makes sense technically but at least for my own use cases I've always only longed for ""delete the entire snapshot, I haven't built anything with that one for months"".",1530403601

I'm finding that the calculator is giving people a sister size for Ewa, so if it gives you 28G you may want to try a 30FF, as the bands in this cut are firm, or order both sizes (28G and 30FF) in the SF. One is bound to fit and you can exchange the second one if necessary. You will love their bras. They truly are amazing when it comes to fit for narrow-rooted breasts. Good luck!",1530403603

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","What (I think) I need: Speakers. 

What I'd like to spend: $300
What I'm able to afford: $150

Current issue: 
Initially I thought my receiver just needed to be repaired, but after getting it serviced it turns out that my speakers are just toast. Only one of them works, and it heavily distorts sound before the volume level hits the middle of the dial. 
(Note: I've attempted to read up on how to match appropriate speakers to the rest of my setup, but I can't afford to purchase something that most likely won't go with what I've got. I'd rather get input from people who know what they're talking about :)

How I intended to use speakers: 
Usually when listening to music with my setup, I'm usually around 5-10 feet away. 

Current setup:
Receiver: Pioneer SX-50
Turntable: Sony PS-LX300USB
CD Player: Magnavox CDB502
Cassette Deck: Kenwood KX-W8030
Speakers: Philips FWB-MCM760 
(Only one speaker works; issue is not the receiver as it has been recently serviced.) 

Also: someone gifted me a 7.2 channel AV receiver (Sony STR-DH770) thinking it would help my situation, but I truly have no idea what I am supposed to do with this machine. Just figured I'd mention that I own it in addition to the things listed above, just in case. 

What material I'm using this for:
Music. I need something that can handle the serious bass of Electric Wizard and Vince Staples, but I also listen to a lot of stuff that has crisp vocals and softer, subtle sounds. 

New/Used:
Either one is fine with me!

I'm pretty blunt with him on telling him how I'm feeling and so far he's been more receptive and reactive to those convos than any other guy I've dated. I'm fine with there being some problems as long as we're both cool with talking them out.

If he came to me today and said that he'd decided he was ready to be exclusive and official, I'm not sure that I feel sold on him enough for that yet. We've talked about how we don't just want to have another bf or gf that is good for a couple years but ultimately not the right person. We'd ideally like to marry our next significant other. So I'm fine with working through some bumps now during early days and taking a few months to figure out if this is something I want to commit to. Plus, he's going to be on a shitty work schedule for the next 2 months, so seeing how he does in those circumstances is important to me since he has a job that is always going to have shitty scheduling. Doesn't mean we're on the prowl for something better but it takes time to get to know someone. Sure, if I met someone who I thought was a better fit for me (or he did) I'd want us to pursue that now instead of feeling like we jumped into a relationship we weren't 100&amp;#37; sure about.

"DallasStars","t5_2ro4p","Im not going to pretend to be a scholar on Anton Khudobin but how is he so much worse? Just going on career and last season they're almost identical. Except for the playoffs, cause, well, reasons. 

Anton: https://www.nhl.com/player/anton-khudobin-8471418

Kari: https://www.nhl.com/player/kari-lehtonen-8470140

Now what that doesn't show is how many soft goals Anton let in at key times nor how many pressure situations he's completely and utterly failed in. I can only go with the stats provided by nhl.com and by being a Stars fan for all of all 25 years of existence including all of Kari's tenure here. I like Kari, but there's a time to cut ties with fan favorites. I loved Robidas, have his jersey in the closet next to Jere, but I understood why he was allowed to go. Love Otter, but I understand. We can't keep a goalie who can't be relied upon in key situations. Maybe Anton can't either, but I'll take the chance that he might fail vs the certainty that Kari will.

So if the team had said let Ricciardo get the tow. That would basically be favoritism towards Ricciardo. Since it was Verstappens turn to have this tow.

If Verstappen's time was already extremely good and Ricciardo was a lot slower, you could make this argument. But that wasn't case.

- Easier to get up and go somewhere, without bundling up with shoes and socks, and layers or clothing

- people have more energy/wanna get up and exercise. Even if you don't intend to exercise, its easier to go for a walk on a nice sunny day with a clear sky than a chilling cold day with snow slosh on the pavement and the sky half dark.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","&gt;We’re living through a massive artificial famine, right now. In NW Yemen, home of the Yemeni Shia who’ve fought off a Saudi-financed invasion, the “coalition” of invaders has settled on a slower, more effective strategy: artificial famine and blockade. This is how you kill off a troublesome population, not with bombs and guns alone. Hunger and disease are much better mass killers than firearms and bombs.

&gt;NW Yemen has been blockaded for years now. And the Saudi strategy is working well. Yemen has had up to amillion cases of cholera, an illness unheard of in countries with modern antibiotics. Untreated cholera is fatal in about half of all cases (versus 1% when normal treatment is available). Since medical supplies are being blockaded (with the help of the US Navy), and few journalists have made much effort to find out what has been going on in the blockaded areas, we may be dealing with an unreported death toll of half a million people, most of them children.

&gt;Yemen is a perfect target for artificial famine and blockade, because it never had enough farmland to feed its people. Before the Saudi invasion, Yemen imported almost 90% of its food supplies. When the Saudis imposed their blockade, cutting off all food imports to Hodeidah, the one Red-Sea port serving NW Yemen, those imports stopped. There has never been any alternative route for food supplies to Yemen. Even before the war, road traffic between Saudi and Yemenwas all but shut down. (Which is why, in a year spent a few miles from the Yemen border, I went up to the border many times, looked over it, but never gave a thought to crossing it. It would never have been allowed.)

&gt;So NW Yemen is closed off very nicely, from the Saudi view. Which is also the view of the US, UK, UAE, Israel, Kuwait, and the oil companies — basically, anyone who matters in this world. Shia Yemenis are dying at a very satisfactory rate, children first (because children are always the first to die in long sieges like this).

&gt;The next step for the Saudi-led “coalition” will be taking Hodeidah, the Shia provinces’ one source of food and medical aid. That operation is well underway as I write.",1530403607

Sorry you are having to go through this.  As for your visit/inspection from DHS. Keep in mind that they are Hyper vigilant about everything and they will not look at it the way you, as a parent, looks at the situation.


Anytime you find yourself saying or thinking:
&gt; that the girls know they aren't supposed to go into

you need to understand that DHS is going to see this or the situation as a fault. For best results you should take the time to put all sharps into a child proof drawer (or cabinet) and put all medications behind locked doors.  Sadly kids often know better than to get into things they should not and they will climb, crawl etc to get at what they think they need or want, it is the nature of kids.

I know you are an awesome mom and I know you keep an eye on your kids, but DHS will always think the worst of any situation.

Best wishes and keep up the AWESOME work!

Its and integral part of the vanilla, that affects and intercourse with all other systems. and they facilitate each other and acts as one integral gaming (eco)system.

And overall factions tension atmosphere is just one of the things. there are too many things, from leveling, to fighting for resources and farm areas (which is a huge part and application of wpvp, not a stupid ganks for nothing), guilds competitions, world dragons, silithus, and many other things. social applications, gameplay, atmosphere, activity, friendships, guilds, how accesible is some resources, how valueble it feels achieving some things and items, raising significance of many different things and so on. there are too many to describe precisely and mention. it affects sooo much for pve, pvp, everything. how much it value and what it means. 

if you think wpvp is just ganking and faction tension, and thats the reason why ppl play on pvp servers, you are wrong. ""they like to be ganked, thats why ppl play on a pvp servers"". kappa.. ""btw i understand factions tension is great."":)

well, most ppl that play on pve servers, dont understand the broader role of wpvp. thats freaking why, they play there. cos they are clueless. if they understood it, most of them wouldnt play or think about playing there, instantly. they all arrogantly think, its all just about ganks. and playing on a pve server you just avoid this stupid annoying element of the game, and it doesnt affect anything else at all... sad.

That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the systematic exclusion of oppressed people of color from the trade union/socialist movement. 

&gt;examples of opposition to racism.

Doing one thing doesn't excuse another.

&gt;The bit that ""he saw Communists as enemies"" is exaggerated as well.

It isn't exaggerated. I was talking about his opposition to Bolshevism. As a poster from r/socialism said a year ago, ""To attempt to portray Debs as pro-Bolshevik as a constant throughout the time period is disingenuous at best.""

Some examples of the lack of solidarity in the socialist movement:

&gt;At his death, Eugene Debs, leading figure of the
Euro-Amerikan Socialist Party, hailed Watson as a true
hero of the white workers: ""He was a great man, a heroic soul who fought the
power of evil his whole life long in the interests of the common
people, and they loved him and honored him.""

The same Thomas Watson who said, ""Lynch law is a good sign: it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people.""?

Additionally, ""Both the Socialist Party of
Eugene Debs and the A.F.L. unions helped lead the anti Asian
campaign among the settler masses.""

&gt;In April 1903,
one thousand Japanese and Mexicano sugar beet workers
struck near Oxnard, California. They formed the Sugar
Beet &amp; Farm Laborers Union, and wrote the A.F.L. asking
for a union charter of affiliation.
A.F.L. President Samual Gompers, in his usual
treacherous style, tried in his reply to split the ranks of the
oppressed: ""Your union must guarantee that it will under
no circumstances accept membership of any Chinese or
Japanese.""


To pretend that American socialism isn't a part of the larger American settler (white supremacist) society is to commit a grave miscalculation.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to have a dog that we found on the side of the road named Buster. He was so ugly he was adorable. He was a mutt, a mix between a chihuahua and pekinese (we think) and he had the weirdest tendencies. He wouldn't eat eggs but he would devour a sliced apple. He understood what it meant when you flipped him off. Like if you used any other finger he was fine but if you used your middle finger he would growl and get pissed. We had a little bush out back and he would sit there for half an hour at times and wait. Eventually he would dive into the bush and come out with a bird in his mouth!

 He was also known for randomly bolting when we let him out to pee. Sometimes he was gone for a day or 2 but he would always come back. One day he led a golden retriever back to our house. Turns out it was our neighbors dog from down the street. This little pimp was half the size of this golden so in order to smash she would lay down for him so he could do his business. Eventually the neighbor told us that our dog needed to leave her dog alone and stay out of her yard. We said the same to her and we never saw her dog again.

Probably the smartest thing I've ever seen this dog do is one day when he ran away I was out driving around and saw him on the side of the road. I called his name and demanded he come to me. He instead approached the road, looked both ways to make sure there was no traffic, waited for one car to pass and then bolted across! He knew I was going to scold him and he knew how the roadways worked. I loved that dog and I miss him very much.",1530403613

I knew this guy in high school who I considered to kind of be a man slut. He was known for jumping from girl to girl and sleeping around... He sang the song Peaches by Presidents of the United States of America to me in one of our maths classes in high school. (In high school I was so sheltered I had no idea what the song was about.) 
Somehow after graduation we reconnected and he asked me on a date. He told me how he had a crush on me in school but I was so out of his league that he never asked. He said he felt so bad I didn’t go to prom, he wanted to ask but thought several people had. (No one asked me to prom.) I was in no way popular, he was. We were both Varsity athletes but that’s about all we had in common. Anyway...
We went surfing together for our first date. It was 50 degrees out, the water was 47degrees. He let me wear his wetsuit. Told me to pee in it. I didn’t believe him... It was hilarious. 
We went back to his grandparents’ house afterwards and I met his grandparents. They told me he had been talking about me for years... It was a great first date. No awkward silence, lots of joking and flirting. I learned what Yoohoo milk was. (This for some reason is the second most memorable thing about the date.) Great time was had by all. 
He was a firefighter at the time, and was on call, so he got dressed and we went to the fire station... Where he raped me in his bunk room. 
Lost my virginity that way. While on my period... lol wicked good. It was awful.

This magnetism ability with the leaves must be the most bizarre thing the show has thrown at me, and that's really saying a lot. It's taking me some time to really warm up to this series' complete apathy towards suspension of disbelief, but I'm getting there. It's starting to get impressive.

I didn't really get attached to Poco at all through these two episodes, so while his big decision to fight back overall worked well, I didn't really feel a lot for him. Just before it happened I was starting to think about how I don't really care for the kid at all. 

Bruford's end was a pretty good moment of grounded emotional weight - something that's tough to make work so close to magnetically holding on to a glider made of leaves - and it gives me the impression that even the minor villains will have a bit of depth to make them interesting. Unfortunately, Tarkus is a bit more bland in comparison, but at least he affords us the chance to get in a good sacrifice play. Unfortunately it seems that Zeppeli isn't long for this world, but we'll see tomorrow if that's just a red herring or not.

The biggest he does though is 2000 pieces because his brain can’t cope with more than that.  Il not even sure thats the correct way to put it though. It’s something about the way he does them and how he registers them in his mind eye. 

Anyway hes 28 now and there’s a specific store room at home where his jigsaws are kept after completion because there’s so many of them.  Some of them are truly beautiful pieces of work and as each one is finished, he can do one aceeek if he’s on a roll,  it’s framed in readiness to go on the wall and I change which ones are on the wall every 6 months. In fact my sons jigsaws are in many homes across the world because people who come to visit us always go home with a couple. My grandchildren   as well as other children in the familiy have ones done especially for them. 

Its funny this subject has come up today because my daughters will be around this morning to help me put up some new ones because it’s that time of year again. Im really looking forward to it. 

We’ve had some very happy times with my son as a result of his jigsaws as have others. When my husband lived with us he had a room at home where he held business meetings and on the walls were jigsaws businessmen from all over the world had brought for my son. Anyway there was one wall that was kept for a jigsaw specific to the country a person was coming from that day so for eg there was a masterpiece of the Eiffel Tower for when the French came. It was beautiful and actually in the shape of the Eiffel Tower with French things like a bakery or the moulin rouge built in to it. People used to love coming in to see what was on the wall.

Spice has no bearing on my decision outside of what I'm in the mood for at the time. Sometimes I want something as hot as I can get, others I'm happy to eat a korma.

In university, my roommate had big boobs herself and she knew I was super curious about them and I must say that she let me indulge in lots of jiggling, groping, bouncing, and silly things when I didn't have boobs myself. I was always super envious of her rack and I wished I had such shape.

I've gotten over 850mbps of transfer speed out of one of these in the real world. As an  FYI I  flashed to Merlin. The version of the firmware linked to on this video worked well for me. The first time I did anything it took ~2 hours. I bought another one for a friend and it took ~25 minutes the second time. Newer Merlin firmware (which you cannot go back on) was less stable than the firmware linked in here.

The latest Tmobile version of the firmware might work as well BUT I skipped it as I so no value in trying. The stock TM firmware only did media bridging on 2GHz wireless-N.

"BPD","t5_2qqdp","I have a best friend like you, she's bipolar.  Our friendship is based on honesty 100&amp;#37; because we are each others keepers.  If I am too in my disorder to see something, she tells me and if she's too in her bipolar or any of her other issues to see something I am there to tell her.  That, to me, is so important, to have that person as someone with a personality disorder who will honestly give you advice, call you on your shit, tell you when you're wrong and go to bat for you when you're right.  I can not tell you the horrible shit she has probably saved me from doing over the years, and all the ways she has helped me, because I'd have to write a Gone with the Wind sized novel to get it all in, and even then could still write Scarlett and Rhett Butler's People with the shit I couldn't fit in the first book.  

So I just wanted to take a second to thank you, and all the people like you who love those of us who have Borderline Personality Disorder and are committed to helping us and telling us the truth and being real, honest to God friends to us.  That kind of friendship is hard to find, because it is easier to be a yes man and not give a shit about someones relationship, life or personality disorder and just agree with everything they say.  That has somehow become the norm for friendships, the ""That's my BESTIE and she's always gonna be right even when she's wrong"" mentality.  Of course you should stick together and have your friends back, but when a person is wrong they're wrong and you have to acknowledge that, especially when your friend has mental health issues.  It's hard to find that person who can and will be that for you, so I am very happy to see that your friend not only has you but that you're here in the BPD reddit, giving advice to others with BPD, learning about her disorder and how to not only help her but others with BPD as well.  That's fuckin' epic on the real friend scale, and shows how much you truly care.  As people with BPD we're always afraid of people leaving us, and fake friendships do nothing to help disavow us of that notion, so people like you help, having a friend that's in it for the long haul with you helps.  

So shout out to you TyNicole12, cause you're the real MVP here!!!",1530403625

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The sociologist Parsons did a research study and found that many black families were lone parent female led.

He says that this ideology and ""tradition"" has passed itself down through the generations to today. 

As a result of a fatherless household, young black boys often seek a father figure in gangs who often encourage them to commit gang related crimes

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","The social status of Japanese people has completely recovered and identity based insults just don't do anything today.  Saying ""haha you are japanese"" will probably result in a shrug.  


Saying ""haha you are black"" will cause a shit storm.  Because despite (or perhaps because of) decades of affirmative action, diversity training, hiring quotas, and media bias, being black is still an inferior social status.  Look how many labels they've burned through: negro, colored people, black, afro-american.  It's only a matter of time before ""PoC"" is perceived as an insult because they haven't done the work to change the underlying social status of the group they're labeling.  


The crazy left thinks that changing words will change the world.  But of course all it does is confuse people a bit before new words are decided on to describe the same old things.  They fundamentally don't understand this and constantly get caught out by it.  That's they get so flustered when their self-applied labels like SJW or snowflake or LGPTQAAIP+ turn into insults - they just don't understand that a proper insult isn't just name calling, it's calling someone what they actually are.  


It's also why they can't get a proper foothold on the label ""alt-right"" and are destroying the power of the word ""nazi"", they can't resist trying to change what people are by hurling these labels at them, rather than finding the people who actually fit that label and calling them out.

I like that anyone who feels like they didn't give enough warning or cheated out of their money get told to direct their complaints at valve, as Valve is responsible for their own choice in how to handle this.  
But it's obvious that Valve prefers to pretend everything it the fault of the government and hopes to direct all angry consumers who suddenly couldn't cash out their gambling gains at the official authorities instead.   

The Gaming Authority also specify (badly translated by google) that if a price is obtained by chance it's considered gambling.  
If the price has value and can be traded it's definitely gambling.  
They also warn against lootboxes in general, even if the prices can't be traded, as they all contain game elements that can lead to gambling addiction.

**TL;DR:**

There is an island nation called ""The Arrowhead"", which got its name by the form the island has (an arrowhead, duh). It is surrounded by a massive, magically reinforced wall, which is so high that the elves that rule over the nation needed to create an artificial sun so it wouldn't be dark for 18 hours a day. 

The elves mind-control the unintelligent, but physically strong Urg for slave-labour and as infantry. Dwarves that don't obey get family members taken away, killed, raised from the dead as silent observers who report anything noteworthy back to their elven masters. The fear of losing a loved one is enough for most dwarves to obey, the silent observers take care of the rest.

**Backstory:** 

Around 800 years ago, after the humans first settled on the continent of Lucia right to the east of the Arrowhead, the elves and Lucians were forced into an all-out war based on misunderstandings and internal affairs. At that time the elves were living rather secluded from the other two races that inhibited the Arrowhead, namely the Zwaagi (meaning ""The First Ones"" in the dwarven language, the bigger one of the two existing dwarven tribes) and the Urg, a nomadic and unintelligent race of ""giants"" (2,30-2,50 meters average height) with black, brown or red skin and a natural bone armor that spent their days mating and going to war with other tribes.

As the elves were about to lose the war they made a pact with the Zwaagi and the Urg, and combined the brute strength of the Urg, the technical know-how of the Zwaagi and the magic power of the elves to force the Lucians to retreat entirely. After that they immediately started to build the wall. Lucia and the Arrowhead are in a ceasefire since then.

**Back to topic:**

The elves, being one of the most arrogant races out there, started treating their ""allies"" as underlings. The elves started to enslave the Urg, who are extremely vulnerable against mind-altering magic and were not able to resist in any way, and pressured the Zwaagi into submission, who were severely outnumbered in pure combat strength. They had no other choice than to live by the laws the elves put up if they wanted to survive. Over the past 800 years the elves expanded their territory by taking over the entire Zwaagi city. They use the Urg for physical labour, harvesting new Urg-slaves from the tribes when the need arrives. Every other kind of work is done by the Zwaagi, who have no other choice. The elves kidnap family members of disobeying Zwaagi, kill them and re-raise them as observers, whose only function is to report any kind of misbehaviour to their elven masters. The fear of losing a family member and being constantly observed is the only thing the elves need to force their will on the Zwaagi. ",1530403633

You basically just dip the wire in solder and the overcoat instantly melts away.  It's very easy to work with because the coating melts at ~150C, far below soldering temperatures.

If you have non-solderable enameled wire, try the following using sandpaper to sand off the insulation.  When you've done that as best as you can, try maxing out the temperature on the soldering iron - even if you have already sanded off the coating, some might still be left.  Even high temperature insulation is rarely rated over 250C.

This is because the degree of heat is higher than your body wants to feel naturally and sweating is a method that your body uses to cool back down.

1. Yea svens flash was bad, but thats kinda negligible.   It sucks and was a contributing factor, but he should have been ganking top...  

2. The blue buff is just nitpicking, it means almost nothing, not even his fault.  Sucks that jensen didnt get it, but overall it didnt matter.

---

We should have either had sven focus top with pressure or ganks, OR take ornn over rene, except the loss in top lane like we played, than played for the long range emgage which would have given us a win regardless...

Overall, I would bet that sven adjusted hianpathing bot, because bot was likely communicating about how good they are doing bot, where as top was even untill a gank happens...

To me I wouldnt say sven was necessarily to blame.  To me I say that rene top was a bad idea, either jax or ornn would have been better, you know your bot os gonna pressure hard and win, and you know that rene gets outscaled.  Aatrox got a free kill on sven, and the rene into hauntzer was just disrespectful.    With an ornn the lackmof pressure top wouldnt have mattered in the late game teamfights, and with jax the comp makes better sense...

Sven didnt play perfectly, but niether did smoothie, gg, jensen or licorice.  The team played overall pretty well, aside from a few pathing and mechanical mistakes (easy fixes), the draft was almost overconfident and the team lost as a unit.  Blaming sven is not the path.

Cannon has one of the hardest set of characters right now.

There are of course exceptions, like Azoth with his really really flashy skully sigs in both Bow and Axe, but those are harder in general for beginners... That is, if he uses light attacks at all.


Or, you can force him to learn a bit by taking a harder characters so he can't really spam, but it depends on his nature. In that case, I'd go with Koji.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Maryland voter here! Was proud to do my part in voting for Senator Cardin, but the more significant race was Rushern Baker losing to Ben Jealous, something not good for us at /r/neoliberal and should be taken as maybe a sign of worry. Quick insights. 

What was the race?

This was the primary for Maryland Governor, a spot currently being held by Republican Larry Hogan. Hogan is very popular due to his not taking sides on most significant issues, such as his refusal to support or actively oppose Trump. 

The Democratic side appeared to be a two way race. The first candidate was Rushern Baker, the former County Executive of Prince George's County. PG County is the second largest county in Maryland, and is 64.6% African American, 18.5% Hispanic, and 17.2% White. His main opponent was Ben Jealous, former head of the NAACP, and an avid supporter of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election.

What was the outcome of the race, and how will it play out for November?

Ben Jealous secured an a 10 point win over Baker, going 40%-30% in favor of Jealous, with no other candidate reaching more than 10% of the vote. Though Maryland is solidly blue, voters have been attracted to Hogan, someone they see as a nonpartisan figure, whereas Jealous has attempted to garner support from the left with policies such as Marijuana legalization, free college and $15 minimum wage.

My two cents-

Baker, while certainly the candidate that alligned best with the politics of /r/neoliberal, also was the candidate most likely to win. Baker had the support of former Governor Martin O'Malley, Senator Chris Van  Hollen, and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, also making him the choice of the Democratic establishment. Jealous has never held office before, and is seen as someone who is inexperienced, idealistic, and a divisive partisan. In today's tense political climate at the national level, Marylanders have taken pride in the more relaxed state politics. This should be a fairly easy re-election for Hogan, as the Democrats will likely not put too many resources into this race that they will likely give up on early, especially considering the lack of enthusiastic support from the Maryland establishment. Northern Maryland will refocus towards Pennsylvania, hoping to strengthen Bob Casey's standing among voters in the south of the state, and try to make house races more competitive, like Conor Lamb's was earlier this year. People in the DC suburbs will head to the other side of the beltway and do get out the vote in Alexandria and Fairfax for Tim Kaine and opposition to Barbara Comstock, in similar fashion to the efforts that led to Ralph Northam's 9 point victory in the Virginia Gubernatorial Election in November 2017.",1530403641

A common way that ""gay guys"" get attracted to women is emotionally. Then eventually, if they stick with it long enough, the girl teaches them how to be physically attracted to her as well.

But if you already have attraction to guys you'll keep it forever, and eventually just end up bi.

No matter the culture, no matter the application, no matter the context, no matter the level of technology, it is and will always be bad. It will always involve violence, censorship, and oppression. 

Communism is a philosophy which is in it's pure consideration completely non-violent, non-oppressive, anti-censorship, etc. At a certain international political point it occurred in a number of unstable countries at a certain point in technological development tied to certain cultures and things turned out very poorly, sure, but this doesnt mean that supporters of it at all support those poor happenings in those countries.

The biggest bit of idiocy from the ""communists evil"" talking point is that something like an economic system is *completely* dependent on technology and societal stucture - which are constantly developing and changing in new and unexpected ways. Sure, maybe you could make the case that communism couldn't work with current levels of technology - but who's to say the same in 100 years? 500? 1,000?

Because, really, communism *has* worked for certain social stuctures and technological development levels. Mainly, a great deal of nomadic, early agricultural, or hunter/gatherer societies.

If you are actively attempting to uphold an unjustified status quo that enriches the few at the expense of the many, you are a right-winger. *You* are a right-winger. It matters little what your parents did.

"dune","t5_2rff0"," I think he studied Machiavelli's and Plato's works with unusual care. I'm puzzled as to what could have been his sources, if any, in the secondary literature for Plato, but regarding Plato's own works, I would expect to learn that Herbert's personal library included well-thumbed copies of Plato's *Philebus*, *Republic*, *Theaetetus*, *Sophist*, and *Statesman*, at least. Regarding Machiavelli, I would expect to learn that he had well-thumbed copies of *The Prince*,  the *Discourses on Livy*, and *Thoughts on Machiavelli*, at least. *Machiavelli's New Modes and Orders* wasn't published until the 1970s, and thus, until after *Dune* was published, but I would expect Herbert to have bought a copy. Herbert was greatly interested in protected, privileged communication, in conspiracy, and in concealment of one's design even over many generations, so besides *Thoughts on Machiavelli* and *Machiavelli's New Modes and Orders*, I would expect to learn that his library contained a copy of *Persecution and the Art of Writing*.

By the way, I know that by a happy coincidence, there actually are sand dunes on the coast of Oregon, and it may even be true that Herbert intended to write an article about those dunes. But when he said that his interest in those dunes was the germ of his Dune series, and when in writing for a national audience, he took care to say that the dunes are in *Florence*, Oregon, I suspect he was secretly high-fiving his fellow students of Machiavelli.

And some years ago, I discovered that after the University of Chicago Press ceased publication of *Thoughts on Machiavelli*, the University of Washington Press, associated with Frank Herbert's school, took up its publication in 1969. I have no proof beyond the coincidence itself and my pre-existing opinion that Herbert studied *Thoughts on Machiavelli*, but I think Herbert met with friends or readers at the UW Press and said, ""This is important, and I hope you'll keep it in print.""

Copyright on the photos and the writing are automatic, and will extend past their lifetimes.  

&gt;**The law automatically gives federal copyright protection to works that were created but neither published nor registered before January 1, 1978.** The duration of copyright in these works is generally computed the same way as for works created on or after January 1, 1978: **life plus 70 years or 95 or 120 years, depending on the nature of authorship.** However, all works in this category are guaranteed at least 25 years of statutory protection. The law specifies that in no case would copyright in a work in this category have expired before December 31, 2002. In addition, if a work in this category was published before that date, the term extends another 45 years, through the end of 2047.


(Source: https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf, ephasis added.)  

If you really want, you can submit it to the US Copyright office, which might not be too bad an idea since you want to put the pictures out to share for others to use.  (I'm not sure how much that costs.)  

To know how to notate them in a book, pick up a book similar to what you want to do and see how they do it.  If one person owns all the copyrights you may be able to just say so on the publishing information page at the front of the book.

As for sharing the photos online, AFAIK, each upload should have CC licensing information with it, or that covers the entire site you use.  You probably want the [CC BY-NC-ND license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), unless you want to allow museums, etc. to alter them as needed for their uses (such as cropping, adding filters or text), in which case it'd be the BY-NC-SA.

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","It's such a shame for MMO's, too... The genre has so much potential to be so much more than just grinding simulators, but every mmo developer just seems to want to copy the WoW style of gameplay but with different classes and often slightly more engaging combat... (see TES:Online and Guild Wars 2 as great examples if this. While they are both fun in their own right, mostly because of the way they handle the shortcomings of the classical WoW MMO, they still have the same core gameplay of WoW: get quests, go to quest location, kill shit and do  other quest activities, level up and get more powerfull, rinse and repeat until you are powerfull enough to do the ""raid content"") 

I would love to see an mmo WITHOUT a character level mechanic but it will never happen because that has been tied to the genre itself so intrinsically even though it doesn't have to be. It's the same with RPGs. Nowadays, when you see a game that's tagged as an RPG, it's not about being able to control a character in a new world, and to experience that world through the eyes of said character, the definition of an RPG. No, it's about having a levelling system and skills you need to upgrade. These genre tags nowdays are used to describe an archetype WITHIN THAT genre, most often the most succesful. ",1530403646

Aiming in BF4 for me seems similar to PUBG, only a bit faster because the frames are stable and you get into firefights more often. You can try to play it like a BR game. Try to stay alive as long as possible,go aggressive and try to kill everyone you see, but don't just run through the open, always try to find some cover like in PUBG. Its a good practice for your aim and especially switching from one enemy to another really quick improves a lot. I always try to play one or two rounds of BF4 before getting into PUBG because I think it helps a lot to not just play the same game everyday over and over again. Another game that helps me a lot since a few weeks is CS:GO. Just try out to play similar but different games, I bet it will make you better.

&gt; The only thing that comes even close to what Miner does is Goblin Barrel, and that's more of a quick damage dealer than a chippy tank, and it can be easily countered with spells.

This is true. But then again, ask yourself ""Do really 40% of the decks need a minitank that can be placed anywhere on the arena?"". Cards like Ice Golem, Ice Spirit, who were unique and appeared in 40% of the decks, eventually were nerfed. And thanks god, right now they are in the 2.6 hog deck despite the nerfs.

Her fighting style is not compatible with that of a healer’s, anyway. And so far she’d always taken the initiative and been the one to deal the finishing blow/take enemies head on during battles.

"dvdcollection","t5_2sm9e","You're asking on a subreddit called ""dvd collection"", so its safe to say you'll pretty much only hear people saying to collect dvds.

Its easy to get a little... manic with collecting and buying up a bunch of a movies you'll never watch. Hell its easy to do that even when you are getting them for free.

Here's my advice:

Buy the movies that mean a lot to you for now, like a movie or two a week at most, but do research on [http://www.blu-ray.com/](http://www.blu-ray.com/) and other sites to figure out the best version. Only buy movies that you know you'll rewatch again and again, especially avoid pricey new releases that will drop to half their release price in a few weeks (except when its a movie so good you'll watch it over and over), and don't be too proud to buy used. Or, you know, do whatever the hell you want to do with your money, to each their own.

As far as digital, there's nothing wrong with it really. Both types of media are vulnerable to being lost forever for different reasons. I had a rather large collection of digital media that I lost a while ago due to my own poor backup practices, which plays a big part in my preference for physical now. I like having easy access to my favorite movies without having to worry about whatever streaming service losing licensing, my ISP acting up or deciding to implement data caps or speed restrictions (rip net neutrality), and I **love** extras like behind the scenes docs and commentary tracks. That being said physical media takes up a lot of space, and being 17 theres a good chance theres a lot of moving around and less than predictable living situations in your future which could make a bulky dvd collection a problem.",1530403652

Or sell your stock, pay the estimated taxes next time you do taxes, and deposit cash in your M1 account.

"nrl","t5_2qn90","I've come around to begrudgingly accepting his presence in the game, purely because it's the only way he'll ever come close to being able to pay what he owed to his victims. It does still rankle with me that someone with a violent history like his is given the opportunity to play at the highest level and will still profit significantly from it, but from that pragmatic point of view it's the best way forward.

I did have a quiet chuckle at a couple of things in the article though:

&gt; Their public backing of the equal marriage rights movement was brave and timely.

I think even the most progressive individual would admit it's laying it on a bit thick to say the NRL were brave in taking a public position which every poll (and the eventual plebiscite) indicated an overwhelming majority of Australians supported. Commendable perhaps, but not particularly brave.

And:

&gt; Most comments in defence of Lodge demanded that he be given a second chance and that rugby league is a working class game built on second chances.

Think you'll find most of the working class would struggle to find employment with a record like Lodge's, and I think the men on the street would tend to lean towards believing in personal responsibility and accountability. Admittedly whether rugby league itself has (and whether it ought to have) a tendency to embrace these ""second chance"" stories is another question.",1530403653

So being poured into a gold-mold while wearing what look like Loofas from head to toe and having boobs shoved up and out so far you can't really reach your guitar is not selling sex?""   At least the Ga owns it, you know?   I know Ann and Nancy have expressed anger and embarrassment over those years but they still don't get to claim that they were always ""just about the music"".  It wasn't a stunt double emerging from the mold -  she voluntarily wore the outfit and did who knows how many takes.

*  24 cents go to Medicare/Medicaid.

*  18 cents go to the military.

*  7 cents go into paying interest on debt.

*  4 cents go into food and agriculture (including subsidies).

*  4 cents go into veterans' benefits - the VA, GI Bill, and others.

*  10 cents go into the remaining functions of the government (transportation, education, housing, international affairs, science, etc).

Carrying out a universal healthcare system would cost ($6,500 per person, given Canada's current healthcare cost or about two trillion dollars) an additional 73 cents per tax dollar.  Yes, you read that right, *73* cents - enough to encompass the entirety of social security, Medicare/Medicaid, and most of the military.

We literally don't have the money for grand social safety net projects.

EDIT:  Reflecting on this, I suppose one could probably eliminate Medicare/Medicaid under this scheme.  That'd still leave 49 cents unaccounted for, and a 50% tax hike to support the program.

I'm not sure Satoshi would care about ""not being taken seriously"" over an arbitrary number.  The only thing that mattered was the code.

I'd hazard 21 million was chosen because the Earth's population may be in the 21 billion region by the time the last bitcoin is minted in 2140 (a theory I've also just pulled out of thin air).

Find someone who wants to learn about your field and teach them about it. It will remind you of what it was like when you first got interested in it.

If you have major gaps in your English, they will create gaps in the new language as well - so if you see an explanation in English that you do not understand, ask and get clarification - don't just brush it off.  

Now, as both your native language and your new language are in the same linguistic family (Romance languages), there will be cases where an explanation in Portuguese will be a lot more straight forward than one in English - because the concept exists both in French and Portuguese but does not exist in English. I like having at least one grammar/beginner's textbook in a language different than English (in my native Bulgarian or in Russian in my case) just for cases like this. Other from that - using English is fine.

If you can link me to an article that says otherwise, I will certainly read it. 

Trump’s supporters are always so quick to deflect what is currently happening to anything to do with Obama. He is done serving as president, so bringing him up except when referencing something he did, or a specific policy of his, makes no fucking sense. Trump has done everything in his power to reverse Obama’s policies that he really cannot continue to blame anything on him. This current administration continues to avoid taking accountability for their decisions. Trump flip flops around ideas and viewpoints more than any president that I have witnessed, and it’s primarily based around public opinion and the response of the media, but Trump would never admit that because he thinks he knows more than everyone else.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

[Except when it fundamentally changes the hobby because now they're catering to normies](https://i.redd.it/swfu1m3tcvy01.jpg)

&gt;So you know nothing about women. No one in college, male or female, is ever thinking, ""Well, I could date someone I actually like...but this guy might make money after college!""

You have to be a fucking idiot if you don't think women are sizing up your future prospects at making money

&gt;If you want to have an incredibly limited perspective on things, and never find any common ground with other people.

You can literally ask reddit any question and get a ton of different responses, finding ""common ground with other people"" is completely unnecessary.

&gt;I'm white. And my nerd cred really can't be questioned. I've probably read more sci-fi than you've even heard of. Want to talk about video games, RPGs, board games, Star Trek, Star Wars, anime, building PC's...my friends and I were trading anime VHS tapes in high school and spending every weekend rolling dice.

And doing it where the normies couldn't see you because if they saw you, then you'd fucking get it.

&gt;Wow, could you be more wrong? Life doesn't hand most people much of anything. I've had to put myself out there to make friends and meet women. I've had to risk rejection and suffer heartbreak. I don't just flash a normie card and get whatever I want.

You flash your normie card and get easily let into the game, which means eventually you'll get what you want handed to you anyways.

&gt;Or I can discuss literature, film, art, science, history...because I am able to be interested in lots of things. And I can tie it all back to the nerd shit that I also love because I'm a well rounded person.

Oh please, I can do that shit too easy. She'll still go fuck Chad afterwards because none of that stuff is attractive, it's just cringe nerd shit.

&gt;Every single assumption you've made about me and the world at large is completely wrong. You might want to reevaluate this absolute knowledge you assume you have about everyone and everything.

For example here is SurvivalZ:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/799500/SurvivalZ/

Notice its graphics and gameplay look identical to another game called UNCROWDED:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m6XTfn34Bw


That's because they are both UnitZ, which is a ""starter kit"" you can purchase. You are meant to use it as a foundation to make your own games, but instead what people do is just buy it then resell it without any modifications or effort by themselves:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/unitz-26912


Here are two videos by Jim Sterling detailing many such examples. Some developers like Digital Homicide once released trailers for 13 games all at once, with them all being asset flips of the same game with only a 1 single slight model change in each one:

https://youtu.be/5svAoQ7D38k?t=4m20s 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6sZkl7STsk

The point in this is that we get developers that make these games regardless of whether anyone buys a single copy, and the main reason is because you can create these games in a matter of minutes thanks to the sheer laziness of people in their attempt to make a few pennies from someone else's work.",1530403663

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line!

Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, you don't want to have the 'Chain Reaction' node which is probably one of the primary reasons people opt for the ascendancy in the first place. This is because projectile traps only target enemies which trigger them. In other words, they do not auto target when they are triggered by the node or from the trap expiring. Instead, you will want a lot of trap trigger radius.

Then there is also pathing to consider. There are lots of wasted points trying to go from Shadow starting point towards Avatar of Fire. Xoph's amulet is pretty expensive. You're better off with Effigon anyway, which covers up all your accuracy needs.",1530403664

I think we badly needed those tax cuts considering the GST we are paying on everything where we never got proper income tax cuts they promised. IF you want people to take promotions with more hours, more responsibility, more stress and less time with family and friends you have to have a reward system that isn't chewed up all in tax.

Have you heard the phrase ""design lifetime"" before? 

&gt;I make the product as good as the customer is willing to pay     
 
No, you make stuff as good as *the company* is willing to spend on making it. The company plans a product's life cycle before they ever even ask you to engineer it. When they bring it to you they already have a price point and life expectancy in mind  that will ensure it lasts long enough so people aren't really pissed when it wears out and will come back and buy another, it's in the parameters that they give you for the project.    
I work in the auto industry, everything is designed for as rapid assembly as possible, ease of repair or replace is of no consideration at all, and they could make the engines last twice as long by adding a $50 pre-oiling pump into the oiling system, but that's not up for consideration either. They run a 100,000 trouble free because they have to warranty the catalytic converters and such for 80,000, trim items start breaking between the end of the bumper to bumper and when they're paid off, upholstery starts showing it's age then too.    
Everything is calculated at keeping most of the customers mostly content until trade in time, no more than that.     
I work on antique cars in my spare time, while they don't have today's bells and whistles for the most part, they do generally still have fully functioning seats and dashboard controls with still legible markings on them, and their engines can be repaired in a home garage with most of the engine and accessories easily accessed. That's why they're still operational after 50 years while the finish started coming off of the trim in my '07 when it was a couple years old.

"SamandTolki","t5_33ygd","This is the biggest reality check of the whole thing imo. I've lived in nice little ""all white"" suburban neighborhoods in the mid west, I've lived on a military base, out in the sticks, and right next to the ghetto. I've seen cops grouping up on a house with guns out before.. *in the ghetto.* But there are also drug houses and shootings that happen. A house with a meth lab exploded just a few blocks away and left a massive hole in the roof and the house wound up just being demolished. I've been pulled over before, at night, on my way home from work and had multiple cops surround my car with flashlights inspecting every inch if the car that they could see through the windows. This is a low income area a few blocks away from the ""wrong side of the tracks.""

I at least caught a glimpse of where boogie lives because of that video where he was out walking around in his house shoes. It looks like an upper class, nice neighborhood with pretty expensive homes in it, in Fayatteville Arkansas. And this was a *welfare check.* In an area like that they wouldn't even have had their guns drawn for a domestic disturbance because they heard people screaming. It's fucking stupid. (I can speak to this, I've been to a couple of places where the cops came because of screaming and fighting. They just stroll right the fuck up.)

In my eyes this is just a big lame white dude in a white area trying to make himself sound tough. What else is going on out there? Was there a gang hanging out right outside the Banana Republic? Was there a drive-by at the Whole Foods? Did he smell some devil's lettuce once?

Edit: Adding some credibility to my post. Here was the time a friend locked herself inside her house with a knife and gun, holding herself hostage and on a psychotic rampage. The toy gun is just to illustrate how the damage to the wall happened. [Pic 1](https://image.ibb.co/miMLUy/001.jpg). [Pic 2](https://image.ibb.co/gRtCbd/002.jpg).

The prevailing narrative out there is you have to man-up and date a 38-year old single woman, be a captain save-a-hoe, make her 'happy' and treat her like the queen she deserves to be treated, all because she's ""worth it"".

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Nice to see not only Ep2 but Ep3 tracks uploaded along with some of the trailer and cutscene tracks from PoF and S4. Also happy to hear that Lena's returned to compose some of the music for the episodes; the composers have done a fine job as usual with nice nuances in orchestration and thematic development. Hopefully this means we'll get a nice mix of works by Maclaine Diemer, Lena Chappelle, Brendon Williams, Wilbert Roget (and possibly Stan LePard if his schedule allows) with their respective styles mixing into the overall Tyrian symphonic tapestry. The Deepstone tracks in particular are very intriguing. :)

It's very interesting to me how Blish's theme works well with Taimi's theme as an almost echo or counterpoint of its motif, and I wonder if, in the future, we may hear their themes interwoven in a new track given the pair's close friendship and history together. What surprised me the most, however, was the lack of a variation of Joko's theme playing a prominent part in a notable encounter in Ep3, but I suppose they had their reasons for using the music they did in the episode.

Although it's great to see so many additional tracks appearing on ANet's SoundCloud (cutscene track representation was long overdue), I wonder if we'll get the rest of the PoF cutscene tracks (e.g. the moment with Vlast, the confrontation atop the mesa during the Departing, the end of the final battle, and the final scene with Kralkatorrik) as well as HoT cutscene tracks (and possibly trailer tracks) someday as well. Would also be fun to finally get officially acknowledged versions of missing tracks from GW2 vanilla OST such as the [""Purification"" theme](https://youtu.be/mYLZ90XU5lk) (whose official name we don't yet know) for completion's sake if such inclusions are possible in the future.",1530403671

"Ghostbc","t5_2wt3j","I’ve never heard of a religious band being successful outside of their religious audience. I’ve even heard of very talented Christian rock bands that play in religious concerts, however I doubt any of them sound Ghost. 
Ghost has its own style; Tobias Forge’s style. TF is extremely committed, dedicated and talented. 
In the last album TF wrote the melodies, lyrics and the parts of each instrument. He also played all the instruments in studio except for the drums.
In his lyrics, TF criticizes Christianity and religions in general, by showing what the mirror opposite of Christianity would look like. That’s why he writes about the the arrival of the anti-Christ or the 4th horse of the apocalypse bringing The Plague in the 1300s.
See, of course everyone knows Papa is not a real “satanic pope.” His “Black Mass” is a form of  criticism of liturgical rites. TF even has a song called “Monstrance Clock.” 
Imo, the whole point of Ghost is exaggeration and hyperbole and it serves its purpose as it invites us to observe certain aspects of religion that we probably haven’t thought about before. 
I personally love how he writes. I love to read the lyrics, put them in context and discuss every line with my husband who’s also a Ghost fan. The first Ghost song we listened to together was “He is” and I remember we spent more than a week talking about the lyrics. 

As a result of Tobias’ vision, Ghost’s form or art validates listeners and fans that see the hypocrisy in dogma in general. 

For me, TF’s work brings me a warm and fussy feeling of freedom and comfort. They are non judgmental and don’t go around threatening me with “eternal fire” or whatever. Seriously, if I really were to go to Hell because I (absolutely!) love “Year Zero” I’d think Hell is a very crowded place and God is kind of petty. If God’s out there and He(She?) is cool He listens to Ghost while tapping His Divine fingers and thinks Ghost’s music is catchy as Hell. Pun intended. 😉

Compared to Korea there was just more going on creatively - so I thought. 

The east coast of Taiwan is the bomb. If I went back to Taiwan I might go there. Hualian or Taitung... It's beautiful but not much going on.

Most cities have expat scenes and bars where you could play music. Not sure if that would be found on the east coast though. It's really nice but I never stayed long enough to find out if there are foreign bars in Hualian or Taitung.

Might be in Hualian, but Taitung I don't think so. There are some foreigners there though.

They're pretty small but really nice. I wouldn't go anywhere between Taipei or Koahsiung though on the west. Hsinchu, Miaoli, Chiayi... None of those places.

They might be alright for you, but for me I pretty much did all of Taiwan. The noise from scooters can get a bit overwhelming for me, so that's partly why I'd lean to the east coast or somewhere more mellow.

I'd probably do Taipei, Koahsiung or the east coast.

* Chick-fil-A chicken biscuits, or other food:  Students like food, and the chicken biscuits were a hit at my school.  Just check if there are rules about if/when food can be sold during school hours and sporting events.
* Dinner or a cookout:  My school's chorus did well with a pasta dinner and performed during the meal.  You could also do a cook out or a crawfish boil.
* Sponsor a thing:  If any of your fundraisers are to buy physical things or complete a project, you could offer some kind of recognition or incentive for a donation.  For example, if you're renovating an outdoor classroom, maybe $X gets the donor's name on a brick or placard.  Another example is my FIRST robotics team had donors ""adopt a tote"" during our 2015 season ([Recycle Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6UYFKNGHJ8)); donors paid the cost of totes for us to practice with, and they kept the totes at the end of the season.",1530403683

Side tsngent: I run a lot of conversion based campaigns, and ever since they merged power editor with the business manager it seems like any time I make a change to an ad set it completely resets itself. I'm not talking like audience changes either. The other week my client gave me some new video ads since they hadn't tried them for quite a while. I built out a seperate as set for them and had to make a budget adjustment to my already existing ad set so my total budget would stay the same. Threw my shit out of whack for like a week and a half. My cost per conversion doubled on my already existing ad set  and I only took out 500 bucks (spending around 20k  per month on that ad set).


Just keeps happening with the smallest changes it seems. I've been running this account for a little over a year now and these drastic shifts never happened until they merged the platforms.

Now that the war has happened, I will tell you that there are very specific circumstances around other people joining wars. Only a few will actually apply to you, but they'll all be flagged on the declare war screen (which, I will reiterate, you need to make sure you read tooltips, especially being new to the game): alliances, which usually only occur from marriage ties; and certain Casus Belli, which for you will probably only be Holy War. Outside of these it's almost impossible for others to join wars (there is an event that involves a friend joining in, but I can't remember the conditions for it, and it's rare)

46:10 The reason you're confused is because you're not thinking in the proper terms. Glamorgan will remain part of the Duchy of Cornwall, but it will not be inherited by your primary heir, Jon, but by Cador. Jon will inherit the Duchy of Cornwall and will still be the liege of Glamorgan. It is not passing outside your realm, there's a specific alert for that. (Figured out by Jon at 1:17:54)

Council discontent. This only happens in specific circumstances, either the ascension of a new liege, or if the liege commits tyranny.

57:30(ish) close. It was flagged last time, but for posterity I'll flag it again. The reason you can't change the ducal laws of Cornwall is because you haven't been Duke of Cornwall for 10 years. (1:09:01 He figured it out, all is well in this regard)

1:12:48 The ""vote"" with elective is constantly happening, that's why you can see the heir. When the current King dies, the person with the most votes will inherit. Other than that, you're correct on how it works.

1:17:54 You missed one step, because Glamorgan is a lower tier title, the succession law of the Duchy (being the highest level title you hold) takes precedence, that's why your second son will inherit Glamorgan.

EDIT: I forgot to address trade posts. They can only be made by Merchant Republics, or on the Silk Road. Those trade zones indicate where the republic has the majority of the trade posts. But as a feudal lord you don't need to worry or even care about them very much.",1530403687

Admins/Alphas will protect new players for a few days if needed. Slightly boosted server, but not that 100x crap you see out there. Turret damage is raised so it takes a bit more skill to attack bases. (Not just a dude and a shield). We may add a PvE server in the near future. We have a Facebook page and a Discord page. Boss battles provide a large amount of Element and Tek Structures. Tek is unlocked for everyone. 

Each drop color has custom items in it: 

White: Armor/Tools

Green: Kibble

Blue: Saddles

You look good (especially your traps and biceps), not being snarky. But Paulo Costa's arms are far, far bigger and he's far, far more full than you while being far, far leaner. And as a natty lifter, you must know about the whole diminishing returns thing. It's one thing to be able to train full time, but to be able to recover from it without PEDs? Not happening

Also, he is full-time training in a cardio-intense sport. That makes a huge difference (with the whole overtraining issue, particularly when natural)

I think Kayaba is an affably evil character. You can be a likeable person and still be nongood. And you can help people because you like them or find them interesting and still be evil. Most evil characters don't kick puppies 24/7 anyway (if they do at all). You don't have to act out of malice to be evil, he's simply a different kind of evil compared to people who PK out of sadistic joy.

All it takes is to figure out where you're at and do a little better every day. 

Meanwhile, tackle the insomnia. Some people find it easier to move time forward. Stay up as long as you can until you hit the proper sleeping hours. Then do things to make  yourself tired at night. You have to get up and out every day so that your body learns day is for doing things and night is for sleeping. And ask your doctor about a vitamin D supplement. 

Anorexia isn't a choice. Purging isn't a choice. People who have eating disorders will tell you it's horrible. You're trading one urge (eating) for another (not eating/throwing up). It'll damage your bones, teeth, and esophagus. It's a bad choice. ",1530403690

Classical players have learned how to reach these frets, with fewer frets clear of the body.    Anybody who plays bluegrass or country with a D-18 doesn't have a problem with the non-cutaway.   

With a non-cutaway, the body usually joins at the 14th fret.   This dates back to the 1930s when banjos were going out of style, and tenor banjo players were shifting to guitar.   They were used to having many more frets, and so guitar makers accommodated them by shifting from 12-fret necks to 14. ",1530403693

So you might run in a room of a ship guns blazing and just take everyone out (thought that's not always possible) or you might just shoot out a window and vent everyone in to space or you might hack a turret and let it do the work for you.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","First off, your post made my day; most things on this subreddit are depressing, and this is super cute and uplifting. Second, here are some things I did with my SO in my broke teenager days, and some things you and your gf might like: 

\-Go out for a chill walk down a trail or to a park and people watch on a bench- your GF could bring her camera, and you could bring a sketchpad.   

\-Wander aimlessly around a mall or store, but make a game out of it, like a scavenger hunt. One game I liked was ""Find the ugliest/weirdest item in the store and try to top it."", ""Truth or Dare"" was also lots of fun. It resulted in a lot of goofiness haha. 

\-Plan a movie night. Turn on Netflix, make a pillow fort, eat popcorn, etc. 

\-Pick up a board game or card game, maybe something new you could learn together 

\-Check town events for live music, fairs, or other free/ cheap community things

\-Pick a place to volunteer together; not sure if you like animals, but playing with puppies and kitties can be fun.

\-Make a scrapbook or photo album together (or, even just a random art project that includes doodles n' pictures) 

\-Sit in a coffee shop and just talk, like you would on a first date 

\-Take turns reading a book together 

\-Take a nap together. (Might not sound super fun, but trust me, it is)

The other day I had 4 or 5 people come in and tell me I was hacking, which was actually kind of cool, but after saying “no guys I’m not hacking. I just have good aim sometimes,” one guy said I was obviously hacking because I wasn’t just getting lucky over and over again, then they all left. It’s super hit or miss with everyone that stops by.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Slavery:

“Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭6:5-9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
http://bible.com/114/eph.6.5-9.nkjv

Reason why God didn’t outright condemn slavery was because back then, slavery was not just for prisoners of war, but also to people in debt. The Judicial system wasn’t nearly as put together as it is now, most of the time murders went unseen. Therefore, slavery was essentially prison, only not the dungeon oriented variation as we see it today. Let’s not forget, many Christians were enslaved by Romans before Rome became a Christian nation. In fact, the Bible has several more things to state about slavery.

Exodus 21:26-27 ESV 

“When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free because of his eye. If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.

People are likely to associate slavery with what occurred in the 1800s. This verse here was one of the many Abolitionists used to preach against the enslavement of black due to their horrendous treatment.

Murder:

I’m guessing you’re referring to in 1 Kings where Samuel told King Saul to wipe out all malachites, including the women and children. Now many people argue that God has that right since he gave us life, but to tell the truth I hated that chapter too. I hated all of the fatalities that occurred in the Old Testament, especially the one involving he Bears mauling the children who made fun of Elijah. However, God in OT was all about Fear, but the God in NT is the one associated with love. I’m not saying this justifies what he did in the past, however I can safely assure you that NT God is not the monster you saw in the OT.

Sacrifice:

Ok so he demanded the sacrifice of a goat unblemished, but this was not for his honor. The Goat’s blood signified purity due to its innocence. It was the original way one was to clean himself of the sins he committed. He was avidly against sacrifice outside of that regard, especially towards foreign nations who did it to their children to appease Gods.

As for Christ. it wasn’t a sacrifice for his ego but to ensure that anyone could redeem himself of her sins. Originally, only the Israelites could worship God for they were his chosen people, Christ came to ensure that anyone could follow God and not be condemned for sins unless they were to sacrifice another animal.

Raping a child:

Galatians 5:19-21 ESV

Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

I’m pretty sure raping a child would fall under sexual immorality, sensualities, and any other sins that may have brought up the rape. God is not for that at all. He offers spiritual healing to victims and condemns their oppressors to Hell unless they were to accept the punishment awaiting for them in trial and repent of all of the sins he committed. Mind you, life in prison usually awaits Child Rapists.

Favorites:

The “favorites” he picked were people who were commanded to dedicate their lives to God. You say favorites like he was treating them better, but in truth these people had it the hardest at times. First and foremost, these people preached doom and gloom. Most of the Prophets and Christ preached about the wrath of God striking down whichever city in Israel that had committed foul misdeeds in hopes that they would repent and return to God. A lot of times, these prophets performed interesting tasks. Ezekiel ate the bread off Dung to symbolize the uncleanliness of the Israelites, Hosea married a prostitute who kept cheating on him to represent the adultery of the tribes of Israel. (Adultery = worship of other Gods.) and Christ had to endure many tortures such as lashings, the crown of thorns, mockery, imprisonment, and of course crucifixion to wipe us free of our sins. What’s funny is when Jeremiah was commanded to be a prophet, he straight up told God, “Pick someone else, I don’t want to.” Sure blessings and prophecies were a boon, but he didn’t pick favorites because he liked one’s loyalty to him.

LGBT+:

Now for perhaps the most contraversial part of this whole thing. Now God will not condemn you for being attracted to the same sex. He will not condemn two people of the same sex sharing a home and adopting a child, but he does condemn intercourse between two people of the same sex. Reason for this because God created Sex for the purpose of glorifying him and producing children. When a man lies with another man, God views as lust and an obsession with one’s own desires. However with that being said, I and God do not condone how many popular churches persecute, demoralize, and even assault the LGBT. He called us to preach his word, but many like to demonize LGBT and that itself goes against how God wants us to preach.

“And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.”
‭‭II Timothy‬ ‭2:24-26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
http://bible.com/114/2ti.2.24-26.nkjv

A lot of preachers and followers of Christ are guilty of this. I do not hate the LGBT, Atheists, or anyone else who has taken to insulting me on this post. I apologize if anyone of us has said anything to harm you or a friend.  Remember, God himself condemns such vile treatment. Like you said, many good things have came from Christianity, this is what God strives for us to represent! Trust me, I can’t stand bad Christians either! 

This probably won’t change anything, I just want to ensure you’re informed. Remember, it’s not as Bleak as what many people make us out to be. If you’d like to continue this, DM me or hit us up at r/TrueChristianity.
