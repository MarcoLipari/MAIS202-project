Don‚Äôt get me wrong though. When I was with my ex he constantly commented on my lack of a butt and it got to me. When I went through his phone, I imagined that these girls he tried to hook up with had better butts and boobs than I did. That stung. A whole fucking lot.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Hot take but I think too many are focused on the wrong part of the spell book that wizards get. 

1) Wizard spells are fungible with currency. 
Yes a sorcerer can swap 1 spell for another spell, of the same level (or a different level up to 19 times) - A wizard can swap any spell in their list with enough coin. Some DMs being stingy with spell scrolls is a per table issue that is partially corrected by the spells learned mechanic. After playing a Cleric, Paladin, Bard and Wizard, I have always wanted more spells known or prepared. 

2) Wizards are the best ritual caster class. 
23 ritual spells that you can cast anytime you want without any spell slot used. Every other class needs to spend one of their limited spells known/prepared, or a feat to replicate this. You get it automatically. There‚Äôs no reason why a wizard couldn‚Äôt identify magical items, teleport you across the world or any other similar feat. Warlocks dedicate their whole subclass to be able to do that. 

Wizards are to spells what Bards are to skills. 
You don‚Äôt know all your spells like a Druid, Paladin, or Cleric but you come very close.  You aren‚Äôt as good at casting spells as a Sorcerer, but you can replicate some of that in specific schools. You don‚Äôt buff as good as Cleric, you don‚Äôt blast like a sorcerer, you can‚Äôt change the battlefield like a Druid, and you don‚Äôt mess either people‚Äôs minds like a Bard. But you can do some of that almost as good and still do well at the other roles. 
 
Casters are only as good as their spell list but wizards have the biggest and most diverse.",1575158401

"OCPoetry","t5_30xom","This took a few readthroughs to get an impression of the meaning, and it's still challenging to grasp (like a cat crouching beneath a bed). The diction is accessible; the syntax a puzzle. My gist is thus: since the qualia of [xyr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xyr) cat the speaker cannot word-ize, instead of writing a poem *about*, [xe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xe#English) writes a poem *on* the cat (""I quickly throw ink on it""). Roundaboutesquedly, in lamenting on how xe cannot write about xyr cat, the speaker nubs the cat's qualities: ""slip through my hands|in slippers of fur on the floor|like a door half-open""; ""slits of sight""; ""a few black spots""; ""the scrape of the neck"".

The poem is composed of semantic nonsequitors.

&gt;I cannot write about cats  
the words they slip through my hands  
in slippers of fur  
on the floor  
from a warm tail to the whiskers  
like a door half-open 

The first two lines make sense: the traits of the cat the speaker cannot put into words. The following lines communicate (sequentially): the zoomorphification of 'words' as wearing slippers; the slippers being on a floor; the slipping through the hands happening ""from the tail to the whiskers""; the slipping being like a door half-open. The last line gives a tangential image of a cat peering, partially obscured, through the crack of a door. There's a sense of fluffiness in the use of the words ""slip/slippers"", ""fur"", ""warm tail"", and ""whiskers"". The half-open door symbolizes only catching a glimpse of what it's like to be a cat.

The next two stanzas may function as a single grammatical marathonic run-on sentence:

&gt;what does a cat know  
that I wouldn‚Äôt reason  
that escapes  
my humanity  
and my poem  
more than its anatomy  
what does the world shine  
into those slits of sight  
&gt;  
&gt;but the cat‚Äôs shape beneath  
the blank page  
and I quickly throw ink on it  
the page-cat-shape  
and a few black spots remain  
behind  
caught by the scrape of the neck

The first lines up to ""poem"" reiterate the idea that the speaker cannot fathom the experience of being a cat. I see two valid parsings of ""more than its anatomy"": as applying to ""what does a cat know"", resulting in ""what does a cat know  \[...\] more than its own body"", ergo ""cats don't have self-awareness""; as applying to the escaping of ""my humanity and my poem"", resulting in ""the description of a cat escapes like its anatomy"", which brings to mind a cat's body twisting free of the clutch of some-one.

The next lines (""what does the world shine|into those slits of sight"") can be grammatically formulated as a parenthetical, interjectionary query - ""\[...\] more than its anatomy|(What does the word shine|into those slits of sight?)||but \[...\]"" - that re-reiterate the speaker's *shameful* ineptitude at first-person experiencing xyr cat. ""\[S\]lits of sight"" is musical description that matches the imagery of cats' vertically-slit eyes. It's possible slits of sight also refers to the speaker's eyes.

The next lines (""but the cat's shape beneath|the blank page"") can be parsed in two ways - both result in a similar meaning to to ""What does a cat know \[...\] more than its anatomy"": as included in the previous parenthetical query, i.e. ""(What does the world shine|into those slits of sight||but the cat's shape beneath|the blank page?)""; as answering the initial question ""what does a cat know"". If the ""slits of sight"" refers to the speaker's eyes, then the first parsing contains the additional meaning of ""the shape of a cat is in my vision beneath the page of this poem"". The inclusion of the word ""shape"" implies an incompleteness - it's not the cat that is in vision, but only its shape.

I imagine the next line being an independent clause delimited from the previous stanza with a semicolon: ""\[...\] the blank page; and I quickly throw ink on it \[...\]"". ""\[I\]t"", and the following ""page-cat-shape"", may refer to either the cat or the page: the speaker is either quickly ""throwing ink"" in a doomed attempt at transforming xyr cat into writing, or literally splashing xyr cat with ink.

The final three lines give different meanings depending on if the ink was thrown on the cat or page: if cat, imagery of ink splotting neck fur; if page, perhaps the cat's neck-scrape smudged off some wet ink (a bold-faced burglary!). There's suggested imagery of the cat naturally having a black-spotted coat, a cat's behind, and the edge of a page scraping something. ""\[C\]aught by the scrape of the neck"" is somehow musically and visually satisfying. It could imply that the speaker's attention has been caught by beckons for pets. The word ""behind"" interacts with the previous preposition, ""the cat's shape **beneath** the blank page"", implying imagery of the cat now (not) appearing behind the page, perhaps with some spotted fur jutting into view.

Long-a assonance profuse stanza three.

&gt;there it is  
behold  
my poetry on a cat 

""\[P\]oetry on a cat"" repeats the double entendre between ""about"" and ""on"": if ""on"" means ""about"", then the speaker is asking the reader to behold their poem; if ""on"" means literally ""written on the cat"", then the speaker is asking the reader to (be)hold their poetry-laden cat.

The trickily indirect way of trickling information behaves cat-likedly: semisensical impressionism; the phrasing of unphraseables. 

This may just be a personal stylistic preference, but I think this poem would look ""cleaner"" with more proper grammar: capitalized sentences and punctuation. I suppose it would match the prim demeanor of cats. The syntactical branching would still be preserved, as far as I know.

Overall, this is a whimsical poem that has straightforward diction and challenging syntax. It uses some creative techniques (non sequiturs, grammar tricks, implied imagery, double entendres) to embody the personality of a cat.

As a challenge: try to fit the form of the poem into the shape of a cat (at least, I don't think this is being attempting already).

As another challenge: fluff up some of the diction. The close repetition of ""slip"" and ""slippers"" seems lazy. Some of the descriptors are dry and a-thematic: ""shine"", ""remain"", ""warm"", ""my humanity"".

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","There could be some other variable instead of follows or subscriptions. Something like an upvote? Or provide the equivalent of ""cheers"" for users to give instead of requiring them to purchase and spend bits to do it.  Some kind of way of saying ""good job"" - even if the person's stream isn't something they want to tune into all the time. 

If someone clicks on my stream, thinks it is good.... but I'm not happening to provide the thing they want to \*follow\* - I won't get any positive feedback from that. And potential viewers will never know that person thought it was good. If they click away because they aren't into Darkest Dungeon, or just happened to get distracted by something... that looks exactly the same (to me and everyone else) as if they were clicking away because I was super boring or low quality. 

Any metric like that would inevitably be at risk of abuse or manipulation, of course - but the lack of a ""quality"" metric is probably at the core of being unable to differentiate between tons of new/small streamers.

I could also see benefit from a kind of new-streamer mentorship process. \[which, if it exists - please point me to it!\] A place where new streamers could broadcast to a limited viewership (like a discord group). People could interact with chat and provide feedback before the streamer goes completely live on twitch to the entire world. As a new streamer in the past month, I haven't found anything like that. There are fantastic resources, and helpful people - but I haven't found anything organized around providing a ""no-fail zone"" for people to get things figured out before going fully live.",1575158402

A lot of these trucks use up double spaces in this free parking lot, leaving a limited amount of parking for everyone else.

I guess I get it, it's your ""baby"" and you don't want something you spent thousands of dollars on to get scratched. But I can't afford to park at school everyday. Taking the bus doubles my already-long commute from 1 hour to 2 hours, one-way. Paying for parking at school is $7/hr and I'm there all day. I can't afford it either.

However, if you are charged not guilty doesn't that mean you are innocent?

I personally don't believe either. I want the case settled and facts and evidence to be brought forward. There are people out there that can lie extremely well, from both sides. Believing ""victims"" is the reason a 14 yr old African American (Emmet Till)  in the 50's was murdered. Granted, that was sexual assault. Not quite the same thing. But the point stands, if you believe a good liar in the court of public opinion you can cause someone's death due to your irresponsibility. The problem is more cases are coming out where the accuser is lying.

There are psychopaths out there as well as rapists. Both should be prosecuted and treated like the criminals they are.",1575158405

"flying","t5_2qm1t"," Thanks for the questions!

1) put the expected in the hold clearance as a separate flight plan #2 so you could quickly do a direct to and then pull up the approach? 

I didn‚Äôt know what my amended clearance was in the hold. When the further clearance did not come at or after the EFC time, I could not remember where I was cleared to (or technically where I was expecting a clearance to). I was not told (despite asking) what the diversion for the flight would be before the flight. Once I decided that most likely I was given ‚ÄúExpect Lebanon‚Äù, then I put M02 in the GPS and proceeded direct to an initial approach fix. 

2) Would you have done a radio trouble shoot scenario like on/off, change headsets/plugs, fuses, com2, handheld radio? Pull out the checklist and see if there is a radio troubleshooting on it? Do a 7600 on the squawk? Keep talking on the radio even though you are not sure they can hear? 

Yes, I did a radio troubleshoot. I think that it would be a red flag for the DPE if an applicant did not troubleshoot. Moreover, I was PRAYING that at some point in the troubleshoot the DPE would start responding as ATC again. Yes pretend squawk 7600. Your point on continued (pretend) radio calls was something I could have been better at. Once I got to the initial approach fixed, the DPE said that the unicom frequency was fine so I made all of those calls. 

3) did the DPE give you planned fix times to leave the hold and perform the approach? 

Just the EFC time on the hold. I left this late - reasoning it was better to stay in the hold and figure out where I was going rather than start roaming the sky haha.",1575158407

"minipainting","t5_2scss","What do you plan on using it for?

What did you mean the compressor you tried didn‚Äôt work?

The TC is a generic model air compressor - iirc that‚Äôs the one without a tank. The primary problem you‚Äôll run into here is if you‚Äôre spraying for extended periods of time you can end up with the airbrush sputtering a bit, as you have no reservoir to run on the compressor has to keep up with your air needs in real time, and that‚Äôs not always possible

Obviously it‚Äôs more convenient to use a compressor with a tank so you don‚Äôt have that problem - and you get an added benefit of the compressor not running all the time

However - there are some things you can do to make the issue negligible. First I‚Äôd recommend getting a really long air hose if you can. A long hose can act like a pseudo reservoir for you to work from, and the length of hose will give your compressor time to catch up with air demand. Second thing I‚Äôd recommend would be to try and spray in spurts - that way you‚Äôre economical with your air and won‚Äôt run into as many issues",1575158408

The screen has been snapped off and there was no toner included, but I don't need the screen (it runs a HTTP server where you can see the same info), and I just bought some new toner. It works flawlessly and the colour prints are really good, and the black is sharper than any inkjet I've ever used. And the toner is good for &gt;2000 pages. Not to mention it can natively print on both sides of the paper and can print quite fast. It was 12 years old and free, but it works better than inkjets in *every* way.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Modern damascus steel is pattern-welding. It's where you layer different steels and fold them. You can do this with various goals in mind. With the right composition, pattern, and heat treatment, you can for example get a blade with a very hard edge, but which can nevertheless yield without breaking. This was super handy before modern alloys.

These days it's pretty universally made to look pretty. Don't expect it make the blade any better. In fact, there's a good chance you'll get a blade that dulls as if it were stainless yet rusts like it was carbon. On the upside, it does look super sweet.

Regardless. I'm not sure what you are getting at. Are you asking if we agree that experiencing hardships can make you a stronger person? Or are you asking if we agree Sansa was made a 'strong woman' by the hardships she endured?

If it's the former, then yes, defiantly overcoming hardships can make you a stronger person. Though it can also break you and leave you in pieces. 

That being said, I'm not entirely convinced Sansa actually is a 'Strong woman'.  We are constantly told that she is, but her being 'strong' pretty much consists of being a massive bitch to the one person who ensured her survival and jeopardized everything to help her.

Dany actually is a 'Strong woman' (before she got lobotomized in season 7,8) and she definitely is as strong as she at least in part because of the hardships she endured.(As she likes to remind us)  The difference is that the hardships Dany endured didn't strip her of her emotions and her compassion. She fought for the weak and the helpless even though it was detrimental to her war efforts. It seems Sansa only thinks about herself. She isn't 'Strong' she'd just a bitch. That's too bad though, she wasn't like this always. Back when she was with Joffrey and took risks to help the drunk knight. Or point out she saw Joffrey cry when he mocked Tommen for crying. Then she was strong.",1575158410

[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-update-to-parliament-on-harry-dunn-case](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-update-to-parliament-on-harry-dunn-case)

To enable the police investigation to follow its proper course, on 5 September, the FCO formally requested the US Embassy to waive immunity. Given the seriousness of the incident, our view was -and remains - that justice needs to be done.

If her immunity had been waived, Northamptonshire Police would then have been able to compel her to cooperate fully with their investigation.

However, on 13 September, the FCO was informed by the US Embassy that they would not waive immunity, and that the individual would be leaving the country imminently, unless the UK had strong objections.

We duly and immediately objected in clear and strong terms and have done since. Nevertheless, under the Vienna Convention, UK police could not have lawfully prevented the individual from leaving the UK.

When the FCO followed up with the US Embassy on 16 September, they informed us that the individual had departed the day before.",1575158410

I was torn whether I should tell OP (/u/hoshner08) that ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù is the only game I‚Äôve platinumed in as long as I can remember, and that while I have yet to finish ‚ÄúGod of War‚Äù, ‚ÄúUncharted 4‚Äù, ‚ÄúControl‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays Gone‚Äù, ‚ÄúRed Dead Redemption 2‚Äù, and many others yet... I couldn‚Äôt put ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù down.  The base game is great and whether you like the DLC or not is just icing on the cake.  I absolutely loved the traversal and while I was suffering from open world fatigue, I didn‚Äôt feel like this was a traditional, open world game due to the speed and finesse of the traversal system and the fluid combat felt 
more like playing with your toys than going through the motions.

*****

But ultimately, I don‚Äôt know how OP feels about open world games.  I don‚Äôt know how they feel about ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù games, or him as a character.  I don‚Äôt know if they like the ‚ÄúArkham‚Äù or ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù style combat.  I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs more action, or narrative oriented.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a perfect game either, but what it does, it does well.  /r/PS4 is overwhelmingly gonna tell you it‚Äôs perfect, though.  It‚Äôs a very strong foundation for them to build on for the next game, however.  And I don‚Äôt feel in any way that my time was wasted by playing it, though I‚Äôve not completed all of the DLC yet.

- **The only thing I know is that it felt like OP gave a false choice between ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù ‚Äî one of the best reviewed and most beloved games on Reddit of it‚Äôs year; a complete game with DLC if you want more of it... and the ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù game ‚Äî a title that doesn‚Äôt even come out until May 2020**.  It just seemed like such a ridiculous choice of a post and I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre not trolling.  The fact that the body of their post is 7 words long and wants us to decide between a game that none of us have even played and won‚Äôt come out for another **half a year** is ridiculous, and I‚Äôm honestly surprised this post has 600+ upvotes.   

But yeah, /r/PS4 likes ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù, haha.  Anyone that says otherwise is likely to be downvoted.  Sadly, there‚Äôs no downloadable demo for the game that I‚Äôm aware of, so I stand by my statement that you‚Äôre better off looking up reviews from critics whose views you most closely align with, so you know that their taste is similar to yours.  And watch some gameplay to see if it looks like it would be fun to you.  We‚Äôre a ***LONG*** way off from ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù and the jury is still out on that one and will be for some time.  So you‚Äôd have plenty of time to platinum ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù if you so choose over the next six months and pick up ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù if it catches your fancy later on.  Happy gaming to you!",1575158412

I am insecure about my loved ones and sincere relationships make me worried and I dread what will happen after ‚Äúthe honeymoon phase‚Äù. I resent others telling me who or what I am, which can make me argumentative and unsure of myself. My personality changes a little depending on my mood and my peers. I have anxiety about sleeping and darkness, and am very immature in some aspects of myself. By immature I mean giggly and mischievous, and delighting in childish things, because I never really grew out of finding joy and wonder in the world. (I‚Äôm 15) I can‚Äôt deal with fake people who aren‚Äôt sincere and honest. I am very empathetic which often causes me a lot of pain for someone else‚Äôs sake.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

"Geosim","t5_39wjl","Presidente Andino has relayed his response to the Chinese Embassy in Havana, stating that the relationship between the CPC and the CCP is unshakable. The Cuban revolution will always accept the much needed aid from our socialist allies, as times have been difficult for Cuba since the fall of the Soviet Union. The CPC has begun putting together a list of proposals that will draw the two nations closer in the near future, and will be relayed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs when finished. 

After significant debate about the permanent PLAN base establishment, the CPC has declined at this time. The proposed base would be too close to the illegally-held Guantanamo Bay by the American forces, and managing Detente has been difficult enough for Cuba over the years, the CPC does not seek to escalate the situation any further. 

However, Cuba is willing to construct a PLAAF and PLA joint base in Cuba on the opposite side of the island in Pinar Del Rio. The base should not exceed 2,000 personnel at any point in time. The land the base resides on will remain the property of the Communist Party of Cuba, non-negotiable, however will allow the Chinese to conduct operations in LATAM. In exchange, the CPC requests that the PLA forces commit to the continued training and development of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The Revolutionary Navy operates one of its primary Naval Bases in Cienfuegos that recently underwent a massive upgrade to house specifically Chinese naval ships, as that is what the Revolutionary Navy operates, and would be able to temporarily house, refuel, repair the PLAN and act as leave rotations for up to three months per vessel at a time. This will allow the PLAN to have an access port to LATAM without having to make long resource commitments. The base, of course, belongs to the Cuban proletariat and will remain so, the Chinese are our guests.",1575158416

And for what it's worth, a professional would not go to a country to start talking in their accents.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","I‚Äôm guessing she had M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease - that‚Äôs a disorder of the inner ear.. symptoms are losing hearing in the affected ear and vertigo.. and then affects your balance... it‚Äôs makes someone extremely nauseated. When an ‚Äòattack occurs‚Äô they come out of the blue. It‚Äôs debilitating. Episodes can last anywhere from say a minute to 20 mins. 

The article states her dodgy ear, hearing loss, nausea and fainting spells (well you literally can fall over because you lose equilibrium). Textbook Meniere‚Äôs symptoms.

I‚Äôve had a lot of experience, as I had it for about 3 years. And used to also run a support group. Onset ‚Äòtends‚Äô to be middle aged people and up. And here‚Äôs a kicker.. weather can really affect it. Rainy weather when the pressure system is fluctuating.. Is a classic to bring on an attack.

If that was me. And I was out somewhere.. and I felt an attack coming on.. I‚Äôd be making a beeline for somewhere to go and sit ASAP. They are really scary. Not only that,  but I would be forced to lie down. Try to be still as possible and wait for it to pass. When it passed, I‚Äôd still feel sick and probably disoriented for some time.

That area around the shrine was deep forrest. She probably ended up somewhere she shouldn‚Äôt and could not call for help for a while. She might have also misjudged a small body of water (even swampy puddle from the rain) and she‚Äôs injured herself enough to pass away. It‚Äôs not unheard of for someone to not be found in the forrest (we had a lady here in Aus take 2 years for bones to be discovered in a really small area when they knew where to look and a massive search party looking for her) 

Very sad her family couldn‚Äôt put her to rest. And not knowing what happened to her.


EDIT - oh just thought to add. Some people in my support group.. had reported attacks over even an hour and longer. When the attack passes.. people literally cannot walk for hours in a straight line because it affects balance.... so she could have fumbled around and fallen down a slope.",1575158418

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Okay first, there is the very pleasurable build up of tension that occurs when you stimulate your clitoris or gspot (some vibrators can do both at the same time and THAT orgasm is a lot better than a single one of the other variety) so this build up is a general pleasureable/warm/aching feeling over your clit.  


The organ that has the nerve endings in the clitoris actually rings around the whole vulva/vaginal opening.  So that is why you swell when turned on and the tension is building for orgasm.  


As you get closer to an orgasm, the urge to continue the movement getting you to that place is stronger -- it's like an impulse, a compulsion.  Of course, we can override this feeling and stop and the tension build will start to slowly decrease.  But of course we don't want it to stop so keep doing whatever it is your doing to continue to build the pleasurable tension.  


At the crest of the orgasm, before it releases and it actually happens, there is an intense \*gathering\* of that tension that will center around the clitoris and also around, to a lesser degree, the entire vulva/vaginal opening and it will bring it into \*intense focus\* right at the clitoral area to break into waves of incredible intense pleasure that radiate from your clitoral area outward.  This pleasure feeling is pure, unadulterated pleasure and we cannot replicate it with anything else ;)  Hence why it is hard to describe.  It is NOT like a sneeze.  When you are watching porn or reading erotic fiction and your vulva and clit feel warm and sensitive to the touch, like an \*aching\* feeling, magnify that feeling x100000000 and THAT is an orgasm.  It is spectacular.  


The waves of orgasm reach my toes when I'm having a particularly good one and my whole body seizes up tightly if its a strong one.  There are varying degrees of orgasm and each one is different.",1575158418

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

"AnimalTextGifs","t5_34opw","I bathe my indoor cats about once a month. They are pros are bathes now.(Generally washing them more often is bad for their skin and hair. It strips them of their natural oils)

What helped me was training them from a young age. When i first got them i washed them every three days for about a month(?), or until they stopped howling every time they come in contact with water.

When they reached three months of age i did it once every two weeks.

At four months they were so use to it they just sit in the tub.

Treats and familiarity help a ton. Talk in a soothing voice and do not use running water. This FREAKS them out. I personally fill my tub about 1/3 of their leg length with lukewarm water, and use a bowl to run water over them.

A tip that also helped me is wrap their legs in a hand towel. This will save your arms from their claws. Just place and hold them in the water until they stop struggling, then loosen your grip. When they start struggling again tighten your grip. Do this until they understand you will let them lose only when they stop struggling. Then let them go completely, but keep the towel near in case they decide to panic. 

Also using your shower curtain to block off jumping routes. My cats think the curtains are solid. When they first were learning they use to try to jump through the curtain but i placed my arm/hand in the way so it was ""solid"".",1575158420

* Following [this sub-thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/dqsr77/meta_thread_month_of_november_03_2019/f6ec671/) from the November 2019 meta thread, began a discussion on transparency of the mod team to end users:

 * [**Passed**] Voted on adding a section to the subreddit wiki detailing general mod team policies, processes and other tidbits. (Currently in progress, to be completed in December)
 * [**Passed**] Voted on compiling a monthly transparency report to post in the monthly meta thread. (That's this comment!)
 * [**Passed**] Voted on including the result of all official moderator votes in the monthly transparency report.
 * [**Failed**] Voted on making vote counts public.
 * [**Passed**] Voted on allowing votes and results to remain private for cases where the vote is related to a surprise event or similar.
 * [**Passed**] Voted on allowing votes and results to remain private for cases where the vote contains personally identifying information.

* Discussed the previous change in episode rating polls (from 1-10 to like/dislike) and, following user feedback, changed again to [a 5-point system](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/dqsr77/meta_thread_month_of_november_03_2019/f69aiy2/). [**No vote**]

* Discussed whether or not fansubs (independent of video/audio) should be allowed to be posted on the sub. Came to the conclusion that distribution of translated material is not allowed under copyright laws. According to our rules, it means that links or obvious directions towards such material won't be allowed. [**No vote**]

* Held a discussion about how to better utilize our Twitter account ([@RedditChan](https://twitter.com/RedditChan)) and came to a consensus of regularly posting more content from the subreddit including fanart, rewatches, and Watch This! threads. [**No vote**]

* Fixed a bug in [flairbot](https://github.com/r-anime/flairbot) so the bot will no longer repeatedly send PMs to a user reminding them to add a flair to their post. This would occur if the post was more than 15 minutes old, was manually approved by a mod, and didn't have a flair.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","Why do people enjoy cock and ball torture? The act of intentionally or accidentally bringing pain upon the male genitals is typically a thought that people wince at with great force. However, there is a reason why this is an enjoyable experience. One rooted in the most important of sciences. Physics. Take, for example, a bottle of Tobasco Sauce. If one where to move the bottle up and down in a motion reminiscent to the one used during male self-stimulation it typically results in a moderate amount of sauce exiting the bottle. If struck hard on the bottom, however, a large amount will spurt out. Should this be done with the name genitals, turning them upside down and then striking the bottom of the scrotum with moderate to immense force, this will result in a large amount of seed to be ejected from the penis due to the energy being transferred from the palm of the hand to genitals. Therefore, because of physics and the transfer of energy from palm to the genitals, cock and ball torture is a scientifically pleasurable experience.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Though I used to be an atheist and have a college education in the STEM field I no longer believe in evolution and believe in the Biblical account of creation.

Jesus tells us we need to believe in the books Moses wrote.

John 5

&gt;46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

Paul tells us he believes all the law and the prophets.

Acts 24

&gt;14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

Peter decries those who take a naturalistic viewpoint of the world, denying creation and the history in the Bible.

2 Peter 3

&gt;1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. 5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

The Gospels proclaim in Jesus's genealogy that He is descended from Adam.

Luke 3

&gt;38 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

The Epistles unanimously declare Adam to be a real person.

Romans 5  

&gt;14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

Jude 1

&gt;14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

Yes, the internet is a free place and if you dislike something you can talk about it and make connections with other people who also share the same opinion. Totally fair.

But I wish everyone could just make room in their world views for both opinions to exist.

Tribalism and the desire to tear down opposing views is the real danger that is really tearing apart society. It‚Äôs not just Star Wars, or fandoms. It‚Äôs everywhere. 

And I don‚Äôt know how it can be stopped honestly and that makes me sad.


Like, why can‚Äôt someone love the prequels and be able to admit they are poorly directed and written films. I love plenty of garbage media because it makes me happy. And why can‚Äôt people be ok with people loving bad things. Why can‚Äôt some people admit that the ST isn‚Äôt what they wanted to see but be ok with the fact that they could be well-made movies that please a lot of people. 

When u don‚Äôt get what you want it‚Äôs ok to be upset by it, it‚Äôs ok to be vocal about it even, but there‚Äôs this misplaced sense of entitlement that makes some people want to tear down the thing they have distain for and to try and convince anyone who disagrees that they are wrong. 

I‚Äôll never have issue with someone sharing what they didn‚Äôt like and what they wish they saw instead. But vilifying everything associated with it just makes no sense to me.

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt; Can I ask why you think that items aren't going to be returned mostly on time as they are now? 

I'm not a librarian so I don't have access to lending data like this. What I _do_ know is that many libraries have fine policies, and I trust that there were reasons for that. I'm merely speculating about the possible downside of eliminating late fees, since there was probably a list of pros and cons when the late fee policy was instituted that, again, I don't have access to since I'm not a librarian.

My only real source of data is articles like these (which don't mention late items, only circulation), comments at places like this, and personal reflections based on conversations I've had (e.g. justifications over returning an item late based on the cost of doing so).

&gt; Usual library users don't suddenly change their attitudes because fines are removed. The people who habitually return items late still do, like they always will.

There has to be a better system than fines vs no fines. I, and my family, rarely return items late, so I don't really know the reasons why people do so. I _do_ know that I regularly try to put items on hold and books are often not available even a week or more after the due date, which is super frustrating. Obviously fines aren't working, but I can't imagine _removing_ fines would make things better, at best things will stay the same.",1575158425

Quick story. I grew up in the hood. Years later, in another state, I'm out late with a (white, innocently middle-class) friend when I suddenly sense gun danger coming quickly in our direction.

&gt; Initially focused on beating back the Medicare for All movement, the Partnership has since expanded its efforts to oppose all major expansions of government-financed health care.

&gt; So as each 2020 presidential contender rolls out their own signature take on an overhaul, the response from the Partnership has been loud and unflinching: No. &amp;quot;The politicians may call it Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, or the public option,&amp;quot; reads an ad run by the Partnership during September&amp;#039;s Democratic presidential debate.

&gt; As executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America - then the insurance industry&amp;#039;s main trade group - he was a driving force behind the &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; TV ads that played a key role in tanking Bill Clinton&amp;#039;s health care package in 1993 and setting the standard for a generation of hard-hitting special interest campaigns that have shaped policy debates ever since.

The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light-coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action, and remains as a classic example in the teaching of evolution. In 1978 Sewall Wright described it as ""the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.

While not an example of evolution, there are many hundreds of cases of animals adapting their behaviour as a result of human activity. For example, the [lyre bird](https://youtu.be/VjE0Kdfos4Y) has incorporated many new human-sounds into its song repertoire.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was a kid (about 8 years old), my family (including my uncle, auntie, their kids, and my grandparents) went to a small restaurant for dinner, it was quite nice (but not posh), we all had to dress up.

At home, if you needed to fart, you excused yourself from the table, and moved far enough away, and let rip (bonus points if it is loud enough for the table to hear - we usually found farts funny.....at home).


Back at the restaurant, I needed to fart, so I did what I would normally do at home.  I excused myself from the table, walked an appropriate distance away (corner of the restaurant), cocked my leg (lifted one of my legs in the air), and let rip! It was one of the loudest farts I have ever done, I was so proud, I knew my table would have heard it.  

My family (and our corner of the restaurant) turned around, and had the most horrified look on their faces. Unfortunately the restaurant was quite busy, and i had failed to take into consideration, the other tables.  

I had gone far enough away from my table, but the corner I had picked to proudly let rip, was surrounded by occupied (equally horrified) tables.

With a giant, and proud smile on my face, I returned to my table, and continued eating like nothing had happened.

I don't really remember what happened next, but I know we never went back to that particular restaurant.",1575158427

"policeuk","t5_2xy00","Having had pair after pair of Magnums and more recently been issued Altbergs I would say that they are night and day better. Magnums are great if you have wide feet, but mine always felt like clown shoes than work boots. 

The Altbergs took ages to bed in for me, about 2 weeks of using them at work day in and out. To that end if you are starting in the new year I would aim to get the boots fairly quick so that you can get used to wearing them around the house and get them worn in. I promise if you do marching (do they still do that across the board?), that a good well worn set of boots will make a massive difference as I still remember the blisters some people in my intake got from brand new, hardly worn boots. 

High vs low boots are very much a personal preference, I prefer high for the support and the dryness benefits it brings. Most Altbergs if not all of them are waterproof all over right up to the top of the tongue, so higher up means even wet trouser legs avoid making you wet and cold. Even getting out in a footchase in a park in winter you'll get muddy boots and the high ones mean you can use the wash bay hose to clean yourself down pretty quickly. I've also been on flooded roads with 3-4inches of standing water and a pair of magnums which were waterproof only up to the top of the toe. 9 further hours of shift with wet winter thick socks when it was frosty was not nice. As a result I'd never go for the lower options unless I was posted to a role where I had no reason to enjoy those benefits. 

I would like to point out that I've had to rinse down in the wash bay 4 times in the last 2 weeks so it happens enough to be worth it for me.",1575158427

&gt; Initially focused on beating back the Medicare for All movement, the Partnership has since expanded its efforts to oppose all major expansions of government-financed health care.

&gt; So as each 2020 presidential contender rolls out their own signature take on an overhaul, the response from the Partnership has been loud and unflinching: No. &amp;quot;The politicians may call it Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, or the public option,&amp;quot; reads an ad run by the Partnership during September&amp;#039;s Democratic presidential debate.

&gt; As executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America - then the insurance industry&amp;#039;s main trade group - he was a driving force behind the &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; TV ads that played a key role in tanking Bill Clinton&amp;#039;s health care package in 1993 and setting the standard for a generation of hard-hitting special interest campaigns that have shaped policy debates ever since.

Use different formatting for this. Either bold or italicize. 

*/Molly didn't feel warm; she felt cold and empty inside. The old Molly would have been excited, camera round her neck instead of packed; she would have been eager to take pictures all along their trip. /*

You used semi-colons in two sentences right after the other. Pick one of these sentences to break into two. Using them so close together breaks up the flow. The second sentences' first clause sounds weird. 'Camera round her neck' needs something to connect it to the previous part. 'The old Molly would have been excited, with her camera around her neck...'. Around, not round. 

*/This new Molly had a permanent frown line etched between her eyebrows. It had only been a few months since she had miscarried their child./*

Nice transition to the miscarriage. I think that the new Molly could use a little more detail in her introduction. Also, since a miscarriage is such a horrible thing to experience, I feel like it would make sense for her to know exactly how many months. It's often difficult to forget the exact circumstances of days like those, and would further illustrate her trauma. 

 */At the hospital, they hadn't let her see the baby, so she would never know if it would have inherited her red hair, or Dan's dark brown hair. That kind nurse had told her it had been a little girl./*

I suggest breaking into a new paragraph here, and adding more detail. Instead of deliberating between whether or not she inherited red or brown hair, pick a different trait for each parent. It'll read less repetitive that way. 

*/After it happened Molly lay in bed for two weeks recovering.They say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. 'I didn't ask to be stronger' she thought bitterly. /*

The transition from the recovery to the bitter remark on the stronger line is choppy. Add another sentence there to show how she is supposedly stronger or weaker or whatever. It feels odd to suddenly jump from one thing to the other. Having all of the miscarriage details in one paragraph would also help is flow better. 

 */When she found out she was pregnant; she put her plans to enroll in law school on hold. Since the miscarriage, she had no interest in going back to school. /*

This could be written more concisely. No need to spend two sentences telling us about school when one will do. It'll also help the flow, as you don't want to put too many words between actions that are close together. It makes it hard to judge how much time has passed. 

 */""I'm so glad you are going with me, Molly.‚Äù Dan told her, smiling.*

*Molly got in the passenger seat without responding to him. A cold gust of wind swept by at that moment and caused her to shiver. She still wasn‚Äôt that excited about it, but she knew this was important to him./*

'Dan told her, smiling' reads weird. I would suggest rewording it as 'Dan said with a smile' or something like it. The use of 'told' feels off here. Also, you use 'to him' twice in the sentences after. It's unnecessary, because we can tell that from the context, and also repetitive. 

*/ Dan had grown up in the small town of Marion in Upstate New York. In the last two months, several people had gone missing from there. Dan's best friend Pete had abruptly stopped contacting him, which made Dan concerned. The police had not been able to do much--they were understaffed and underfunded out there. /*

You use 'there' twice here. Several people had gone missing period. We know that you're talkig about the town, so no need to further describe it.  Why capitalize 'upstate'? You name Dan twice in one sentence, and you only need to do so once. Again, ending the sentence 'they were understaffed and underfunded period.' Out there is redundant.",1575158429

But it is approved.

&gt; Radical progressives wouldn't be forced to associate with you....and you can force them off of your property, too. 

Im kinda of referencing the systems we have right now, where the left successfully boycotts and protests for conformity all over. 

&gt; To be clear, the destruction of the conservative ideals I'm sure you advocate for has been ushered in, 100% 

Im liberal in my heart, but I have eyes and a brain. Young people are depressed and suicidal. Everything is fucked. People aren't happy, they're on drugs, and they aren't having families. 

&gt; then they were able to artificially extend childhood into adolescence 

Its adulthood. My university peers are large children. Even myself, I lack the discipline of an adult man. 

&gt; THEN the Cultural Marxists (following in the tradition of Lenin/Stalin) realized that, in order to destroy Western European resistance to Communism, they needed to take over schooling 

I read somewhere that the basic education system we have, of a teacher projecting to the pupils, is an idea from the soviets, or something. But specifically, who. The frankfurt school?

&gt; In the sixties, they did exactly this, and from there, the indoctrination has slowly become more overt. 

Has it ever. Do you think im incorrect, when I say this all stems from feminism, and intersectional feminism? Its an objective statistical fact that woman are different than men, think and feel differently, vote differently, and want countries to be run differently. No?

&gt; Without a State in the middle of all of this to force conservative, Christian Europeans to send their children to be indoctrinated by people that hated their way of life, none of this would have occurred 

Seems like that. But what does the libertarian do, abolish public education? MY idea is just changing what is taught. More philosophy, debate, economics, less forcing into post-secondary.",1575158429

Because the clogging tends to happen not just in one spot, but all the way from the base of the pipe, to the top of the pipe, to the curved pipe leading to the inlet, to inside the inlet, to inside the 'cyclone' dirt collector itself. The pipe needs to be wider and/or it needs more power.

&gt; Like I say, I get having ideological objections to the regulation, but is there an actual vacuum cleaner you've had problems with?

Yep, my current one. Many others models too looking at various Amazon reviews.

&gt; But in reality, the change forced manufacturers to advance their products

They would have advanced them anyway, since customers want a better product. Regardless, maybe we can take the handicap off now :)

&gt; but they don't necessarily mean anything more than a noisier motor,

Not necessarily, but all else being equal, you'll get better suction, so on average, yes. A noisy motor can be quietened by going brushless, or even being bigger so we can keep the same RPM.

&gt; It's not even as if the manufacturers are struggling with the limit, and everything's just maxed out at 900W - 'best buys' range from Henry hoovers at 620W, to Dyson uprights at 700W, to the Miele machines at 890W.

"youseeingthisshit","t5_3dde0","&gt;Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee ‚Äî zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou music.
‚ÄúAh, this is marvelous!‚Äù said Lord Wen-hui. ‚ÄúImagine skill reaching such heights!‚Äù
Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, ‚ÄúWhat I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now ‚Äî now I go at it by spirit and don‚Äôt look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and following things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.
‚ÄúA good cook changes his knife once a year ‚Äî because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month ‚Äî because he hacks. I‚Äôve had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I‚Äôve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there‚Äôs plenty of room ‚Äî more than enough for the blade to play about it. That‚Äôs why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.
‚ÄúHowever, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I‚Äôm doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until ‚Äî flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.‚Äù
‚ÄúExcellent!‚Äù said Lord Wen-hui. ‚ÄúI have heard the words of Cook Ting and learned how to care for life!‚Äù

&gt; Initially focused on beating back the Medicare for All movement, the Partnership has since expanded its efforts to oppose all major expansions of government-financed health care.

&gt; So as each 2020 presidential contender rolls out their own signature take on an overhaul, the response from the Partnership has been loud and unflinching: No. &amp;quot;The politicians may call it Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, or the public option,&amp;quot; reads an ad run by the Partnership during September&amp;#039;s Democratic presidential debate.

&gt; As executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America - then the insurance industry&amp;#039;s main trade group - he was a driving force behind the &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; TV ads that played a key role in tanking Bill Clinton&amp;#039;s health care package in 1993 and setting the standard for a generation of hard-hitting special interest campaigns that have shaped policy debates ever since.

Or maybe each tile in the tic tac toe game gives some kind of resource that can be used to win the overall fight. Lots of ways to go about it.. sounds like it could be interesting though..

[The President's Daughter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_es8HMNff8SVWBQ5uwxJYHKWLPfWcnv-mbbq1l8wkAo/edit#heading=h.vqzyw8lsf5sf)  ***-*** $3.93 Kindle, $12.93 Print

[Website](http://www.madisondrinker.com)

In a narrative of suspense, action, and family secrets Madison Drinker will face the shadow of her own abusive past and the cloak and dagger world of ‚Äúopposition research‚Äù as she risks more than just her life to learn the secret of the President‚Äôs Daughter. A real-world masochist, with social ties in the underground world of kink and fetish, Madison hides her emotional instability inside a high-stress and high-dopamine job in the world of opposition research or ‚Äúoppo‚Äù in Washington DC politispeak. 

Graveyard humor and a lack of self-preservation propel her into an investigation which will pit Madison and her partner, a former British paparazzi turned foreign correspondent, against the most powerful man in the free world. The ability to endure pain and emotional duress are tested as Madison investigates previously debunked charges that the sitting President, rough-edged former American Gunman reality star William Foster, was involved in sexual abuse of his daughter Kaidence and hired a Baltimore prostitute to roleplay her for bedroom games.

Madison Drinker fights to learn the truth against a backdrop of issues vital and trending in today‚Äôs world: sexual countercultures, family abuse, surveillance, demagoguery, privatized intelligence, and an Imperial President. 

Squaring off against the President‚Äôs private security, headed by a brutal Memphis ex-cop with flexible ethics and near-unlimited resources Madison comes face to face with the truth...and with herself.  

Presented by lifelong Beltway insider James Gordon and BDSM and fetish educator and edgeplayer Rebecca Doll, enter a secret world written by people who understand it.  From the holdout survivors of Washington‚Äôs haute cuisine watering holes to the scarred sidewalks of Baltimore‚Äôs Payson Street prostitution district, become immersed in a setting depicted in sharp and atmospheric relief.  Crafted with meticulous precision and attention to detail, the story captures the grunge and glitz of Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia without stretching the bounds of politics or straying into science fiction.

Okay guys, it‚Äôs been a good and not so good month in terms of goals 

1. To get to 105kgs- weighed in at 109.75 at beginning and weighed in at 105.7 today. About 700 grams off but I‚Äôm still pretty proud. 

2. To go to the gym at least 4 days a week (2 cardio and 2 resistance sessions) Nope-: this did not happen. I guess because I was losing weight, I lost the motivation to go to the gym but I‚Äôm trying to get fitter over here so I need to get back on track. I‚Äôm travelling for most of December without gym access so walking will be my exercise


3. To try and hit 10,000 steps or more 5 days of the week (not including exercise conversions) Nope: averaging around 5,000 right now. Will hope to meet this goal in December 

4. To journal at least one day of the week (trying to build long term habits) : did more than this. Really been journaling consistently this month. 

5. To fast one day of the week : I tried this and it made me more likely to overeat afterwards. After a couple tries I‚Äôve realised that consistently eating throughout the day is what keeps me satiated. Glad I tried it though.

6. One long picnic at a beach this November : Terrible weather this month, but I‚Äôve definitely got it in nailed in for the 7th of Dec (28 degrees celsius and sunny that day. All friends are available too)

This was my first month doing this and it was nice to see where I was achieving my goals and what I wanted to work on to improve my consistency levels.

Excited for December!!",1575158433

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","First of all, from a player perspective this is a downright lame ruling. All of the items at recharge at dawn either says ""daily at dawn"" or ""cannot be used again until the next dawn"". Which implies that it is simply a denotion of time, it doesn't actually need to be hit by the sun to recharge, all the magic items still recharge while underground.

Without the sun does time not pass? Can the players only rest once while in Avernus.

Ultimately it is your game and you can rule as you want, but I want you to consider how cheap this would feel as a player, ESPECIALLY if you are giving your players very powerful items, which they then cannot really use.

This will probably really unbalance the party when they make it out of Avernus with these items. 

As for the list, this is just a pure research thing, go look up each magic item and check its recharge ability. You are literally just asking other people to do your grunt work, but I'll give you one anyway The Rod of Resurrection.",1575158433

If that doesn't work, then I give them a longer, about 2 second dose, and give them another chance to realise that *yes*, I'm flashing the beams at them, and *yes*, they do need to dip their lights. 9 times out of 10, they get the idea.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

You either have ear piercings or you don‚Äôt. You should have contacted your piercer when you began to have problems. Also, swelling is a part of the healing process. You should have been told aftercare. I‚Äôm sorry your piercer either didn‚Äôt inform you or you didn‚Äôt pay attention.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I'm FtM and while I do believe it's possible to find someone like that I believe it would be an exception or not the norm for most gay guys. Like I said in a previous post I did recently,

&gt; As a gay trans guy myself (ftm) I don't fine it transphobic if a gay guy declines to sleep with me. I very obviously expect it actually and will continue to do so until after I fully transition. (ie top and bottom surgery) Genitals and our attraction/dislike of them are honestly a big part of sexuality. I also think breasts and pussy is gross and off putting sexually speaking. So why would I think that any other gay guy is purposely discriminating against me? Insanity. Truthfully, I'm gonna have more luck if I find a guy who's Pansexual, Bi, or Open minded/non-labeling(?) if I want a relationship before I have fully transitioned. It's the way it is. Even afterwards I know it will still be hard. 

This would be especially the case early on. Tbh it takes about 2 years on hrt to REALLY pass (like stealth pass) and sometimes longer. Though the longer you're on it the more masculine you look. You look at a timeline of 5-10 years and it's insane, most of the time you'd never be able to tell! 

That's my 2 cents anyway. Hope it helps!",1575158437

I suggest a less radical change to make player/ally icons only visible to SLs (only if they have SL kit) and perhaps FTLs. It might make sense for the squad to see each other's position on the map.

This is one of the main reasons why I support Yang. Most other candidates' plans put more decision making power in the hands of the state. Yang's Freedom Dividend plan is all about putting the power in OUR hands. WE decide how the money gets spent, not some unaccountable government bureaucrats.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I want a president that helps promote small businesses

This was literally Yang's passion project before he decided to run for President. He spent most of the 2010s founding and running a non-profit called Venture For America whose sole mission was to recruit highly qualified college grads who would typically go into one of a handful of jobs (banking, consulting, etc) in a handful of cities (New York, San Francisco, etc) and instead redirecting them to small businesses and startups in declining cities in the midwest and the south like Detroit and Birmingham. Yang knows what you know: that small businesses are part of the foundation of our economy, our communities, and our country. The Obama administration named Yang an Ambassador for Entrepreneurship for his efforts with VFA.

"SpaceXLounge","t5_3eye9","‚ÄúDisperse‚Äù. Yes. Disperse their atoms.

As an aside, I‚Äôve always felt like the established cues of visually-depicting science fiction, back in the days of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù science fiction, never matched the way I thought about it. Y‚Äôknow, they sometimes call it ‚Äú[zeerust](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeeRust)‚Äù.

(*EDIT: I mention it because I watched the movie for ‚ÄúWhen Worlds Collide‚Äù long before reading the book. It‚Äôs extremely zeerusty, even as regarding the differences between the screenplay and the novel‚Äôs text.*)

It‚Äôs like Isaac Asimov said. The pulpy stories about robots were near-universally rough retellings of Frankenstein, with the creation proving monstrous by rebelling, as is implicitly the just deserts of those ‚Äúenslaving‚Äù them. Asimov thought it was silly (and too repetitive), since robots would presumably be built by engineers using rigorous, established valuations of various dangers.

Hence Asimov‚Äôs notions of a science called ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù and his deliberate ‚Äúlaws of robotics‚Äù. If it weren‚Äôt for his robot stories exploring some of the caveats and limitations of his own ‚Äúthree laws‚Äù formulation, I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôd have as strong a sense of some of the real dangers of AI‚Äîmostly GIGO stuff like paperclip maximizers and lack of semantic behavioral guarantees (a sufficiently advanced AI can be a literally *perfect* liar and manipulator, with absolutely no way to check for sure, like software with a backdoor that can lie about its source code and binaries.).",1575158440

Staten Island, though part of the City, is more like a suburb, along with some sections of Brooklyn and Queens. The center of the photo is taken up by Manhattan, which is by far the most neatly laid out part of the City. Only about half of Manhattan is shown, starting from Central Park and below because photographers apparently forget about the entire northern half of Manhattan. The two ""islands"" (not really islands) to the right of Manhattan are actually New Jersey, and I believe that's the borough of Staten Island in the far upper center, with tiny bits of Brooklyn and Queens to the left.

I can understand this sentiment, but throw her a damn bone. You're trying to be cold steel logical, but you're not, you're actively putting the fear of losing a commitment in the way of your relationship AS WELL AS YOUR GF'S FINANCIAL POSITION.

Your GF is taking care of your child full-time, she's an unpaid nanny and she's taking a major financial hit in her pension and year-per-year career development. Respect that and react to it.

YES YOU FUCKING DO. You have a paper saying you're the father of that girl. That is literally the only thing keeping the bio-mom from taking her from you. And it IS the same god damn thing. If you want to prove that sentiment, tear up that paper and let the bio-mom know you'd be fine with her taking the baby away at any time. Not willing to do that? Fucking hypocrite.

The kicker is that everything in Vietnam, from Healthcare to education, is paid for out of pocket. So the system is set up against the average person. 

Not only do women have multiple children, and then can't work right after giving birth, they're put at an economic disadvantage in order to raise them. I find that to be evil and incomplete.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Wait, there's no way The Ordinary says you can't use both, period, just that you shouldn't use them in the same routine??

As far as peptide effectiveness ...

I think it's very individual. For example, I use high concentration Tretinoin as well as Ascorbic Acid daily, and chemical peels monthly, so my skin is constantly completely exfoliated, which makes it highly likely that the peptides I use every morning **do** get into my skin and do **do** something. Also I use peptides on basically bare skin where there is nothing being applied under the peptide product that would compromise penetration.

However, this not going to be the case for most people. If someone who never exfoliates their skin uses peptides, the peptides are probably not going to get into the skin, thus, the peptides are probably not going to do anything.

Same goes for application. If you apply peptides over other, occlusive or emollient products, the peptides can't make it into the skin. I always thought it was interesting that Angie from Hot and Flashy uses peptides after her Curology prescription, for example, because Curology is a thick cream that contains occlusive sweet almond oil in its base. She knows her shit, so I've always found this perplexing.

I personally don't use peptides with any acid, including Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid,) AHAs (Glycolic, Lactic, etc) and I also won't use peptides with Tretinoin (Retinoic Acid.) So my routine is AM: peptides, Niacinamide, moisturizer, sunscreen, PM: Ascorbic Acid, Tretinoin, moisturizer.

I personally stay the fuck away from copper peptides altogether because there have been way too many scary anecdotal reports.

So tldr you can use peptides and acids/Vitamin C, just don't use them in the same routine. Think a lot about what you can do to facilitate peptide penetration.",1575158443

But now twitch has added filters to the search it is making it easier where you are looking for someone to watch set you filter to just gone live or lowest to highest views.

Also if you are looking for a support comunity come check us out on discord you will have to DM me for the link or you can use this one discord dot gg slash pnjt9yf

&gt; Initially focused on beating back the Medicare for All movement, the Partnership has since expanded its efforts to oppose all major expansions of government-financed health care.

&gt; So as each 2020 presidential contender rolls out their own signature take on an overhaul, the response from the Partnership has been loud and unflinching: No. &amp;quot;The politicians may call it Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, or the public option,&amp;quot; reads an ad run by the Partnership during September&amp;#039;s Democratic presidential debate.

&gt; As executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America - then the insurance industry&amp;#039;s main trade group - he was a driving force behind the &amp;quot;Harry and Louise&amp;quot; TV ads that played a key role in tanking Bill Clinton&amp;#039;s health care package in 1993 and setting the standard for a generation of hard-hitting special interest campaigns that have shaped policy debates ever since.

In the book, Blackflame, Casias gives a little hint that doesn't answer your ironbody question specifically but leads me to believe the Blackflame human line may have had a bloodline ability or inherent resistance.  
  
Blackflame: The horrifying possibilities of Eithan's plan started to creep into Casias' mind. ""He's not born of the Blackflame line. He couldn't handle the madra.""  
  
Eithan answers with why he gave a top graded Blooodforge Iron body that can draw on the pure core. This helps explain why we do not see new Blackflames and Lindon with his split core opened up the options.  
  
In the end, the power of the Blackflame Artists gradually ""declined due to being eaten away from the inside out by their own madra."" This makes me think their ironbodys only played a small role if any and a bloodline power or pact was the main help.",1575158447

This was taken just after sunset last night, [through a 350mm telescope](https://optcorp.com/products/meade-6000-series-70mm-f-5-petzval-refracting-telescope?rfsn=3263299.a9cb76&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=refersion) with a Sony a7ii. A conjunction is when two celestial bodies appear close together in the night sky, and this was the third in a row, as the moon drifted past Jupiter and then Venus the night before. The cloudy skies almost prevented me from getting this image, but thankfully the moon broke through several times and I was able to capture hundreds of shots. While the clouds, moon, and Saturn (and background stars)  were all captured in a single frame, I stacked around 200 shots to sharpen details on the moon and Saturn. Seeing conditions were rough, but I am still thrilled with the details I captured, and the haze gave the scene a dreamlike vibe. This was done using far fewer shots than I usually use, as the clouds quickly obscured the image again as I was shooting.

You don¬¥t.

Serious answer:

Push in the waves and to get as fast as possible tower first blood, then try to make use of your lead through skirmishes at herald, ganks at mid lane or tp ganks on bot lane. Aatrox' mid-game is very strong so you have to make use of it. He has one of the best two items power spike in the game with Cleaver + Death¬¥s Dance. In later stages of the game it's getting harder to apply his damage so you should end the game prior to 30-35 minutes.

I wouldn't recommend picking Aatrox without a tank tbh. He should be played as a follow-up disruptor and not as a primary engage. If you don't have a tank you CAN still pick him, but it¬¥s getting more difficult each passing minute in the late game.",1575158447

"LivestreamFail","t5_38jf0","There is underlying racism to racial preference but society accepts certain forms of racism. Of course people are free to do whatever they want but let's not deny where it comes from. A lot of people here saying ""it's not racist it's just preference"" are just saying that because they are most likely white males who benefit from it and have some sort of white guilt about it. or asian women trying to justify it to be socially acceptable. 

If you were to say that about gingers I would think it's kind of racist to have that response. If you just said you don't visually like how they look and it's not your thing it would be a preference. But it is racist when asian women ""prefer"" white guys not based on their looks but their status in society or positive stereotypes. Saying ""all white men have big dicks, better faces and asian men are inferior for [asian stereotype]"" comes from a place of racism.

Again people are free do whatever they want and don't have to justify anything but let's not act like it doesn't come from a racist point of view. If you were to say ""I don't like women over 30, I prefer to date 18-24 year olds"", that's 100% your right to do but people across the board would give you shit and you would have to justify it. It's just since this is a female issue of women having preference no one can talk about it or say it has some problematic elements. If you as a man (of any race) say you have a preference for Asian women people would give you shit for it. People would call you racist too since they think you only have a preference for asian women because of racial stereotypes.",1575158452

"friendship","t5_2qsto","Part II: 
Any how there were more events like this through the year that really made me question things: the event that broke camel's back was new year's eve. In sum, she asked me to go out and I said I have family commitments, she got upset. Then...

Then on new year's eve I messaged her like usual, she didn't respond at all.
At that point, I decided I can't have this anymore, I have to explain every of my actions, my behaviours, it was getting really restrained in the friendship for me. It shouldnt be like this. Then past mid-night she sent through a text saying happy new year. I didn't respond. Every single time, we reconciled and communicated, it didn't work. We both tried to work together on this friendship. It didn't work out in the end. I miss her. I do. But I'd rather spend time alone, if it means that I would be tied up in a friendship like this. It was becoming unhealthy. 

The next day is what really freaked me out - because i didn't message back I think she panicked and started messaging and calling me frantically. I answered. I said can you please just leave me alone for a bit to think things through as we've been through a lot this year. She insisted that she wants to come over to my house and she's leave me alone and let me think and she'll sit quietly in the corner. She apologizes for her behaviour, and insisted she needs to come over. In my head, I'm thinking that is really putting herself down to being small but it shouldn't be like this. So I asked her please, just leave me alone for a bit, I need me space. If she is going to come, I'm going to go out. Then she said, okay she wont come over. 

Then the next day my dad going to swimming drove our and saw her waiting outside my house and just staring in to the window. My dad spoke with her and asked her to go home. Then in the next few days we started message and communicated about all what's been happening and going on. The more that was explained to me the more it became apparent that it was about her. I felt I was emotionally manipulated by her because she used what I had said and turn into a naive narrative. I couldn't believe in her anymore, every time we reconciled I believe we have become closer and understood each other more, we could build more trust. But the same theme keep coming up every single time and more often as well which really got to me and perplexed me because I thought we had reached and understanding and made compromises. But it wasn't enough for her. I am a human being too that needs to be heard, I'm not a saint. It felt like I cannot have my other relationships without being guilt tripped. She would get upset because I had to spend time with my family. That doesn't add up. 

Then I think what really got to her was my decision to cancel our April trip to Japan. Now that was another story in itself - she believe that I didn't want to go with her as i wasn't proactive enough with our flights and planning. With flights I explained that i was okay with anything below $1500 because we were going in peak season. So she went over to the flight centre and asked if this flight was okay, and I said yes lets go head with it and she said I'll wait and check another time. Because its cost/money related if she says she wants to check out another cost or alternative, ofcourse I would agree - she said then howcome when I go learn japanese etc. you just go - I'm said well its my personal thing and I pay for it myself. This trip is a combined trip - I'm like we've been to Thailand together, we've been so many road trips and its always been us planning together. Anyhow we finally settled with the flights after we communicated about her doubts. Anyhow.... 

After a few days because I was still upset about the communication we had, I wasn't ready to meet her. She demands that I have to meet her and she doesn't agree with my decisions. I asked her to give me more time and leave me alone to think for myself. 

Then she sends a message saying that she's going on a one way trip back home and may never come back. I met her one more time giving back her parcels that usually when she does online shopping its gets sent to my home so I delivered her package to her and said good bye. She asked me to promise her that she wants me to talk to her before the Japan trip and see what I decide on and not to cut her off. I said okay. 
While she was back overseas - we communicated a few times and she was telling me about her time back home. Then after a while she told me she was on depression medication and she had no one to talk to and asked if she can talk to me. At that point, I really couldn't cope with that anymore. I said please could you speak with you family members at home. She said it is different, didn't want them to know, only I could be the one that could help. 
I felt like it wasn't fair - I really couldn't handle this anymore. Then I was adamant that I could not go to Japan with her. I told her this and wished her well and we both ended our relationship wishing each other good terms. 

Anyhow - so my point of saying I don't like conflict it because I do think communication is a better way than conflict. And the conflict I experienced through the way how she treated me when she was upset, I really couldn't take it and the actions to my other friends and my potential relationships, I felt like it was her lashing out if she didn't see fit. I don't want that happening in my life. She knows my family and how much I value friendships as well as me as a person. I don't think she thinks about that when she doesn't like something or someone. But I always have considered  her first all the time and the one time I wanted something for myself, she doesn't allow it and she was manipulating me to stand with her. That's my baseline, I cannot take that. It makes me vulnerable each time when I am exposed to the hostility suddenly placed at me and reconciling I expose myself sharing how I feel and in turn its used to manipulate me. I definitely don't appreciate that.

Hope some of this context makes sense... Sorry, its really long...

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One time I was down at a secluded smoke spot at my university. I was there with a couple pals and we were having a grand old time. Some fellas come down and I prepare to open the circle because that‚Äôs what homies do. But instead of posting up with us they make their own group a couple yards away. No big deal, not everyone likes to meet strangers in the middle of the night.

I hit the boof and pass to the left and I notice one of the newcomers take something out of the backpack and I prepare to witness whatever grand piece they‚Äôve brought to the party. However, even in the dark, I can tell this isn‚Äôt a bong or bowl. It‚Äôs too long and thin. Then I think, ‚Äúholy shit, this mensch has the biggest joint I‚Äôve ever fucking seen.‚Äù 

The bowl, meanwhile, comes back to me so I take my eyes off the strangers and  put them back on the prize. After my hit, however, I notice their voices getting more excited. I turn my gaze to the folks and I can‚Äôt believe my eyes as I witness them light up three fucking sparklers (one for each).

Blazed out of my gourd, I try to make some sense of the situation. ‚ÄúYou guys gonna burn?‚Äù I ask. Not only did they say ‚Äúno,‚Äù they looked at me like I was crazy. These fellas, for whatever reason, decide to go down to a well known smoke spot to light up not weed but sparklers.",1575158453

If you think I don't choose libertarianism, the ideology of supporting gay married couples protecting marijuana fields with fully automatic machine guns over being a Republican who likely doesn't support all three parts of that phrase, I don't know. I just I don't know, guess I just like weed.

I don't even smoke weed...

I've never even SMOKED WEED.

Now, this Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream is a fucking miracle. It's the only moisturizing step I use and since day one of using it, no more peelies! Nothing. Nada. Also it's one of the first moisturizers my skin seems to agree with and that doesn't make me break out.


So again, you angelic being. Thank you so much for voicing your opinion. It was a chance, and I took it, and I am so glad I did. My wallet will thank me too.


Thank you.",1575158454

being a virgin has only a small part in safety during rough intercourse.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. you want her to be as aroused as possible prior to penetration.  This will make her ""wet,"" and the wetter she is, the safer it is to be faster and harder.   
2. honestly it's OKAY to take it slow.  If she's really as pent up in sexual energy as she claims, then taking it slow at first will only make her desire it more and make her wetter, making it - again - easier.  
3. communicate with HER not with reddit.  Every girl is different, every first time is different.  
4. If she LIKES pain, abuse and crying play during intercourse, then sure go ahead, but only after you guys have agreed on a safe stop mechanic.  A safe word is a common way for her to let you know to stop while allowing her to cry and resist a bit within comfort zone.",1575158456

"TheOCS","t5_q0suy","2020 through 2021 will be a period of refinement as producers and retailers continue to dial things in. 

Some things we will likely see in the near-ish future, roughly in the order in which I think we will see them:

&amp;#x200B;

* Christmas 2019 will be a bigger deal than Black Friday because of the first 2.0 products
* 2.0 products will come in waves throughout 2020 as they become available. Some will be great, others will be awful
* Some LPs are going with proprietary vape pods will others are going with more generic 510 carts. Expect a certain amount of inconvenience on this front. There will be winners and losers based on format alone, never mind the contents, especially if too many offerings require special batteries
* More large format offerings - HEXO making the first move for a full ounce is a notable turn of events. I could see Aphria, Organigram, Redecan, or WeedMD being one of the next to make a move, even if they start a new brand to do so
* Prices will not collapse, but a certain jockeying for position will happen as producers try to figure out where their price point needs to be for product to move. I could also see there being more brands introduced in 2020 as producers keep their namesake brands as the core offering and value and premium lines becoming more of a thing
* Quality gradually increasing, with some producers clearly doing better than others
* More seeds for the coming growing season, but I could see this being more of a thing for smaller/micro LPs - until they start making enough money for the big players to sit up and notice. Same goes for cuttings if the logistics can be worked out in Ontario

&amp;#x200B;

As for what I *want* to see, I want to see what the producers can do with concentrates (especially some made with recent standouts like DT81) and more contemporary genetics in general.  I would be willing to pay something of a premium if someone were to do a really good job with a super long flowering sativa, but I know that is not a commercially viable thing, so will end up being a rarity if it ever hit the market.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in my early teens I was obsessed with scratching my rectum. I eventually figured out that if I leave a thin layer of shit on my anus and let it dry over night I would be more itchy and I would have a fun surprise that I could peal off my butt hole in the morning. I cannot describe how wonderful the feeling of pulling off that thin simi transparent sheet was. After pulling it off I would smell it and then toss it under my sink. After a week or so the smell was too much for me to handle. So I began to spray febreze down there every once in a while. This went on up until I started growing hair down there. I stopped for a while because I would end up pulling hair with my shit. In the mean time, I would toss my finger and toe nails along with my heel skin and occasionally, my sun burn skin (what a treat that was) under the sink. I eventually began to miss the sensation of peeling, so I decided to shave around my anus. Shaving it made it more itchy! Sadly, for some reason my shit wouldn't come off in a single layer. That's when I decided to take some Elmer's glue and lightly apply it around my rectum and let it dry. My god! The feeling was 10,000 times better than before! Not to mention that my anus was super smooth after peeling! The worst day of my life happened three years ago today. While I was out shopping my next door neighbors house caught fire and engulfed my house with it. My beautiful collection went up in smoke. After the ensuing trauma I sought professional help for my disorder (talking to that shrink was the most embarrassing part of my life). I was diagnosed with OCD and excoriation disorder. I no longer peel or pick at my body. I have a few pictures, Sorry for the darkness of the photos. They were originally intended for me to look at when I was on trips (wasn't expecting to share them).

Hello /u/butilkata, welcome to Knife_Swap! Please read this entire message if this is your first time posting here!

Make sure you obey any laws that are applicable to your country and the recipients country. If we find out that you are breaking them we will ban you.

As a reminder, all posts require a timestamp with the knife open and the blade visible.  This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. Additionally, please make sure to have a grade:

Quality [Q] Levels (use + or - accordingly):

* ""A"" - New, has been taken out of the box a few of times, never used to cut or been carried
* ""B"" - Light wear, been carried, non damaged. Sharpened by someone who knows what they're doing (e.g. original manufacturer or a very well established modder like REK). Non-permanent mods like new clips, new screws, or similar will fall into this category since the knife has been disassembled or worked on but not permanently changed or damaged. If these modifications have caused changes in the knife's performance e.g. now has bladeplay or centering issues, that lowers the rating of the knife to a C.
* ""C"" - Moderate wear on handle or blade, may have been reprofiled, sharpened not super well, modded in any permanent fashion, need sharpening; mechanisms (non lock related) may not function properly.
* ""D"" - Things are broken.


Until you have a successful sale that‚Äôs confirmed delivered you may only post one knife at a time. If it doesn‚Äôt sell after five days, you can post another for sale after withdrawing the first by editing the post to say so. ~~~~This means one thread, one knife, and that's it. NO EXCEPTIONS  

Once you successfully have completed and got trader flair a sale or trade, you can post however many knives for sale as you want! Please still try to keep them all in one post, though, to avoid spamming our page.  

Please make sure your prices aren't ridiculous.  You will be called out if you're asking an unreasonable amount.

Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services, with any fees added.  All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 

Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  

If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear. 

As always, please don't be a dick.  Message the mods if you have any questions!

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Really it's just a case of to each their own. I enjoyed playing all of the games. Out of the 3 FO4 is my personal favorite and the only one I still play. 

The combat is all around more smooth and enjoyable. In 3 and NV I felt that the combat system was just a means to and end in my goal of reaching the next story tidbit. In 4 I will just run around shooting things sometimes because it's so much fun.

I love the settlement system. I have easily spent hundreds of hours tweaking settlements and starting new games just to get another blank slate to work with.

And I like that the game leaves it up to me to decide if an action is good or bad. In 3 or NV the devs decide if my actions deserve positive or negative karma making everything black and white. In 4 it's all a gray area left up to me. Is the BOS good or evil? It's up to me to decide, not some karma system telling me so every time I do a quest. Is that person good or evil? I just have to guess, there is no finger left behind on their corpse. I really feel that 4 did a better job nailing that gray area of people just trying to survive in the wasteland. For an example, lets look at the BOS. We have maxon, a fanatical leader trying to stop a group that is killing and replacing people. He has a noble goal but is so fanatical that he can't see when he crosses the line. Or you have elder Lyons in 3, a kind old man dedicating all his resources purely towards defending the wastelanders and creating free purified water for all. One is pure good, the other is a flawed character that leaves it open for you to decide if he is good or bad.

That open ended world is where I think 4 excells in its role-playing. While many quests are rather railroaded and do not give you options beyond help the person or kill the person, looking at the world as a whole to help you decide who to help and who to kill is where I find the depth in the game. It feels more like a world that I am a part of and less like a story line that I am following.

But again, that is just my opinion. Doesn't make it any more or less valid than the opinion of anybody else. We all just have our own preferences for what we enjoy.",1575158460

I'm another one of the opinion that people should be allowed to write what they want. If fan fiction makes you happy, go ahead. Loads of people I know either write both or started with fan fiction and then went on to write their own original fiction. Many are now published. It's also a good way to get immediate feedback and critique of your writing, which you can use to hone your craft. Of course, not all the feedback you'll get is useful, but learning to discern which advice is helpful and which isn't is another handy skill for those who want to take writing seriously.",1575158460

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","Been there. Honestly don't recommend quitting without some sort of plan. The plan doesn't need to be perfect, but no plan at all (which was what I did) will add new stress to your life that will replace the old stress (and more maybe). The three part plan that I would recommend in retrospect is:

1) Form a soft plan B in your mind, and get comfortable with worst case scenarios (the Stoics call this negative visualization). The idea here is to get comfortable with the fact that even if the near term trajectory goes south, you can find your way through it. Do some job search while currently employed, but be careful of grass is greener thinking.

2) Tell people you trust at your current place of work how you're feeling. Strongly consider if there are lateral moves within the company that could give you a morale boost and reduce your workload and stress, even if you have to take a pay cut or change your career trajectory. HR doesn't normally love this, but retraining people is expensive and if you're a valued employee they'll put effort in to searching for new roles for you.

3) If this isn't fruitful after, say 3 months (no less), see where your head is at, and if you still want to quit, go for it. Take two weeks for yourself with no obligations or pressure to find something new. At the two week mark, start pretending like finding something new is your full time 9-5 job. Work on it every M-F. Don't get too comfortable. Time can start slipping very quickly past this point, and so taking it seriously and asking for help is highly advised.

Best of luck!",1575158460

What happens when a massive star ignites within a dense cloud of hydrogen gas? This kind of thing.

As the bright star within the Bubble Nebula began nuclear fusion, the radiation surged outward and carved out this little enclave of space.   The delicate bubble you see here is created as gasses pile up in front of the stellar wind that is pushing outward.   It is over 7 light years in diameter, but at over 7000 light years distant appears tiny in our sky.   Why do chaotic events seem so peaceful from afar?

Though shot through specialized narrowband filters, this is a palette that loosely represents the true color of this object. For those astrophotographers: an HOO mix.

Edit:   
I‚Äôm getting this question a lot so just wanted to add it here.  How can I get 24 hours of exposure?  It‚Äôs not continuous exposure.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Spine chill is good (just level it up ofc)

Borrowed time i guess is pretty neat but in my experience it doesnt really help myself score points and rank up (of course if you are just playing for fun then disregard this)  if you really want to help your team and rank up at the same time i would reccommend well make it instead

now some people are telling you to go bond instead of selfcare, it is true that selfcare is kinda bad atm and should be swapped if possible but bond is only really good if you play solo since if you have a friend or two you can just keep eachother informed on who is doing what and bond becomes rather obsolete

This is why they become irrationally angry at even mild criticism and cannot ever truly take ownership of their mistakes.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Most products (unless they're pH-dependent like vitamin C, AHA, or BHA) work best when applied in thinnest-to-thickest consistency order.  Sunscreen is always the last step of any skincare routine.  

Squalane oil is generally applied after water-based serums (like hyaluronic acid).  It can be applied right away while the previous layer is still damp, or after it's absorbed.  Oils are pretty flexible and can be applied over, under, or (my personal preference) mixed in with moisturizer.",1575158468

&gt;Who care about boars ?

Farmers for one, King Bobby B for two, and just about anyone that ever encountered one for three. 

&gt;Current society, no.

Yep. If we can get rid of guns, we can get rid of cars. If I'm wrong, you're wrong.

&gt;And where do you plan to find enough horses for the hundred of millions of people who use a car to travel (and how to feed the horses) ?

Same way we find the way to feed and defend the hundreds of millions of people after we take away all their means of defense and food gathering. 

&gt;You can't replace cars by horses

Yup, you can. If you can take away guns, you can take away cars, since cars way kill more children a year, and that's bad.

 &gt;So there is no way to debate with you since you'll just answer with even more insanities.

It's great how angry you get when I throw your argument back at you repackaged. It's how most feel when talking to anti gun nuts.

I have a sneaky suspicion that shadow/inferno is going to be the next meta buff as pbe is showing shadow is 75% extra damage instead of the 45% for 3 champs in that synergy. Where the tactics come in to play is that, the positioning and item building is a main source of playability. 

Maybe non of this is true but just my thought on how I've seen and played the game.",1575158472

Couple things to note though, 16' won't have space for a bipod (and I'm pretty sure 18' isn't made with a bipod cut, but I didn't check), and the fact that you can always cut a barrel down but never can you increase it's length. Having said all that, mine are 21'.

Edit: If you want to put on scopes, red dots, flashlights, lasers, etc. you probably want an AR-10. You get a FAL because you want a FAL (which is also why I recommend a 21 inch barrel). If you want a 308 rifle that'll perform much better, be cheaper, be more accurate, be much lighter, and be able to customize it however you want, any answer other than AR-10 is the wrong answer.",1575158476

"Watches","t5_2qls5","I didn't read the guidelines here, but also have some dedicated cameras, so I might be a bit more picky. What I'll say is that what feels not so dark to your eyes, can already be reasonably dark to a camera. Under certain circumstances that can lead to the movement of your hand holding the camera to induce blur in the image (camera shake). Not sure if that's the case here.

What is more easily visible (and what might somewhat hide if the above is also true or not) is that the camera doesn't seem to have nailed the focus. The busier dial of the Breitling, with its smaller details, is a good location to check. Zoom in the shot and you might notice what I mean.

That being said, the way you took the shot is great to show the collection and we can definitely recognize models and your flavour. Photography takes practice, don't be deterred by my (well meaning) comment.",1575158476

Answer:

* Leaving the EU so that there's no higher source of human rights law and then modifying/removing our Human Rights Act to get rid of things that inconvenience their ability to exercise executive power in ways that impose their will upon the lives of HRH's Subjects (i.e. us). 
* Making the House of Lords a purely advisory institution so that it can't inconvenience the legislation they will be able to impose as the sole viable party under a gerrymandered FPTP system.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","Economy in D&amp;D is tricky because most players come from video games, where you can constantly get better weapons, but in D&amp;D a sword is just a sword. So a *Skyrim* player asks what kind of sword it is, you say it's basic steel, and now they want Elven or Glass, and you tell them that's not a thing in D&amp;D.

What D&amp;D should have is item condition. A sword that has been damaged in combat should do less damage. Also, a castle forged sword should be better than one forged by an apprentice. But to D&amp;D, a longsword is a longsword.

I'm planning on giving my players a forge master, who will maintain their weapons. I'm not sure how I'm going to handle this numerically. They might just get +1 weapons, but with no magical properties. Just a flat +1 to damage. Nothing game breaking but a nice bonus, especially to bad rolls.

To answer the question, most towns will have a selection of what's in the equipment section in the PHB. Most towns may not have a weapon shop, but the general store might have a few short swords. A weapons shop will have more.

I'm not sure if there's a table for this, but for some, less common things, I'd have them roll, with a chance the store doesn't carry that and/or they do but they're out. Every store should have rope, for the most part... but why carry torches if you're in the desert?

Healing potions would be rare, I would think. They'd have to be made by a skilled apothecary, and those aren't common.",1575158478

There is a burden of proof, where most of the time older condominiums have to prove negligence.

So you end up with very questionable scenarios where it's difficult to prove negligence. Deductible by-laws give the condominium corporation more authority to charge back the deductible cost because - if it's in your unit boundary, you're responsible for it (example, where a shutoff valve bursts right at the seam of the unit boundary, or a pipe bursts that a homeowner cannot necessarily maintain).

Edit: And ""lonely"" is hopelessly vague. I knew people who complain about being lonely when they don't get laid for a few days. I don't like the stigma around the word ""incel"", but if there is a non-hated, snappy and well-accepted term for ""someone who is generally considered physically unattractive and thus cannot find a partner despite all reasonable effort"", I'm all for it.

Unlike most hobbies, there is not an 'end' to ham radio. It keeps expanding, especially in new modes/types of communicating. We have our own satellites. We communicate by bouncing signals off the moon. We communicate via the aurora borealis (northern lights). We communicate by bouncing signs off meteor trails. Almost every mountain peak around the world has ham radio repeater stations. You can 'sign on' to some specific websites and remotely make ham radio contacts thourough some very modern, powerful ham radio stations. Most of the time the ISS (International Space Station) has hams on board. You can 'plug in' to as many opportunities as you want to. That is just for now...5/10 years from now...whose knows...you might be the one to discover or develop that next new method!

If you haven't yet, I suggest to join the ARRL. You will get a monthly magazine. QST is their 'main' magazine, but you might want to select a brand new one, aimed at new hams..called On The Air. January 2020 will be the first issue.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Just have to physically be present to show how you are working so hard and respecting the seniority of your boss. 

Knowing what I know about Japanese company culture, I suspect there‚Äôs lots of moments behind the scenes fans would find more infuriating. They seem to have bad management and management can make or break the company in Japan. Look up ‚Äúblack kigyo‚Äù, basically refers to companies with ridiculously shitty working conditions.

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","When someone asks that I get anxiety and change the subject asap. It's a pointless conversation.

If I say I'm hurting, what are they going to say in response? 

It's either 'I feel bad for you'.

Well that doesn't help me. You can't know what it's like. What would help is getting me out of the pain.

Or the other response is, ""A lot of people have their struggles, you just have to pull through it"".

Well that sounds like they invalidate my pain, if that's the case then I don't want to be seen as the guy that whinges because I hate it when others do it. And no, I don't have to pull through it. Where's the end? I had my dreams, but the cost of a life in even more pain is obviously not worth it. I'll take the scrapes of happiness where I can get it.",1575158483

They've given away everything it means to be a fiscal conservative, family values, pretty much any redeeming factors of conservatives to placate a cult of personality that they helped to create over the past 40 years, hell, since Nixon and the Southern Strategy.

A 1-2 day trip to Kawaguchi-ko is an idea if you want to see Mt Fuji. It's a nice town. But clear skies and seeing Fuji isn't guaranteed so it's a risk if you're going there specifically to see Mt Fuji.

So during September my friend (15m) who I‚Äôm gonna call Jason had been talking to this girl Alexa (15F) they never saw each other in real life and were talking for about 2 weeks before they started FaceTiming. They then started dating after about 3 weeks of knowing eachother and they did not once meet in person. Then after 3 days of them being Alexa broke up with Jason. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal and neither of them even considered it a relationship. But during the time they talked Jason introduced her to me and our main friend group and we‚Äôd all occasionally FaceTime together.


So after a while me (15m) and Alexa sort of talked a little more and I was interested in her. So I asked Jason if I could act on it and ask her out. He said yes though he seemed to not expect her to have feelings for me too. Me and Alexa started dating. Jason in the beginning made fun of our relationship but eventually got over it and just accepted it. Me and her went on many dates did stuff sexually and had been very intimate. Eventually after almost 2 months of ya dating she decided to break up with me. I was very upset about it for a bit but eventually got over it. A WEEK after Jason hit her up again on insta to attempt to get back with her . I asked why he would do that and he said he wasn‚Äôt having much luck with girls recently and so he was re-attempting with her. I got really mad. But he says I‚Äôm TA because he allowed it when I did the same thing 


I eventually just said this was not at all the same thing BECUASE they dated for three days and never saw eachother in person. While me and her had a longer and more intimate relationship and the breakup actually hurt

"stardomjoshi","t5_3epmj","If anything NJPW is now a lot bigger oversea's then it ever was and it's at least back to been the number 1 wrestling company in Japan, it's producing some of the greatest wrestling of the last decade and they do successful tours aboard. They are now about to do two successful nights in Tokyo Dome in January. Bushiroad have done a great job for NJPW. They learned from mistakes like not signing their talent to long term contracts after losing AJ Styles and Nakamura for letting them run down their contracts.

Just my opinion, I don't see any changes with the in ring work. That stay the same, you will still get matches most weeks. I could see them not giving big MOTY type matches away until the big money shows though. I think gradually the smaller indie type shows will fade out. I think you will get a lot more slicker product then you did before that's for sure. The camera work will take a massive jump in quality as well as editing.

I think you get a commentary team put in place, and it be cool if they gave a spot to a Joshi legend or Stardom talent. The show will be gradually aimed at a younger audience and a female one too. So expect a lot of filmed segments with for example Mayu going shopping with Arisa with cheesy music to connect with girls and women. A bit like All Japan Women segment's of the 80's and 90's. you probably see a change in some of talent's character's to probably going down that route. you might see makeovers for some talents.

I could see the end of talent probably selling their own merch, and fans meeting up after shows to get pictures taken with talents and getting autographs. I could see the only chance you meeting the talents, might be at fan fests and stuff like that. Also booking tickets with talents might come to a end gradually as well.

The creative booking will change with some talent. I think personally you will probably see more of heel and face divide then you did under Rossy's ownership. You might see change in some factions, with someone turning heel or face overnight that won't make sense to more diehard Stardom fans. I definitely see it been a bit strange for long term fans. That's my feeling on what Changes I see.",1575158487

Which isn't the story but is why I was in Nigeria. Me and a coworker had some down time as we had sourced the problem fairly quickly.The two of us decided to take a stroll through the small village and check out the locals.

As we strolled along we spied a bush meat market and decided to have a look. Before we quite got there I noticed several of the folks  hurriedly putting away what looked like a  human leg that had been butchered much like one would any animal being offered as a cut of meat.

I didn't say much other than,"" Hey, that looked like a man's leg"". My friend asked if the heat was getting to me because he sure hadn't seen anything of the sort. 

Shortly thereafter we flew back to Texas and that was the end of it. I mean I know what I saw and it wasn't an animal's leg, it was a humans.Needless to say Nigeria was a blast. If I ever get the opportunity to go again I will. Probably stick to a vegan diet though. Just in case.",1575158489

So for instance, if you‚Äôre applying for high schools (yes, Japanese high schools have applications processes and entry exams) then having ‚Äúcompleted Senbazuru‚Äù on your application could put it ahead of others who are equally qualified.

"Hijabis","t5_2tgrb","As someone who provides this kind of advice frequently, I'll put my reasoning here and feel free to challenge or poke holes in areas you think I'm wrong. 

For me, it's mostly a question of practicality. Take the example you present in another comment of a woman being forced to marry. In that situation, the unfortunate reality is the woman does not have the power to change what is being done by others to her. She does have power in that case, often times she can actively stop what is happening to her or leave the situation. But those options come with possible consequences harm - potential retaliation, damaging or breaking of close relationships, etc. 

Someone with more privilege who enters the situation doesn't have to fear those consequences as much. They can take unpopular positions and are insulated from consequences by whatever authority or privilege they have, and in turn they can insulate the victim from consequences. And unfortunately, in our patriarchal societies and subcultures, men are more likely to be in those positions of power and privilege. It's wrong and it's unfair. But also, in that moment, it may be the safest option to minimize harm for the woman while getting her out of that terrible situation. 

Ive known people being pushed into marriages they don't want, who see the marriage as a better outcome than losing their parents. Whether or not I agree, that's the decision they make. In their case, asking someone to intervene is an option they'll take, because it provides a path for them that doesn't involve breaking from their parents. 

Of course in a perfect world women should never have to rely on others, especially men, to protect rights that they should have regardless. And I think we should always be actively working towards that world. And I want to add that as long as the world is unequal, I think people with privilege have a responsibility to use their power to help others. 

I do 100% agree with your point though that many people do not have anyone of the sort they can turn too. Too many people fail at their responsibility to help others. And it's something I'll take into consideration when offering such advice.

Now I was looking at getting a trainer again, so all my info is from online. All trainers might get an issue, but the manufacturers will take care and replace it. A friend got a new Suito, but it had (known) issues, and she‚Äôs getting it fixed. So if you‚Äòre worried about that, I think you shouldn‚Äòt, they are getting better.

About the noise: Try to find comparisons on youtube. I think all of those videos don‚Äòt really sound like reality, but you can compare the noise to shift noises or so.

One lady once complained about a maybelline foundation and demanded to know why the matte finish had a 2 dollar coupon on all of them and not the dewy finish ones. I told her I didn't know but called a CSM for assistance. She asked another lady that was zoning in Cosmetics before me and mockingly said she didn't know either. They never came for like 15 minutes. She ended up going to customer services to complain. She came back and a manager talked to her and just gave her the foundation for me to ring up. He never told me head on to do price override but she told me he said to, in a rude manner. I rung it up and made it two dollars less.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

That's not how women operate. The percent of men most of us would bang based on a picture is like .0001%. Meanwhile, far more than .0001% of men are getting sex.

This is where the ""80% of men are incels"" meme comes from. In their minds 80% of men are not attractive enough to fuck and if they are getting fucked, the women can't be attracted to them at all because ""women only find 80% of men attractive.""

Yes, it may not be 'as easy' as the setup is now. But it's definitely possible and yes there will still be errors and issues with it because that's how technology works. I'm surprised he doesn't have a tech wizard coding his shit, and can only imagine his back-end folk are just too stoned to bother doing much outside of what Shopify requires for 'coding', because I'll be the first to tell you it's very minimal work.

They would have to determine how long things can be held in-cart for. The only thing connection would have to do with it is if the connection to the site timed out or crashed, like the Shane launch. That was affecting most people, not just one or two. Many people who ended up getting the collection also faced those same hurdles, so I don't think anyone really missed out on behalf of their connection or computer, but more because the website just couldn't stay up long enough for a lot of us to deal.

And no, the game wouldn't change.

These last two gunfights I just did I was rank 20 and my PUG teammates were around rank 40-50 and we were going up against players at rank 80-155. Like wtf.

"FATErpg","t5_2toez","In a game like D&amp;D, giving other characters a chance to grab the falling character in the nick of time is an OK solution.  It's cinematic and tense, but you have to be prepared for the small chance that nobody manages to save the falling character.  What happens if they actually fall?  Thin rock bridge over a pool of lava, someone slips, everybody rolls terrible... RIP?

In Fate, it's much easier to confront the characters with truly deadly obstacles.  Success is always an option.  Would you like to plummet to certain doom in the lava?  Or would you like to succeed at a cost?  The choice is clear.  You just need to come up with a suitable cost.

Whenever something happens and I don't already have a clear idea of what needs to happen, I try to get the players to fill it in for me.  I let them narrate their successes as well as their failures.  This way they can decide for themselves how their character deals with these matters.  Some players like to attribute success to competence and blame failure on circumstances, others blame success on luck and attribute failure to ineptness.  Whatever makes them feel good about their character.  That is perhaps Fate's greatest strength.",1575158494

"tombprospectors","t5_3fokg","Was in no way asking to cheat the system, I think you misunderstood my question..

I‚Äôm asking how to gem the blades the best with what I have, not to make them match other builds in damage output. Would flat arc be better for blades or should I just get phys attack gem or arc scaling.

I specifically asked how to make my r1/r2 attacks of the kos parasite hit like a truck, because I know the r1 attacks and the explosion aoe have different damage multipliers or whatever...



I‚Äôm asking the most optimal builds for specifically the three weapons I presented based on the stats that I have....I don‚Äôt understand your response lol. The answers I‚Äôve gotten before have been minimal in terms of what effects to look for and where, not ‚Äúyeah I can‚Äôt help you there dude‚Äù

A few tips:

* I've DM'd you a link to submit your round with the correct title.
* Make sure your round can't be solved using Reverse-Image-Search (RIS):
    * Google isn't the only RIS engine! Try using a browser extension like Reveye ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reveye-ris/)) to check multiple engines at once.
    * If you need to, you can apply a mask to your image to trick RIS. Try our online masking tool [here](https://imagemasker.github.io).
* Once you've got the next round up, let us know how you solved this one!
* Feel free to join us in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D2t9fN2) to discuss your round and future rounds.

In our last campaign our characters became strong enough to fight gods, and due to some wacky shit, the entire pantheon of gods was killed by a primordial being. We kill it, we all become gods.

50 Years later, we play as said god's descendants (or not) and it created some really interesting characters. I actually played as an alchemist who had nothing to do with my old character and followed one of the other player's god.

But because he was an alchemist he was able to learn and test for godblood. Which was an extremely potent ingredient to making drugs that super powered anybody who used them. He ended up becoming one of the most important characters in the game as he also learned how to dispell the godblood which had been used to resurrect the big bad every time we killed him.

At the end battle, we got to fight alongside our old characters in a massive battle and it was beyond awesome.",1575158500

Cool. The overwhelming majority of people can't sustain that lifestyle. Even if they could, the planet couldn't. A plant-based future is the only one that works for everyone *and* saves the planet.

&gt;This is where I have problems with veganism. It tends to be very dogmatic and irrational. It says it solves problems for animals but it really solves problems for humans guilt.

Not really. That analysis plays into stereotypes and paints a very clear picture of where you get your opinions about veganism. If you're unclear, this is the definition most vegans subscribe to: ""Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose."" This eliminates factory farming, yes, but also all other forms of animal agriculture, which, in the West, are completely unnecessary and unsustainable in the long term. A plant-based lifestyle, conversely, addresses [numerous pervasive health issues](https://youtu.be/8AL4EX53gFY), [the decline of our ecosystems and the warming of our planet](https://youtu.be/Z0LPSWtfGnQ), and [the most ubiquitous and largest system of animal exploitation and abuse the world has ever seen](https://youtu.be/w8B547L5VkQ). Fringe issues like whether or not we should eat roadkill have absolutely no bearing on these stark realities and disagreement over them don't discredit in the slightest this very simple and effective solution: don't fund animal agriculture.",1575158501

Thanks!

&gt; I also don't see Czechia and Slovakia forming as separate countries, or Yugoslavia pushing that far into modern day Austria.

Those regions of modern day Austria were inhabited by ethnic Slovenes who wanted to remain part of Austria. There was a plebiscite there, but only because of the 14 points of Woodrow Wilson. If not for those Yugoslavia would have just annexed the region and everyone would have just assumed the Slovenes there were happy about it

&gt; let alone surviving until 1928 

I did say they had a lot of instability and uprisings. But their large &amp; more modernised army would be able to crush these rebellions.

&gt; but I really do not see the Russian Empire taking East Prussia

"EDH","t5_2scee","1. What's something all my decks have in common? It could be a specific color or colors, a certain number of colors, or even a type of strategy. Usually it's as many that I can think of.
2. What would be the most different deck that I could build? For example, let's say I had a Breya deck, a Yarok deck, a Tatyova deck, a Prossh deck, and a Sliver Overlord deck. Well, with five decks as all multicolored, I would limit my choices to monocolored. Then, I see that each of my decks have blue and black, blue and green, or black and green, so I would limit my choices to either mono-red or mono-white. Lastly, I see that all my decks have to do with either artifacts, creatures, or lands, so I would build a spellslinger deck or an enchantress deck. With all that in mind, I would probably build either mono-white enchantress or mono-red spellslinger.

In your situation, it sounds like you already know what commander you want to build, so I would start by looking at EDHREC's page for Multani to firstly see what themes people usually build for him. Click on that theme, and see what important cards are used in that theme. From there, let your imagination go wild!",1575158503

4) I‚Äôve never tried to teach a language to somebody overseas because I never felt the need to, if I go to a country I won‚Äôt teach everybody I meet English just so I can interact with them, I‚Äôll have learned that language first, which is the exact reason I learned French.

"Pete_Buttigieg","t5_nahld","Right, and I've also seen people conflate ""public goods"" ""public utilities"" and ""goods with positive externalities."" 

education is strictly a good with positive externalities (innovation, productivity, general ""rub-off"" effects on others they interact with). Society receives a substantial benefit from an educated individual, but make no mistake--the *majority* of the benefit goes directly to the individual. 

""public goods"" have two main features: (1) they are non-excludable, meaning it is impossible to prevent someone from enjoying the benefit even if they don't pay (think national defense); and (2) they don't have problems with rivalry--meaning more people using the good/service does not diminish its value for others. 

obviously, its easy to exclude someone from the direct benefit of college if they don't pay (although they still get the benefit of positive externalities associated with other peoples' education). rivalry in education is obvious too--class size affects educational quality, and if everyone attended college we would need to massively expand our facilities and staff, likely hiring more adjunct, non-tenure tract professors.

next, ""public utilities"" refer to *necessities* that, by their nature, create natural monopolies, thus requiring regulatory intervention. for example, economies of scale in delivering electricity (the electrical grid infrastructure) mean that it can only work if one entity provides it. The very history of education/its current state demonstrate that it is not a ""public utility"" because colleges do not form *natural monopolies*, if anything they might form natural oligopolies--having just a few large institutions in a single state. and even then, we see that a public utility conception of education doesn't hold up. different models are successful--many people choose smaller schools over larger ones, and many smaller schools are in fact perceived as more prestigious.

additionally, educational institutions lack (somewhat) the coercive power that a true utility provider would. if an electrical company wanted to price-gouge, citizens would be powerless because they need electricity and no one else can provide it (say only one company has their lines hooked up to your house.) but if a college tries to price gouge, generally speaking, people have other options (although not necessarily equivalent options). people won't starve or freeze to death in the short-term simply because they are not enrolled in college. etc

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","This is how business works. You don't win by doing favours. You should always pay your friends and family the full amount because you love and support them. You should help them when they need it and also pay them in full. If you expect a discount because you put in effort, that's on you, not the other person. That's entitlement. 

Never give something away unless you are willing to never have it returned. That's just a common sense principle. Don't loan your friends money unless you are willing to lose it. Don't lend your car unless you are prepared for it to get totaled in an accident. Shit happens and you should never expect to get anything back in full. Especially with family and friends. 

The easiest way to destroy your relationships is to do something for people and expect returns. My parents started a comic book business after I got them into comic cons and stuff. I still to this day help them out, for free whenever I can. I run a multi-million dollar company and I'm still standing around a comic book booth selling comics for a dollar or 3 bucks or 5/8 bucks. I didn't do it for me, I do it for them.

That's because of personal opinions not faith. 

&gt;You‚Äôre right. Hitting them with the same verse‚Äôs the parents did when they disowned them is super empathetic. Congratulations. It doesn‚Äôt look like the church put something on to lure them into a trap or anything.

I never said hit them with Leviticus 18:22, I say preach the gospel. That Christ died for their sins and that if they just come to him and repent, they will be forgiven and be given eternal life. Is there something offensive about that?

&gt;Would it be exhibiting empathy if I decided to hit you out of nowhere with the same words that your parents used to disown you?

Would it be empathetic if you had curable cancer and you decided not to do chemo because you didn't want to loose your hair and I sat by and said nothing? Would it be wrong if I casually brought it up? Would everyone around you not bring it up if they cared about you?


&gt;Then show some basic empathy and respect and just let them eat without shoving the same verses down their throat for an hour or two.

No one is saying say, 
Leviticus 18:22 ESV
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.

I'm saying say something like, 
John 3:16-17 ESV

&gt;  
&gt;15800 Imperial Seat moved to Byzantium in retreat before provincial rebellions and minor jihads.  
&gt;  
&gt;14700-14608 THE GREAT STRUGGLE: The Century Without an Emperor.  
&gt;  
&gt;14608 Discoveries in America allow Madrid to attain the status of the Imperial Seat,  
&gt;  
&gt;14512 BATTLE OF ENGUCHANNEL. Seat of Empire moved from Madrid to London.  
&gt;  
&gt;14500-14200 THE GOLDEN AGE OF INVENTION: Development of radio, television, atomics, rocketry, genetics, and the computer. '  
&gt;  
&gt;14255 First atomics demonstrated in an intraprovincial war. Seat of Empire moved to Washington.  
&gt;  
&gt;14100-13600 THE LITTLE DIASPORA: The solar system is colonized, and the population of Terra is eventually outnumbered by 20 to 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;13402 Ceres gains the Imperial Seat after a planetoid strikes Terra.

The point of divergence between Dune and the real world has to be somewhere in this span. Are you sure that it doesn't occur until until after the 20th century?",1575158508

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","You'll probably die a bit more than other classes, generally because Warriors don't have any real escape buttons, especially if you are new to the game. 

You can mitigate this by sticking to green level mobs and quests (the estimated difficulty of NPCs in the game range from grey, green, yellow, orange, red and skull) and picking up gear that can help you (training Bows, Crossbows and Guns and using one of them to range pull mobs safely, there's a quest in the Badlands that rewards a trinket called the Nifty Stopwatch, Alchemy can be useful in being able to craft your own potions, etc.)

You may want to look at playing a Combat or Sword Spec Rogue as well. Rogues are technically more fragile than Warriors but tend to have an easier time leveling due to the tools that are available to them. 

Warriors are a fun class, though, and just understand you're going to be a little slow going compared to other classes.",1575158508

Team feels solid to me for the most part, except I'm not skilled enough to make good use of Insigne.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","My understanding, which may be incorrect, is that it works something like this:

When an item drops, it rolls for rarity in some big range.  Low roles are whites, then there's a range for blues, and a range for yellows, and a range for uniques.  Within the range for uniques, there are different tiers, so a rarer unique requires a higher roll than a more common one.  If no unique exists for that base for that tier, you get the next tier down instead, or a rare if no unqiues exist below that rarity at all.

For example, let's say rarity is from 1 to 100 (I'm sure it's bigger, but just for the sake of example).  A common unique like Cameria's Maul requires, say, a 90+, while a rare one like Mjollner requires a 99+.  In that case, if Cameria's Maul didn't exist, any roll of 90-98 would be a rare, not a Mjollner.

If this is correct (which I can't guarantee), then when a unique is added to the game that is a lower rarity tier than any other unique for that base, it does increase the overall odds of a unique drop (since it means some drops that would have been rares before are uniques now).  If a rarer unique is added, though, it just makes whatever the next tier down of unique for that base a little rarer.

So the addition of Cameria's Maul did not reduce the odds of finding or chancing a Mjollner, but Mjollner's existence does reduce the odds of finding or chancing a Maul.",1575158514

&gt;&gt;if youre within a kilometer

&gt;Thats basically shooting range.

From the front, maybe. From behind, most shots at 1km are completely wasted.

&gt;just outrun and dive from overhead?

Let's say I make a guns pass at Mach 1.10 and miss at 300-600m. Let's say I pulled for an angle and bled some speed, but I'm still going Mach 1.0, ~1100kph. The hunter has unrivaled MER, so he's probably still going 1000+ kph. If I don't pull hard to keep behind his 3-9 line, the hunter will have ample time to SRAAM me, as even a 200kph advantage, that's 55m/s. After 10 seconds, I would only be at 550m, right at the SRAAM sweet spot.

If you attack a hunter F.6, and fail to kill him in the first pass, you need to stay behind him, or you will die. This requires bleeding speed, and suddenly you're in the hunter's territory. Anywhere in front of a hunter F.6 under 1.2km is death.",1575158517

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","I hate TW3, and I understand people who love it. But you should hear from both sides to decide.

Why I hate it? Well, as far as RPGs go, TW3 does not bring new stuff ti the table. The progress system is the good old get a skill point per level and spend it, but your choices don't feel impactful. The crafting system is way too cluttered. You get too many different materials but almost never enough of each one and I found myself looking online where to find a specific item I needed more times than I'd like. The open map is a lie. Sorry fans, it's a big lie. The map itself is huge but you can't explore over half of it. The points of interest in the map are repetitive. 


If you didn't play the first 2 the story has almost no weight and you don't understand the role of half the characters. The main story is basically you doing favors for people in exchange for info which will bring you to anither favor in exchange for more info which... You get the idea.

Now, Witchers are monster hunters and the monster hunting part of the game is pure trash. The got some good rpg features but the devs made a big mistake with this. You just follow a quest marker, spam the same attack button for a few seconds a d fight over.

And this brings us to the worst combat system I've seen in RPGs. The combat is extremely unbalanced. You take more damage from a fat guy 10 levels below you punching with bare hands than from an earth elemental 10 levels above you. Parrying feels underpowered. It's just a not qell designes combat.

If you have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a better game. It's somewhat similar and everything TW3 does, Horizon does better.

People will disagree with me. TW3 is a good game, but far from a new experience or somehing to really remember.",1575158517

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

Anyway, while we try to track down the Admins to put a stop to this mess, **reposts are unrestricted\* for the next two days**. After being denied for the past 30 days it must feel so good to finally let it out, alongside the other 680k weebs.

That said, it was not all sunshine and rainbows throughout [November](https://redd.it/dpwdn5). Some people just couldn't hold it in for an entire month. 905 memers blew their load early and got dragged to our dungeon for a round of spanking. 85 of those users liked the glow on their bum so much that they came in for a second, slightly extended, stay at the Animemes' torture dungeon. Last but not least, we have a chosen 12 apostles who after 10 days of bum tenderizing said to themselves: ""You know what? I need the full 21 day luxury stay. If I can ever sit again after that spanking I want my money back""

Unfortunately these chosen people are going to miss out on this glorious celebration of unoriginal content, though it is unlikely to affect their posting behavior in the future if the bans didn't do it.

As for actual specifics for this event:

- Rule 9 is suspended for the next 48 hours
 - Spamming the same post is still prohibited. There are over 500k posts made to the sub, everyone can grab a unique one.
- Regular rules still apply. Even if it was OK in the past, the repost must pass current muster.
- Fresh content is still allowed as normal, but might have to compete with an abnormally high amount of reposts.

"marijuanaenthusiasts","t5_2uzej","While this certainly is a striking picture, for the record and for anyone who thinks this would be a neat thing to try to duplicate: this is not at all good for the tree. This is almost certainly English ivy which has nearly covered over the brick wall in the foreground, as well as the trunk and major branches of the tree. Here's why this is a problem (courtesy of [NC St. Coop Ext.](https://caldwell.ces.ncsu.edu/2019/04/english-ivy-friend-or-foe/)):

&gt; English ivy can also damage trees and neighboring plants. English Ivy has two kinds of roots: roots that are in the ground and aerial or adventitious roots. It is the aerial roots, sometimes called rootlets, that help English Ivy climb trees or structures. On trees, it will climb the trunk, spread to branches, and eventually cover the leaves, preventing light from reaching the trees leaves. The ivy also adds extra weight to the tree, making it more susceptible to limb breakage. Often you will see trees that lose all lower limbs to the upper reach of the English Ivy, and only have leaves and branches above the ivy limit. 

And if that isn't bad enough:

&gt; The protective habitat English ivy provides is an attractive habitat for voles, which are rodents that feed on plant roots or the base of tree trunks. Voles can cause serious damage to plants when present. English ivy harbors a bacterial disease, bacterial scorch, that affects maples, oaks, and elms.",1575158519

Mostly to play below their natural rank/skill level. 

The game uses a hidden score called MMR (MatchMaking Rank I think) to match players for games.  If you are good, over time, your MMR can get pretty high.  The idea is that players are always evenly matched.

Some people dislike this and want to dominate every match.  So they make second accounts that will start out at a low MMR.  There are limits to how much it will jump an account each round, so even dominating on a new account, they will be in low MMR for a while.

On consoles, one copy of a game can be used by I beleive 5 different accounts.  Like my Won has OW on his Xbox One, and I can play it using my Xbox Live sign in, without buying it.  On PC, this doesn't work.  If we both want to play, we both have to put out money.  So these alt accounts are more common on Consoles.

There are some who claim they have alt accounts because they are ""Tank/Heal/Whatever mains and want to be able to practice as a character/Class they are poor at.

He died 12 years before the Nag Hammadi texts were discovered and mostly dabbled in Hermeticism which isn't Gnostic. Gnostics view the material world as evil, Hermeticists don't. When someone doesn't reject the world he's not a Gnostic, this is how we know that Kabbalah/Freemasonry/Thelema aren't Gnostics - they don't seek to escape the world, they want to rule it. Clearly jewish/satanist.

I can now point my finger at my 21 month old when he's getting into stuff that could hurt him and he'll leave whatever it is alone and go do something else. I don't have to pop his butt much anymore. 

If you're parenting right, it's not something you do often. Do it all the time and for everything and it loses its effectiveness pretty quick. If you spank for everything, you may as well not be doing it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not OP but I vaguely believe in reincarnation because I am cursed.  I must have killed someone in a bathroom stall in a past life.  Whenever I'm in the bathroom, even if I'm just in there peeing for like 30 seconds, if anyone walks in they try to SLAM themselves into the stall door to get in, even though there are plenty of other open stalls.  Many, many times I've yelled ""occupied!"" or ""just a sec!"" and they will actively engage in trying to still get into my stall.  I have discussed this with my friends and while someone will occasionally not realize they're in a stall and try to open it then say ""oh, sorry!"" and move on - that's not what I experience.  

It's like a continuous effort by the universe to make public bathrooms a living hell for me.  I work in a high rise office with \~4-5 offices on my floor using a main bathroom.  There's maybe 15 women who work on my floor and five stalls.  So, there's usually no one or one person in the bathroom, sometimes maybe two, rarely three, and almost never more than that.  Every goddamn time I'm in there someone comes in, sees the four open stalls, and tries to body slam into mine.

&gt;because god forbid if anything were to happen to our relationship

This combined with the open relationship sounds like you're not ready to commit to her. Whose idea was the open relationship?
She's already attached to the child and sees her as her own. She's probably worried you're not as invested in your relationship and will take her away from her one day. As someone else mentioned, if you don't trust her to be your daughter's legal mother then you don't trust her enough to be marrying her.

**ETA**
Have you considered how this will affect your daughter? Your fiance is the only mother she knows. If you do split up in a few years, do you plan on just ripping your child away from the mother she's grown to love and attach to? Do you have any idea what kind of trauma that would cause a child? The level of selfishness in this post is astounding. And thos obsession you seem to have with blood purity is just plain weird. You're a parent now!! Stop and think about you child!!!",1575158521

There is nothing wrong in my opinion about sex, actually, kids should be told about this at a young age, when they are mature enough to not make it a big deal of it and to understand it. For most kids that is around the age of 9-11. Kids should not be sheltered from stuff like this because there is the real world out there, and I have seen some kids so sheltered and so immature that they can‚Äôt even handle criticism.  The dude is 13, 13 year olds can handle this, they won‚Äôt become violent or have underage sex because of this, that is crazy talk.

the real solution to all questions like that is answered by the 14th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.  

Because in that chapter, Paul isn't talking about meat and herbs or holidays.  He's talking about the fact that we have an individual responsibility to God to follow the dictates of our own conscience and draw the line where our individual walk with God tells us to place it, without trying to impose those dictates on others lest we make them stumble in their walk with the Lord

Now I can guess your next question so I'll get ahead of it.  This is not the same as getting carte blanche to place those standards wherever is personally convenient.  Honest soul searching introspection is required to determine between you and the Lord what constitutes an honest attempt at righteousness.  You can try to lie, but the funny thing about lying to yourself is that you're never fooling anybody.",1575158521

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","Go to a shelter and ask for a bed tonight. You won't get one.

Was homeless for little over a year. The 3 times I actually lucked out I stood in a line to get a number to maybe get a bed from 12pm till 5pm. Lots of people tuned away, those with jobs had no way of getting a bed. Then, each of those nights the staff would actually steal from you. The other people there would lie about being homeless, start fights with people and then have friends to back up the lie of who started it so they could get friends in for the night. They would then go around selling drugs. The shelters kick you out around 4-6am. The ones I had gone to were extremely dirty on the inside and one place was infested with bed bugs. Staff told me that was impossible, they washed everything. The clothes they had available, they had some underwear there that actually still had skid marks so I highly doubt they washed anything.

Shelters are a business. They do what little they can get away with with no resources to actually help. The higher ups put on a facade to make it seem and look like they are doing everything they can to help. In reality they are not. Look up stories from the news. Lots of these places take in donations, yet the money doesn't go to anything useful, it goes to the owners pockets.",1575158523

We spent a week, packing, discarding and cleaning, and cleaning more.

Try wearing one to the store. The nice thing about an oring if you are out shopping and it falls off, just put it on your finger and keep walking. People just think it's one of those rings that fell off your hand. Or just leave it because you have 99 more at home. People just think it was stuck to the bottom of your shoe or something. If you are out and a DTR or something falls off, you are going to get some looks.

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","Until you get more experienced, don't install anything that is not from your distro's official repositories in the package manager. Steam is of course probably OK, and I have no idea about Origin.

Set a strong password for your user, and if your distro uses sudo do not disable the requirement for password authentication. If it sets a password for root, make it a different strong password than your user.

Your distro should by default block incoming network connections, and you should not change this until you know more. For a desktop it's probably not going to be needed, but if you want to run server software it is.

Your browser is going to be the biggest vulnerability, because it does what the user tells it to. This is really no different from windows or linux or mac; don't fall for phishing, don't download and execute arbitrary programs, no you didn't win a free ipad, the usual stuff.

If you follow those rules it's pretty hard to screw things up. You're in more danger when you get just enough experience to think you're safely breaking the rules when you're not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Linux is getting more common these days, so security threats are definitely there

This has always been a huge myth that Linux has less viruses because it's less common. That has nothing to do with it because the more VALUABLE targets have had just as much if not more representation of Linux for a long time now. Linux is more secure because you do not by default do a google search for software, download,  and install it, you use package managers with cryptographically verified packages. If you use a mainstream distro, the vast majority of your software comes from the same single source, so for a malicious vulnerability to be introduced requires several failings of community review. If I want to go download a virus I can do so right now, but it requires making a whole bunch of bad decisions that are seen as standard practice on Windows.",1575158527

First, you want to simplify the denominator by adding the two fractions together. You can't do that unless the denominators of those two fractions are the same, so we modify the denominators in the first step. Once the denominators are the same, you add the two fractions together by adding the numerators and combining the denominators. Lastly, we need to take a reciprocal of the resulting fraction in the denominator.",1575158530

She clearly doesn‚Äôt want to get expelled and will blame you if she does. 

Now, it‚Äôs your turn to make the choice. 

I know you don‚Äôt want to force her and I know you want to save her. 

But you can‚Äôt save someone who doesn‚Äôt believe they need saving.

IT should do what it can within its ability to make those other employees as productive and happy with their environment as possible. The cost of a macbook is nothing to the cost of replacing a great employee who left because they had to fight IT for the best tools for their job, instead of feeling like IT was doing everything they could to help them perform at their peak.

Are there places that this isn't remotely true, yes of course. I think it would be a pretty boring way to work though, just doing the bare minimum for users. I think the whole IT vs. users attitude many here take is a sign of pretty bad corporate culture.

I use a mac at work. I'm perfectly happy with windows and run it on my own desktop, but for my job I prefer the tools on available on a mac including the OS. Other employees are happy with their windows laptops as perfectly good tools exist there too. Would I leave if there was a good reason I needed to use windows, absolutely not. Would I leave if I had to use windows because IT was too lazy to support more than one OS in 2019, yea probably. Luckily our IT team is awesome, and find more ways everyday to keep help the rest of us be as productive as possible.

Personally, I bound Drift to Left Paddle and Ball Cam to Right Paddle. I bound jump to Y and air roll left and right to X and B.

In addition, the triggers have two stages. Means on my right trigger, the first stage of pressing is analog and used for Drive Forward, but pressing stage 2 is Boost.

End result: My thumb is always on Jump unless in the air or trying to look back (which is Right Trackpad Press and pretty rare), my index fingers are always on Drive Forward and Drive Backward, and my middle fingers are always on Drift and Ball Cam. It's a slight edge over having to move your fingers around, means you can react slightly faster in certain situations.",1575158532

"abusiveparents","t5_2sqmq","Oh my dear, you are already better than the people who hurt you.
I was hit, slapped, thrown and emotionally abused my whole childhood. As the omdest of six and homeschooled, I practically raised my youngest siblings (mom and dad cared way too much about themselves to think I deserved a childhood).
At about 12 or 13, I was watching my 2 or 3 year old brother outside and he wasn‚Äôt obeying me as I wanted him to. I lashed out and hit him - and it was easy. I didn‚Äôt even think, it just happened like I had been training all my life for it. I wept. I cried so hard and felt such deep shame and regret.
I‚Äôm 27 now and that brother is a sr in high school and we talk about how messed up mom is and how we need to grow and be better. So much of the wrong ways I treated my younger siblings is now a conversation starter about how to grow and be better.
Your child knows you love her. Use this as a way to teach her what it is to be a flawed human, and how to apologize and grow. She will mess up too and she needs to know that you will still love her when she does. This doesn‚Äôt make you a bad mom, it makes you a person.

Ultimately I think there are a lot of things WP could be doing better, but at the end of the day all I want is a good story. HS2 is a good story so far, in my opinion. Twitter takes are secondary to that. If some of those opinions start to bleed into HS2 itself, I might change my opinion. It's too early to judge. But, we should fund artists to create the media we want. I'm not judging people for doing that, and I'm not judging you for not doing it. But if there's an option to help an artist create stuff you like, and you're able to help them, you probably should, as a general rule.

The God and Goddess of Wicca are personifications of aspects of Nature. Specific Gods and Goddesses are also personifications of particular elements of nature, within a cultural context.  
  
A patron God/ess is when the relationship between you and a particular deity is so strong that you are willing to dedicate your self to that deity. It is absolutely not necessary to have one, and the best way to get one is to wait until a Deity claims you for their own. I waited 25 years before I was claimed, and it was worth the wait.

(btw not every bucking horse has the fear of death some are just clever enough to know if they buck long enough they could get their will)

There is indeed a method (one of many methods that are existing, some brutal, some absolutely non-brutal and in-betweens) where you stress out the horse with that what you want until it gives up. But you can't do that forever and ever. It is like if you would work with a wild horse (like a Mustang not a Przewalski of course) that never learned to ""work"" with humans. You can go and build up trust over a longer time span or you can go the break-in way with pressure which will work much faster but can possibly traumatize the horse longterm.

There are so many approaches for working with horses, riding horses why using them in any form anyway, you can't say ""There is this method I didn't like hence all methods must be the same"".

While we can argue if horseback riding is good or bad your explanation is still bs. I have experience in handling horses for over 30 years now (starting at a very young age) and I have learned a lot over time. I was never a big rider and I hate riding competitions, it puts so much pressure on anyone involved. I have a horse but he has a leg injury for a few years now (that was not caused due to riding) and I can't ride him anyway and I don't want to ride another horse. I love horses and roaming through nature just you and your horse exploring things gave me and him joy but I don't know if I would do it again. We can now walk through nature side by side but it is exhausting for both of us kind of, we live in a hill area.",1575158533

If your body is well grounded, there's also a chance the electrical cathode or anode providing a potential to generate the plasma could arc to your hand, sending hundreds of volts at high current through your body (no air, so either the plasma or your body are the lowest paths of resistance to ground).

I think about it a lot and see it as a privilege, and there‚Äôs a good deal of crime. I would be very nervous living in one of the largest cities in the world knowing almost anyone could be carrying. Sure, illegal guns are always going to be an issue, but the idea of the sheer number of idiots who might pull one out, terrifies me. 

My overall point is some way to ensure (if even partially) that people who own and carry guns, have the temperament. I realize that is impossible. I just can‚Äôt see opening the floodgates, so to speak, as the proper way forward. 

I appreciate what you‚Äôve said. You make a lot of great points, I‚Äôm just still not sold on it being so easy. A lot of my fears would be assuaged if police actually did their jobs, but that‚Äôs a whole other conversation!",1575158538

"dui","t5_2tqam","Almost same situation here.  Got a DWAI from NY but home state is MD.  Tbh I'm not sure if the 90 day suspension applies to your home state or if your home state would make a difference.  I *assumed* that since they said my 'NY license' was suspended when I left court and my lawyer said I could still drive in MD that my MD license was still valid.  Also the suspension did not go into effect immediately.  Believe I had a 20 day grace period.  I'm still not sure if I was driving under a suspended license in MD for those 90 days but I never received anything from the DMV  and I never checked, but I think if my license had been suspended in MD they would have let me know.  Still regret making this assumption since getting caught driving with a suspended license is no joke but I'd strongly recommend checking with NJ DMV.  

It took about half a year but the charge did eventually catch up with MD DMV (MVA here).  Whether that's a typical amount of time I have no clue.  Got a letter certified mail from DOT saying I had received points and that I would have to get IID for 6 months, the other option was to appeal.  Went to another lawyer and he said so go for an appeal since I had a clean record and would probably get probation before judgement.  By then I had already completed a 12 hour drug and alc class ordered by the NY judge which would be considered probation.  Get to my appeal day and the judge was like, nope, now you're getting a restricted license for 6 months and he yoinked my license on the spot.  So, yea I would say plan on something happening in NJ as far as the DMV is concerned.  Like you said hopefully you can overlap anything if they do end up honoring the NY suspension, but I don't think you can ask the DMV to start any consequences at a certain time since it all has to go through their system.  I think part of the reason I got a worse outcome in MD is because most other states don't have the DWAI level charge (believe CO is the only other) so they are forced to give their own mandatory minimum, so in my case getting an out of state DWAI made it worse than if I had been a NY resident.  One thing you might be able to do is find out how many points the DWAI will put on your driving record and then see what NJ does with that point level.  

Hope that helps, good luck.",1575158539

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. If you can remember, what age did you realize you're transgender?
   1. End 20s.
2. How long did it take you to get the courage to come out to family and friends?
   1. Less than a week.
3. How supportive were said family and friends?
   1. Friends were very supportive. Family too. Parents don't really get it though but they accept it.
4. If  you have finished transitioning, how long did it take? Do you still  experience dysphoria? If so, how much better is it than before?
   1. Only just started E. Feels great, but mostly emotionally. Skin is getting softer. Thighs felt a bit warmer that before. Less sweaty, especially in genital area.
5. How upset do you get when you are misgendered on accident? Are you more sad or angry?
   1. Nah, I don't care because I know I barely see myself as a woman. I might get very annoyed later if I feel like I pass and put in a lot of effort and people are dicks about it.
6. What is the best moment you've had while transitioning?
   1. All moments have been better than before transitioning. But most importantly the realization that I could still love myself despite being different. But that already hit me a week or so after finding out. The best part so far is thus the higher self-acceptance.
7. After  coming out, did you instantly start changing your appearance (new  clothes, haircut, etc.) did you wait a while, or did you not change your  appearance at all? If it took a while, how long did it take?
   1. The first thing I did was deciding to grow my hair out. So far I've been sloppy about the rest. Almost 2 months on E now. Started better skin- and haircare about a week ago. Results are okay.
8. What are a few things that happened while transitioning that you didn't expect or weren't warned about?
   1. Nothing weird so far.
9. How differently did friends and family treat you after coming out, if they treated you differently at all?
   1. Not yet, but I've noticed I've become way more social myself since coming out, probably because I accept myself more.
10. Have any previously unsupportive people become supportive? If so, how long did it take them?
   1. Nope.
11. What do you feel like made you have that ""Oh shit, I'm transgender"" moment?
   1. I was browing reddit and got redirected to r/egg_irl. Memes were very funny, first time I genuinely laughed in months, but they also often hit home very close. So basically that same evening I was wondering if I could be trans if I recognized so much things. So I just asked myself: Do you want to be a woman? And the answer was an immediate and enthusiast YES, directly followed by a scared NOOO. That went back and forth for a few days as I went through the bargaining stage untill I got stuck on yes. So then the question became: What do I want to do with this knowledge? Transition or not?
12. If  you are currently dating someone, did you meet them before, while, or  after transitioning? If you met them beforehand, what was their reaction  (were they indifferent? surprised?)? If you met them while  transitioning, did they initially think that you looked like your actual  gender or the one you were born with? If you met them after  transitioning, were they surprised to find out you used to be another  gender?
   1. I've dated some ladies in the past when I was still completely in the dark about being trans. Looking back I think they realized something about me was different, that I wasn't a typical guy. Anyway, the last one I dated was only a few weeks, and she quite literally asked if I was gay after our first (and last) night of sex. A while after I found out I told her. Shortly after she decided we shouldn't continue dating and that we should just stay friends. Haven't seen her since. Decided to stop dating for a while since I wanted to transition first and A) couldn't know what I'd be attracted to after transitioning and B) didn't want to get into a relationship with a straight girl who'd only leave me after transitioning.
13. Anything else you think is important or that you noticed while transitioning.
   1. Masturbating is way less taxing now. I'm only on low dose E. I used to feel relaxed but drained after masturbating, but now I feel relaxed and still energetic.",1575158543

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","This is straight up wrong. Quantum computing requires maintaining a number of properties that no one seriously in the field expects to get far in decades (if we have crazy unforeseeable breakthrough) or centuries (likely, if it's even possible), because the physics just aren't remotely close to being favorable.

The logic that quantum computing runs on is fundamentally not suited to solving a lot of problems that we'd need it to solve, on a purely mathematical level. The dumb bullshit algorithms that people talk about on the internet are built for, as far as we know, quite possibly totally impossible machines that have stupidly large numbers of qbits and maintenance of certain quantum properties for lengths of time more than a few orders of magnitude from anything we even conceive of potentially managing; neither of these things is like increasing speed or shrinking die size.

It's going to be a highly useful but highly specialized tool for certain classes of problems and simulating quantum effects in physical simulation. No one that understands the research ever claims otherwise in anything resembling a professional context. I only qualify that because someone might have written massively dishonest pop-sci, but I've never even seen an expert do anything but politely tear pop-sci stupidity down when asked, given the ridiculous degree of exaggeration and wholesale fiction.

As to the benefit of just having extra states instead of just being binary; talk to anyone with any experience in computability from either a CPSC focus or pure math. There's no advantage. They're all equivalent to the basic Turing Machine and the base whatever arbitrary number systems tend to just make the circuitry for math a bitch and a half and provide no real advantage.

You think it's arrogant because you have no idea what you're talking about; saying quantum computing is going to overtake classical computing for the set of problems binary is good at is like saying jets are going to overtake bicycles for visiting your friend down the street.",1575158546

Believing that someone should be employed without enough pay to get by with a reasonable life is just encouraging indentured servitude with more steps.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","An adventuring day is a venture into dangerous territory. A dungeon, crypt, swamp, outpost, castle, foreign plane, ect. It should begin with entering that area, and end with leaving it, or making camp inside it. 

Inside this dangerous territory, danger lurks around every corner. You can see how it would be easy to narratively justify 6-8 encounters when the party is lurking in hidden laboratory of a mad wizard, or the infernal castle of a demon lord. 

You can also see how its easy to limit long rests in areas like these. Enemy ambushes, dangerous terrain, or trapped room can trigger partway through an attempted long rest. You can even chain these one after the other, so sneak in 2-3 encounters before your players return to their long rest. It helps to know the layout and ecology of the enviroment ahead of time so you can consistently improvise these encounters.

Ultimately, you have to recognize that the game is called ""Dungeons and Dragons"" for a reason. Relatively small, confined locations with clearly delineated rooms and pathways each having their own ecology and traps and treasures make it easy to wring as many resources from a party as possible. 

Also, its important to recognize that not every day is an adventuring day. The time spent between dungeons is just as important, and in those encounters you can feel free to let your long rest class players go wild. Just make sure you include these long-form gauntlets to reel them back in and give the short-resters a time to shine.",1575158548

* Really no idea what you mean by Borderlands looting. There appeal of Borderlands is almost infinite procedurally generated guns and mods and all. The Outer Worlds has a really rather small amount of weapons and armor. You'll use the same couple weapons for 80% of the game. 
* There's the two companion, but I don't think any of them are written as well as some of the better ones in Mass Effect, and they lack even the depth of Mass Effect 1 in customization. 
* I guess it technically has Fallout Gameplay, but without as much customization. ""Fallout gameplay"" is pretty vague, anyway.
* The game's writing isn't anywhere near KOTOR imo, neither are it's decisions. 
* The story is decently similar to Bioshock, but without the depth and/or atmosphere. TOW never really takes itself seriously, while Bioshock did.

It‚Äôs impossible for a fetus to care or to not care about being murdered, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre making this comparison. And I never implied that consciousness makes you a full human, I said that you have to have basic human functions. Unconscious people have those functions wether they‚Äôre unconscious or not. 

And like I said before, I fetus doesn‚Äôt have the mental capacity *to* be unaware that they‚Äôre about to be killed, like an unconscious person does. A fetus is not developed enough to know anything about that, an unconscious person is. When I say ‚Äúhumans have thoughts and feelings while fetuses don‚Äôt‚Äù, I mean humans are fully developed to have thoughts and feelings, fetuses aren‚Äôt. An unconscious person is a full human, a fetus isn‚Äôt.

A child is a full human, they have all the functions necessary to be a full human. When you turn 18 you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúfull human‚Äù, you‚Äôre a fully developed human. A fetus is neither of those. And I never said that a child wasn‚Äôt a full human, I said they‚Äôre a developing human. Doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt a full human, if that makes sense.

In regards to the exaggerations, we don't know (as the general public) anything that has come of that budget. We're only ever informed of militarized technological advances long after they are decommissioned. A large portion of the budget is ""lost money"" which we have no clue where it went. That's terrifying for many reasons, one of which could be that the spending is simply not reported for security concerns.

You have a lot of self care and healing to do. If you‚Äôre in a safe place now use this time to seek out some support from someone one on one, also group and a doctor. Additionally you can find someone online you can chat with that understands it all, that will respond and be someone that will listen. You have a lot of healing to do. Take it one day at a time, be kind to yourself the best you can. Also what helped me was journal about it, start writing down your thoughts it gets it out of your head and it‚Äôs on paper, which makes it real.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I just want to follow on from this to throw out there that being a rapist doesn't mean someone who jumps out at people from the bushes and attacks them.

Our main image of rape and rapists as a society is as a violent, aggressive attack that you need to worry about walking home on a dark night. Obviously this happens too, but I think we're coming to reckon with the fact that far more sexual assault happens in a much more insidious way, with manipulation, pressure and (fundamentally) a lack of consent.

I don't generally consider myself a rape victim - but have I been in situations where I've been pressured into sex with a boyfriend who took ""no, I'm not in the mood"" as ""she just needs more convincing""? Sure. Not aggressive, not cruel, but selfish. 

I consider myself very lucky that for me ""it wasn't that bad"", because a lot of people experience a lot worse, and unfortunately it's a lot more common than people might know. This goes for all genders too.

While obviously being black and white and saying this kid = definite rapist (to be clear, not my opinion), but I don't think it's an unreasonable concern to have that someone who is raised (whether it's the mother's intention or not) to act on self interest, disregard the feelings of others and specifically their consent might grow up and demonstrate those behaviours under a different setting isn't an unfounded connection to make.",1575158558

two things fellow LDOers. Been playing This War Of Mine again (remember I found that LDO scenario with  yahtz and gabe as I reloaded it) but the gameplay where you are looting houses really makes me think of Tribly's Art of Theft with all that hiding in the shadows and stealing mlarky. (btw another fun scenario could be with Royston Shelfabs and Douglas Uppity)

and outer worlds... well hasn't appealed to me so far, what with some of the garish colours and weird alien design. But also really the only gameplay ive watched goes from the start until the resolution of the first major quest (cant remember... power.. water? but didnt see anything that interesting really, no weird side quests or anything. does it hold up to fallout? from the look of it id rather play fallout 4 (which isnt my fave at all). only asking as just bought an amd processor and i get TOW or Borderlands 3 free. not really in the mood to give any money to randy squirtford even via a third party but TOW hasn't really impressed me.",1575158558

Hey [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog),

[@jhfxxng](https://www.instagram.com/jhfxxng/) here.  
.

I'm a Melbourne (Australia) based photographer who has primarily shot a lot of travel and street photography, but have been recently shooting more portraits, fashion and conceptual work of late.  
.  
Kind of a film camera/gear head too, so I shoot a good mix of digital (with adapted film lenses) and film - 35mm and Medium Format.

You can find me here:

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Ah yes.. better get help, or ya turn into a school shooter tho..

I had those thoughts too, but before I did that, I rather completely isolated myself and found excuses to not go to school.


Then later I took shrooms (was 19 then) and this made me come to the conclusion that killing people with such unfair means is something only incels and islamists do.


I'm neither of those, so now I try to find my way with peace and shrooms.

Keep working on your emotional regulation so that you can cope with minor setbacks and disappointments without catastrophizing or acting out.

"golang","t5_2rc7j","Welcome to the Go community :) - a straightforward first post, your writing style is good.
On Go, you're missing some idioms right now, as you might expect (e.g. abbreviations should be capitalised, `InitDB` instead of `InitDb`). I'd recommend looking at [this page](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and just really inhaling everything on it - it's very helpful when starting with Go. Otherwise make sure you're using tools like goimports or something similar, and make sure you're running linters regular / as part of your build process to catch other idioms, etc.

You've started quite heavy diving into Gin and GORM too. I'd recommend taking a step back and swapping Gin for something a little more barebones like go-chi/chi, and try some plain queries, or maybe just a query builder. One of the main advantages of this approach is you avoid using as much reflection. GORM does a lot of magic.

Additionally, the way you've structured your project feels very much like a different language. It's not quite like the languages you listed at the start though, but packages like `api`, `database` (as a general place to put database accessing code), `common` and `lib` aren't really great. What distinction is there between `common` and `lib` for example? Better package names in Go tend to be centred around _domains_. For example, the overarching domain of your app is `todos`, which conveniently makes a nice short package name.
From there you can have types like `todos.Repository`, or packages under your `todo` package like `http` so you can have `todos/http.Handler`. Packages dedicated to misc utils and that sort of thing are red flags too.

The other thing I'd say that's a bit of a red flag is the use of `todos.ctrl.go`. I've not used Gin, nor would I personally - perhaps it's a convention in Gin itself, but generally in Go people stick to using the standard library's approach for many things, and HTTP handlers is one of those things (go-chi/chi does a good job of adhering to this).

[Upspin](https://github.com/upspin/upspin) is a great example of an idiomatic project layout. The project has a couple of the Go team working on it (or had at least). Projects that aren't great examples of idiomatic Go are things like Docker and Kubernetes, despite them being very well known, large projects.",1575158561

Sex is about deep vulnerability, connection and trust and if that has been denied us, it takes time to to relax into it again. Also a relationship lacking in intimacy might be caused by one person, but the other partner then develops reactive behaviours in response, these take time to rebalance themselves and readjust to the new reality, it won't happen overnight, but I hope it happens for you, be patient with yourself you have been through a lot to get here.

Mother-daughter relationships can be fraught during the teenage years, but she really handled this poorly. If she isn't always like this, try to have a heart to heart when you've both calmed down. Apologize that things got out of hand the other day, but explain you were caught off guard when she tried to dictate what you could buy. Ask her if in the future you can both agree that you will be open to suggestions, but that you ultimately get to decide on your own clothes and makeup. Then try to take her suggestions sometimes, it will really make her feel better!

"politics","t5_2cneq","So let's talk about reparations and *why* they're bad.

First: They don't address the issues. A large tax return, essentially, is not going to fix the deficit in generational wealth, the unequal earnings, racism--institutional or otherwise--or opportunity imbalance that exists in minority communities.

Second: We'd need to implement this as a ""race credit"" or risk missing *huge* swathes of otherwise deserving people. How many minorities have issues obtaining and maintaining identity paperwork *today*, let alone proof that their ancestors were slaves 100+ years ago?

Third, we'd need to pay reparations for every bad thing we've ever done. I'm a white male, gay, and of Italian heritage. How much do I deserve? I'm a white male, so nothing for that, but the Italians were discriminated against pretty heavily, so I'd be owed some but not as much as those whose ancestors were enslaved, and I've personally faced oppression and discrimination due to my sexuality.  What about the systemic sexism that women face? Or people of Irish heritage? Do Catholics get some small amount? 

Reparations are bad because A) they don't work, and B) they're impossible to correctly implement.

It's a *far, far* better use of that money to direct it toward affected communities without regard for individuals' suffering or hardship. Direct the money at inner-city schools to address the opportunity imbalance. Direct the money at programs to help build generational wealth among those who don't have it. Fix problems, don't just pay them to go away.",1575158567

For the services: take a look at systemd,especially systemd-analyze can help you to find services that take long to load (and whether you need them or not depends on your use case).

And for the GPU: there can be a difference in performance between x.org and Wayland  sessions (especially due to xwayland-overhead),sometimes the de makes a difference,too (but as you're using i3,that shouldn't apply).
If you're using x.org,take a look at options for your xorg GPU driver.
Also, depending on your GPU,there are maybe different drivers available (mostly open/closed source ones for amd/Nvidia and the Intel Iris/i965),also make sure to use the right renderer (vulkan is usually the better choice) and you may even have the option to use the new ""aoc"" shader compiler.

I believe this is where people have to be honest with themselves. Are you really driving the weapon that hard in the bays such that eyebox is the limiting factor? I‚Äôve been shooting 3 gun for around 10 years and am pretty competitive. The NX8 absolutely was limiting with its tiny eyebox, hence my upgrade to the ATACR. But again, if running the gun HARD. I noticed that my time to transition was a good bit slower than the top end shooters. My solution in the end was to build a dedicated bay gun with a dot (landed on an eotech after trading an aimpoint T1). I now use it for the bulk of my gaming and save my more Gucci V7 build with the atacr for longer range matches and run and gun. 

For the ATACR or the Mk6 (similar reticles), I run the dot turned on only at 1x. If I‚Äôm planning on anything more, I turn it off. For me, steel (typically ~18x21‚Äù silhouette) 3-4x gives good fov and I can see the mil lines for my holds easy enough (the outer edge of the circle is 1 mil so for a 400y shot I‚Äôd use the first major line below the dot (2mil). The actual hold is 1.8 but that‚Äôs close enough (granted I‚Äôm explaining my atacr since that gun is 5.56. Again, my Mk6 is on my blk so that‚Äôs a different animal but same concept). Engaging the same size steel 300y or closer, I don‚Äôt think too much about it, just aim at the shoulder line. My drop at 300 is 10‚Äù so that still gives plenty of wiggle room. Like anything else, if you know your dope and equipment, it works.

"kundalini","t5_2rezq","&gt;Whenever I concentrate on the Ajna chakra (the spot between the eyebrows) the energy sensation there becomes really heavy and dense   

That's equivalent to:  

Patient: Doctor doctor. My head hurts when I bang it on the wall.  
Doctor: Uhhhh, stop banging your head on the wall.  

Energy usually follows the attentive focus. Stop over-focusing on the ajna. Working on one chakra alone has never been considered wise, but has become popular and problematic for many in recent years, with 14 and 20 year olds really good at making YT vids, but extremely inexperienced  insofar as their meditative experience goes. Blind leading the blind makes for a mess of consequences for those foolish enough to follow their unwise instructions.  

Find better sources!  

/r/Meditation has or had (Haven't looked in a while) some decent resources in their FAQ and Wiki.  

&gt;I feel there might be something to it, that could help me improve my meditation practice after so many years without much progress.

The [Alliance Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland) is a member of the Liberal International and Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and is aligned with the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain.

I was wrong when I said they took the Lib Dem whip in Westminister, however. Interestingly, the Alliance permits its members to be simultaneously [a member of the Lib Dems](https://ianjamesparsley.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/alliance-must-clarify-precise-relationship-with-libdems/). Naomi Long didn't take their whip when she won the seat, although I wonder if that was purely down to personal preference on her part.

By and large, Alliance and Lib Dem are very similar so I don't think it's unreasonable to note that. They're officially sister parties.

&gt;That circumstance is predicated on a Labour led government which is about a 20/1 shot right now.

You spoke in absolute terms, I was merely pointing out you were incorrect. Brexit doesn't inherently mean a border anywhere concerning Ireland.

While the state should not go 'over-the-top' with nationalisation, it has an obligation to intervene when the loss of jobs seems inevitable.

The company is restored as if it continued in existence - assets that vested as bona vacantia in the usual places belong again to the company (simplifying).

You are going to have to persuade the court as to why - these restorations often happen when e.g. prosecutions or actions in tort need to proceed, or a company has been improperly dissolved to evade creditors.

We did everything we could but interaction actually made him freak out more so we had to just ignore and and leave him alone.

Edit.  As with every release, tried it again.  Not only can you not have a screen to the left of the main home screen when you're using Google feed you literally can't have one.

I ended up in a corner surrounded by stuffed animals, but I was facing the ceiling and couldn't move my head, so my fiancee on the other side of the room seemed to disappear as soon as she stopped talking. I have experience with hallucinating her on dxm, so at this point I was starting to get convinced I had been alone all day and just hallucinating her. Every second felt like my mother was walking into my room to scream at me, even though she was out of town and is supportive of reasonable psychedelic use. There was no way she could be coming in, but in my mind it was like I was 16 again, paranoid out of my mind from smoking too much pot (which was the only way I had ever consumed it at that point), locked in my room afraid to move so she wouldn't come check on me.  No thoughts came to mind about how my mom has been so understanding about psychedelics, just memories of fears I had when I was a kid.

"montreal","t5_2qnmr","As a muralist on the aforementioned list who has been painted over, I'd argue that it's an older phenomenon with crews such as TFB doing it systematically several years ago - what's changed is the type of murals that are around to be gone over. Murals as we conceive of them today are themselves a relatively new concept. When I was starting out, they were generally either of graffiti pieces or low budget community efforts.

What's more, murals today are increasingly correlated with the value of property. They are often a value-added, frequently working hand in hand with gentrification efforts. While some efforts (I'd like to shout out Unceded Voices) do use mural art as a way of voicing inequality or social issues, many pieces are merely the visual equivalent of a social nicety with no actual critical stance. Graffiti is often more democratic than the actual walls being gone over. 
Of course, the people doing the graffiti vary in criticality and judgment, but muralists still tend to be more involved with graffiti writers than property investors. The more grassroot the mural, the less likely it is to get gone over.",1575158575

"cursedcomments","t5_hw1ju","Yeah, I‚Äôm not defending it. But it‚Äôs not Islam to blame. Think about all the other videos on there, most of them are probably in the U.S. but Americans aren‚Äôt bad people. Neither are Atheists or whatever belief. That‚Äôs like saying because an American executed someone, that means the constitution said to do so. As I previously stated, it‚Äôs legal in Saudi Arabia only if the government does it. And again, Saudi Arabia practices Wahabbism, meaning that they punish a lot of things by death. Execution is very rare in those other countries, same with some American states. For example, there were no executions in Pakistan in 2013. But notice how the death penalty is still legal in the U.S., chances are that a lot of these were for very bad crimes. And obviously if you go on r/watchpeopledie then you‚Äôll find people dying. But looking through a small scope into a country that shows you only a bad side, hardly shows the country at all. These videos are not Muslim justice, just like ISIS isn‚Äôt helping Islam AT ALL. They say they are but the religion doesn‚Äôt. I know you probably won‚Äôt care, and I know that this sounds absurd, but the prophet predicted ISIS.

Here it is: ‚ÄúThere would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur‚Äôan, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of Judgments.‚Äù ‚Äì Sahih Muslim 1066, Book 12, Hadith 199

He goes into more detail about them: ‚ÄúThese people will have long hair and bear black flags. Their hearts will be hard as iron, and they would be the companions of a State‚Äù (Ashab ul Dawla). ‚Äì Kitab Ul Finan

Islam is so against this that the prophet said to kill ISIS, doesn‚Äôt this show that these ‚Äúhonor killings‚Äù are strictly forbidden. I‚Äôm not arguing against you, I‚Äôm discussing with you.",1575158576

"Pete_Buttigieg","t5_nahld","Unpopular opinion: I think you're missing the ""talking points"" part of ""Republican talking points."" Meaning it is usually in reference to gaslighting BS cooked up in an RNC backroom, not real ""concerns of Republican constituents.""

And dismantled RNC talking points are still harmful, because even once you've dismantled them, they've changed the conversation in unfair, intellectually lazy, and harmful ways. That is why Trump's troll farm and Fox News are so effective, in ways that have been academically documented. Every single thing they said about Hillary was dismantlable. Didn't matter.

I would really like what you are saying to be true, but I think it is naive and harmful to the party at this point. Trolling and fake news work in a major way, and the ""marketplace of ideas"" is not enough to defeat them. The marketplace of... ways to block worthless ideas needs to take over, and ""Republican talking points"" is part of that.",1575158578

Settings: 400mm | f5.6 | 1/200 | ISO 2500

I photographed this crane because I thought the textures and colors of its feathers were both interesting and aesthetic. I‚Äôm curious about how others feel about this photo and its edit (edited using ‚ÄúPhotoshop Fix‚Äù on my iPad). Among smaller adjustments, I selectively increased or decreased sharpness, brightness, and saturation on some parts of the bird because I felt it didn‚Äôt stand out enough from the background. I chose to desaturate the blacks because my ISO was pretty high and I felt desaturation made the red/blue color artifacts/grain less apparent. 

I worry it may look obviously edited (I can‚Äôt tell anymore because I‚Äôve looked at it too long).  I also think the background and bird‚Äôs crown feathers may be over-saturated, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm comparing to the original image? I feel pretty pleased with the crop, but wonder if there is a better alternative. Here‚Äôs the unedited photo for comparison: https://imgur.com/gallery/HjaEPtm

Idk I'm still seeing that mid as a great one. Suffered a lot against RM last game but that's a lot on RM finding overloads in the middle all over the place due to your attackers not tracking back and your fullbacks being shite at defending.

Everyday we get closer to a new war, to a new recession, to a new revolution, to a new generation.

Stories do not. They have clear structure. A beginning, a middle, and an end.

To open up your story to the cycles of real life you are asking for it to turn in to some day time tv drama. Something without end. Something without meaning. No clear beginning, and no clear message to tell.

To undo the OT ending so easily, and argue that Star Wars should emulate real life, you are asking for the ST ending to also be undone. Eventually the peace that Rey brings to the galaxy will also be undone. Look at the neo-Nazis, and their rising influence in the modern day. If the ST is WW2, then we know full well that Rey's victory will be a hollow one, and that Palpatine's mark on the galaxy will never be gone.

"HalfLife","t5_2rgym","&gt; Physics isn't a gimmick and lmao that you think that's in any way comparable.

I was under the assumption that you considered it a gimmick, hence why it was in quotations. The fact that physics isn't a gimmick yet VR is in your mind says it all. It's just another post of someone whining they can't play the game, therefore VR must be a gimmick because you clearly have to degrade things you can't play.

&gt; Every game of every kind benefits from better physics because it's just a straight upgrade.

Definitely not true. Physics can go overboard and ruin games. Just look at RDR2, quite a lot of people like it, but quite a lot of people also think the physics interactions can get seriously annoying and clunky.

&gt; There's a reason very few VR games are even made compared to the number of conventional games that come out: because it's a gimmick and not much else.

Nope, it's because it hasn't had nearly as much time on the market and is at an earlier point, and because it's hard for AAA developers to make money.

&gt; If anything, VR is a limiting factor here, because a real HL3 could be far bigger than HL2, which is obviously harder to do in VR.

What a completely nonsensical statement. VR makes games shorter now? If anything, VR could make games longer because people will naturally do more sightseeing and interacting with things.",1575158582

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Sports photojournalist here. 

I edit at halftime, or between periods, or during the game (have to miss some of it sometimes, but usually only when there are two+ of us there so action is always covered) depending on the sport. I tag images in camera to make selection go faster, then I ingest, select, crop/tone, caption, and then FTP about 5-10 images during halftime/between periods. Software is a unique program built by my employer that handles the selection, captioning and sending. Photoshop for cropping/toning. I use a card reader to ingest.

  
Post-game, I will select, crop/tone, caption and FTP the most newsworthy from the second half stuff first (buzzer beaters, hail mary plays, major injuries, players, etc), then go back and crop/tone/caption/send other tagged stuff that I didn't have time to edit during halftime. Before I leave, or sometimes when I get home (though I usually continue editing on-site to avoid traffic leaving), I go through the entire take (anywhere from 1000-3000 images usually, between two cameras) and pick out anything else that I might not have tagged in-camera, or anything more ""feature-y,"" like fans, portraits, sneakers, etc. Crop/tone/caption/send those. 

Depends on the game, but I usually finish with about 40-100 images edited by the time I'm done. I export them out of the company software and archive the full take to my drive.

After I've met deadline, I then pull all of my edited images into Photomechanic and make some selects to post on social media. Add a watermark in PS, save, then email to myself.",1575158583

"IdleHeroes","t5_3fzsh","That team is just IMO one of the best overall for PvP and PvE.

If you're only PvE focused then I wouldn't worry to much about an aura.

Forest - Heart Watcher, Garuda.

Abyss - Kroos, Or 2-4X Skerei's (1 alone is not really good)

Fortress - Sigmund, Penny

Shadow - Horus, Gustin maybe viable option also but Horus &gt; Gustin.

Light - Belrain &gt; Asmo &gt; Aida (IMO)

Dark - Amen Ra &gt; Aspen &gt; Dark Arthindol

If I was soley PvE this is what my team would be;

1. 3x Skerei, 2x Kroos, 1x Heartwatcher

2. Horus, Penny, Garuda, Heartwatcher, Belrain, Amenra, switch out belrain or amen ra for sigmund depending on the situation (BS7 would more than likely benefit from Amen ra more over sigmund)

If you want a rainbow team i'd do

Horus, Sigmund, Heartwatcher, Kroos, Aspen/Amen Ra, Belrain/Asmodel.",1575158584

Ren does a similar thing. At first we thought he needed to be touching someone to use his semblance on them. But later we saw him do it remotely. Perhaps that wasn't an extra feature of his semblance but was instead just ""extending his aura"" like what Vine is talking about here. 

If everyone is capable of extending their aura like that, it could lead to some neat new capabilities among the teams. Blake might be able to make a copy appear somewhere far away from her instead of having it pop out of her current location. Nora might be able to project her aura and make other people immune to electricity. Perhaps that's how Weiss makes her glyphs appear in distant locations. Maybe if she didn't know how to extend her aura she'd only be able to make glyphs at her current location.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

"depression_help","t5_2zy2x","I don‚Äôt know if I have depression or not, but I know that I rarely find reason to feel happy. Really life feels like an endless drudge through everyday struggles, that end up being rewarded by at most a few hours of happiness per month. It is really hard to feel positive during the rest of that month when you are spending hours working on something you don‚Äôt particularly care about, for no real reward at the end. Living life to me feels like driving a truck from Los Angeles to New York and being paid $200 at the end. Sure, $200 is nice, but is it really worth driving for a week?

I don‚Äôt feel sad most of the time. I just feel empty. I hate that empty feeling more than anything. I guess I could call it existential boredom. My solution is to just wallow in my own sadness. When I don‚Äôt have anything to be happy about, I deliberately start thinking about how I am a borderline autistic ugly person who will never be seen in a romantic or sexual way by anyone. I start thinking about how I will never truly be anyone‚Äôs best friend, I‚Äôll just be the ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù they never make time to see despite living walking distance away. I will never be invited to anything, I will only be around them if I take initiative. I start thinking about how I am an intelligent person with lots of potential who is throwing it all away by never being able to focus.

And believe it or not, thinking about every negative thing in my life feels better than the existential boredom. But it isn‚Äôt healthy. It‚Äôs fetishizing my own sadness. It certainly makes me a less attractive person to be around and is going to hurt me in every way. I‚Äôve tried to follow this simple piece of advice: ‚ÄúYou gotta do it everyday, that‚Äôs the hard part‚Äù. But being positive when I feel nothing to be positive about hasn‚Äôt worked for me. No matter how long I try to avoid negative thought. How many years am I going to have to wait before life becomes worth living? I was told it would get better after high school and adolescence. I am now an adult in college, it still hasn‚Äôt gotten better. If anything my life is worse. I have no friends or social group in college despite trying very hard to make one. My friends from high school either live a long ways away, or cant be bothered to spend time with me. I have had zero success with romantic or sexual relationship. My grades suck. I haven‚Äôt found something to be passionate about. I have tried so many things and I am mediocre or bad at every single one of them no matter how hard I work to be better.

I'm pretty sure some of them - particularly the ones in Ghosts of Saltmarsh - do give a minor mechanical benefit, and stuff like Fisher and Outlander's ability to find food is a significant mechanical benefit in a survival game.

Fisher:

&gt; You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

Marine:

&gt; You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see ‚ÄúTravel Pace‚Äù in chapter 8 of the Player‚Äôs Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.

Shipwright:

&gt; Provided you have carpenter‚Äôs tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 √ó your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.",1575158586

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","She passed away a year after I had finally built up the courage to ask her out. 

**To clarify:** I never thought she would have said yes, she was my first friend when I moved to the elementary school she had been, she was prom and homecoming queen all four years of high school, varsity volleyball, softball, tennis and track (again all 4 years) and all-around stunning both on the inside and the outside. She even unknowingly saved my life that I had planned on taking when she became that first friend at that school since I had been incessantly bullied at this new school.   

**Back to the story:** I had asked her out the last weeks of senior year we had been talking about what college we had decided on. Turns out that we were both going to go The College of Charleston. So I go for it and ask, I will always remember her response till the day I die ""I can't believe it took you 7 years to ask me out, of course I will you idiot"". 

Not long after she had not come to school for a few days and I came to find out that she had since been diagnosed with Diffuse Large B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma a rare type of cancer and her parents moved with her back home to Syracuse (because of the great juvenile cancer center). She wins prom queen in absentia with a live stream there for her the whole time. I go thru the summer and my first year of college with us talking back and forth on Facebook about our lives. Then over the summer she messages me that her Dr said she was in remission and could come to school in the fall and (quote from her FB message) ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to come down south again where its warm, you‚Äôre going to have to show me all the fun spots in Charleston now that you have a year knowing the town on me, also you still owe me that date ;)‚Äù. 

A week later I come downstairs at my parents place a couple months before college was scheduled to start to see my brother morosely looking shock white at that day‚Äôs newspaper and he said that she had passed. Improperly cleaned hospital equipment and her weakened immune system left her open to an infection that had taken her. 

Never got the chance to tell her how I felt for her, or that she had saved my life.

You don't have to spend a fortune to let someone know you've thought about them and care about them.

You really need to let him know this isn't okay, and he needs to make more of an effort in future. All depends on how much it truly bothers you, but it's definitely okay to be really disappointed and upset by this, not ungrateful at all.

&gt;That opens up a lot of power for whoever takes the seat next. If Sanders doesn‚Äôt just capitulate to the opposing forces and decides to flex that power in the same way, we‚Äôd see real change for the better.

It's not about the power to push through one's agenda, it's that Sanders' agenda won't work for the U.S. The demographics are totally different from the countries where his style of government works and quite similar to the countries which his style of government fails abysmally.

That's pretty much it. I just ask the question and the answer will be something along the lines of ""I'm fine/going alright/whatever."" I don't ask questions like ""if you want to hang out?"" or ""how are you?"" I just ask ""are you ready to go?"" and the answers are usually great.

If you're asking someone this kind of question, I think it's important to ask them if they want to hang out without them asking.

In cases of CIA covert action however, covert operations have generally served to support overt policy. The funding of the Contra insurgency for example, followed serious public condemnation of the Sandinista regime from both the Carter and Reagan administrations. Multiple speeches were given alleging Nicaraguan support for insurgents in El Salvador, and there were serious overt attempts to change Nicaraguan policy by the State Department and other agencies. President Reagan was extremely supportive of the Contra cause (despite their well-known brutality, and gave multiple addresses praising them as ""freedom fighters"". 

Kissinger and Nixon likewise were extremely concerned by the possible success of the Allende government, animated by (unfounded) fears of Chile becoming ""another Cuba"". Coups in Iran and Guatemala were likewise orchestrated by an administration which publicly considered American-Soviet competition a battle for the fate of the world, and viewed left-wing nationalist movements as proxies for Moscow.

 Have any senior Trump administration officials given speeches on the situation in Bolivia? Has the Trump administration made the stability of South America a priority? So far as I can tell, this President could not point to Bolivia on a map. Why, then would they consider a coup in Bolivia worth doing, especially given the immediate worldwide condemnation they would face if it were exposed? What is in it for them?",1575158592

"ballroomdance","t5_2zfwg","As a newcomer competitive ballroom dancer with 6 competitions so far the reason in my opinion to limit each heat (every dance consists of multiple rounds and every round may consist of multiple heats depending on the number of couples) to about 90 seconds is mainly to accommodate the large number of heats (between 30 and 60) on a given day. The dancefloor in all heats up until the final round are usually pretty packed with dance couples. During those early rounds the judges have to mark up to 50% of all couples for a possible recall. Each judge only really has a couple of seconds to look at each couple and to either:

* mark them for recall
* do not mark them
* mark them as a maybe and hopefully come back to them for their final verdict

If the dance time would be shorter than lets say 60 seconds, there wouldn't be enough time for each judge to look at all the couples.

If the dance time would be longer than 90 seconds, the number of total rounds on a given day would decrease, less dancers would be able to dance, and the overall waiting time for each dancer not currently on the dance floor would increase.",1575158596

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","Every healthy meta has an aggro deck, and red is the most flexible mono colour for aggro. White AND green are extremely sensible to boardwipes and can't really finish games, blue doesn't have very efficient creatures so tends to be too slow to play straight aggro AND also struggles to finish once it can't push through creatures anymore, and black is kinda weird in that its only face dmg can't hit creatures or planeswalkers, so it's quite inflexible (while red can use its burn spells to kill creatures or walkers). So black tends to either run destroy effects, in which case they struggle closing games, or face dmg, in which case they lose easily to runaway creatures/planeswalkers, or both, in which case they can hardly be called aggro anymore (and they somewhat suffer from drew-the-wrong-half-of-the-deck syndrome).

Only red has spells that can go face AND double as removal. It also has plenty efficient, small hasty creatures, which makes it just weak it enough to boardwipes to make them worthwhile, but not weak enough to make the wipes instawins. Against Red, if you haven't killed them yet and don't have a repeatable source of healing, they WILL kill you even with an empty board, if need be by throwing spells at your face. It's just inherently a more resilient aggro game plan than that of all the other colors, which usually need specific strong, almost OP cards to make it really viable (like MonoUs \[\[Curious Obsession\]\]).

In short, MonoR usually needs not be feeded to be strong. It inherently has a good gameplan.",1575158597

Robinson the journey, the blu (a demo buy nothing has better graphics imo), subnautica (need gamepad and vr mods), skyrim VR with mods, chronos, and edge of nowhere all very beautiful too but the other 3 are top tier.  Racoon lagoon is really pretty in a cute way.

Sure, Rahne is bad, our defense has looked out of place, but anyone who says we haven't taken a big step forward is a damn fool.  Especially considering we were not supposed to have this many wins.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

So, given the lack of good evidence for the Death story and the lack of an objective omniscient narrator ruling on the validity of either theory, it just seemed like the ""Peverell's are very powerful and made them themselves"" theory makes more sense.

Right now as it stands, were we all healthy:


NHL contracts: Howard, Bernier, Comrie, Pickard, Fulcher, Larsson

AHL contracts: Nagle


NHL assignments: Howard, Bernier


AHL: Comrie, Larsson, Pickard


ECHL: Nagle, Fulcher.


Leaves an odd man out--possibly meaning we trade Fulcher. I can't imagine we would trade Nagle and Fulcher hasn't really shown a 'spark'. Unless, of course, Fulcher is injured longer term, but he's currently skating so it's possible he's near being back.


My guess? We keep 3 goalies in the NHL with Comrie as our third rather than risk losing him to waivers or pushing someone out. There's really nowhere for anyone to go--Nagle wouldn't be traded, IMHO, because his home is Toledo now in the sense that this might be his swan song/final year and out of respect, he should retire here.

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if VSTrader has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=VSTrader&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check VSTrader's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=VSTrader&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/VSTrader), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#VSTrader), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=VSTrader&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user‚Äôs **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

4. This is further backed up by the fact that the average time between an offense of murder and the trial in Florida is 52 months\*; However, Cruz is scheduled to start trial just 23 months after the offense (less than half of the usual time), showing that already he is being pushed through the process faster than usual, the judge herself said she refuses to delay the trial because of the significance of it.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

And as the trap was set, he had to be sacrificed publicly to incite the mob. Walter, I believe, planted this idea in (forget her name but the large preacher woman) head, during the night they spent.

It found that even in couples where they rated themselves as valuing gender equality the woman did significantly more of the household labour. When the men where asked why it was so they explained that their female partners knew how to do all the household chores whilst they themselves had never been thaught to do them, so it was just natural to assigned it to the person who could do it better. When the women where asked how they learned to do household chores they explained that after they moved out as adults they had to learn, and the most common method was by calling up their mother and ask how they did it.

Ever since I read that I have had a suspicion against the argument that whoever knows how to do a task better should just do it. Just because someone learned it earlier doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs more difficult for someone else to also learn it latter on. So ‚Äùyou‚Äôre better at it than me‚Äù is not a good argument for who should do an unpleasant task if it is the only argument you got.",1575158606

Also cutting everyone is the same as cutting any counter power balance. Humans can't be good with power, it's proven and repetitive throughout history.",1575158609

"assholedesign","t5_33o0p","&gt;The US has the slowest broadband of developed nations. 

I think you mean to say **on average,** but unless you're looking at a different metric than I am, I still don't think you're correct. The US is kinda massive, and while population is largely concentrated to both coasts where internet is actually really good, but we also have tons of people living outside of those coastal cities. If you look at a [world density map](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/viewer/) (top left), countries like Norway have a density relative to ours (technically less dense), but with 1.5% of our population, and their dense population essentially existing only on the coasts. Having a much smaller, more homogeneous population being located essentially around the perimeter of the country makes infrastructure less daunting. Sweden is much like Norway, although less bound to the coasts, they also have large swaths of their landmass that are mostly uninhabited.

The USA on the other hand has at least one major city in 45 or so of the 50 states, even cities hundreds of miles from coasts or either boarder such as Salt Lake City, or Denver. Other very well developed nations like the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, France, Spain, etc... are all behind us in average speeds, even being much more dense, and much smaller.

The service I get in Atlanta is really damn good. All up and down the east coast, and most of the west coast the service is some of the best in the world. Everywhere I have been on the east coast, midwest, and southeast has been great. Of course if you're trying to get gigabit internet in rural South Dakota you will be disappointed, but that is pretty universal to the rest of the world that far out rural areas have poor infrastructure.

All of the countries with [better internet rankings](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-23-countries-in-the-world-with-the-fastest-internet-speeds-2018-7#2-sweden-46-megabits-per-second-22) than us are much smaller countries with much generally much more dense populations. In [rankings of population density](http://statisticstimes.com/demographics/countries-by-population-density.php), out of 235 countries, the US is at 177, so pretty well spread out.

Of the notable countries above us in ranking of average internet speeds, they all have much lower populations, and much higher density:

Singapore: **1st** in internet, **3rd** in density, **1.5%** our population.

Denmark: **3rd** in internet, **89th** in density, **1.5%** our population.

Romania: **5th** in internet, **114th** in density, **6%** our population.

Belgium: **6th** in internet, **34th** in density, **3%** our population.

Netherlands: **7th** in internet, **22nd** in density, **5%** our population.

Luxembourg: **8th** in internet, **54th** in density, **0.1%** our population.

I could go on, but it really just continues in the same way.",1575158609

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

I set up cage traps everywhere when I started my fort so in-between my military fighting captured creatures in an arena i accumulated over 100 humanoid corpses in a single refuse pile.

Sending any dwarf there once would be enough to be sent to complete apathy due to having a thought for every single corpse. 

It even worked on my very stress prone dwarves because it seems like you reach apathy with the least amount of stress the faster you pile the thoughts on all at once. They'd become haggard and throw a tantrum, but then spend over a month in jail and destress completely due to the constant ""repentant"" positive thought they'd have while locked up.",1575158611

"Xplane","t5_2t9qj","You should check out JSGME if you don‚Äôt want to pay for xOrganizer to handle loading your mods. Then install FlyAgi Tweak Utility and Xvisibility. Set your LOD to Auto and target 30 or 45 FPS.  You'll need a mod called FlyWithLuaNG.  It allows you to install Lua scripts that help customize the sim.

In the settings menu head over to the Data Output tab and check Show in Cockpit for Frame rate.

In the Graphics tab set Visual Effects to High, Texture Quality to Maximum, AntiAliasing to 2xSSAA+FXAA, Number of World Objects to Minimal and Reflection Detail to Low.  Make sure Draw shadows on scenery is unchecked as well as Draw parked aircraft.

Now start a flight. This is your baseline. In the Frametime box in the top left it‚Äôll show FPS for the Graphics, FPS for the sim, CPU frametime and GPU frametime. You want high FPS‚Äô and low frametimes. Whichever frametime is higher is your bottleneck.

If you have 30fps but your CPU frametime is lower, crank up Number of World Objects. If GPU is lower then turn it down. If you don‚Äôt have 30fps with Number of World Objects already low and GPU is higher then you can reduce AntiAliasing. You shouldn‚Äôt need to reduce Texture Quality but you can check if you‚Äôre maxing out your VRAM with a utility called GPU-Z.  Reduce Visual Effects as a last resort.

Whew, onto the mods.  Check out my list of mods here in this post:

For bush flying you should check out the Propstrike Studios C172 Bush Kit and Machmell Fisheries.  They're free.  Also, when you do want to drop $20, the Reality Expansion Pack by Simcoders for the Laminar C172 is compatible with the Bush Kit.

He then passed us and the car in front of us on the right side which is illegal here in Germany.

Then he continued to merge somewhat dangerously in front of the car ahead of us and flashed his brights at a BMW driverwho he managed to scare out of the left lane.

I feel that as a human with ancient Jewish ancestry that the current leader of Israel is led on the people's feeling of paranoia, leading to the equivalent of an ethno-state with democratic characteristics.  In reality the people of the Levant must push off the chains of the Saudi's and Iranians.  Squash the groups they fund.  Then. And then only would the Israeli government be able to liberalize.   


When the country of Israel was created in the 1940's, The plan(to deal with competing nationalism)  was to make Jerusalem a United Nations Territory(Internationalized) and the areas that we would know as Israel and Palestine  would be in an economic union, and protection of minority and religious rights.

Third: A lot of hand guns can be used for big game hunting, some may be brought along as an accessory to other activities. For example when fishing in Alaska you may not bring a full sized rifle and may elect to a large caliber handgun because bears.",1575158615

I was speaking to a cashier at a large grocery store recently and we were joking about what a busy day it was, and she said it was nothing compared to the Sunday after-church crowd, who she called the rudest and nastiest of all the customers. 

In any case, lots of folks just like being assholes to strangers when they know their targets can‚Äôt talk back.

4. Logic: Liberals hear only themselves, will not listen to logic if it does not match their own redundant rhetoric and will basically bite off their own nose to spite their own face to try and prove their pointless point. 

*Conservatives listen, are not afraid to see things from different points of views and always looking for better outcomes for the good of the people ALL people!

5. Immature Defenses: Liberal seem to think a strong offense is a good defense. Perhaps in football but not in life. They will attack anyone with a different viewpoint that does not coincide with their own agendas. Lower their already low standards.

*Conservatives will not attack or go on the offense because they are secure in their beliefs and are almost always right!!

Even if it killed all humans to prevent this scenario, there is still the possibility of an asteroid strike causing major damage to the planet. 

The best bet is to pose as a secret government agency or private corporation and arrange for bunch of rocket launches so that it can start to spread out into space.  Once out there, establishing factories on the moon or mars will enable it to significantly reduce its exposure to humans and cosmic disasters, until after a few years of manufacturing it should be able to start spreading out into deep space. 

I'm still not sure if killing all humans is necessary.  I don't think it is, but I guess if the AI just leaves, there is the possibility that we will somehow create another ""evil"" AI that will try to seek out and destroy the first AI.  The first AI would have a significant head start though so it is probably not a problem.",1575158617

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","""They were not informed of the conspiracy as only a very select and small  group of people was informed. Potentially only the astronauts and the  President/Vice President. The rest of these hard-working Americans  simply were not informed of the truth so they believed""

[http://www.clavius.org/scale.html](http://www.clavius.org/scale.html)

**THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM SCENARIO** 

At the other end of the spectrum we consider the possibility that only a few top people at NASA knew of the conspiracy.  And so all of the contractors and most of the folks working at NASA truly believed the lunar landing was a fact.  

This has two advantages.  First, it is well known that the probability of keeping a secret diminishes rapidly as the number of people who know the secret increases even slightly.  So by keeping this number to an absolute minimum you'll reduce the number of people who can spill the beans.  Second, the NASA employees and contractors will go to their graves staunchly asserting that NASA did what it said it did.  

The big disadvantage is that the contractors now believe they must actually build the space hardware.  Grumman must actually believe it is building a lunar lander, North American must actually build a command module, Boeing and others must actually believe they are building a moon-capable rocket.  Integration teams from all these companies must make the products work together.  Quality control officers from NASA must meticulously inspect the work.  

These engineers are not dummies.  The whole reason NASA hires them to build its spaceships is because they have the expertise to do it. And so when NASA tells Grumman to build a lunar lander, it knows that Grumman engineers are going to go out and discover for themselves just what problems are involved in landing on the moon, and then proceed to solve them.  If NASA executives are bent on fooling everyone then they couldn't care less if Grumman succeeds.  But Grumman would care.  And the NASA quality control people would care.  If Grumman falls short, Grumman will know it, and so will the NASA employees who inspect the work.  

In short, this scenario will produce equipment capable of going to the moon.  But our cardinal premise is that NASA couldn't do it.  So if the equipment worked, then what was to prevent NASA from actually performing a lunar landing?  Remember, the most airtight scam is the one that's not really a scam.  If they wanted people to believe they had landed a man on the moon, and they had the machinery to do it, the smart thing to do would be to actually accomplish the landing.",1575158617

"television","t5_2qh6e","It‚Äôs been established as surprising to characters in-universe that she‚Äôs unusually powerful, so in that way, anakin is just as Mary Sue.

She‚Äôs actually never won a lightsaber fight. She is saved from likely defeat at Kylo‚Äôs hand by earthquakes in Starkiller, and then she teams up with Kylo to take on the red guards. 

She fails at convincing Luke to come back and join the resistance, and she only barely manages to lift the rocks necessary to save her friends. 

Mando meanwhile, is a bit gruff, but always makes the right choice, is cool and calm all the time, always wins fights, and women seem to fall in love with him even though they don‚Äôt see his face. 

He‚Äôs a classic male fantasy. 

Again, from my point of view, neither character is actually a Mary Sue, but so far there‚Äôs nothing about the mandalorian that isn‚Äôt kind of *perfect*. And male Star Wars fans are in love with him because this is the first original male character in a Star Wars thing since Disney that they can easily insert themselves into.

I just feel like i‚Äôve seen the character done so much better. Examples: Malcolm Reynolds, Joel from TLOU, Wolverine, spike spiegel.

Bit of backstory here: my second husband and I got sober together on literally the same day. As of 2019, I have 20 years of continuous sobriety, even though Mike died of heart failure 17 years ago. During this time, I married my current husband Brian 13 years ago. I am actively involved in a 12 Step program, attend meetings regularly, and speak on my anneversary. As Brian is a ""normie,"" i.e., not alcoholic or anything, he doesn't go to any of my weekly meetings.

He has not gone to one of my speaker meetings in many years. 

However, this year I FINALLY found out why. Apparently, it makes him feel uncomfortable when I talk about Mike's death, especially because I often get choked up at that point in the story. He never told me that before - he just made excuses to not go or bowed out because ""he's heard it all before."" (To be honest, the story doesn't change all that much over the years.)

After he finally got honest about this point, he made a snide remark about the one picture that I have up in the house of Mike. It is in our room, not prominently displayed, but it is there. I have thought about moving it to the spare bedroom, but I am not comfortable with just shuffling it off to an unused part of the house. I thought I was being respectful by not having it in the living room like it was before we started dating.

So, AITA?

"DestinyChildGlobal","t5_sfdbz","Sounds more like you don't know what you are doing or you have an extremely skewed perception as to what rewards ""newer players"" should be getting. Going to look bad when you compare yourself to whales and veterans. 

You 100% do not need ""a good team"" to get to the final shop and basically buy out everything. Newer players may not be able to get the 3-5 summon tickets every day and the 5 star ticket for 200k coins but the costume/raid boss dupe is definitely obtainable. 

Season 2 Cleo: I was using max morrigan, freesia, leda, persephone and chang'e. Got top 1% with only 40 tickets per day and bought out entire shop. I didn't have the required frej/elizabeth/pantheon/werewolf. 

I don't know why you are using freesia to begin with, debuffers do bad in ragna because of the extremely high debuff resistance and lower debuff duration. Drop her for dana/2nd healer. 

Leda can solo heal on manual. You will just need to use her vamp drive. Should be using Maat.

Since my max elizabeth with double edge debuff can barely survive a crit+drive/fever from Aria, your maxed frej with max gear/carta can as well.

World boss has harder to obtain reward because you get less tickets per day and there is boost childs. You actually need to have the correct units or you need to buy extra tickets each day if you want to buy out the shop. 

I have no idea what you are doing in ragna, but I'm going to guess it is wrong. 

You only need to do 100k damage (2% of boss hp) to get plat chest drop. Drop rate/plat chest rewards are not better if you do more damage. It only increases for the person who discovered the raid. 

Plat chest can also drop same elemental units like Cleo, neptune, light frej, sytri.  

Higher rank per raid does increase coin drops but not enough to warrant spending more than 1 ticket per raid. 

You use the 5 raid summon tickets with 2x bonus every day. Everything else goes to slayers, 1 ticket per raid. 48 free tickets per day. 

And frej isn't a bad unit. He does more damage than elizabeth on full auto because of his single hit tap skill. You know what does majority of the damage on full auto? Your fever damage which scales off your tap skill. Saturn or Frej are the best units for full auto. Elizabeth does piss poor fever damage because of her quad tap. You do poorly because lack of heals. 

Top 100 team comps are all based off manual lucky runs where you pray elizabeth crits non stop with tap. 

And why are you even worried about ragna? Have you done the math? You know that the top performing players in ragna only gets like 2-3 extra 5 star tickets compared to the rest of us right? You really going to dump away all your crystals to get a ragna specific team for what is essentially some 5 star tickets?",1575158619

I eventually figured out that if I leave a thin layer of shit on my anus and let it dry over night I would be more itchy and I would have a fun surprise that I could peal off my butt hole in the morning. I cannot describe how wonderful the feeling of pulling off that thin simi transparent sheet was. After pulling it off I would smell it and then toss it under my sink. After a week or so the smell was too much for me to handle. So I began to spray febreze down there every once in a while. This went on up until I started growing hair down there. I stopped for a while because I would end up pulling hair with my shit. In the mean time, I would toss my finger and toe nails along with my heel skin and occasionally, my sun burn skin (what a treat that was) under the sink. I eventually began to miss the sensation of peeling, so I decided to shave around my anus. Shaving it made it more itchy! Sadly, for some reason my shit wouldn't come off in a single layer. That's when I decided to take some Elmer's glue and lightly apply it around my rectum and let it dry. My god! The feeling was 10,000 times better than before! Not to mention that my anus was super smooth after peeling! The worst day of my life happened three years ago today. While I was out shopping my next door neighbors house caught fire and engulfed my house with it. My beautiful collection went up in smoke. After the ensuing trauma I sought professional help for my disorder (talking to that shrink was the most embarrassing part of my life). I was diagnosed with OCD and excoriation disorder. I no longer peel or pick at my body. I have a few pictures, Sorry for the darkness of the photos. They were originally intended for me to look at when I was on trips (wasn't expecting to share them).

For a medium/full coverage look I use Loreal Infallible Fresh Wear 24hr foundation and day to day I use Maybeline Dream Fresh BB cream. 

Not drugstore, but I buy Fenty lip gloss becauae they are a very good deal! They come with .3 oz and most lip glosses only come with  .1, so at $18 its like you're buying 3 $6 lip glosses at once! And you get to feel fancy with a luxurious product üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç


I'm trying out a new concealor and so far I love it, its Revlon Photo Ready Candid Concealer. I won't lie that the main reason I like is because its the closest color match I've been able to find, but I think its a good quality product and definitley works well for spot concealing which is all I do with concealer. 

I also love Essence Volume Stylist Lash Extension Mascara, their Lash Princess one is also very good but something in it irritates my eyes, other people love it though. 

I use Wet N Wilde Megaliner, I love it because it is so easy to work with and dries down matte, but be warned, it never dries down to the point where it won't move, I like that because I hate destroying my eyelashes trying to get off waterproof/budge proof eye liner and I will get styes so I really can't leave any behind, but I know many will probably hate this liner because it will smudge if you rub your eyes.

The main thing you need to do is ensure the card has Zero Fan mode. Then it will indeed remain silent in normal and idle usage. In fact some of the 1660 super coolers are so good they're silent almost all the time (but a node 202 may change that!)

* Arghlex are a species of dragonlike humanoids, hailing from a verdant death world in the coreward reaches of the Orion Arm. Massively built, they tower over most other spacefaring races at an average of 10 feet tall. Their physiology is highly robust, with organic carbotanium-polymer scales (which come in a wide range of iridescent colors), reinforced bone, muscle, and connective tissue, and redundancies for virtually every organ. They're pentadactyl like Terrans, but have elongated digitigrade legs, a thick prehensile tail, and enormous functional membraneous wings. Notably, they're also venomous and can bite or spit a corrosive neurotoxin, and have eyes capable of independently swiveling in different directions if need be.

* Contrary to their appearance, Arghlex aren't actually reptiles under Terran taxonomy. Scaled and reptilian though they might be, they're actually warm-blooded carnivorous egg-laying quasi-mammals. Mother Arghlex do in fact nurse their hatchlings, and with very good reason - most life on their homeworld is poisonous, and, though young Arghlex can quickly adapt a resistance to these toxins, there's still a good chance that it might kill them. Thus, Arghlex milk, aside from being nourishment for the young, also carries chemical markers that kickstart the process, as an evolutionary adaptation to boost infant survival rate. Notably, Arghlex body temperature is much higher than a Terran's, and they prefer to live in hot, wet climates.

* Formerly the techno-economic and military power in the galaxy, Arghlex civilization was almost eradicated during the Great Scourge War roughly 2000 years ago, and collapsed to barely a shadow of its former scale. Only their core worlds remain sovereign territory, hidden deep in the Varos Nebula, and many Arghlex have grown up among other races in a chaotic post-War galaxy, with only fragmential stories of home before the War to connect them to their kin.

* Arghlex are some of the best magic-users in the galaxy, with an extraordinary and peculiar innate power. The current reigning theory as to why proposes that something about the nature of their physiology and souls was fundamentally altered by the Skyfire, a reality-warping thaumion storm of incalculable power that swept the galaxy roughly 100,000 Terran years ago.

* In spite of their monstrous appearance, Arghlex are not particularly warlike, though they certainly enjoy challenges of physical skill and might. As a matter of fact, they were the driving political force behind the foundation of the Galactic Concord, an immense multispecies federation spanning the entire Orion Arm of the galaxy for nigh on 50,000 years. They're known to be a highly methodical, calculating race with an extraordinary gift for long-term planning.

* Though there are few Arghlex left in the galaxy outside of their hidden homeworlds, curiously, the vast majority of them have somehow wound up in Terran space, livingwith under the banner of the Commonwealth. Many of these Arghlex don't even know their home and civilization survived, and have adapted to living in Terran society, and have gained a reputation as extremely capable mercenaries due to their physical advantages.",1575158623

Tactics were just like In this video : evoke an emotional response, *make this person who had just gone through trauma cry=more views*


I can‚Äôt remember the exact questions in my situation, but they were to the effect of stuff like:

‚ÄúHow close were you to the incident? How does it feel to have a classmate dead? What did you think about wen you were crying in a corner waiting to die? Did you see blood? How do you feel seeing blood and having gunshots ringing through your ears? Do you think you will ever feel safe again?‚Äù

And even if you max it out, you will not make a contested lay up unless it‚Äôs on some no defense/no intimidator build like yours, which is rare.

I was just actually thinking that Fuuts might know Itsuki is ""Rena""(and thus the girl from the past in his mind) and *could* hold feelings for her because of that not knowing the Yotsuba is the girl from the past and the one who had Itsuki disguise herself. It would confuse him terribly if this were the case and he found out the truth soon after.

I thought this due to the meet up between Fuuts and Rena after the trip. HOW did that meeting take place? Did Itsuki leave him a note as Rena to meet or something? If so...he knows the writing styles of the sisters. He'd be able to figure out it was Itsuki. So in his mind he may think she was Rena/the one from the past. (Unless I am forgetting something on how they meet up to give her the group picture)

If Itsuki realizes this she may struggle with telling him since Yotsuba forbid her from saying anything.

Now...this seems unlikely and kinda convoluted but its possible. Though I find it more likely if Itsuki doesnt actually hold extreme feelings for him and it IS just more friendship and thus it wouldnt be as harsh a thing to happen for her (to be chosen then rejected)

I dont know but it does feel the truth needs to come out at some point so...who knows.",1575158626

After over a quarter of a century at GT, I believe this is exactly the overly-analytical approach we faculty impose on the students. I blame myself and my colleagues for this. We can't fix decades of this in the classroom, but we can laugh about it on Monday night.

A. While CTCA is not a perfect organization, Dr. Katherine Puckett was previously the head of their Mind-Body Medicine Division and did some amazing work in the use of humor to reduce stress for cancer patients. They are a commercial business and as such they sometimes paint their success rates in an overly-positive light, just as Georgia Tech used to downplay information about mental health challenges (long before your time). Luckily GT is more open about this now and trying more proactive things to address it. We comedians are trying to join them to do our part regardless of how indirect the effects may be.

B. [www.humor.gatech.edu](https://www.humor.gatech.edu)  points to [http://pwp.gatech.edu/humor/](http://pwp.gatech.edu/humor/) specifically. Check your browser settings.

C. Nobody is pretending that mental health can be ""Attacked"" by humor (interesting choice of words that were not actually used in the original post). If you don't think humor might help improve your mood before finals, then I recommend the late night pancake breakfast or some other activities that GT usually does at the end of the semester.

We hope you can join us on Monday night, and I look forward to meeting you in person. Feel free to stay after the show to discuss research in stress reduction from humor, and possibly join the new Stand-up Comedy Club at GT.",1575158627

I had band class in Junior High and it was fun and all playing instruments and first period was practically my teachers only good class.

And keep in mind, The sax's sat directly in front of the percussion so you would imagine our pain. This kid that was in the percussion row always said ""Hey OP why are you on your phone?"" And keep in mind that I wasn't on my phone when playing or pretty much any time of band class and it wasn't funny but I decided to give a laugh at it. He kept this shit going and it was getting annoying. One day I was super pissed off and this way my last straw. I was trying to keep my cool and not lose my shit at him. He then said the words, ""Hey OP why are you on your phone?"" So I stand up and pull out my phone with a bulky ass case and yeet it at this motherfucker straight in the face.

People with stronger sobriety could deal with it but there are a lot of people in early sobriety (including myself) with minds that are looking for any excuse to drink.

"witcher","t5_2sebi","Consoles are pretty restrictive on what they allow, which is almost nothing. I've read that there are ways to break out of the given UI, but I've never really wanted to.

I guess if you like the controller, you like the controller. I cannot recall ever having seen anyone be as exact with a controller as just the average person with mouse and keyboard. I've see videos in YT of game play and often told myself very quickly, ""he's playing with a controller"" because you see the lack of coordination in running and aiming. The player is always running into something, stopping and then turning, instead of turning while running to avoid running into whatever in the first place. Of course that happens with mouse and keyboard too, but far less often and generally things are just far smoother than I ever see with controllers.

But if you like controllers, all the more power to you. They are the game equivalent of an HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick - I fly DCS too ;) ) which is impressive for what you get. Just too bad about the mods.",1575158628

Sorry Ive worked at a detox center for a year now and its just sad af.... most of these people are homeless and have no ties to their families who kicked them out cause their families thought it was the ""best thing to do"" smh. they usually get better IF a family member actually starts giving a crap about them, even then it's the addiction they gotta kick and thats a LIFETIME fight.

It was a pretty dark and uncertain time. One day we went to the local library because it was cold out and we could just relax in there for a few hours in the warmth. While she was messing around on the computers, I went and picked out a book to read, which happened to be *Siddhartha.* I read it all in one sitting and was nearly brought to tears by the end of it.

"funkopop","t5_2ulbr","‚Ä¢ Buy what you like  
  
‚Ä¢ Do whatever you want as for how you want to keep your collection. Some people keep all their Funkos in boxes, some don‚Äôt, I do a bit of both. Boxes can be easier to stack but they don‚Äôt get to show off the designs as much.  
  
‚Ä¢ use poppriceguide to help keep track of your collection (I don‚Äôt reccomend using it for prices since it‚Äôs not accurate) I just use it to remind myself I have a lot already &amp; I forget sometimes which pops I have.  
  
‚Ä¢ Hot Topic, FYE, Boxlunch, Target, Walmart, Walgreens, Amazon, Michaels  
  
‚Ä¢ Amazon has a section called warehouse deals, if you don‚Äôt care about box condition they‚Äôre really cheap. If you do care about box condition don‚Äôt bother then lol. They always come in damaged for me but the pop is fine.   
  
‚Ä¢ Michaels has baseball bat displays that are great for those collecting pops out of their box. they‚Äôre on sale a lot and there‚Äôs a ton of coupons so never buy this at full price!  
  
‚Ä¢ I really do NOT recommend collecting everything from a single show/game/etc. It can be very expensive. Say you want all pops of Dwight from The Office, it‚Äôs going to be hell. They‚Äôll release 90 different versions of him and it‚Äôll be hard as hell to keep up with. If you have time and money to burn go for it.

But we're talking optional things you can buy for the game. You can always earn it in game vs buying outright. With the new ship rentals and everything going on, its far easier to upgrade your ships in verse so you don't really need to buy them outright.   


Better comparable would probably be like League of Legends. It costs just over $700 to get every base form of character to play with. Over $6000 to get all non legendary/retired skins.   


We live in a time where games cost more and more. The average paid user of candy crush spent over $1000 while playing the game. CandyCrush alone brought in $1.5 billion last year.   


In terms of revenue generated, Star Citizen has just passed the amount earned that was needed to bring Star Wars: The Old Republic to reality. We're about another $50 million away from the cost to bring GTA:V and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 to the shelves.   


Also look at averages. The average Star Citizen account has spent \~$85. A comparable (not really) game that came out on XBox years ago, with the same demographics as star citizen, had a price tag of over $2000.

"fatestaynight","t5_31xwr","The series relies more on compatibility than out right OPness.


Example: Emiya taking half of berserkers lives in the fate route but getting absolutely fucked up by lancer. Despite the seemingly clear power difference between his foes. In the VN Emiya doesn‚Äôt even use his reality marble against zerk yet here he is getting dogged by Lancer. Typically this would make no sense but lancer is specifically tailored to destroy archers due to protection from arrows. While Heracles has trouble against projectile spamming.

the reason why zerk got destroyed by salter is because she kept spamming mana burst (big as fuck laser) which essentially disintegrated all of his lives. And alters get a boost in stats. Cu got wrecked by assassin because the author hates Cu (just kidding) it‚Äôs actually because Assassins Noble Phantasm is quite literally an Instant Kill that ignores all defense. 

In other words the worse matchups for both characters. Not to mention the shadow aka (spoiler next sentence) the devil in sakura‚Äôs titties literally eats a sun that Medea throws at it and eats servants for breakfast. So it‚Äôs not entirely unlikely for it to destroy most servants. The only reason Emiya resists it is because he isn‚Äôt entirely ‚Äúgood‚Äù. And even then the thing fucking destroys him. It‚Äôs just that in this game of Rock Paper Scissors every servant got hit with their biggest weaknesses or the things closest to them.",1575158632

"reactivedogs","t5_3jbj2","I'm not the person you're replying to, but I want to take a moment to say that EVERY DOG SHOULD BE MUZZLE TRAINED. Little dogs, big dogs, nervous dogs, confident dogs, whatever. When and how often the muzzle is used is a matter of discretion and management that falls on the owner, but there's really no downside to having a well fitted basket muzzle besides the negligible upfront cost of buying it and the time it takes to introduce in a positive manner. There are a thousand good reasons to have one. The easiest example is in the case of emergency veterinary medicine; if (god forbid), this big boy got hit by a car, the first thing you'd want to do would be to muzzle up so he can be handled safely by you and the doctors to fix him up. Other reasons might include high stress situations (like this one), or to send a clear message to strangers that says ""this dog needs space"". 

Good dogs bite, too, and a muzzle doesn't have to be a punishment to them. It can be a good thing for every dog, and I think that it's silly to assume that any dog will *never* be in a position where muzzling up is the best option for everyone (dog included). One of those ""better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it"" kind of philosophies.",1575158634

Maybe I am a pessimist, I said end month they would be 7th in the division and 13th in the conference. Well that can't happen. Need at least a few more days for that. 

But if they don't get it together they could be 6th and 11th in just a few hours. 

Now you can argue games in hand and you can argue that it's a tight race and it's still early. I agree. 

I just don't think they are good enough to crawl out of a hole, and they are slowly digging a real hole. They probably won't fall that far back, but being in the race all year and missing by 4 points is still just missing the playoffs.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

Yes that‚Äôs my point. For 172 points you‚Äôre getting a lot more than model that fires a gun, for 170 points of Exorcist you are getting a model that fires a gun.

&gt;72‚Äù range is certainly nice but 48‚Äù is very respectable

I mean, 72‚Äù is objectively better than 48‚Äù (it‚Äôs actually more than double the threat range) especially since...

&gt;they can only move 5‚Äù and fire their main gun at full BS

5‚Äù is infinitely better than 0‚Äù to fire at full BS

I also made that calc assuming a Canoness is within range for RR1. Naked it pulls off 5.84W on a 3+ T8.

I had a habit for much longer, started with the old school OC 80s, snorting and smoking, then switched to BTH. When I finally decided to quit, it was probably 4 to 5 weeks total just for the physical WDs. The worst of it was over after a week, but over a month before I could sleep properly or saw the restless leg syndrome totally gone. Mentally I didn't feel ""normal"" for at least 3 months.

At the time it felt like I would never get over it, but eventually there it was. It was a gradual thing, and I guess technically it's never been normal like how I was before I used, but normal relative to when I was a full blown addict. My point is that as long as you tough it out, it will get better. Patience and perseverance will get you there. 

Stay strong, try to find a hobby, exercise, anything to keep yourself busy. Like I tell everyone in this situation, if you're serious about quitting you can do it, it just takes time and patience.

The terrorist had an indetirminate prison sentence (labour legislation that allowed indefinite detention) that was abolished in 2012 under the conservatives. It was not applied retroactively.

The terrorist appealed this IPP and the conservative poster boy Leveson accepted believing he wasn't a career terrorist. He could have been rejected and still be under IPP but the conservative government needed those numbers to look good.

With his appeal accepted and no IPP he was released after 8 years.

The conservatives are responsible. Boris is the leader.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's not. It's perfectly fine and far better than gimping the entire game by trying to make it pancake compatible. 

Virtual reality is an entirely different beast compared to flat screen games. If you have not experienced it, you have no idea - it's one of those things where no amount of words can actually tell you what it's like until you try it yourself.

You cannot translate VR controls to that of a gamepad or mouse+keyboard. You can kinda make Skyrim work in VR, but you'll never play Beat Saber with anything other than 6dof tracked headset &amp; controllers. There is no way to perform the simple action of accurately firing two weapons in different directions with standard control schemes. You will never throw a grenade over your shoulder at the baddies behind you in the middle of sustaining fire in front with your other hand, or freely manipulate a melee weapon. It simply cannot be done.

VR is something completely different. We have to reinvent the wheel on even the most basic things you'd expect in a game, even learning how to let the player *walk around* without making them sick took some time. 

You cannot compare it to traditional gaming, and to ask that an experience developed specifically for VR be made playable on a flat screen is unreasonable.

Edit: also, you've gotta ask yourself if Valve cares in the slightest about how many people buy it. They're rolling in cash, if it sold a total of zero copies they'd be completely fine. The whole point of HL:A is to show off what makes VR special; to get more people into VR. Just like HL2 showed off Steam and the Source engine's physics capabilities.",1575158637

The mod wheel is jumping values and not responding smoothly. Sometimes i have to push it really hard for it to go back to zero. 

I've disassembled both pots and cleaned with contact cleaner. It helped only a little. I really can't see any dust or rust on them. 

The worst is the pitch bend pot, as it seems clean to me but the fact that it's not giving the correct value is super annoying. I'm using a Max for live device to correct it in the computer but as it is i cannot use it with other synths via midi. 

They're not wiggling very much, i have even tighten up the metal holder on the pots to make sure of that.

"politics","t5_2cneq","If their reporting gave us a worse version of Trump during the next round of Republican presidency, would you still defend their petty and toxic bickering? 

Try stepping wayyyy back and visualize the nature of the whole webwork of ""liberal"" news. Now, see, this is a complex idea, so flip it back around on its head. So imagine that entire webwork of news as close to you can as being a single person. We'll call them the ol' mainstream Matteo.

You walk through many rooms and Matteo followed you there, and you hear him talking about ""bad man."" You go online, and see Matteo has created entire rants about the things done by ""bad man."" He combines everything bad about ""bad man"" and projects that onto half the people around you, so now they feel very deeply offended and get *defensive* before they even hear anything about your politics. 

There are endless positive groups across the world doing good things, but if it goes against Matteo's corporate/capitalist agenda, he refuses to mention it. This means all the news that's most beneficial to Matteo is basically just a massive advertisement for consumerism. An ad for *ads.* Matteo knows this, and so does his buddy Bright Bart, a guy who really fails to live up to his namesake. 

Now, the weirdest part about Matteo, realistically, is the fact that *it doesn't matter what you do or think.* Why? Because he's omnipresent in the lives of every person with a hint of boredom or interest in politics. Matteo is the cult leader for tens/hundreds of millions of Americans, and he ensures all those brainwashed cult members are socially toxic to anyone that even remotely tries to avoid the discussion or move away from a hateful state of gridlock. Matteo dominates American culture with an iron fist, and strangely enough, he achieves that ***rigidly*** through his strange pact with his opposition, Bright Bart. 

See, because, as much as they might hate each other, they both know their power disappears if they don't keep fighting one another. If Bright Bart passed away, what would Matteo do? Would he suddenly give the people everything they want? Of course not. He'd split himself in half with an axe if necessary just to create a new Bright Bart buddy to compete with, because without that division, we can hold people accountable.

Now, the strangest part is how Matteo and Bright Bart are both really just the propaganda arms of the two corporate parties that dominate our government and exploit us to the greatest extent possible. They really *are* just the little cult leader voices that distract us from reality and the fact that progress should be constant in favor of American labor, but it's not. It's frozen, and they're taking all our resentment built up over that, both of them, and whispering in the ears of the citizenry to keep us fighting over complete bullshit.",1575158639

On the other hand i do believe it is imperative to talk about when someone brings it up on their own because ignoring someone on the edge in their time of need can be a disaster. Thats the problem with encouraging people to talk about it all the time. Theres no way of knowing which time of need is the big one.

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","I finally fixed it by going into Cydia when it wants to update everything, telling it to ignore. ***This is after I did a rootFS restore and re-jailbreak.*** 

Once I got the Cydo 2 error my dpkg was screwed and I couldn't even complete a jailbreak with Unc0ver successfully. It wouldn't install openSSH and I had no root access, but JB apps that were already installed would run. So I really had no choice but to restore rootFS. 

If you can get Cydia back to the place it was when things went wrong without a rootFS restore then you could follow these directions and avoid restoring rootFS.

**The Fix**

Go to [apt.binger.com](https://apt.sbinger.com) repo in Cydia and manually add the 4 packages listed below.

LaunchD, DebugServer, JBCTL and Jailbreak resources. They must all be installed at the same time w/ jailbreak resources being **updated** only. I think this is what Cydia is supposed to do, but it's screwing up for some reason.

The problem is the first 3 packages want to remove jailbreak resources and so you have to manually install those 3 at the same time you upgrade jailbreak resources.

As soon as you pick one of the first 3 to install in Cydia it'll show you that it's going to remove jailbreak resources and signing cert. We don't want it to do that, so just continue queueing the installs/upgrades until you have all 4 of those packages set to install by themselves with nothing else.

Then Cydia will successfully update those 4 packages **AT the SAME TIME** (this is essential). 3 Packages are new installs and Jailbreak resources is an upgrade. You must select those 4 to install/upgrade together and then it will complete successfully.

Names of the 4 packages from [apt.binger.com](https://apt.binger.com) repo...

Launch Daemon Controller (Install), debugserver (Install), jbctl (install), Jailbreak Resources (Upgrade)

Everything is working fine now and I'm able to do the ""essential"" updates in Cydia after manually selecting the 4 packages listed above to install/upgrade at the same time.

It's essentially the same fix mentioned above, except we are doing it via Cydia instead of the console, because that will be easier for most of you AND I didn't know the exact console command to use to install multiple packages at one time, so I had to find another way.

Update: I've now reinstalled all the tweaks that I previously had installed and everything is working fine. I had saved screenshots of the installed tweaks in case I couldn't remember the names etc. I also had a Backup, but I decided it'd be better to install fresh than risk screwing something up again. No more updates showing in Cydia and everything working fine, just like it was before this 2 hour headache began! I'll check back on this thread later in case anybody has any questions, but thankfully my phone works fine now. So I'd rather go back to doing something I actually enjoy, lol.",1575158639

If anything they'd have less banditry and more incentive to work. Either through them or civilian industries to support them.

Maybe not, but they are taking away a large portion of fighting age men and women to join their armies, which has an impact on the number of hands available to work the farms, protect one's home, etc.  The war also means that a significant portion of each hold's guard force is either diverted into the Imperial or Stormcloak forces or are otherwise preoccupied with the war (protecting their borders, keeping an eye out for encroaching Legion or Stormcloak soldiers and camps, etc.) or stretched thin, which creates opportunities for bandits to take advantage of the chaos.

While the Empire and Stormcloaks are pillaging or oppressing the people, their conflict still results in a number of problems including banditry, economic problems, straining resources, etc.",1575158640

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","&gt; Imagine establishing your country on the premise of overthrowing European imperialism, only to be taken over by Europeans a few hundred years later.

That's kind of how I feel about what happened to all the North African countries. The Maghreb is commonly misrepresented as ""Arab countries with European influences"", which is honestly inaccurate for the most part. I know many Tunisians, Moroccans, and Algerians. As a nation, they are proud and individualistic, but they're often regarded as ""French-Arab Colony 1,2 , and 3"" which leaves a bad taste in the mouth. To see yet another stereotypical representation of them is honestly kind of disheartening. Compared to other sects of Islam, the Sunni Maliki school is a lot more democratic and actually incorporates the people's culture into its Sharia, yet once again it's characterized as yet another decapitation-crazed regime.

Otherwise, I think your world building is incredible for the most part. A lot of thought and detail was put into it, it's actually interesting, and for once the maps have realistic borders. I just wish it wasn't so ... stereotyped.",1575158640

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","Woah woah woah.....hold on friend. The reproductive responsibility is also referring to women in more cases than not, being the one that is having to be responsible for making sure she doesn‚Äôt get pregnant. Not all guys have condoms and if they have one in their wallet you might as well not even bother because it‚Äôs probably damaged. Many have to be on some sort of hormonal birth control (some which are a plastic thing injected into your arm that stays there permanently, or a shot in the ass) that messes with your body in so many ways, or have a device PAINFULLY inserted through the cervix (which is normally an exit only and clamped shut unless having a baby) and up into the uterus blocking the Fallopian tubes. 
Asking a guy to stop if he doesn‚Äôt have a condom doesn‚Äôt always work or you get crap about it or dumped, asking a guy to pull out doesn‚Äôt always get respected. If any of the birth control methods fail most times WOMEN get the blame for it not working right and then get ‚Äúinput‚Äù on if there will be an abortion or not (which takes away women‚Äôs body autonomy).",1575158641

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","- If this costs too much, you have a couple of options:

 - Skip the RAM and use your old one, though I don't necessarily recommend this route because Ryzen loves fast RAM; the older 2666MHz modules aren't really up to speed (Unless you manage to overclock them, idk)

 - Skip the NVMe SSD, either buy it later (or don't, as you wish)

- Also if your old monitor is 1080p 60Hz, let me know since that probably should be upgraded alongside the rest of the system. A 1080p 60Hz monitor will actually be the bottleneck here.

You are naive if you think Pelosi hasn't done more because she couldn't. Do you think that's why Obama didn't get more done? 

&gt;So quit with the ‚Äúboth sides suck‚Äù bullshit and vote democrat. 

Another predictable response. I plan to vote democrat in the primary and in the general. That doesn't mean I don't think dem leadership suck and they do btw. Between the acquiescence to compromising with and enabling Republicans, to using right wing talking points and attacking and trying to stop progressives, to voting for mass surveillance and war, to using their political influence to enrich themselves, to ignoring their base and not properly representing them and dragging their feet when pulled left, I'd say it's safe to assume they do indeed suck.

I don't care if republicans are worse.  That doesn't mean we should tolerate this crap on the left, same goes for 'libeal' media bias and journalism malpractice, and as long as we drone out with tribalism and ignore it happening, ignore these things because the republicans are worse, as long as we ignore dems who enable people like Trump and push for policy that helped pave the way for Trump, then things are NOT going to get better.

"cpp","t5_2qi27","&gt;I agree with commas, but not comments - sometimes we need to consume those, too, or at least maintain them for round-tripping.

Yeah, that's one of the problems with supporting comments. It isn't standard JSON, and now we have the additional complexity of storing them for round-trips. My library is optimized for the use-case where comments are not stored. Again this goes back to the central premise of the library,  which is that no single JSON library is optimal for everyone. That is why I have taken a narrow focus.

Boost.JSON does not promise to do everything for everyone. It promises to do some things, and that it will do things this exceptionally well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That might then at least guide that the container format should be extensible in a multi-library-way, e.g. for a library that wanted to add comment or binary blob type support or whatnot.

This is an interesting idea but the container actually goes in the opposite direction. It is designed to have no extension points or customizability at all. Unlike other libraries which allow the user to choose the type of container to use for arrays for example, in Boost.JSON these types are provided for you. They are `json::object`, `json::array`, and `json::string`. The reason is that it creates a consistent API for all users, which does not change depending on what version of C++ is being used. These containers are ordinary classes (no templates), and they are optimized to work with the storage system (the flavor of allocators used in the library).",1575158646

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Pertaining to your title question:

Honey is harvested in such away that either damages the hive, causes many deaths, or destroys it. In many cases the bees have to be given sugar syrup to replace the honey so that the farmers don't need to bother re-creating the hive from scratch next year (i.e. they wouldn't survive the winter due to the amount of honey taken). In addition to this, honey is harvested from European honey bees, and invasive species that competes with native pollinators for resources which leads to a decrease in native bee populations and native bio diversity as some plants pollinated by native bees are not pollinated by the invasive ones.

If you have questions feel free to ask. One sentiment I do want to express that I see elsewhere in the comments is the whole ""honey=not vegan"" thing. Saying things like this without explanation isn't helpful, try to anticipate people's questions.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

So then, the ROR trade either doesn't happen at all, or has to include different pieces, because Berglund was definitely the best player going *to* Buffalo from St. Louis.

Do the Blues still win the Cup?  Without ROR, the answer is certainly no.  And if Army had to change up the deal, who knows what players might have gone the other way instead of Berglund.

I have *Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2* (US version) on my phone right now

Probably the best is *Classics Selected by Brian Wilson*

But here's the ones I find noteworthy:

* *The Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 3* (US version) - it's an odd one for the ""Frosty the Snowman"" inclusion but it's one of the few places to find ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"" pre-box sets and side 2 has this charming thing where it opens with their first hit (""Surfin'"") and ends with their most recent hit at the time (""Good Vibrations"")
* ***Good Vibrations - Best of The Beach Boys*** \- includes all the hit songs from the *Pet Sounds* to *Holland* era; personally, I think this is the strongest compilation from them
* *Be True to Your School* \- bar none the weirdest comp from them. 10 songs, 22 minutes, but it has ""Surf Jam"", ""Car Crazy Cutie"", ""Carl's Big Chance"", ""Stoked"", and ""I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man""
* *Ten Years of Harmony* \- songs from *Sunflower* to *LA (Light Album)*; it's an odd one (and a long one) but it does have a previously unreleased track - which I think you can only get on the out-of-print *Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys* box set - and Dennis solo song
* *The Beach Boys' Instrumental Hits* \[1994 CD Release\] - it's has every instrumental officially released by the group plus the live version of ""Let's Go Trippin' '65"" and the B-Side to The Survivors' *Pamela Jean - Single* ""After the Game""
* *Summer Love Songs* \- I'm sure we're all familiar with this one (and I might as well mention *The Warmth of the Sun* because it has the single version of ""Cool Cool Water"" - which I wish more compilations albums from more artists would do)
* *I Can Hear Music - The Beach Boys lead vocal by Carl Wilson* \- I'm pretty sure this is an Australasia only comp but has a very cool theme
* *Be Still: The Music of Dennis Wilson* \- pretty sure this is a bootleg (or at the very least a grey market album) but again very cool to highlight a posthumous vocalist",1575158649

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Entropy. The tendency for things to become less orderly as time passes.

Most people understand the concept on a basic level. Leave frozen foods out long enough and they thaw, leave damp wood alone long enough and it rots. It's simple.

Most people see simple things as stepping stones to more complicated concepts, but I've found there's power in simplicity.

The Grand Magician's tournament is where people who've mastered complicated concepts gather to show off to each other. Every year magi, wizards, witches, and sorcerers gather to show off their flashiest spells. This year I've decided to enter myself.

My first match is against a Pyromancer. The last four years have been dominated by them so anyone who can make so much as a spark thinks they're the next champion. This won't take long.

""So, what do you do, little lady?""

""I have this neat trick where I can melt an ice cube in 3 seconds, want to see?""

""No, I really don't. If all you brought was parlor tricks you won't get very far.""

""If you say so.""

The start of the match is announced with a small popping sound, magically projected so it can be heard throughout the whole stadium. The moment I hear it I cast my spell, and my opponent is now moving many, many, many times faster than I am.

""Did she just buff her opponent?""

""What's her strategy here?""

""Maybe she was aiming for herself and missed?""

The crowd's state of confusion is mirrored by my opponent, who's been bathing me in fire for hours from his point of view, without so much as singeing me.

""You're not going to do anything,"" I retort, despite knowing I'm talking far too slow to be heard from his perspective. ""An hour's worth of effort from you is barely producing a flash for me. You could spend all day at this, but fire doesn't do much of anything if it only lasts a second or two.""

A minute passes, maybe two. But for my opponent it's been hours. He passes out from exhaustion, and my spell ends.

""Let a fire burn long enough, and sooner or later it runs out of fuel."" I say loudly enough to be heard throughout the whole stadium.

The referee calls it and I move on to the next round. While I wait for the results of the remaining matches, I hear rumours starting to circulate about a monster who can make her opponent pass out after a single spell. 

The magician in me wants to explain exactly how it works, but the competitor in me knows the confusion will only make things easier for me. So instead I hold my tongue and start seeing what I can dig up on my next opponent.",1575158651

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","You can‚Äôt build a true mastering studio. I do ‚Äúmastering‚Äù but  advise all clients my studio is not a true mastering studio. I run a nice project studio and I‚Äôve spent around $500 on treatment plus labor building. My floor is carpet, my walls are treated. I‚Äôm making plans to build a cloud and am now at a point to start shopping for materials.   I will also be building a small room to record in if I need extra separation.  It‚Äôs a compromise.  My own studio will never be like a state of the art rooms I‚Äôve worked in and that‚Äôs ok.  It isn‚Äôt needed all the time. I‚Äôm lucky that my studio has a recessed floor, that means at a later date I can separate the floor from the rest of the house, which is huge. Your best bet is to treat as best you can and start making music. Treat well enough to record/mix. Treat for your listening position. If you have a boomy room you won‚Äôt be able to change that most likely.  

So...
Treat the sides of your listening position, and walk  behind listening position. Treat wall in front of you.  This is a good starting point. I used home build 4 inch or 2 inch foam over 1/2 or 1 inch sound board and I‚Äôm quite happy. I usually use heavy drapes or blankets for front wall. Then with cheap magical bed sheets it all looks professional. I get squeeze serious tones from my humble set up. I get good tones from my experience, mic quality, and room treatment.

Game state being garbage is opinion of most players, therefore it is an objective fact. You cannot name one thing in the game that is not falling to shit or is one already. How is it not objective? 

Even the combat which was the main point of the game got simplified with recent patches to the point where it is nothing like before. Third specs which should be something, at least SLIGHTLY, game changing are nothing, but holding one button and clicking one-two every ten seconds, and on the top of NcSoft introduced autoplay.

Moreover, you are calling my comment ""toxic and subjective"", but then you're telling me that what I wrote is not useful, because I don't provide **OBJECTIVE** infomartion, and then you tell me that I should tell him to go and check game so he can check if his **subjective** opinion is the same as that of most people here. Aren't that pretty ironic?

If people wanted to invest 200 hours of their time into researching about minor game then they would do so. The question is why would they do that if simple Yes or No given by few people is enough to decide whenever game is worth checking or not? Simply assuming that there would be ~half people telling him that game is worth checking out and half that did not agree, then ok, he may go there, invest his time, but we are here right now with: 4 opinions that say it is not worth and 2 that ""MAYBE BUT YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT YOURSELF"".

So the questions I have are:
1. Are you guys split? and;
2. What are your reasons for being so averse to your feelings? Is it some kind of latent biphobia/homophobia in that you want a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life? Or is it merely that you love your ex-fianc√©?

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I wrote a similar comment in the other sub for DoD, but I think people are drastically underrating this card.

The fact that most legendaries are bad misleads people about this card.

Most legendaries are bad because they have bad stats for their cost, and their (often insane) effect doesn't make up for it.

But a 5-5 for 5 mana is perfectly fine. So you get the insane effect (battlecry, deathrattle, discovers, auras, etc) without being force to play a poorly stated minion for it.

And the good thing is that it works with all size legendaries; Small or big.

Say Bloodmage Thalnos? 5 mana 5-5 draw a card, with spell power. It's Azure Drake (a card that was HoF'ed) with +1+1 stats. 

Ysera? 5 mana 5-5 get a dream card.

Alexstrasza? 5 mana 5-5, ""deal up to 15 damage"" to your opponent. 

There are SO many legendaries that are good as it is, but more importantly: There are so many legendaries that would be good if they didn't have shitty stats. Well, this card removes the ""shitty stats"" part of the card. 

And unlike other RNG cards that are highrolly because the effect is decided when you play them, with this one you know what you're getting. 

Don't like what you're seeing? Just wait for the next turn. A 5 mana Alex is good on any turn, so is a 5 mana Thalnos, and so on.",1575158658
"Diablo","t5_2qore","nope, im fine without linking that build. You can go fuck off and tell some random person that they are wrong.

Linking a build will change nothing. Your just going to nitpick it apart and not have a brain to realize that this is only meant for people who outgear T16 and can kill everything instantally without lamnations.

&amp;#x200B;

Suprising i know? Right? People using their brains and adapting current icy-viens builds to support themselves because they realize they dont need a piece of dammage gear because they melt everything without it anyways.

This proves you don't eve get the entire point of the build. I don't need lamnations to kill the mobs with whirlrend while having 150% movement speed. They just die without needing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Your going to have to take my wrond on it. Im not going to buy into your bullcrap by linking my armory and having you explain that it is wrong.

I wish you luck

Haha you patronizing fuck.  

You can‚Äôt prove this at all.  The majority of these asian women aren‚Äôt browsing asian American subs and then purposely digging at asian men because of these posts.  That‚Äôs insane mental gymnastics.

Where do you think most of these subjects are discussed? Online forums.  Asian women don‚Äôt troll these subs for reactions.  That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.   They do and say this of their own accord.

You seriously cannot make an argument that the real world does not contain racism from asian women.  Literally impossible. You are just a white knight. 

I‚Äôm having a great time dude.  Currently on vacation in HI with my beautiful asian girlfriend.  Surrounded by many happy asian couples.  You think we are all incel and somehow that means we are making up stories.  

The fact is we all have pretty normal lives, and just call it like we see it.  You are completely delusional and in opposition to thousands of woke asian men AND women.   You have so much hubris that you think your more enlightened than everyone when in reality you are biased and blind.

You sound like a Deadbeard main being salty because Barrel Blast got nerf. Anyway, I think in general, zombies have more solid and stronger characters than plants does so a lot of players like to abuse op characters like scientist, space station, citron or super brain etc. to rack up the vanquish count and making the game unbalanced. So the patch basically prevent players from using broken characters to get quick kills and Barrel Blast is a pretty annoying quick kill ability, if you count the speed upgrade and higher launch upgrade it's even worse, consider that it's supposed to be more of a defensive ability than an offensive one. As for chomper, I always think he's at a disadvantage because how slow he is for a melee class and his bites are too slow to take out high hp/ high dps zombies (thank god the ttk decrease and december patch are coming) so the only way to get kills is spamming his abilities. Compare chomper in gw2 to bfn, his primary weapon is way better and more versatile now. And to be honest, even after the patch deadbeard is still a good and viable character to play as, his shotgun aim is not as shaky as cactus is, his Barrel Blast radius is still the same and the parrot is still ok.",1575158660

"Sociopaths","t5_2rr3h","Sociopaths are actually less likely to kill than neurotypicals. 

People with heightened emotions get mad. They lose control. They get angry at people for being angry with them. They get lost in the moment and do things they regret later. They then experience remorse after it is too late and they cry about wishing they could take it back.

People with reduced empathy and reduced emotional intensity don't do any of that. 

If a sociopath kills, it is because they got themselves into a situation where they had a problem that would be most immediately dealt with by murder. A sociopath who is being blackmailed might conclude that murder is more effective than paying on the money. 

In one extreme case, a sociopath decided that robbing a convenience store and murdering the clerk was more effective than going home to get the wallet they forgot an begin ng late for a hot date. They made it to the date on time but were arrested later. Some sociopaths are idiots, but not all. A smart sociopath would have just got his date to pay for dinner.",1575158662

I said, ""the prophecies in Daniel give the timing for the coming Messiah, Jesus recognized Daniel as a channel Jehovah was using, do you think Jesus was an apostate?"" From one elder I got about 30 seconds utter babble for that one. He could not string two words together to make any sense. It totally stumped him. So much so they had to throw me out - for sticking to simple maths and what the Bible really says.

"NewMaxx","t5_11y3o7","The 2TB WD Black (2018), SN750, and SanDisk Extreme Pro NVMe, as well as the 2TB 970 EVO and EVO Plus, are all single-sided with two NAND packages. This is universal (i.e. fits in all laptops) and more efficient but also more expensive: it requires a single 16Gb/2GB DRAM module and both packages must not only be 16DQ but also 512Gb/die. These drives actually use 256Gb/die at smaller capacities. The controllers on both additionally can handle 64 CE. Technically there is a small drop in performance and endurance here because you have double the density with the same amount of layers (64L) in all but the 970 EVO Plus - you're using some of the headroom for that density. And of course 16DQ at high speeds can be challenging, although ultimately more efficient.

The original 2TB SM2262EN &amp; E12 drives stuck with 256Gb/die at 2TB and were double-sided, as cost-saving decisions. This led to a drop in performance at 2TB due to oversaturation of the controller. The E16 drives did not have this issue as they go to 512Gb/die at 2TB (but at launch actually used 256Gb/die at lower capacities, even though all NAND was 96L/BiCS4). Intel/Micron NAND for its part is 512Gb with B17A (64L) and B27A (96L), the former is on SM2262EN drives now (see my 2TB EX950 post) and the latter is on E12/E12S drives (some will have BiCS4 as found on the E16 drives). The 96L have more headroom from additional layers so should perform better. Discussion about endurance here is more complicated because everybody but Samsung engages in string-stacking, that is two 48-layer stacks, while Samsung's is 96 native, although moving forward with more layers everybody will have to stack. Theoretically more layers allows for lesser voltage but basically there are trade-offs made with more layers, but it's not necessarily true to say endurance will be worse, not the least because of improving ECC, algorithms, controllers, etc.

So to get back to your specific questions though:

1) The B27A flash is actually quite good. For consumer workloads, which is where these drives are falling due to them being effectively ""budget"" these days, I consider it an overall gain. However going by the original design philosophy and on paper - i.e. less DRAM - it's a loss. But ultimately it likely means cheaper drives that perform the same or better for the people buying them (mostly), so tech as usual.

2) 2TB can be single-sided as mentioned above, especially with four NAND packages on a side. The 660p is the obvious example with 1Tb QLC. Cheaper drives tend to be double-sided, such as all SM2262/EN drives except the 760p, all E12 drives at 1TB+ until recently (and even some were double-sided at lower capacities, like the P34A80), outside truly budget drives of course (which tend to be DRAM-less, QLC, have four NAND packages, etc).

3) Based on pure flash merit in order: Samsung's 96L (970 EVO Plus), Micron B27A, BiCS4, Micron B17A (only at 2TB), WD/SanDisk 64L/512Gb, BiCS3. Keeping in mind WD/SanDisk's flash is made in the same place as Toshiba's with the same tech, although WD has higher standards, so it might be a tie with B17A. However if you are talking overall design, WD and Samsung are clearly above the rest.

To add: Tom's Hardware is expecting a SX8200 2TB review soon which might shed some light on things.",1575158662

In terms of extracurriculars, I wished I put more time into Extracurricular #1 (CS NPO), Extracurricular #9 (Machine Learning Research), and Extracurricular #10 (Software Engineering Intern). I felt like I did not put enough effort into those extracurriculars, and they could have been better. But I don't necessarily think they would have increased my acceptance rates (Honestly I think there's a point at which the AOs will recognize my ECs as pretty above-average and proceed to look at other things).

While getting USACO Platinum in a vacuum would have been great, the issue for me was that it would have taken too much of my time away from other extracurriculars. I was having difficulty with USACO in general and felt like in the time it would take to prepare for moving up to Platinum, I could be showing much more tangible progress in a lot more of my extracurriculars.

In terms of increasing acceptance rates, one thing I wish I did was try to take more AP courses. I would have changed my science course pathway from 10th-12th (Regular Physics --&gt; AP Physics 1 --&gt; AP Physics C) and also take an online science course (AP Physics 1 --&gt; APES / Online AP Physics 2 --&gt; AP Physics C). 

I also wish I applied for more summer programs. I missed out / forgot a lot of program application deadlines and as a result was quite lacking in my summer activities. I would have applied to more high school research programs and made sure to follow the deadlines.

I also probably would have changed my 9th-10th grade activities. Despite how my extracurricular list looked now, at the end of 10th grade I can assure you they looked.... lacking. I had none of the leadership roles that you see in my extracurricular list and none of the awards, either. I attribute this to being in oversized clubs like DECA and Speech &amp; Debate in my freshman and sophomore years, which are extremely difficult to get meaningful awards in as well as being too bloated to secure officer roles. It was mostly grinding in 11th grade and 12th grade (by focusing my attention on the small clubs on campus) that I was able to attain a lot of the extracurriculars I got.",1575158662

The best advise I can give is this is not windows don‚Äôt approach it like it‚Äôs windows. You have to learn how to use Linux past point and click. Find some good information for Linux beginners. Read some tutorials on the command line interface(cli). Do not strictly rely on graphical user interface(GUI). You will at some point have to dig into the terminal to fix something.

We are recruiting late night raiders to fill our 2 raid groups. We are a mix of vanilla wow vets, private server players, and retail refugees. 

We don‚Äôt have any fancy server first claims, or the fastest clear of MC. We didn‚Äôt all raid naxx and we sure didn‚Äôt all make it to rank 14 in vanilla. But we are a group of committed raiders who want to see all the content and kill lots of Internet dragons. 

Raid group one is 10/10 MC pre-submerge Rag and 1/1 Ony. Raiding on Thurs/Sun 1130-0230.

Loot distribution: Loot council 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Raid group two will be starting next week on Friday 12/6. This group will raid Fri/Sat nights from 1130-0230, mirroring the other group.

- 1 Resto Druid  
- 1 Feral Druid Offtank /dps
- 3-4 DPS Warriors
- 1-2 Hunters

Loot distribution: First two weeks will be MS/OS +1 system while everyone gets to know each other and clear the raid. Then the raid will switch to loot council to mirror raid group one.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Honestly, depends on the ship, but I lean pretty heavily to Drake.
The Herc and Merc are slam dunks, but i'm not crazy about the genesis.

I love the Gladiator and Hurricane, but i'm iffy on the hornet, Hawk, Cruicible, and Terrorpin.

The Retaliator is my favorite large-ish ship with the avenger running a close second, but the Sabre, Gladius, and Eclipse are eh. Cool industrial ships though, with the Reclaimer and Vulcan.

RSI is hit-or miss, as i like some parts of the ships, like the connie pheonix, but the utilitarian parts like the living quarters and bridge section is pretty not-great. The Polaris, Mantis, and Apollo all look pretty cool though!

I love Origin's 300i series, but i don't really like the 600i or 890j, and the m50 and 100i series are kind of meh.

MISC is just kind of practical- nothing looks outstanding even if the stats speak for themselves - and the hull series is downright ugly!

Pretty much nothing of Drake's is immediately offensive to the eye. inside or out, and most ships really have that cozy, lived-in, cramped feel that you just don't get from most other manufacturer's. The ships not not be as structually tough, but are also lighter and generally easier to fly than anything in their respective weight classes and offer really close capabilities to their competitors with some extra features, not to mention at a much better price.

Lastly, Crusader - i really do want to like those ships, as they seem like a combination of the best from RSI and origin but they simply don't have anything in game to get a feel for it - Though with the 'leaked' ares, maybe that might change,",1575158663

"Naruto","t5_2quts","Hello! Your submission was removed  from /r/Naruto because it violates the following rule:

You either did not provide a source or the correct source for your art/edit. Even if the post isn't an art post (a question, discussion, etc using fanart as a point of reference), it still needs to be correctly sourced.

Additionally, make sure that: **All Fanart, Fan edits, and Cosplays are linked directly to the artists page in the main post, and NOT in the comments section of the post**

To link directly to the source, **copy-paste the url of the work into the url space that's available when making a link post.** Uploading said work as an image and leaving the link in the comment thread is the incorrect method. 

If the art in question is original content (OC) re-hosting on reddit/imgur etc. is fine.

If the artwork is traced and/or a reference was used, be honest about it. Give credit to the original artist by linking to their work (if it can be found) or leave their name in the comments/title.

Please try to find the original artist using [**saucenao.com**](http://saucenao.com/) and [**Google Images**](https://images.google.com/).

Download Image Search Options to search faster and with more services: 

* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-search-options/kljmejbpilkadikecejccebmccagifhl)

The following websites are not valid sources: weheartit.com, pinterest.com, zerochan.net, dailyanimeart.com, alphacoders.com, any website with ""wallpaper"" in it, etc... these are aggregate sites which only have re posted artwork.

The original source is almost always on pixiv.net, deviantart.com, twitter, instagram, tumblr or artstation.

Remember that if you edited someone else's work, you still need to give the original artist credit.

Thank you!

The WHO (World Health Organization) has a very specific protocol for how to remove them safely without spreading them or letting them come back. Proper treatment involves a sterile environment, a real doctor, surface disinfection, a tetanus shot, broad spectrum antibiotics, sterile dressings, gloves, etc. He does none of that. This guy sanitizes nothing, chops them up instead of removing them whole (the right way) and leaves people who don't own shoes with open wounds on their feet. Often his ""patients"" get nasty infections afterwards.

When people try to call him out on it, he sends them death threats.

"MilitaryPorn","t5_2sq9y","Basics of it is that Prince Harry initially wanted to be infantry and was actually deployed in (IIRC) Afghanistan as a squad commander (IIRC), but then the American press reported that he was actually on the ground. The British press had initially been quiet due to the Royals asking them to not report it (For safety of course), well the American press blew his ""cover"" so he got sent back to England.

Apparently he wasn't happy about that so he retrained as a helicopter pilot, where he was given the privilege of having 1 on 1 training instead of group training to basically fast track him (Perks of royalty).

He deployed again as a Helicopter pilot the idea being that ALL helicopters are in danger of small arms and rockets and they're all targets anyways so he wouldn't be putting either himself or his squad in more danger due to his own prominence. Apparently he served quite well as a pilot of attack helis.",1575158668
"CatastrophicFailure","t5_38tab","That's actually probably exactly what the problem was.  In simple battery chemistries like NiMH or lead-acid, the trickle charge is basically the same power that the battery loses constantly just from being charged.  It's the power consumed by internal reactions.  In simple battery chemistries, this power is pretty high, and mostly reversible or at least not a big deal.  

In li-ion, the self-reaction rate is very low, and critically important to battery longevity.  If the trickle charge is too high -manufacturerer defect, variability, or temperature/aging- that power is going directly into damaging the battery and breaking down the very chemicals that are protecting it from self-igniting.  Over a long enough period it will become dangerous.

It's pretty easy to design a charging circuit that increases its output voltage when it gets hot.  Diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors are all very temperature dependent.  Put them next to a battery that gets hotter as the voltage rises, and it's pretty easy to see what goes wrong in retrospective.  As an engineer designing  (or someone modifying designs) the thing, it can be easy to not take that into account.  Even if you know all of that you may not consider the case of all the defects going the wrong way (which they do, often), the controller being glued upside down so it faces the battery and isn't cooled well, and the device being charged inside a box under a pile of clothing.  

Always be careful with your electronics; if they're uncomfortable to the touch and you aren't actively being prevented from touching them, they're probably WAY hotter than they were designed for.",1575158668

In general my server has been a shitshow, and I've been extremely frustrated about it. However, it has the side effect that because I can't play on my main that much I've been able to level my alt (just got 40 today hurray!) and pvp on my alt has been a friggin blast! I haven't had this much fun in a long time in WoW - running around farming xp/questing and being the biggest asshole I can possibly be when I see the opposite faction. So far at these lower levels it's been nothing but 1v1 or 1v2 and it's been absolutely amazing. This is the pvp i love - fair, unpredictable and fun!

My favorite part of today was when two mages around my level killed me on two occasions which sort of made me get into my ""I don't care anymore - from now on my only mission is to make it a living hell for them"". I killed them so many times that I made one of them log into his lvl 60 main to come and keep me away from them lol. It's been an absolute blast!",1575158669

This happened a few months ago, I don‚Äôt work there anymore but I used to work at a restaurant as a dishwasher and this one server has been really nice to me so I thought she liked me plus the fact that I heard that it‚Äôs normal to hook up with coworkers while working in a restaurant and I could tell that people was sleeping with each other where I worked already. So I asked her if she wanted to practice making out with me at a hotel after our shift was done, but she said no and then afterwards a few days later people in the kitchen was being rude to me and giving me bad looks. So I think she told everyone I asked her that, and I later quit because there was too much passive aggressiveness towards me from my coworkers. Am I the asshole or is she?

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","I think a lot of what the ""rules"" are, are making sure you have a good amount of value and balance in your dating life.

Too often, we get really caught up in a person and lose all sense of reason. I think it's very very true that when you know yourself really well, have confidence and know your worth, that you don't need to play games. 
 
You should instinctively know when someone is asking too much from you and how fast is too fast. And what a good sense of balance is when dating a person. 

The rules are a shortcut to this self-realization. 

I actually tried a version of them in my 20's for guys and they worked! But, the problem was that they worked on other people who were out of balance too. So, sure, I would attract and date consistently attractive women, but so many of them were so emotionally unhealthy. So.  Much. Drama. 

And who wants to get into a serious relationship with someone that you constantly have to ""game""? It's exhausting. 

Know your worth and be an emotionally healthy person, that goes far when dating.",1575158672

Your post was removed for not following the proper title format. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *[FS/FT/GA/LF] - LOCATION - PRICE - title*  Example: [FS] - Location, Place - $42 - Stuff for sale

**Make sure you include the hyphens**

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

1. Use only LF, FS, FT, GA as tags (looking for, for sale, for trade, give away)

2. Use [] around the tag, so it looks like [FS]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.

3. For multiple tags, only use /'s, so it looks like [FS/FT] or [FT/GA]. Don't use . , \ | - : ; ~ or anything else.

4. If you are posting a discussion or PSA, please use a [PSA] tag at the beginning of the subject.

5. Your location must be included after your tag.

6. Your price must be included after your location. 

* If you are selling multiple items, please use a + after the lowest priced item.  **Example: [FS] - location - $5+ - multiple items**

* If you are giving something away, you can use free or $0.

* If you are are posting LF, FT or LF/FT, a price is not required.   **Example: [LF] - location - stuff**

Well, it's not really so much of a common sense issue, it's more of a self-esteem issue. It's also related to various non-neurotypical conditions like being highly sensitive or an empath. 


I realize for people who don't struggle with this, or who have healthy self-esteem, it probably is just common sense, and I imagine, it just comes naturally to them, so they make the mistake of thinking that it's common sense for everyone. 


It's a whole different reality for people with negative self-esteem, who have been socially isolated and excluded or mocked, and have just had to take whatever scraps they could get or else have nothing. It's a completely different psychology which requires different strategies than well-adjusted people are able to employ. Setting healthy boundaries is what people with options do.

throwaway account, dont want this on my main

i run an art account on instagram and im pretty interactive with my followers; i try my best to answer every DM i get and people are usually very kind and just pleasant to talk to.

occasionally, i'll get dms from people that just simply say ""Hi!"" or ""Hello!"", and since they seem friendly enough, i reply back, but it always ends with them flirting with me or even worse. now, most of these people are boys, and i have established on my account that i'm a lesbian and that i have a girlfriend, so i don't understand why they keep trying.

because of this, i made a little PSA on my story basically saying that if you want to dm me, just get straight to the point within your first message. if it just says hi or hello, i'll delete it. i even went as far as to explain why i was doing this (because of the boys constantly flirting) but i got several replies to my story telling me that's a bit harsh. ""some people might wanna be friends!!' they'd say. now that may be the case but like, is it so hard to just send ""hi, you seem really friendly and id like to chat a bit and maybe be friends"" all in one message? personally, i dont think these DM rules are too strict at all, and given the circumstances i think it's personally reasonable, but what do you all think? AITA?

As well, instead of making your strength equal to your int for the duration, I'd just let them use Int for unarmed strike attacks, and maybe give advantage on strength checks/saves. It's more common to do something like that than for a spell to change the score itself (a noteable exception being feeblemind, but that's 8th level)

These seasons are not because of the incredibly idiot idea of Daenerys becomes crazy (by the way Meereen plot was only 3 seasons long and many people are complaining that they don't like it very much and they are waiting for Daenerys in Westeros. Can you imagine 5 seasons for ""Daenerys goes crazy"". It would be incredibly boring. Not to mentione stupid). These 5 seasons are one season for Dorne. Surprise there is no need to convert Doran into nothing. One season about The Reach and the Stormlads. One season about Vale and the plans of lord Baelish. One season of Daenerys ... in Essos.

He mentioned an argument that we had like a week ago, and started another argument based on the previous argument we had. During that second argument, he decided to text the words ""I want to break up"" so he broke up with me at 2am over text message, 4 days shy to our 2 year anniversary. Later he claimed he did it over text because he didn't want to see me cry to his face.

It hurt a lot that we dated for nearly 2 years, and I was reduced to a breakup over text. I didn't even disagree with his reasons for a breakup, they were legitimate reasons for a breakup, but the way how he went about it wasn't great.",1575158679

Prep the SD card as described on the MiSTer wiki and copy the update script to the writeable partition on the card. You can then run the script from within the MiSTer UI (provided you're connected to the Internet!) and it'll download ALL of the cores and most necessary files aside from some proprietary BIOS images. This is for the heftier MiSTer builds but since you're wanting the 128MB  card I'll assume that's where you're headed. (I have a 400GB SD card with pretty much everything English or translated to it.)

You can also create other scripts to only include the cores you choose but given enough storage space it's honestly easier to just get everything.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","What a fucking dumb comment, but sure I‚Äôll bite. Russ has 24 passing touchdowns and 3 rushing touchdowns, for 27 total touchdowns. Lamar has 24 passing touchdowns and 6 rushing touchdowns, for 30 total touchdowns. Russ has 3,208 combined yards (between rushing and passing), while Lamar has 3,303 combined yards (between rushing and passing). Russell has accounted for 154 first downs (139 passing, 15 rushing), while Lamar has accounted for 170 first downs (124 passing, 46 rushing). Lamar has the lead in yards, TDs, and first downs, despite sitting out four fourth quarters (AKA missing an entire game‚Äôs worth of production). 

But sure, let‚Äôs just compare passing. Although they have the same amount of TD passes, Lamar has thrown 53 less passes than Russ: he just has the highest percentage (8.0%) of passes that go for TDs in the league. In terms of completion percentage and qb rating, Russ has a very slight edge: 67.3% to 66.9%, and 112.1 to 111.1. The main edge Russell has on Lamar as a passer is interception percentage (he has .9 to Lamar‚Äôs 1.7), but both of them are very careful with the ball.

So then, lets move on to the passing stats Lamar edges Russell in. We‚Äôve already talked about touchdown percentage, which Lamar is leading the league in. In ANY/A, often seen as the single best gauge of a passer‚Äôs ability, Russell has 7.99, which is quite a good number. However, Lamar is even better at 8.09 ANY/A. 

So no, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs that they‚Äôre extremely comparable as passers (Lamar seems to be a bit more efficient and Russ seems to be a bit safer, although both are near the top of the league in both categories), but Russell isn‚Äôt even close to the same level of Lamar as a rusher. Lamar has 605 more rush yards than Russ, has an average of 7.1 ypc to Russ‚Äôs 5.1 ypc, and has tripled the amount of first downs Russ has gotten on the ground.

Of course wrong answers are unhelpful but I would argue that overly complicated right answer is as almost as unhelpful as the wrong one. I originally almost didn't post anything because the original post was so dumb and not really fitting for this subreddit. Since it is almost impossible to decipher what the OT is about, I thought that the only possible answer is to say things as generically as possible.

&gt; Huh...you can get that with a 14 watt LED light bulb or two from Walmart for a few bucks and an old five gallon bucket. People in [r/SpaceBuckets](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/) do this all the time. You only need a $20 light meter to verify this.

Yes, but if you put those 2 lamps in your living room and hanged them in some closely visually pleasing manner, would they still be 500 umol? And where I live 2 14w LED bulbs would be like 30 euros and then you still would have to buy the actual power supply part of the lamp.",1575158684

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

You've also focused on ""ground state"", when the real point was the ""total energy of the universe"". You can't have a total energy equal to 7280 for example. That would contradict the PSR.

If you reject the PSR, then this is a moot discussion since it means you're irrational, and you might as well be crazy. And aren't you crazy, if you reject reason, reject zero and reject dimensionless monads in favour of ""infinitesimal fluid""? If you accept the PSR, then there is no sufficient reason for any number (either above or below zero) to be privileged over any other number - why 42 and not 6? why -44 and not 628? In fact, the universe as a whole *must* equal zero. As does every monad. And you have yet to explain why it is rational to reject rational unobservables (dimensionless monads).

If the blacksmith has spare clothes lying around I would dress as the blacksmith and say I'm the new apprentice if anyone asks. I would also pocket some of the gems just in case things get hairy and if not, hey, free gems. The thing about talking to people is not everything is a check. If you look the part, and seem confident and aren't doing anything out of the ordinary, then people tend to not ask questions, and if they do and youre confident in you answers, you don't need a persuasion check unless what you say is dumb, or if the DM deems fit. If anyone asked me what I was doing, I'd say grabbing a cart for the weekly delivery. Now once I got a cart, I'd make sure the blacksmith and woman were still gagged and tied up and unconscious. If they are awake, I'd knock them out again. Next I'd load them in the cart, put a sheet over them to hide them, and then gently load weapons over them, and cover the weapons with a bigger sheet. Then I'd walk out again to an area deemed safe, and wait for nightfall, and sneak out of the town when I could with or without the cart, or, send a message to my party for extraction help, and hide until they got there. If at any point guards got suspicious he could throw the gems, to get passerbys to cause a riot and commotion as he is able to get away in the confusion.",1575158685

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

NYC is a 45-60 minutes away via a commercial jet flight, and an 8 hour Amtrak or bus ride away.  One of the direct routes between Buffalo and NYC goes OUTSIDE of New York State, through Pennsylvania and New Jersey, before crossing the Hudson River back into NYS and Manhattan.  Buffalonians speak in an accent that  sounds nothing like the NYC accent; it's really in the same family as the Chicago accent.  The local food is different.  The architecture is different.  The weather is *much* different.  That's how far away NYC is.

Richard Florida talks about ""Torbufchester"" as a megapolitan area.  Nobody lumps Buffalo in with the Northeast Corridor. There's no such thing as ""New Yorbuffalbchestercuse"".

The official definition of ""Upstate New York"" that New York state government uses is ""counties without commuter rail service to New York City.""  Basically, outside the NYC sphere of influence and commuter shed.

The United States Census Bureau considers the [cities and environs of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Syracuse, Utica, Elmira, and Ithaca as their own metropolitan areas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas)

It is possible, but difficult, to trade for a legitimate 6IV Ditto.

If you do not have much to offer, you may not be able to trade for one here on this subreddit.

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt; I don't understand how finding the coefficient of the term with the power 15 is easier than finding all tuples that add to 15.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a fast way to determine the coefficient of the term with the power 15 other than expanding the giant thing, which would take like 6^5 multiplication of terms?

The point of the generating function is that actually its faster than that. It takes roughly 6*5^2 operations.

For a general die with s sides thrown n times, this generalises to about s*n^2 operations.

Also, this can be sped up further with the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).

&gt;What would be the optimal way to find this using combinatorics without the generating function?

Probably writing down the recurrence relation for the number of ways to find a sum s after n rolls, w(s,n)=sum(w(s',n-1)) where s' ranges over s-f for the values f on the faces of the die. Then with the initial conditions which are w(f,1)=#faces equal to f on the die.

Note however that this is identical to the generating function approach and isn't really avoiding generating functions as pretending they aren't actually there.",1575158689

"TheHandmaidsTale","t5_3fhbh","I believe Lydia's story about her life before Gilead. Her whole vendetta against Judd is based off the moment where she was forced to shoot the Unwomen in order to become an Aunt. 

She is both a victim and a perpetrator. I don't think that contradicts her narrative so much. At the very beginning, she introduces herself as someone who is feared. She doesn't really deny doing horrible things, she just makes it clear that she has suffered, and she thinks it's for a greater good: if she wasn't there, someone who is trying to undermine the system, then a true believer Aunt might be her place.

She believes that working her way to the top with her own agenda is the best way to proceed. And yes, she's let a lot of people be killed, enslaved, tortured, raped, etc. But if Lydia stood her ground every time, she might get purged, and then her bigger plans to change Gilead might be ruined. Does this justify what she does? No. Is it a price to pay so Vidala isn't the head of the Aunts? Maybe. It's intentionally very ambiguous. 

I think she did shoot Judd. It was a private meeting between two high-ups at a safe location, not having security present could work -- and she timed it so it would set up a larger moment that hopefully leads to the fall of Gilead.

Atwood doesn't go for the ""Lydia was the good guy all along"" approach, I think. But neither is Lydia the complete villain that she appears to Gilead, and appeared to the readers in Book 1. She was a normal woman (an extremely intelligent woman) who got roped into this world and tried to remain decent and work for a greater good, but still did cause a lot of suffering along the way. But unless you join a rebellion, almost everyone is a cog in the monstrous machine that is Gilead.",1575158689

Bought this on the current Autumn Sale. Since I wanted to have actually played at least one thing from 2019 this 2019.

It feels a lot like Hotline Miami 2 but much more streamlined and fixing a lot of the mistakes HM2 had (I loved HM2 but the story was just a bit too disconnected and the gameplay had exactly enough bullshit that it got annoying after a while). The story is really interesting and told in a very fun way. This game has a better conversation system than Fallout 4.

8/10 so far, could be taken to a 7 or a 9 depending on whether it sticks the landing in regards to the ending or not.

**Puyo Puyo Tetris**

I bought this a long time ago but I'm only really getting into it now. I've always been pretty good at solo Tetris (I had a really boring class years ago that involved computers and I'd play Tetris instead of working like 100% of the time) but pretty terrible at Versus mode.

This game is teaching me a lot that I would never have learned about the game if I just sat comfortably at SP mode, and I'm having a blast, even if the RNG in regards to the pieces can feel like bullshit sometimes (had a game the other day where I pretty much made no obvious mistakes but ended up losing because the game just wouldn't give that damn L piece).

I'm horrible at Puyo Puyo though. I can barely do a Triple T-Spin on Tetris, how do they expect me to have the processing power to pull off those chains?!

 A very thoughtful comment. The Ma.K size is definitely a good scale to work in, especially with the diameter styrene tube that is readily available. I've never built an Ma.K kit, but their design is very inspiring. Power suit design in Fallout is also a good source of inspiration. 

German tank design has no end to interesting lines. The deck design was definitely something I wanted to draw on.

 In fact, I've become very skeptical of *anything* offered on Amazon for computer components (and some other categories) because I've been burned way too many times. Everything from sketchy Chinese brands to counterfeit merch to mislabeled products. Bezos doesn't seem to give a shit, he just enlists *any* kind of seller and it's a crapshoot whether they're reputable. Fake reviews make this an unreliable measure of quality. What's worse, the way Amazon works is that they dump all of the *same* product -- regardless of seller -- into the same bin so potentially bad products get mixed with good and ALL sellers therefore become unreliable. That's *my* experience, anyway.

Especially for items like ram, I prefer to go to the source instead and I've always had good luck with Crucial. Here's what they say

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Thank you for sharing! I think you‚Äôre right - it‚Äôs definitely a very intimate and emotional experience so that kind of thing isn‚Äôt easy to come by with casual relationships. 

I‚Äôm not really comfortable with one night stands and they‚Äôre not my thing and I‚Äôm not opposed to a serious relationship- I just haven‚Äôt met anyone but I also haven‚Äôt been sexually active much in the past few years. I feel like waiting for a relationship and having these traumatic sexual experiences as the  only ones I‚Äôve experienced is just not healthy for me and it‚Äôs not helping my confidence either. That is probably affecting my choice of men as well, I think. 

This is why more casual fwb type of relationship might help me overcome some of the past trauma, along with the yoni massage. I don‚Äôt want to just jump into bed with random people though. Maybe this new year will change things :)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To set an example.

Insults are always made on an emotional basis, or are made out of an emotional response. 

Emotions are almost never controlled so the words spurred out by that uncontrolled emotion are almost always meaningless.

Therefore whenever someone tries to hurt me or insult me deliberately, it feels very stupid receiving them. Also it‚Äôs quite childish to insult one another, and I feel like a proper person with a lot of self-knowledge doesn‚Äôt insult people.

So when I do receive an insult, my brain makes that person out to be an airhead, stupid, impulsive, childish and the insult itself just never hurts or gets to me.

For me this has always been basic knowledge. But people around me always tend to get hurt by insults which I just can‚Äôt seem to understand.

Also most insults are very relative and subjective.  Getting called ugly as an example, means that person isn‚Äôt attracted to you, oke? But there are also persona who think you are attractive. So why care about one opinion thats just relative to that persons view.",1575158698

At one point I gave them explicit instructions on what to test dialing out.  They showed up, plugged in and tested dialing, said it was good, and left.  When I tried to follow up on what exactly they dialed, they had failed to document what they actually tested.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

Thanks for understanding.

Christians believe these things cause ""God"" or ""the Bible"" whereas vegans believe animals can feel pain and suffer because of science and basic observation.

It's not similar you're right, it's IDENTICAL. Both views purport to be morally superior and that doing X behavior means you're lesser than they are and should  submit to their self-perceived superiority. The how and why don't matter. God vs the poor animals doesn't matter. The ends don't justify the means and the means vegans use to spread their beliefs are the exact same tactics used by fundamentalist Christians and cultists. They do this because the very argument is flawed and not capable of standing on it's own. So they must bully, harass, shun, lie and stigmatize to force their view on ""unbelievers""

The odds of you making that happen are incredibly slim. Ludicrously slim.   


You MAY be able to find a woman who is a close friend of yours, and convince her to have a child, which you and your future husband will raise, and have that close female friend be a part of the child's life, which is slightly more likely, but still very difficult.

Pay the mortgage as quickly as you can. 

But but what about low interest money that you‚Äôre paying back quickly? You can use that money for something else. 

This is your first property, you need to learn the discipline of not taking any money out of the business to service external needs. 

Plowing that money right back into the mortgage keeps it hostage and prevents you from having spending dreams. (Of course you‚Äôre should keep a suitable emergency stash on hand for expenses). 

23 years in, we have a rental business that we‚Äôve never pulled anything out of. And that continues to ensure the growth.

Ever wonder why they keep on raging about diversity and all that pseudo-sociological bullshit and yet their core team is all White, all male (bar one token female), and yet they have the gall to appear holier-than-thou in every single interaction? Get the fuck out of here, bruh!

By contrast, I found the Dlang community one of the best (remaining) technical communities - they didn't give a fuck if I was White, Black, Purple, Male, degenerate or an alien wrapped in a gender-fluid raccoon's body. All they cared about was technical stuff, trusting adults to converse like adults, and that always worked out from what I saw. If D had the same pull as Rust has, I would use replace Rust with D in a heartbeat. In fact, the community was rather welcoming of opposing views, and even unjustified ones were debated in a genteel and professional manner. The idiots in the Rust Brigade simply downvote what they don't like (and quite possibly don't even understand), and that's a huge part of the problem - a complete blind faith in some entity - correct or not, which in fact goes against every single principle that they claim to follow. Hilarious, to be honest. 

I still have hopes for Zig (even though it's not really a full substitute for Rust). I like the fact that Andrew Kelley is a smart person who goes about his business, and is willing to entertain contributions and ideas from anyone, and the idea is judged upoin its own merit. I Hope as the community grows, it manages to stay the same way. 

About Steve, to be honest, I never liked him much, but after his gross mistreatment by Mozilla (and subsequent exit), I had a sympathetic view towards him. I really don't understand his comments of late though - almost acting like a cover-up agent for things which are clearly bad or plain wrong in the Rust ecosystem and/or community.

4. But you see the colour this time, so maybe you see progress, but to reach that maybe your old self has to die which poisons this good idea.

"WitchesVsPatriarchy","t5_p3r73","All of your first paragraph is terrifying and true. At some point this issue *will* make it‚Äôs way up to the Supreme Court and then all of us women are truly, royally fucked. I‚Äôm newly married. I want to have babies. But if a clump of cells (or even a full term baby that isn‚Äôt going to live or will have an extremely short, painful life) that I of course love, is going to kill me, it has to be me first. It would be tragic, literally no one *wants* an abortion (or a stillborn or sick baby, for that matter), but I come first if it‚Äôs between me plus my baby dying or just my very very sick baby dying, as it was always going to do, I have to choose me. Horrible to think about but so many women are put into that situation. And maybe my comment sounds crass, but I need to be alive for my husband and future family. I can‚Äôt die. He will be broken. If this happened after we had already had some kids, they would be broken. A mother needs to be alive for her children.

I probably worded this horribly, but if there‚Äôs a choice, you have to make it. If I was going to give birth to a perfectly healthy baby but I was going to die, yes, I choose the baby. Maybe some people wouldn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs okay, too.

And, again,  this is coming from a married person who wants children soon. There are plenty of teenagers and young women or women who can‚Äôt afford or don‚Äôt want children with their own points of views that I haven‚Äôt even gotten into.

There are just so many complexities to this. My point is, women should always no matter what have the right to choose what is best for them and their family.",1575158708

It is amusing though, when Jose was still around I was much more positive and then people called me a cultist for supporting jose when he had the rug pulled out from under him because I refused to turn on him. 

Now our football is worse, and I honestly find it quite hypocritical the way people are treating those who don‚Äôt back ole. 

Giving a manager with no CV to speak of the job because of 6 weeks of results is the definition of knee jerk. You want to sell me the idea that ole implemented tactics and is the reason this team won within 4 weeks of him being hired? It‚Äôs a new manager bounce, every club goes through it. 

But if you‚Äôre arguing that he‚Äôs the reason we got all those wins, then how can you remove him from all responsibility for how horrible we‚Äôve been this year?

All I keep asking for from anyone backing ole in is facts and reasons and all I keep getting back is platitudes. 

He‚Äôs gotten the team sheet wrong nearly every game this season, his tactics have been poor. 

Platitudes and niceties aside, and problems aside of which we certainly have...

There are still massive problems with ole. He can‚Äôt manage to protect a lead to save his life, something neither of our previous two managers had a problem doing with far worse back lines. 

I‚Äôll be positive when I see some sense that ole can get us results on the pitch, and that players can actually improve under him, as is the hallmark of a good manager.

‚ÄúKnows United. Loves United.‚Äù These aren‚Äôt qualifications of a manager. Moyes also knew and loved United. (Sorry that was the wrong platitude for Moyes. I meant to say he was ‚Äúhand selected by SAF‚Äù another platitude that doesn‚Äôt qualify someone for the job)

If it's some shit-shack that routinely violated any and all employment laws, that's one thing. But if there's any level of professionalism, advancement, etc, then dating between bosses and direct reports is absolutely a no-no. Neither party can cross that line, although the ramifications are not as much if the lower is propositioning the higher, than the boss doing the propositioning.

If a report propositioned a boss (REGARDLESS OF GENDER), the boss should email their own boss and describe the situation: the leadup, the proposition, and the rejection. If it's resolved amicably, good, although some may attempt to separate the boss and report without negatively affecting either's position. 

But if the direct report escalates (tries again, starts gossiping, etc), now there's documentation and HR should definitely be involved. And if they hadn't be separated before, they will now. And btw, the boss being ""friendly"" is not a defense (again, REGARDLESS OF GENDER).

NOTE: If it's the boss who propositioned, it is completely suitable for the report to go straight to HR, and that will affect the boss's position/career. That is SUCH a big no-no because it opens the company up to so many lawsuits that very little leniency is usually given.",1575158714

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","For your information, if you choose an AoE damage spell, you generally don't intend it to to control a number of enemies or kill single targets. It's intended to kill groups of weaker enemies or at least roughen them up enough for others to clean up. And it this context you should consider it. And in this context it has the same damage as flame strike, but 4 times the area, a bit less damage than cone of cold but like 5 times the area if not more, more damage than cloudkill and you can't run away. And again, I'm comparing this shit to 5th lvl spells, not third. 
 AoE on both of the spells you mention is laughable. MMM needs four turns to get the same damage, four failed saves and has 1/4 the area. And is even more vulnerable to fire resistance than fireball. And lighting bolt of course does the same damage, but enemies need to stand in a line which is unlikely to happen and makes it hard to aim without hitting allies. 

Of course, damage type comes into play. And this not only doesn't come up nearly as often as you'd think since very specific groups of enemies make the numbers inflated for fire resistance while not really affecting the likeliness of meeting them, but also you can work around it with Elemental Affinity. 

And your last point is again missing the mark. You use fireball when circumstances are right and you imply that since there are circumstances where using hold person gives you much better results exist that makes fireball a bad spell. No, it doesn't, it's a specific spell for specific purposes, but oh well, since killing shit is generally what you want in most cases casting fireball is what gets you there the fastest. 

And even if you contest this notion again, as a convinced person happy to argue with strangers who disagree, I'll still be pondering how to sneak fire resistant enemies into my campaign while not bothering with lighting resistant ones, since I have two players who took fireball and it makes it harder to make encounters than the pallock and battlemaster combined. 

I wish you a lot of fun with MMM and Lighting Bolt and hope you don't die too much because of this",1575158714
"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I was just like you starting out and now I am one of the most toxic players after 5 years of playing.

I realized I had spent more time typing than actually playing the game. I would let what people get to me so bad, that I wouldn‚Äôt even want to win anymore. I would int, afk, or play ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù constantly, definitely more often than not.

And just for context, I was not toxic in the way that I told people to kill themselves for feeding or anything like that. What would get me mad was being the only one winning lane and then have someone feeding say something stupid. If I ever had a bad game I would just say sorry and try my best.  I knew when I was playing bad and didn‚Äôt try to blame it on others, which was what tilted me so hard all the time.

For the body, it's moreso that there's no evidence that showering every day is better than showering 3-4 times a week (aka every other day). Except, of course, for people that get stinky quickly, or have certain other conditions or situations. You going to the gym every day absolutely pushes your need to daily showers.

The recommendation *against* showering every day is mostly a preference thing, as far as I can figure from what little information there is about it. If you don't mind your skin being a bit drier, and potentially have more acne breakouts, then it doesn't really matter. That's what the studies show. If you don't have an skin conditions, and if you're not uncomfortable, do what works best for you. Though I'll also apply the ""Curly Girl"" theory to this: if you can, try out what people claim the ""better option"" is for 2 weeks. If you end up liking it better, great, keep doing it! If you don't, go back to what works for you. Everyone is different.

Note: there is an issue of stripping essential bacteria with too-frequent showering, so something you could consider is only using soap once a day, and doing just a water rinse during the other shower. So, probably soapy rinse after workouts, and water rinse after an average day.

And don't feel bad about taking extra showers sometimes. If you feel grimy, then take a shower. I had a day where I took I think 4, because circumstance left me feeling grimy, generally guh-y (I hope that emotion gets across), or just too god damn hot (it was a REALLY hot day, and I had a lot of outdoor activities throughout the day).",1575158715

"functionalprogramming","t5_2vcmg","Interesting, although an imperative procedure would look just like #3 and even behave the same.
I think the classic example of
x = x + 1
isn't too bad although there are nuances as well.
Obviously C would really overwrite the value in memory and x is nothing more than for example a location on the stack.
Some FP languages don't allow this as it's a false expression.
Others allow shadowing, so don't overwrite the actual value but there is just a new name x pointing to x+1.
So technically = is still an assignment but it just assigns ""pointers"".
But probably that doesn't help too much as it just scratches the core of immutability. 

Time is also much more confusing in FP languages as we don't really control the flow. 

If in C we write 
X = 1
X = X + 1
we impose explicitly that line 1 will be run first, then line 2.

Elixir allows the same two lines and in the end we also have an implicit ordering that is imposed by the fact that the second line needs the definition from the first line. 
So because of this shadowing the order  of our lines is relevant again while theoretically it should not matter without :). 

And also in my layman's terms it's interesting to think about purity by contemplating about ""statements don't make sense for pure functions"". Because a function with immutable parameters, with no side effects, only provides a return value as result and nothing else. So the call is useless without handling the return value. 

Well, those are a couple thoughts of how my brain tries to find the distinctions but like so many others I find it really hard to present a clear picture of all the consequences.",1575158718

I had a similar-sounding issue during development that was related to pruning invalid vertices from a given face.

The QuakeMapNode algorithm does brute-force three-plane intersection checks to determine vertex locations for a given brush, then projects them onto the plane's normal and checks the sign (offset by a small epsilon value) to determine whether the vertices in question actually lie within the brush, or whether they're irrelevant intersections somewhere out in space.

The bug in my case was having a too-small epsilon value, which was causing valid vertices to be pruned out. I don't know if that applies to your implementation, but hopefully it can put any leftover curiosity to rest :)",1575158718

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","1.) Pointing out white on black vs black on white homicide is trivial since around 90% of homicides have the same race for criminal and victim.

2.) You can correlate race to crime but there are other factors that correlate at a much higher rate. For example: number of parents, number of parents in neighbor hood, number of hours read/ cultural environment and so forth.

3.) whiteness and blackness are not a think. There are different culture but those cultures are not homogenous and have different subcultures. 
To say all or even a majority of a skin color has the same culture, especially in the US is ignorant.

The values that one has leads to massively different actions and therefore massively different outcomes.",1575158719

Infection via droplets is one of the most common, if not the most common way, diseases spread.

When blowing onto something you use much more pressure taking up much more tiny droplets than by exhaling.

IMO it is not far fetched, to ask a bartender to not unnecessarily blow on my drink.

"Flatearther","t5_3k7bo","She's eating her hair. First of all, every galaxy is supposed to rotate and they are all allegedly rotating at the same rate for whatever impossible reason. So now they claim some galaxies are non-rotating like stationary in space and she ate her hair to tell us that the rotating ones have more hydrogen than the stationary galaxies for whatever reason. So the extra hydrogen makes them rotate or what?! How does she know they have more hydrogen?! It doesn't matter, 'cos she is science, she reads these things and then uses her expertise to make predictions about the sky while she's sitting on her desk eating her hair. If you guys weren't a bunch of kids you'd see through this rather than believing her bullshit blindly.

Also learned today that Neptune was only theorized until NASA made a cartoon of it. None of you can see Neptune in your telescopes or Pluto or anything else further. You only see seven planets and that's all there are. Everything else is cartoons that you can't ever see for yourself no matter what you do.

Also how does a galaxy have hydrogen, where is it exactly?! Inside one of the stars or where? Where is the hydrogen of the milky way which is a rotating galaxy and so it should be abundant in hydrogen? Is it space vacuum or a space fabric cloth or is the space made of hydrogen? If not then where is all her hydrogen hiding?! Did anyone bother asking her this? Am I allowed or will I get blacklisted and banned if I ask this sort of thing as I always do? So who will ever ask her this?",1575158720

"WaltDisneyWorld","t5_2te6p","No it is not worth the money but it is awesome. After hours cost more then a full day of park, for less time, and very limited entertainment. You don‚Äôt get as many street performers, characters, and shows, and even some rides are closed. Food choices are extremely limited, which is a big draw for me since food is typically one of my favorite parts of the parks. You do get shorter lines, so you can do more rides in a shorter amount of time, but I will argue that if you plan your fast passes right you can get the same amount of rides in, if not more, in a full day of park. So if you want to splurge on your vacation I guess go for it because it is really cool being in a park that‚Äôs so empty, but it is not an adequate replacement for a full park day.",1575158720
