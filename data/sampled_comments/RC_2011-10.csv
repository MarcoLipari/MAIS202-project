On a grass surface, it's just like playing barefoot; you'll slip around and have trouble cutting hard.  It's actually dangerous to play in them, same with playing barefoot.  It's really easy to pull muscles (esp. groin &amp; hammies) or slip and fall.  Or even get stepped on.  Ouch.

Vibrams *do not* work on hard surfaces either.  It feels exactly the same changing directions in them as it does barefoot.  You'll want to slow down first, get balanced, and then turn and push.  Again the slipping and falling, also busting up your toes real bad.

Best bet for hard surfaces are *tennis shoes*.  They have the most support, and they are built for exactly the kind of running you want to do; quick cutting forward and back or side to side.  It might feel weird with such a big shoe, but it's the right choice.","1317427208"

You name it.

I can say that out of all of those trips I have had three or four completely life changing experiences. These are the days you decide to dose big and strap yourself in for the ride. Nothing anyone can say or do will prepare you for a complete loss of self &amp; time as you thought you knew them. Complete Ego dissolution is quite a curious experience, to put it lightly, and if it's the first time you experience it you usually have a hard time 'letting go' of the self and all the things (material possessions) which you hold so tragically close to your heart. You will realise that all that is, was and will ever be is the eternal now. No past, no future, just raw awareness. 

My last large dose &amp; a highly recommended experience: 15g wet (around ~4g dry) Psilocybin Atlantis truffles in Amsterdam. Hire bikes. Consume on the picturesque riverways whilst riding to the Vondelpark. Ride around the Vondelpark on the most magical bike ride of your life while colours and sounds explode in front of you and humanity and nature show every angle of themselves to you at once.
A few photos from this day to share: http://imgur.com/a/8xwNb

It is my personal opinion that if everyone had JUST ONE decent dose of Psiloc(in|ybin) at some point in their journey from the crache to the crematorium, the world would be a much happier place.

tl;dr
Psilocybin + right setting * high dose  = -ego + realisation that you are the eternal now.

Just to clarify this should really be. ""Banks were forced to make crap loans, knew they were crap, and unloaded them as fast as possible.""

&gt;""investment banks sold that crap bundled up in credit swaps and their ilk."" 
You probably should have said mortgage backed securities. Credit default swaps are bought after the fact. Mostly by AIG during this time.  

&gt;""Everything is wrong with both the bank and the marketer of the swap being made largely whole by the bailout while the regulations are rewritten to avoid the truth that is balance sheets that are still loaded down with tons of shit assets and Uncle Sam now the proud owner of over 250,000 foreclosed home.""   
Easier to just say that rating agencies and the SEC didn't do their jobs. I actually don't have a problem with uncle Sam owning this turd bucket. They were the creators of the problems so they get to carry the product of the problem they created. 


&gt;""So yea. Screw the banks and CDO they rode in on.""
Remember, banks were damn near forced to take on these loans. They were required for these sub prime mortgages to pretty much underwrite them blind folded to many any sense. No bank wants to make a deal on a guaranteed foreclosure (which is what they pretty much were). Foreclosures are very messy and expensive process sometimes lasting for years. I work in real estate so I know this all to well. Banks do everything they can to avoid foreclosures. When they foreclose they are very lucky to even break even.

Otherwise I agree with you.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think all of tokuteks blog posts are worthy of reddit, i've downvoted a few myself. But I also don't think that just because that's all this person posts, regardless of relevance, that it should not be in /r/database.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","You don't need to quote me Romo's numbers, I've been quoting them a lot myself recently.

As far as Bradford, he is a dink and dunk passer right now because the Rams have no receivers that are both a deep threat and able to catch the ball.  Denario this year but he can't play 2 games in a row.  Not to mention the guy is a second year player on a team that was 1-15 2 years ago.  Romo is a better QB today.  Probably a better QB next year and a decent chance he will be the year after that.  4 or 5 years from now and I think Bradford will better as long as the Rams can get the right personnel around him.  And if we are talking about just this year I would take him over all but 4 or 5 guys.  Bradford is not one of those 5.  As I said, I like Romo, I'm not one of the haters.  I've spent the last 3 weeks defending his 4th quarter play in the regular season and the fact that he isn't solely to blame for the teams' woes.  That said, Bradford has enough promise if not more than any other young QB in the league today.","1317427222"

I don't know whether you or your grandpa will find this interesting, but my grandmother and my great grandmother used to bake bread for the Jews who were in held in a camp in Alytus, Lithuania. 

My grandmother, Zina, was the oldest child. She was barely 14 years old and she with three of her younger brothers (Peter, Vitaliy and Tolia) would sneak in at night to deliver loafs of bread to Jews who were stuck behind the barbed wire. My grandmother was Russian old believer but all of her friends with who she had spent her childhood in the Lithuanian countryside were Jews who were stuck in the camp so she simply wanted to help her friends out.

Eventually my grandma and her family got caught and they ended up being held in the camp for over one year until the Nazis have retreated, because the Russians were advancing. 

After my grandmother got freed she reunited with her old friends and they have been friends ever since. Shes either 83 or 84 now and she still enjoys an afternoon tea with some of her friends from WWII.

 Ohh man I wish my grandma knew how to use scanner so she could scan some pictures with her hommies enjoying a drink after the war so I could show them to the community :/

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Light sometimes acts like a particle (like in solar cells) and sometimes acts like a wave (like in double-slit diffraction).  

It doesn't need a medium to travel through.  Sound needs a medium with mass to travel through - sound is essentially pressure waves.  Pressure waves can propagate through air, water, metal, etc.  

But as inc114 said, light is made up of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate.  The fields don't need any medium to exist - they exist within vacuum, air, water, metal, and other materials.  

Visible light occupies one bit of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Others include infrared light (longer wavelengths), ultraviolet light (shorter wavelengths), radio, x-rays, and others.  All these types of radiation are fundamentally the same.  Light just happens to have the right wavelength that your eyes can pick it up and interpret it.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I am NOT implying, and I made this clear, that we should remove saved games from existing games.  That would, indeed, be a horrible design decision.

What I'm saying is we should stop designing games around having a save-game system.  We should design non-linear games in which winning and losing are both a real possibility.

I'm also NOT advocating for games ""taking longer to play"", in fact, just the opposite.  By stripping story out of a game, you can get right into it and have nothing but interesting decision after interesting decision - efficiency!  I highly recommend you check out Tetris or the board game 7 Wonders for an example of what I mean.

&gt;Then don't load from save if you don't like this feature.

Games are specifically ABOUT discovering what the optimal moves are - *mastery*.  To expect the players to NOT use the most overpowered weapon ever wielded in the HISTORY of all games - the save file - is not reasonable, at all.

Here's what I advocate:

A return to the fundamentals of what games are.  A game is a system of rules, in which agents COMPETE by making interesting, meaningful decisions.  Yes, I think building a game around story (as in, plot-points) is a bad idea, because then you are tying down a non-linear, emergent system to a linear course of events, to various degrees.  I'm not totally against ""saves"" - Mount &amp; Blade's ""Save &amp; Exit"" is just fine.  I AM against allowing players to go back on their decisions, because that means that their decisions simply do not matter.  And yeah, I think check-points have the same problem.","1317427237"

Remember; Gus has been involved in Meth production far longer than the Cartel, has paid for two chemists top-tier free runs through Universities, and has a lab that is far cleaner, more well hidden, and better maintained than what the Cartel was working out of. 

From every angle we are assured that even though the Cartel may be larger and more intimidating as a whole, Gus knows how to fight properly as the little guy, and in this case, it's offering product superior to anything they can come up with on their own, despite all their efforts leading up to Gus' eventual ultimatum. 

Until Walt came along, Gale was the best, and it's likely the exact same scenario would have played out after his ""hard-earned"" concoction started taking over the market, albeit with our vegan friend surrounded by Cartelians, rather than Jesse.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I worked for a while in the wedding industry and I planned my own wedding, although in the US.  The easiest way to cut costs on a wedding is to invite fewer people.  That's the most drama-filled way, too, because you have to decide who makes the cut, but if you're serious about cutting costs, that's the way to go.

My second biggest suggestion is: pretend this is not a wedding you're planning.  Pretend this is a very nice party you're having for some of your closest friends/family.  I say this for several reasons- one is because everything wedding-related is more expensive than the non-wedding-equivalent, and the other is that it will help you get out of the mind-set of ""It won't be a wedding without X"", where X is anything besides your fiance and an officiant.  When you get out of the wedding mindset, you'll find that dresses and cakes are cheaper, you don't have to buy everything in theme colors, and perfectly nice bouquets of flowers are available inexpensively at the grocery store.","1317427249"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;The idea is that we can imagine it to have gone differently

I'm not completely sure if we're talking about the same thing.  I'm not talking about the *configuration* of the universe.  That is clearly able to be imagined to have been different, no contest there.  I'm talking about the energy/matter (whatever is the most accurate way of describing what the physical world is made of) that everything is at the bottom-most level.  I'm talking about what is *being* configured in our universe, not the configuration itself.  

So back to what I said above, if we're talking about the existence of this physical 'stuff', to imagine it differently would be to imagine nothingness.  A point has to be something, or else it wouldn't be a point, so I would still argue that we probably can't imagine nothingness.  Pointing out that the stuff can be warped only serves to point out again that the stuff can be configured differently.

&gt;You can, but just know that you are then committing to an extraordinary claim. That there is just one brute contingency, despite all our experience to the contrary.

No, see this is the important piece, with what I'm talking about *everything* is a brute fact of a sort.  That is, to the extent that all of it is made out of the brute fact stuff, it all exists as a brute fact.  Now of course, the objects you're thinking of are specific configurations of the stuff, and these configurations are not necessary in the slightest, but that doesn't get at the underlying issue at all.

For an analogy, I'm basically talking about a lump of clay having a brute fact existence.  Now, you can come along and roll it in your hands and make a snake, you can form it into bricks and build a little house with it, you can even make a little person with it.  After making all those things though, have you done anything to demonstrate that the clay is somehow just as contingent as the configurations you were able to produce with it?","1317427250"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It was the British Mandate of Palestine. It's a bit of a different story than most former colonies because of what happened in 1947.

During WW1, the Ottoman Empire occupied and controlled the area now known as Israel. After the breakup of the empire following the Allied victory, the League of Nations gave control of this area to the UK. This transferal of control is called a 'mandate', and it was left this way until Israel appeared and fought for control of the area under the financial and logistical support of the victors of the recently won WW1.

Really what happened is that the European victors felt horrible about what happened to the Jews and those in power began to support Zionism, or the belief that the Jewish people deserve their own homeland. So they decided that the best place for them to go would be the birthplace of Judaism. They fought a quick war and set themselves up. It's a shitty situation for the Palestinians, but you have to remember that this is how most borders are formed: people fight wars and the victors write the borders. Need I remind you about the American Indian? Didn't we do the same exact thing to the native people of America? Aboriginals ring a bell? This is what happens in history... The strong survive. As an Arab-American I really want to say that the Palestinians deserve their own homeland but honestly the only thing I can see them doing is fighting a war for independence. That is happening right now, but its been happening for so long that the Israelis are far far stronger militarily thanks to Allied (now US) aid. Also, both sides are xenophobic to the point where I think all they want is utter distruction of each other. 

It's really a tragic situation but I'm not sure a two state solution will ever work. With all of the countries that surround Israel being as xenophobic as Hamas, I really don't think Jews and Arabs can coexist in that region as long as their respective religions are fueling the xenophobia. Maybe the internet will help change the younger generation and they will find a peaceful solution... 

What really gets tricky when you say ""there was no recognized country"" is that we need to use better terminology. For all intents and purposes, the Nation of Palestine has existed for over 2,000 years. The nation-state ""British Mandate of Palestine"" existed for a brief 30 years or so. What I am trying to hammer home is that ""country"" is a poor term to use when we are discussing the Palestinian situation. 

Consider for a second that a nation is just a group of people (IE: Red Sox nation, nation of Islam), and a state is a soverign ""country"" that has a government. The term ""country"" is poor to use because it can be used to describe a state, a nation, or a nation-state. 

So to be clear, there WAS and IS a country called Palestine. There was a state in that area (the Mandate), and there most certainly is a nation of Palestinians. ","1317427261"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;So, if you are now defining regulations as government support,

Not at all.  I'm talking about specific regulations that specifically prop up an individual or even an entire industry.  Pretty much all regulations do that, but at least some regulations are meant to be universal standards in theory.  

&gt;If anything, CA and NY have a more robust market than TX

I'm not sure how you are defining ""robust"" here.

&gt;So, again, a less regulated market has more of a monopoly than a regulated market, but shouldn't the difference be huge because CA and NY are so heavily regulated?

Not necessarily.  Texas is a heavily regulated state too.  There is no ""unregulated"" market for health care anywhere in this country.  Less regulation does not equal an absence of regulation.  I don't think that you can measure regulations in the number of pages or rules.  It is the totality of the affect of each regulation that is important.  I can't even imagine how you could argue that one market is 70% as regulated as another market.   Besides, market concentration isn't the ideal measure of a monopoly.  A monopoly is an entity that can charge monopoly prices for a long period of time.  Certainly some players will have a large share of the market, but as long as they are not charging monopoly prices, that isn't terribly relevant. The fact that you are bringing up one of the most regulated industries in this country to discuss deregulation is shocking.

&gt; Again, you will say this is not a true free market, and any comparisons are invalid because of government involvement.

It depends on what specifically the government is doing.  There is no key number of regulations, and it is impossible to measure regulations in any amount other than pages, and that doesn't really tell you much about the regulations themselves.  

&gt;As a counter example, you will provide nothing, assert your position again, and say that you don't have to provide a counter example or counter evidence. See you in a couple hours.

But you don't have any argument except, ""there has never been a truly free society,"" which wasn't what I asked.  Even in an unfree society, you could still theoretically find an example of a natural monopoly occurring without government interference, especially if the market naturally trended towards monopoly as you argue.

2) The a in atheism doesn't mean anti, it means absence of.  Atheism is not anti-faith or anti-religion, just like agnostic is not anti-knowledge.

3) Atheism does not worship science.  Most atheists understand science.  And the ones that don't, understand that people smarter than them do.  Big difference.

4) Atheism does not see nature as god.  That's Wicca.

5) People do not worship Richard Dawkins (well, there's probably some crazies out there).  There is a difference between messiah and famous person, otherwise, I guess all those famous Islamic scholars are messiahs since you follow their teachings.

6) Morals are relative to each person.  Most people raised a certain way retain the morals of their upbringing.  Since a lot of atheists are raised religious, the lessons of their childhood stays with them.  The difference is, the majority of atheists will question them, and if necessary, change them.

And granting a power to the President is a little different from restricting various powers. The power to wage war, by its very nature, implies that we are dealing with a territory where there is no US jurisdiction. However, the Bill of Rights prohibits the US government from certain conduct which, in foreign countries, it would presumably not have the power to engage in anyway.

Also, if you actually bought the album, you recall the focus on stereoscopic photographs. There was a whole booklet and a flap with lens in it so you could view the stereoscopic images as a 3D image. So the layering of the songs makes perfect sense with that.

I also remember that Tool was asked if there was a puzzle with this album (like the previous one) and Maynard said yes.

Well. I'm happy to know it's been solved. I wonder what other songs layer - if they do.

I think that the western ""me"" culture and the lack of effective parenting in this country lends a lot to the ""whorification"" of the American teenage girl. It is absolutely correct that no one FORCED these girls to take sexually suggestive pictures of themselves, and they seem to take great pride from a very young age the effect that their bodies have on men of all ages and learn quickly how to use that to their advantage. Looking at the pictures of Angie V that have been posted everywhere... she's 14 years old, is shown in many of her pictures with alcohol, in EXTREMELY suggestive positions and stages of dress. I'm saying there is lots of blame to go around.","1317427290"

How so?

If the Europeans never came there, it would still be a part of the Ottoman empire. If the British destroyed the Ottoman empire but didn't acknowledge the right of the Jews to their own country, they would've never set up the mandate of Palestine in the first place, since its only purpose was to create a national home for the Jews. 

And even if everything until 1948 was exactly as it was, but the Arabs have won the war, there would *still* be no Palestine, because the plan was to divide the land between Jordan, Syria and Egypt - and indeed, the parts that were conquered by the Arabs in said war were annexed to the Arab countries. In fact, the idea that Palestine is just ""southern Syria"" or ""western Jordan"" was the leading ideology well after the war. 

The widespread idea that Palestinians should have their own country is a very new concept, even in the Arab world.","1317427300"

Cons: Jack of all trades, difficult to find a niche that can not be easily replaced by younger cheaper blood.  Real world ME is more like common sense engineering.  (Widget is too big, solution, make it smaller)

EE 
Pro: Job field and work is more defined.  More people (management) will not understand a word you say.
Cons: You're that nerd in the basement that gets dumped on since you're always the constraint.

Personally I would get into CE/CS (programming in JAVA, Action Script, Etc...) that's really the only innovative place for an engineering in the US economy.

Since you're in Alaska, you might consider focusing on Energy (Chevron, Exxon, Shell), but there's no innovation in energy.  As an ME/EE you're just another # in the massive energy world.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","My boyfriend and I have been together for four years in November and he has a similar fantasy. We haven't actually done it, yet, but I have had sex with other guys and then told him about it. It can be incredibly arousing. He's had sex with other women and then told me about it too. If I were you I would sit down and ask him what exactly it is about it that he enjoys. If you're not interested in it, tell him so, and tell him why not. If you don't know why yet, think hard about it. This is his fantasy and even if it makes you uncomfortable it's a personal thing and as his partner you should handle it delicately even if you're not going to change your mind. Then see if you can incorporate some of the ideas from his fantasy into the bedroom. Don't go outside of your comfort zone, but see where you guys can take this to create some new intimacy. It may also be a good time to ask him if he'd want to explore some of your fantasies. 

Again-- if you don't want to do it, dont. But this is not an uncommon fantasy. Good on him for sharing it, but hopefully he will let the fantasy slide once you tell him you're for sure not interested at all. This isn't really a fantasy you can ""dabble in"" -- it's a big leap. ","1317427312"

Pure unfettered capitalism is a disaster that will seek profit at the expense of public well being. We have always had rules in our markets in the U.S. to prevent abuses. Things like standard weights and measures so you do truly get a pound of potatoes and a gallon of oil..Regulations to insure pregnant women don't get an anti-nausea drug that gives their babies flippers, etc.      

Governments take on the industries that SHOULD NOT be controlled for profit ie. control of roadways and infrastructure for the common good, regulation of drugs and food. 

It annoys the crap out of me when someone is called ""anti-capitalist"" when they want to make a rule to prevent rat turds in food  ""OOOOHH!, that's anti-capitalist.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've never felt ""sad"" about life.  I've felt sad about events and that will always happen.  Part of the secret is to understand that happiness is something comes from what you are, the thoughts inside you, the world you build in your own mind.  If I could tell my 17 YO self anything it would be that most of the things that I felt were so frightening were really not that frightening at all.  Be brave...if something makes your heart pound, and your hands sweat, do it anyway.   The simplest things are important...the girl you are afraid to talk to wants you to talk to her, and she is afraid also.  If you have a choice between collecting things or collecting experiences, collect the experiences, every time.  Go to Australia with a cheap camers instead of buying an expensive camera.  The experiences will bring you more satisfaction as life goes on - the camera will sit on a shelf.  Try to think of yourself as someone who will be a student your entire life...it will help keep you young.  It doesn't seem like much, but these things will help a lot.  If nobody ever gave you the poem ""If,"" by Rudyard Kipling, they should have...so here it is.  Good luck.  Print it out...read it when you are bored.  Over time...you will know exactly what he is saying.

One more thing that I think is important...and others will be angry at me for this but everything I have seen tells me this is true.  Drugs and alcohol will not help.  If you let them become a big part of your life, you will feel the kind of enveloping sadness you want to avoid.  If you have a beer with your buddies, that's one thing...but keep your own mind in control.  That's very important.

Alright...last thought:  The world now seems to feel that snarkiness is necesarry to be considered clever.  Let it go...just let the things that made you happy before, keep making you happy.  That's called avoiding cynicism.

Here's the poem you should already have:

If:
By Rudyard Kipling

If you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, 
But make allowance for their doubting too; 
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, 
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, 
Or, being hated, don't give way to hating, 
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; 
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; 
If you can meet with triumph and disaster 
And treat those two imposters just the same; 
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken 
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, 
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken, 
And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools; 

If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, 
And lose, and start again at your beginnings 
And never breath a word about your loss; 
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew 
To serve your turn long after they are gone, 
And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on""; 

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch; 
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; 
If all men count with you, but none too much; 
If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run - 
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, 
And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!

On the other hand, there are 3 expansions in very close proximity to the main. I think these are far too close together and unimpeded. Zerg could feasibly expand twice and zone control with spine crawlers... which could be imbalanced. But the way the chokes are right now, it would be the only way zerg could win against someone with splash or forcefields. 

So, destructible rocks 1 of the 2 third base spots, and thin some of the impassible area from middle. With more room to maneuver it would at least give options for flanks.

He's been at least twice and I believe he took a ship from South America somewhere.  The other two were from my current school (which in the interest of anonymity I'd rather not mention as I'm still there as are the people who went), and they went last December I believe.  They also took the boat.  I doubt they would have left from New Zealand though, so maybe that's why they went by boat?

And I'm sure many rescues have been performed, but when it comes down to it, a post stroke observation is not grounds to risk peoples life.  Like many others have said, a post stroke observation is not considered IDLH after 24 hours, and if the victims health isn't rapidly declining, it's not grounds to put other personnel into IDLH circumstances.  Also, as many other people have pointed out, anyone allowed to travel to Antarctica is made WELL aware of the risks, and the protocol for medevac should they become injured.  I really don't see how this thread is even being discussed.  The ""victim"" appears to be stable, she's not in danger of losing her life as far as qualified medical personnel can tell....why exactly should she be rescued...during winter...in the harshest climate on earth?

The thing about electronic music today is that the lines are incredibly blurred between styles, and dubstep is a nice example of this: you have the tunes in the original dubstep style which are based around deep, meditative bassweight and vibe, and then you have the American-style electro-house-influenced, midrange-based tunes.
Both go by the name of dubstep, and because it's still a relatively new style (~10 years old) and the fact that only a small proportion of it has been adopted by the mainstream, there hasn't really been any consensus on subgenre labelling beyond 'proper dubstep' and 'brostep'.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I honestly think that the biggest roadblock in the way of DotA2's success is the community at large. For all of the amazing tutorials, time and effort that the development team could formulate and put forward, the community needs to profoundly change its attitude. There will always be leavers, trolls, and ragers--that's inevitable--but what *does* need to change, imo, is the attitude of ""gtfo of *my* DotA, go back to LoL you casual"" or just the ""we don't want you"" attitude period. 

League of Legends is, for all of its gameplay faults (which there are many), a very popular game. If DotA2 is to grow as a game, especially if it wants to be bigger than League of Legends or even SC2, people will need to move over from LoL to DotA2--and not just the pros/people with experience, but the people who are willing to sit there and watch matches/tournaments and root for their favorites, hoping to be ""the next big thing"". We need to be able to sit down and say *why* DotA is better in a reasonable way without needing to put down other games so directly (IE: ""DotA has really complex and unique heroes, like invoker"" instead of ""X game has shitty heroes everything's the same"".)","1317427331"

And I noticed you didn't argue my first point. That what you're advocating for is one particular game philosophy that you enjoy. Espousing that it is the only/best/true philosophy there is. I'm not saying that it is a bad philosophy either. I love a game with simple mechanics that gets deeper the more you learn about it. Magic: The Gathering is a perfect example of this and I encourage all game designers to look into it. There is a reason why it is still the number one CCG out there.

However, many people don't like it. So they've turned to other card games. The newest version of the Game of Thrones card game is a LCG (Living Card Game). It works a lot like M:TG put removes the aspect of ""He who has the money has the best deck."" It fundamentally changes the concept of what those types of card games are. Does this make it any less of a strategic card game? No.

If you wish to make simple but fun games with very little story, that is awesome. I imagine I could even enjoy them myself. But saying that games that strive to have story shouldn't be considered games is... Well... Silly.","1317427369"

Second, having a little thing like that on your credit report, especially if the debt is funny money like much of the collection industries debt is, is not going to be a big deal if you have generally good credit.   In the past year I've had a couple of collection agencies try to get me to pay them money.   I completely ignore them and still have good enough credit that I am constantly bombarded (2-3 times a week) with credit card offers in the mail.

You have to do whatever you feel is best for you.   But your case is a perfect example of funny money debt that the collections industry thrives on -- a debt that would never have existed in the first place (nobody would pay it so the bank would have dropped it) without the existence of the debt collections industry.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So let me give you some inside about why they suddenly started doing this.

The usual way that debit and credit card industry work is that for each transaction they charge merchants a fee called interchange. this is the fee that pays for the cost of the network and profit for the bank and all the parties involved (e.g. masterard, visa and other processors). And remember operating this networks is very expensive usually each transactions goes through three different companies and networks until it settles, add this to the cost of frauds and R&amp;D. 


Sometimes ago big retailers (like Walmart) went to the government and complained about these fees. Lots of lobbyist from both side (merchants and banks and networks) worked on this. Story short retailers won. And government regulate the interchange to specific fee( I cannot remember it) and there is a deadline for the banks to implement this new fee. Banks and network companies hate this because that means they have to pass the cost to consumers and they can loose transactions and potentially customers. 


I assume that is why BofA and others are starting to charge fees. However, I am not really in the position to say if this fee is fair or not, and I am not here to defend them. I am just giving you information.


In short: Government regulated debit interchange fees, they are passing the difference to the consumer.

To be clear, I think there are drivers out there who do the worst imaginable embodiment of the 'teach you a lesson' type of driving and also drivers who are too absent minded or distracted from the task at hand - these are the drivers I take issue with. Personally, if you want to speed, great, it means you won't slow me down and if I let you pass me, you aren't endangering me any more than driving near cars observing the speed limit!

My problem with driving training in Australia is that is very easy to obtain a licence. For example, in scandinavian countries the driver training includes many experiences with controlled drifts on ice and other more advanced driving techniques because of the particular climate of the region and the importance the society places on safety/personal and community responsibility/education. I think there would be many advanced driving techniques, for example reading traffic flow, that would be essential for the Australian driving conditions that you really only learn about with time because our standards for licence issuing are so low, kids bearly know what they are doing when they hit the road solo.","1317427388"

Fast forward 10 weeks to the end of the semester: She didn't turn a fucking thing in, and she faked a corrupted file for her final assignment. She definitely had cancer, but she was still a lying cheater, and she used her cancer as an excuse for lying and cheating.

I'm not teaching anymore, but after that, I didn't take any excuses unless they went through the higher-ups. Doctor's note or no, cancer or cancer-free, you get X absences and grade deductions from there. (Unless, again, they'd received letters for accommodation from special services.)

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Hearing aids simply amplify sounds. These days they are very advanced and can be programmed by an audiologist, so that they're adjusted properly for the specific hearing loss of an individual. For example, many people born with sensorineural hearing loss have very poor (or no) hearing in higher frequencies but better in lower frequencies. So a high-frequency sound would need to be amplified more than a lower-frequency one. Other than the expense, there's no downside to hearing aids-- they are perfectly safe and easily removed. While someone with no or little hearing in various frequencies isn't probably going to be hearing things exactly as they sound to everyone else, it's just an amplified version of natural sounds (in the way that a microphone amplifies a person's voice).

Cochlear implants, on the other hand, involve a potentially life-threatening surgery (as all major surgeries are, to be fair) that completely destroys any residual hearing a person may have. From what I have heard, the sound is very artificial.

For people who are able to use hearing aids, I literally cannot comprehend why they would choose a cochlear implant. Hearing aid technology is constantly improving; I'm 30, and the hearing aids I have now are exponentially more advanced than the ones I had when I was 4.  I'm sure they will only continue to get better and do more as the years go by-- and unlike someone with a cochlear implant, all I have to do when the technology changes is go to the audiologist and make a purchase.","1317427418"

I still maintain that different people have different aptitudes.

It's hard to see though when we're all trained to look on the surface. Fame, money, power... Yet there's soem people that just always make you feel good inside. And there's some people who know what's going on but lack the skills to say it. And there's some people who know how to never hurt a fly. And still others who are incredibly hard workers, selfless, who destroy their own bodies in the line of duty. I can't stand the idea that just because you can run some equations, or write a good speech, or organize some people, that you're somehow worth more than somebody else. Everyone has a purpose.

There are several malls, social and economic centers, and various kinds of neighborhood from bordering on hippy/hipster friendly, WASPy nice subdivisions with good schools, if that's your thing, to fiercly redneck and ghetto areas. You could wind up moving close to the water or in the middle of country meadows if you want. Just depends on budget and your tastes.","1317427444"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This; I loved how the article didn't bother to reprint the quote or the context.  They did print this:

&gt; In 2003, he had to recuse himself from a case involving ""Under God.""  You see, he claimed in a speech that the Framers of the Constitution didn’t intend to “exclude God from the public forums and from political life.”  Clearly, unequivocally, 

Which does support their argument, but at the cost of showing that he is willing to step down from a case when he knows his personal beliefs conflict with the standard interpretation of the law.

I'd also like to point out that the reason that supreme court justices are so hard to get rid of is because they aren't supposed to be afraid of what the public thinks of them or how politics are progressing.  When judges are elected things get much more political in the courts.

EDIT: I'd also like to point out that the chances of getting this guy impeached are pretty much zero.  He's been a supreme court justice for around 25 years.","1317427445"

"simpleliving","t5_2r0za","The biggest lesson I've learned is ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" or ""Pick your battles"".   The most recent example, I was taking out fall/winter clothing to get ready for the season change.  It's still pretty warm here.  My son saw his snow boots and was DYING to wear them.  We tried to talk him out of it, we said it wasn't time for them.  But then we were like, ""WTH does it matter?  They're shoes, who is it hurting if he wears them now?""  Does it look a little silly?  Yeah.  But he's 3.  Besides, we feel it's good to give kids a chance to make decisions for themselves on the small stuff.

The other thing, that I didn't figure out until my dad laid it on me, was RELAX.  I was terribly worried because my then 2 year old didn't talk very much and was almost painfully shy.  I was convinced something wrong.  We took him to doctors, read about speech delays etc.  Everyone kept telling us to calm down, kids do things at their own rate, but being new parents we were convinced something was terribly wrong.

A year later the kid won't stop talking and loves going to the playground and meeting other kids.  I'm not saying ignore warning signs or don't get possible issues looked at, simply that new parents sometimes need to relax and remember kids are individuals too.  Not every child hits every milestone at exactly the same pace.","1317427452"

And with all due respect, you never said 'never going to be comfortable' or even implied it. You just said not comfortable. And though you never said people can't negotiate about sex, you essentially said that they can't negotiate about sex in any meaningful way. It's not negotiation if both parties just agree to do what they would have done anyway.

In the scenario you presented with your fiance, his communication about wanting to have one and why he'd like to is an attempt to convince. I'm not seeing where you draw the line between manipulation and negotiation.

"Vanderbilt","t5_2s4s4","Hey I know this thread is old as shit, but I'll try to give you a little more perspective. KA's still what it was around the time you were here, I'd imagine. Lots of northern kids, though I'm guessing they haven't been as ""Southern"" as they try to pass themselves off as in quite some time. I'm guessing you're wondering about the big schism they went through when they gave Deion (black kid) a bid. I'm sure some kids dropped out after that but they didn't colonize a different chapter or anything. 

Sigma Nu got kicked off I guess nearly a decade ago, for an incident involving a naked pledge and a campfire off-campus, I believe during hell week, and that's where Nu Society came from. I guess you already know that, though. I actually ended up pledging Sigma Nu a year or two after recolonization based mostly on their reputation from before they were kicked off. Class a couple years ahead of me was decent, some NROTC guys and other dudes that knew how to party. Majority of my pledge class was utterly miserable, and every class after that got even worse. Bunch of clowns and Kristen Torrey suck-ups.

Anyways, Nu Society re-colonozied on campus my sophomore year (fall '08) as Kappa Sig. It's been downhill for them since, honestly. 

Sigma Chi had 50+ of their guys get arrested on a camping trip which was pretty hilarious, Pike got booted from their $1.5 million dollar house this last year, Phi Psi is no more, Phi Delt's been on and off like crazy, and I think there's a FIJI chapter (colony?) these days. Me and the few buddies I had in Sigma Nu ended up partying till we got kicked out of the house, more or less. In the end, our own President and VP reported us to IFC for an off-campus kegger. I was social chair at the time. It was weak, but I haven't regretted it a bit. The whole scene has been gradually dying, I think.

Insecurity of what? Your intelligence? Or the size of your penis, because you clearly had to make a point of defending that as well. Whether or not this is true, I'm aware that you have very valid reasons for your actions, and I can understand, as well as even respect that. I've continued to respond simply because I've been able to derive an amount of entertainment from this interaction. I only had one question to ask; the only reason I asked a second question was because of the fact that you ignored the first. I went on to make the definitive statement that you are indeed speculative; to imply that because of this nature, I have not even the slightest inclination towards inquiring from your pretentious and extremely egocentric self. I have no care to defend myself in similar ways, as I do not thrive off of false pride, which is the reason in only telling you that you were speculative, and not elaborating further, as defending myself unnecessarily is not an appealing way to utilize my time. Since, as is evident, you are confident about your social life due to the fact that you have a ""huge dick"", I have no problem in continuing this entertaining conversation.","1317427468"

You are actively ""stealing"" what I need to be effective. Sure, you can take it and might use it a bit, but you've also completely shut me down for it. 

In terms of a team game, you're not being a part of it. Sure that 0-10 akali may think they need it in your specific example and you'd be in the right to take it, but that's not what Pendragon nor Xiuhtec were arguing about. If you take it once, you're not going to the tribunal. If you steal them *constantly*, you're a detriment to your team and making the game harder for your own team. And at that point, it's an attitude/pattern thing, not just doing it once.

Stealing doesn't just mean taking the buff though, it means you're taking it from someone who really needs it. Again, Amumu and Fiddles early jungles are super dependent upon it.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Nothing you said in your last comment has the slightest bearing on the topic we were debating, which was whether or not this is an accurate statement:

&gt;The news reports on the things people care about. It's not the job of the news to tell people what they're supposed to care about. The news is, as it should be, reactive to what people want to hear. 

You believe that the news media should find out what ""people"" want to hear about, and then tell them about that.  This first of all begs the question...which people, exactly?  Different people want to hear about different things.  Religious fundies, environmental activists, agricultural megacorporations, technophiles, teenage music groupies...they all have different interests, different topics they're hoping to see in the news.

I do not believe that the news media is supposed to be catering to the lowest common denominator.  I believe that its job is to shed light into darkness, expose injustices and illegalities, dispel ignorance and keep people informed on the important going-on on the the planet they inhabit.  Unfortunately, the modern MSM agrees with you about what its job is.  The good news is, we don't have to rely on them to keep us informed anymore.  The religious fundies, environmental activists, agricultural megacorporations, technophiles, teenage music groupies and everyone else now have their own information networks on the web, where they can insulate themselves in their own comfort zones or stretch out into broader circles, as they see fit.  The MSM is becoming obsolete, and they're doing it to themselves.

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","Macroeconomics as it exists today seems more like pseudoscience than anything resembling formal scientific thought. The practice of econometrics has pushed economists too far into the realm of empiricism causing a loss of perspective on the mechanisms that might produce those empirical results. In the physical sciences we don't accept empirical research findings as ""scientific truth"" until they are explained by and integrated with conceptual models. Neoclassical/keynsian economics is rife with examples of ""economic conclusions"" that run contrary to our understanding of basic economic theory, yet these contradictions are held openly and almost proudly by prominent economists such as Krugman. (I wrote a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/ku5jj/a_rather_odd_krugman_article_is_his_conscience/) about these contradictions on a posting of this same article in r/austrian_economics.)

I see this discomfort in Krugman as a subconscious realization of the conflict between the path that he and the rest of mainstream economics are on and the more methodologically sound path of the Austrian school and other ""conservative economists"". It seems he's thinking to himself ""Gosh, why are all these dumb economists not listening to me and the theories I study? Why isn't my school of thought gaining momentum and making progress in how we understand economics?"" I would answer: because that school of thought is fundamentally flawed and incapable of being truly successful.","1317427494"

My dad is a stout conservative but can spell and isn't blind that defense spends too much and GE should pay some taxes.

Cain being a business man in a downed economy appeals to many people, including my dad. 

I on the other hand like Ron Paul until he says or imply getting rid of FDA or EPA or Department of education. That I feel goes too far. Huntsman is very appealing simply because he doesn't sway from science or denying global warming. So if either one was elected I wouldn't be angry.

Sweet merciful Jeebus, the deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza (and indeed all the other places they've attacked) is very well documented. This is a matter of Israeli policy, this very summer a farmers' well in Beit Hanoun was hit in an airstrike that wounded 4 children and 3 women. But I suppose that well posed an existential threat to Israel as well. 

During Cast Lead the Israelis destroyed homes, factories, greenhouses, and farms in areas under complete Israeli control, where there was no military threat whatsoever. They have repeatedly, in all their invasions targeted sanitation plants, power stations, and other infrastructure essential to civilian life. As you should know, Gaza has been under blockade by the Israelis meaning that the materials required to build new home and repair damaged infrastructure rarely enters Gaza at all. But again, I know, it's all the Palestinians own fault. If you keep this train of thought up, it shouldn't take you long to come to the conclusion that it is the Palestinians that are occupying the Israelis. As I've said already, Israel can launch as vicious and as reckless as an attack as it wants, killing hundreds of civilians just like it has always done, and you will blame the victims.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;something every study and experiment has shown to be the best situation for a child

I find this hard to believe, especially considering things like the [APA's official stance](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting.aspx) on the ""issue"":

&gt;In summary, there is no evidence to suggest that lesbian women or gay men are unfit to be parents or that psychosocial development among children of lesbian women or gay men is compromised relative to that among offspring of heterosexual parents. Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents. Indeed, the evidence to date suggests that home environments provided by lesbian and gay parents are as likely as those provided by heterosexual parents to support and enable children's psychosocial growth.

Also, we must take care not to conflate the legal definition and the intrinsic, arguably arbitrary ""meaning"" of marriage. The former connotes a set of responsibilities, privileges, and benefits that the government makes available to officially married couples, regardless of whether that couple intends to have children. All LGBT couples want is the same legal recognition for their unions for which heterosexual couples are currently eligible; they do not seek to change what that recognition entails, and indeed, a gay couple receiving a marriage license from the statehouse doesn't make yours invalid or in any way different. On the other hand, the ""meaning"" of marriage is a personal matter and has no place being dictated by secular government. 

Besides, considering modern advancements in technologies such as in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination as well as the ever-increasing acceptance of [gay and lesbian parents](http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/research/2008_09_expand_resources.php), I think it's a stretch to imply that gay people cannot ""cooperatively raise children together.""

To quote [*Perry vs. Schwarzenegger*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1984506746130471324&amp;q=gay+parenting&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,31&amp;as_ylo=2009):

&gt;A private moral view that same-sex couples are inferior to opposite-sex couples is not a proper basis for legislation.

Finally, despite the fact that it's a tenuous analogy at best, how exactly might the legal definitions of assault, murder, or burglary change anyway? There will always be decisive court cases, but that's more about interpretation than ""legal requirements for."" The implication that gay parenting is equivalent to any of those criminal actions is pretty offensive, btw.","1317427511"

Also, if his main crux was that socialized health care was so darn expensive, why did he gloss over all the evidence that medicare is super expensive and just hyper linked to a 20 page long report by a private research firm known as the *council for affordable insurance?* Strategically, it makes sense to make counterpoints by his critics more difficult to postulate, since a 20 page long footnote with no presentation in his own text is convenient for him and frustrating for opponents, but it also makes the author appear lazy or not at all interested in a holistic discussion.

What this article does not take into account is the fact that 50,000 people die a year due to lack of health insurance.

It also does not take into account the essential philosophy behind health insurance is not at all different than the essential philosophy behind socialized health care. Insurance is like a co-op where people pay into something for a product they don't always use in the event that they really need it. Nationalized healthcare is just a larger health insurance system: one whose members include all taxpayers of a nation. And both work the same way: The more members paying more premiums, the more efficient the system works for everyone. The big difference? Private health insurance strong-arms its members into annual contracts with enrollment periods and avoids paying for pre-existing conditions. Its as if most insurance companies don't fulfill their end of the bargain and get to pocket the difference. The government could offer a more rational system: Socialized medicine is non-profit and could function at or near a zero sum. The government does not have to profit from socialized medicine- only cover losses- whereas private practices must maximize profits to serve shareholders and executives. The government could require everyone to pay into healthcare and in turn be guaranteed to offer those services when needed, regardless of ""pre-existing"" conditions.","1317427512"

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","Okay, for one what you're referring to in your article is socialism or the first phase of communism. Later stage and pure communism involves the abolishing of the state, so the idea of state-regulated materials is a little strange. Sorry for being the guy who says terms, and i normally don't do this, but the idea that what the USSR had was communism is laughable. When you're talking about the USSR say Communism with a big C, Stalinism or socialism (the term socialism encompasses a wide range of ideas, so you will be safest going with that terminology). Hopefully this will help when you're talking to leftists and scholars and thus help you better present your points.

On topic, utilitarianism seems to also be more prominent in people in your article than in my experience. It is especially useful to look at how strongly utilitarians hold onto their values when the situation refers to them. I would like to see a study where the participants were asked about diverting a train from a group of ten people to a rail that they were standing on.

Selflessness is almost universally admired, but is far from universally present. However, just because people are not selfless does not make them selfish. For instance, if you asked a question like ""You have three loaves of bread and there are two men with none who have no way of otherwise eating today, what will you do?"" You are much more likely to get a ""not selfish"" answer than a selfish one or a selfless one.","1317427526"

"self","t5_2qh96","I went to school for programming when I was younger.  I originally wanted to be a photo journalist/journalist and/or a lawyer.  I made a deal with my then girlfriend who I was supposed to spend the rest of my days with.  I will get into the programming/tech field, get a job, you'll do good in school and we'll settle down.

Skip ahead 3 years, she cheated on me (Broke up with me to sleep with someone then got back together with me.  Still counts.  Didn't tell me for several months), and left me in a job field I really didn't want to be in because I really had no passion for it.

I got a job in the field though and just decided I'd suck it up and find other ways to be happy.  Long story short, I fell into depression and chased some girls that were unhealthy for me.

I also started watching Penny-Arcade's show and realized just how fucking awesome it is o have a job you want and don't call a job.  Not a career, but a fucking vocation (Leave religion out of this).  So, I went back to school for graphic design and am loving every minute of it.

It will let me be creative and let me do things that I will enjoy doing.  I just hope I can find an awesome job that will let me feel fulfilled, however, I already know I will be with or without the 100% perfect job...  I also found a loving and supportive girlfriend, so pretty much, realizing I was the only one that could make my life better and realizing at the very core of what I wanted to be happy has only started me down the road to being happy.

Good luck in finding your right path and simply put, just find what makes you happy at the core and fucking do it.","1317427535"

There are a few places with 18, fewer with older, and a few with younger, I think Japan has the youngest with 12 or 13.

The problem is those that post pictures of really young girls. the single time I went to r/jailbait, to see what exactly they were posting there, I saw girls as young as 12 or so in bikinis/underwear. Yeah, you can see them in the same thing at the pool, but not in a sexual way, at least not intended like that.

And again, it's more about the fact that r/jailbait's archive has been said to have straight up child porn. Some deny that, but until someone looks through the whole thing, there's no conclusive proof either way. And I'm not volunteering.","1317427552"

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","My husband and I love them. We switched once Chase started charging for their ""free"" checking, among other effed up crap. 

You need to deposit $50 in savings to be a member, and that sits there. When you leave, you take it out, but it needs to stay there in the meantime. In exchange, you are a *member* of a co-op, not a customer. 

Fees are noticeably smaller. We have our savings and checking linked in case of overdraft, and get charged $5 for the xfer, as compared to $20 for our own money to automatically xfer between accts. 

We've gotten 2 car loans through them with killer rates.  They actually send you offers based on your credit score--you don't apply later and get screwed. We refinanced one car loan by taking advantage of an offer, and bought another car through their financing.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","We live in a world of double-standards.  Your outfit is cute and appealing and unfortunately, says you might want to be hit on.  A loose-fitting t-shirt, shorts, and baseball cap says leave me alone.

Men run the world.  They decide.  Not you, not me.  If you don't want to be hit on, don't show so much skin and don't wear clingy yoga pants.

I know that sucks.  The outfit is modest, why should you have to change it?  I agree.  But I don't want to be bothered at the gym, so I follow the rules the men set up, or else I change gyms.  

It took a while for me to get here. Similarly, I used to listen and heed people who said life is too short to eat healthy and how sad it is that I change my diet and look at what I am missing out on...etc.  Or how silly it is to work my life around my workouts and not vice-versa.  They were setting me up for failure because I couldn't ""live it up"" and made me feel something was wrong because I was being disciplined so I could focus on other things.  Why oh why do/did I have to put up with the fucking comments about my workout and eating habits every damn day!!!!  Why can't people just live and let live.  I'm not asking for a critique about my lifestyle decisions!!! /rant.

Then I realized that life is much too short, pick your battles to suit your own temperament.  If it is important to you to wear exactly what you want, then expect certain reactions.  Fight the battle.  Or save your energy for other battles.  We all have the things that are important to us.

I gave up on the clothing thing a long time ago.  The one time I forgot my ballcap and went to the gym anyway, some freak was there and literally followed me around the entire time.  

I hope you find peace with this issue.  It may not be a big deal to you, but it used to be a huge deal to me.  What we look like, as women, is far more important than it should be. I have often wished things were different.

Each of us story designers have our notebooks and each of us scribble through idea after idea with the end goal of something like this. We've all developed our narrative knowledge through these finds as we've played our favorite games, but even throughout the literature and film on which we've been trained, the subtleties can nearly always be as emotionally moving as the overarching themes and events in a plot if done right. 

I'm not gonna say you should *expect* anything this moving from us. As someone who lives for writing like this, it'd be more than pretentious to suggest we've got notebooks full of anything like your favorite finds. But, goddamn, we're gonna give it our best shot. We'll do what we can to use what narrative opportunity we'll have in an open-world game to an end like this and we think we've got a chance to do a damn good job with the guys we've got.

Keep an eye out. We'll probably be posting up some ideas for review in the future, so look for the tags in our nicks and if you're interested in fiction or critiquing it, you might just find something pleasant pop up on your front page from us. Feedback will be key, so be prepared!","1317427560"

Is this the primary 'goal' of Guild Wars? 

I honestly have been out of the MMO scene for some time and kind of miss the whole reputation grind as well as the dungeon grind. That's really what I'm trying to put together here.

Gear is important. Not obtaining gear and being better than everyone, but appearance of my character. My friend who's been playing GW for a while said most of your gear is through vendors (aside from costumes which I have no intention of getting) - is this true? Does he mean reputation-style vendors, or through quest lines, etc. How do I go about obtaining the Best Gear

I don't like to be told how to live my life when I try to live it the best way I can. But in our free-speech society I can't force them not to show theses billboards. Most of the time atheist billboards that I see arent better than the religious one, claiming that there is no god, trying to convert people. That, in my opinion, trying to convert people, is forcing them.

For some people, living his life as best as he can is by religion, so be it. But as far as society if concerned, it has no religion. If you remove every religious aspect of a society I'm pretty sure it will go back to a minimum by itself from good education.

So from that logic, no it's not like wanting to have a religious based belief teached in public school. But if there is a christian school that want to teach it, why not. It's their choice to send their kids there.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;And no, a debate predicates that either side can be convinced by the other. Honestly, no amount of arguing from a theist will convince someone who has closed their mind to the existence of God. Especially when said God demands faith. There are no proper analogies or words to describe the experiences of life built on faith to a person without it. I say this because I know full well the ""evidence"" required, and know it is likely that even if you got it, you wouldn't be satisfied.

I was Christian for a long time, I know very well what it is like to have faith.  I eventually came to the unavoidable conclusion that faith is not an accurate method of determining the truth.  I thought ""why is my faith more accurate than that of a Mormon? a Jew? a Muslim? a Shinto Buddhist? a Hindu?""  It isn't.  'Faith' is the word we've come up with for rationalizing ridiculous beliefs in something we've been taught for no reason at all.  Why should I have faith?  Because it's in a book?  Because my parents have faith?  Because it makes me feel good?  Many books contain falsehoods, many parents believe things which aren't true, and many things which make me feel good couldn't be further from the truth.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","an essay about a walk in Valencia:


  I had gone for a walk by myself on my last night in town, tired of constant company and loud raucous crowds. Twilight had just begun to fall and clear skies were slowly giving way to towering storm clouds. It was pretty warm, and there was only a slight breeze, perfect weather for me. I hadn't expected to stay out long, just enough to clear my head and take a look around my immediate surroundings. During my two weeks there, we'd been extremely busy trying to do and see as much as possible. As i've already said, it was a wonderful trip, but my own personal style is to go slow and experience new things fully without worrying about what comes next. As a result of our hectic schedule, i'd only seen the surrounding neighborhood that lay on the route to the highway(or what passes for a highway in Spain=).

 So I set out with no real purpose in mind other than to enjoy the salty sea air and see what the hell was around the house i'd been living in the past two weeks. The area surrounding Elaina's house somewhat mirrored the stereotypical american single family home development. The differences were pretty striking though. Wide boulevards and sidewalks shaded by tall tropical trees and bordered by the opulent walls and gates of the houses.

 As I walked, I noticed the clouds slowly gathering momentum, painting the occasional scenic lagoon in shades of gray. It start to rain, lightly at first. I'd been walking for 20 minutes or so and I wasn't ready to turn back, so I kept my origin in mind and continued my explorations. As the rain began to fall harder, I started to really revel in the experience and unconsciously began walking at a faster clip. By this time, it was full dark and I realized that i'd lost track of where the hell I was. Momentarily, I felt panicked, but the storm turned torrential on me and I got caught up in the energy. I started to run and any conscious thought disappeared. I have no exact idea how long I ran in that state, simultaneously connected and disconnected to everything around me and myself(I know thats contradictory, but hopefully you know the feeling). It was so vital an experience and the most passion and beauty i've felt in solitude.

But in a federal court, in December of last year, a judge concluded that even though he happens to be a U.S. citizen, he can still be treated like any other belligerent.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","This, the same reason that lead you to atheism lead me to Mormonism. The explanation is quite long though, I'll try to summarize it as best I can, but I'm sure some questions on specifics will come up. Either way here goes;

Just like how Christians believe there is an afterlife Mormons believe their was also a ""pre-life"". In this ""pre-life"" (or preexistence) there was everyone. From here a plan was presented to come to earth and be ""judged"" and tested. There was also another plan presented by Satan to follow him where you'd have a similar mortal life, but no free-will, everything would be forced.(On a strange note what would be forced would be religion, that's all there would be. 24/7 studying of doctrine, everything we consider a sin would be unquestionably banned.)

Following that; War in heaven, blah, blah and 1/3rd follow Satan, while the other 2/3rd come to earth at various times. After which you are judged and go to various levels of Heaven. (There isn't really a hell for anyone who comes to earth, so even the most baby eating atheist to the worst serial killer rapist get some level of heaven. There are lower levels, although all of them are far better than life on earth. The only ones who go to hell are those who followed Satan in the beginning. The reasoning being that they had a perfect knowledge of God, so there is no excuse)

So sin is permitted by an all-powerful god so we can be tested and personal improve from that. Taking it away completely would more or less take away from freewill, not necessarily though. I fully believe that if the religion is true god and his followers could remove sin with the bat of an eye, but he doesn't so we can experience this, mortal life. Although with this idea God is viewed almost as a good coach, who leads us through challenges so we can progress, and help the team progress. (Wow that was a really sappy analogy)

One of my personal issues with this concept is how Satan is regarded as being so evil when his actions really are pretty much necessarily for us to be tested, or life as we know it. It really is the biggest ""Necessary Evil"". Still that issue doesn't stand out nearly as much to me as the gaping logic hole you presented under mainstream Christian views.","1317427612"

Secondly, okay, you don't want to go to the courtroom? Fair enough. I can understand that. There's also some technology that was invented waaaaaay back in the 18th century called newspapers, where reporters sit in on the trials, take notes, and write about it, then they print it and the paper's distributed so you can get it without abandoning your children or losing your job.

Also, they have this ""news"" thing on your **tele-vision**, so you can learn about it there. And they've got news on the Internet now. And you can get transcripts from the court. Really, there's no excuse not to be informed.

In addition, think about this. When a person on trial appears in the media, they are often assumed to be guilty. What if they don't want the poor defendant's face broadcast all over the nation and making every gullible idiot assume guilt without looking at the facts? Is THAT justice?

Fun Fact:
When I was a kid, I played Little League down the street (Wildwood Park, WHAT!) from, what was then called the Florida Suncoast Dome.  This was in the time before they even had a team and the city had built it in hopes a luring an existing team to the Bay Area (it was the White Sox first, then a one moment there were talks of the Giants or Expos - all of which obviously didn't pan out).

Anyway, during practice one day some officials from the recently completed Dome dropped by and asked if they could borrow a few of us players for an hour or two.  Practice was finishing up anyway so the coach called over 5 of us and told us to hang around for a minute.

After everyone had left and our parents all showed up - he explained that they wanted to take us on a tour of the new dome.  And to better yet, ""bring our gloves"".  Bricks were shat by 9-12 year old boys.

When we got there, the place was bare concrete but we didn't care.  We were in awe.  They showed us around and took us down on the main floor, where the field would be.  When we got down there we were met by none other than Von fucking Hayes, the then Outfielder/1st Baseman of the Phillies (St. Pete at the time was their spring training home).  The suits explained to us that Von was going to hit us some pop-flys on the floor (field) and they wanted to know our thoughts.

As a kid, my mind was reeling - was I being scouted?  Is this a try out?  I heard of kids devoting their lives to the big leagues at an early age but this?  Is this real life?

Anyway, fly-balls were hit and smiles were abound.  It was nothing more than a Major League player hitting some kids pop-flys for an hour in what basically amounted to a covered parking lot, but damn if it wasn't the biggest dose of Baseball Magic that had ever directly touched my life.

Afterwards baseballs, hats and gloves were signed.  Some free schwag promoting the Dome and it's desire to house a baseball team was given out along with some very specific questions about us watching and catching the balls when hit off the bat.

Later on the way home, I found out that these guys were testing the roof of the dome to see if we could pick up the white ball up off the white dome ceiling.  Apparently they didn't think of that when they built it and it was a major concern.  Grabbing a couple kids down the street was the quickest way to test it.  I have no idea why Von Hayes was there.

Anyway yeah - so that happened (roughly 23 years ago).

PS - St. Pete, sack up and build these guys a proper field!  What happened to that idea of the new stadium down where Al Lang (I forget what they call it now) is?","1317427621"

It's not to serve a public good, it's not to give employees a job, it's not to further a cause, it's to make as much money as possible. The entire concept of capitalism is to take everybody's money, because the best economy is one in which money is flowing freely and quickly.

Not all business decisions are designed to promote an instant return on investment; many investments are longterm in scope. 

To sum it up, if you want to regulate businesses by stopping predatory tactics such as fraud and cheating, fine, but don't claim a move is bad just because it's designed for a business to make more money. Newsflash, *every* decision a business makes is to either make more or save more money.","1317427637"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","The United States is a bi-partisan political system. Because of this, unions are often forced by default to work with Democrats in achieving some basic gains for workers. This is just the political reality, and even Marx advocated a reformist approach as an aspect of the overall workers' movement. 

But your analysis also completely neglects the most important aspect of union activity: collective bargaining. Political positioning is a minuscule amount of what the union does in compared to bargaining within the work place. I suggest you do some research on this and you will see the collective bargaining is still alive and well within American unions. Professors for instance wouldn't have tenure without their union's collective bargaining; postal workers, likewise, wouldn't have guaranteed pension programs. 

Also, I would hardly call union organizers ""upper class."" The vast majority of union organizers begin within a respective trade, and then get an interest in the bargaining process and subsequently become union organizers. A very small amount of union organizers come from outside certain trades; those who do, often activists with experience in organizing, are hardly ""upper class pro-capitalists."" Take Richard Trumka for instance, the president of the AFL-CIO; he makes about $200k a year, which I don't really think qualifies to stand alongside members of the financial U.S. elite. And I don't think it's really that unfair if he makes that much in income; the typical CEO makes about $10-12 million a year, at least Trumka spends his time helping workers organize and get political and economic leverage.

I refill the same bottle everyday, and just give it a quick rinse with cold water.  If it starts to taste funky, I wipe the rim with a wet paper towel and rinse a few more times.

"darknetplan","t5_2rju2","&gt;I don't understand what you mean by ""have its own address space"". Isn't it good enough to use IPv6? Why can't it just be an extension to the regular internet? If the regular internet goes down, the mesh internet continues to function normally, routing around the problem. Isn't that how the internet is designed to work in the first place?

At 2^128 addresses, ipv6 is probably large enough to support every device having its own public address, without ever resorting to ""private"" subnets. I've done a little further reading on ipv6 ""private"" subnets and it turns out that even though there is a reserved address space for ""private"" traffic, the scope of those addresses is still global. 

However, there are still some good reasons for wanting the new mesh to exist on its own separate and identifiable subnet. One that immediately comes to mind is to easily distinguish mesh traffic from other network traffic when the public internet starts using ipv6.

Another reason is that the mesh topology will form its own network with its own routing topology. Hence the reason that network devices expecting to function on the regular public internet as well would need to be dual-homed, meaning having two addresses for the same network interface: one mesh, and one public internet, at least until if and when the public internet switches to ipv6.

&gt;Why does this need to be on its own network? Why can't this be built on top of the Internet?

Building it ""on top"" of the internet defeats the purpose of it being a citizens mesh. The more connections back through the internet, the more it remains susceptible to censorship and deactivation. Of course in the beginning, some geographically distant nodes or hubs would probably use the internet as a backhaul connection. But the idea is that as the concept spreads, there would be enough intermediate hub nodes already interconnected to take up the slack.

Essentially it needs to be its own network with its own address space because it is ultimately designed to operate independently of the existing internet. Theres no reason it couldn't talk to the existing internet, but the mesh should be its own entity managed by the mesh nodes themselves, with as little interference from governments and corporate infrastructure owners as possible.

Otherwise, we are just adding on privately managed routes to the existing internet. Perhaps a mesh could have been constructed this way at one time, but as of today, besides the fact that we would run out of public ipv4 addresses long before we could build a mesh, there is no clear way to differentiate mesh traffic from internet traffic. It may be fine to route some mesh traffic over the internet, but the lower speed, citizens maintained mesh is not designed to handle the throughput of routing the internet's commercial traffic. If the mesh network were not its own separate addressing space, how would one differentiate these two cases?

A mesh already exists with many features that you suggest. It is called [openmesh](http://www.open-mesh.com/) and its purpose is to allow access to the internet through a mesh which routes end-user to nearby ISP-connected WLAN's. 

What I am suggesting would need to be in its own address space because its traffic is routed entirely separately from the public internet. It should have messaging, file transfer, and scalable social networking capabilities built in because the first thing a user should see when adding his node to the mesh should probably be something like a directory of geographically neighboring nodes. 

In that respect it would be similar to i2p in allowing one to run and advertise to the ""neighborhood"" or to the mesh at large, say, the pages of a locally running webserver. 

At this ""neighborhood"" scope of operation is also where one could manage the DNS mapping of MAC to address to namespace that I mentioned. (Or at one level higher with, say, a municipal registrar.) Nothing suggests the necessity to sacrifice global uniqueness of namespace entities since the underlying address space and routing is not inherently anonymized as it is in i2p. 

However the existing ipv4 internet is already on the verge of compromising the global uniqueness of its underlying address space, which will lead to all sorts of interesting subnetting scenarios. For instance check how [openmesh](http://www.open-mesh.com/) (above) assigns addresses on their mesh. They reuse public ipv4 addresses to route traffic within the mesh (what would traditionally be considered the ""LAN"" side of a router's NAT firewall), and use oslrd to negotiate the resulting route table. In addition to introducing an unprecedented layer of complexity to the routing implementation, it would appear that such an implementation could not scale up to a full sized mesh without the possibility of address space collisions.

This is why it is better if the mesh exists in a subnet of ipv6.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm flattered, so much so that I'll continue the story.  My dad retired from the Naval Research Lab in 1995 after 34 years to become a full-time dad.  While at the navy, his title was ""thermolucent dosimetrist"".  Basically what this means is, if you've ever seen doctors or nurses at the hospital wearing one of [these](http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/dosimeter/dosimetryinfo.htm), my dad developed it.  They also use them on battlefields anywhere close to a member of the nuclear family, on a nuclear-powered vessel - basically anywhere there's a more than normal level of radiation, including [banana plantations](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2689136/posts) (probably, not really).  

In conducting his research, he often had to go places where radiation was known to be present.  For the sake of convenience, he was also qualified to inspect nuclear reactors on the behalf of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Dept of Energy.  One of the more interesting reactors that he inspected, was at [McMurdo Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station#History), Antarctica. I was going to boast that this reactor, as was claimed by my father, held the record for continuous operation of over 10 years.  Sadly, however, I must mention in the interest of full disclosure that in writing this, I found out that there were many environmental problems that occurred as a result of maintaining this reactor, including many [cases](http://bellona.org/articles/articles_2011/McMurdo_leaks) of navy personnel contracting cancer. I'd like to believe that he detected a problem while he was there and reported it, only to be ignored by the government, and in the process of going all Bruce Wayne on the government's ass for being total dicks, suffered a bout of radiation-induced amnesia, but clearly, that's exactly what happened.

That being said, while conducting the inspection, he claimed to have ""ran around the world 10 times"".  Not one to skip a beat when accused of bullshit, he asked if I had remembered latitude and longitude from school. That's when I realized that [technically] (as we all know, the best kind of correct), if he had ran around the South Pole ten times, he would have passed through every meridian ten times.  After a hardy laugh while enjoying a tall glass of scotch, straight of course, he explained in depth how he and my mom first met, but that's another story for another time.","1317427701"

my car actually has side curtain airbags in the rear, though they are probably completely unnecessary for an infant in a car seat.  our 6 year old, however, might well benefit now, and even if not now he certainly could as he gets taller.

You make a great point about LATCH, and apparently some car seats rate better on LATCH than they do with a seatbelt.  I'm going to guess that any car built in 1990 will not have LATCH, so you'd need to secure the seat with the lap belt.  Consumer Reports has some very useful ratings, their top rated infant car seats are the Chicco Keyfit 30, the Combi Shuttle 33, and the Safety 1st onBoard / OnBoard Air, but the Safety 1st didn't rate as well when used as a belt as with the other two.

"Fixxit","t5_2sti8","&gt; Could the headlight circuit being broken cause the battery to overcharge?

This could be a symptom of a voltage regulator failure.

There is a zener diode inside the voltage regulator which begins 
conducting current to the gate of a silicon control rectifier at 14.5 volts.

The SCR then shunts one phase of the 3 phase alternator rotor to ground, burning up excess current as heat.

But if the zener diode fails, the alternator's output voltage is only regulated by the amount of current load (typically around 100 watts)
from the lights and the load of charging the battery.

If the battery was so low on water that the unregulated alternator couldn't charge it at all, the only load would be the lights and the ignition system and the headlight just might have blown out for that reason.

I recommend that you inspect the three bullet connector on the wires coming from the stator.

If the plastic insulation is dark brown or black, that indicates a poor connection and the bullet connectors need to have the oxidization cleaned off them and the female sockets need to be tightened by gently squeezing them with a pair of pliers.

Also, inspect any plastic connectors in the circuit going from the
stator to the rectifier regulator for melting.

Bad connections in the bullet connectors and the plastic connectors can cause the zener diode to be fooled into never triggering the SCR that grounds one phase of the alternator.

Now, after you've done this inspection, and replaced the headlight bulb and installed a new, fully charged battery, do this charging system test:

Set your voltmeter on the 20 volt scale and connect across the battery, observing correct polarity.

A fully charged flooded cell lead acid battery will read at least 12.2 volts.

A fully charged maintenance free battery will read 12.8 volts.

Start the engine and rev it up to 5000 RPM.

The voltage should rise to 14.5 volts on a system with a flooded cell battery, and about 15.5 volts on a system with a maintenance free battery.

When you rev the engine past 5000 RPM, the voltage should fall back down to the fully charged voltage.

Then rev the engine up again and the voltage will rise again.

Every time you rev the engine the voltage should rise and fall.

If it doesn't the voltage regulator part of your rectifier regulator isn't working.

Go to www.electrosport.com to order a new aftermarket voltage regulator if you need one.

They cost about $110 and have an extra SCR and zener diode built into the circuit.

NBC this year has had an awesome stream of Sunday Night Football games.  They do it every week.  I'm a request visitor of r/nfl.  A SIGNIFICANT portion of us all prefer watching the game on the nbc.com stream then watching it on our televisions.  It's just incredible what they've been able to do with it.  I can change camera angles, have picture in picture with different camera angles, I can look up stats.  I can rewind, they highlight the spots in the instantly recorded feed for where I need to go back to to see an awesome play.  It's a better viewing experience than television.

I swear, watching that race, I saw no less than 8 or so DRS passes by Hamilton alone - that is, counting the replays, because for some godforsaken reason they thought it necessary to replay every DRS pass, even though they're the most boring possible things in the universe to watch.  I'd rather they show an empty pitlane than a replay of a DRS pass.

Shortcuts would still deprive us of awesome battles like Alonso/Petrov and Hamilton/Schumacher (the latter only happening because of a mistake in gear setup, if DRS had worked ""as intended"" then the battle would not have happened), but at least they would deprive us of them a little bit less, I think.  And they could be used equally by the cars that are getting caught up, instead of just by the cars that do all the catching up.

Not that it's a good idea, it's just better than DRS.","1317427744"

I had trouble not facing it. If I rolled over with my back to it, I would get nervous and roll back over, half expecting to see something standing next to my bed. Getting up to close it would mean reaching for it in darkness, or flipping the light switch that is about 6 inches to the left of the darkness. My bowl, though, was on the table right next to my bed.

The lasting affect that is being referenced here is a positive one, so unless you are already a deeply fearful person, there is nothing to fear from it.

you can also put a little grease on the face of the stud and then run the lug nut down it and if the grease is moved or if it is now on the inside of the lug nut you know that they are too long.

Or you can go get open ended lugs and try it out and see if it changes anything.

also take a straight edge to the hub and make sure you didnt bend the hub when you pounded the old studs out. some hubs have ears that the studs sit in and you can bend them.","1317427771"

Most of these are cases where the album was digitally remixed at a later time for one reason or another.

Totally going to adjust the horizontal velocities for the pixel death. I think the ""charge up"" attack may do more damage, or perhaps hitting them in the back like you're saying. Maybe I could do a ""swat the weapon away"" attack, like a stun, so that you don't always have to jump behind everyone. I could see that getting kind of old as the primary means of offense.

IMO, you are the one who at least on the surface, pushed him away, so it should be you who draws him back in.
He is shy, dont expect him to openly hit on you.

Also, he kissed you *four* times, of course he is into you.

The biggest challenge that we face is the lack of funding, if I want to do something entertaining in my classroom I buy all of the supplies. If I want my kids to have a binder, paper, and pencils for my math class, I buy the supplies.  I raised money to buy one classroom computer that the kids can use, only two other classrooms in my entire school have a student computer.  Technology is such an important part of getting students involved and engaged, and yet it is impossible if there is no money for computers. I would do just about anything to get a small fraction of the amenities that you probably have at your school.  Your school is by far not a typical public school in America. You are truly lucky to attend a school like yours.  

Edit: I should add that I would never change my school to work at a school such as yours.  Yes, I am sure it would be nice.  I would not leave my students, it is hard to find quality teachers to work in schools like mine, we are few and far between.  As evidence that I am a quality teacher: I have awesome relationships with some of the ""hardest"" kids in the school, I have a Master's degree and I am working on my specialist degree while working towards becoming National Board Certified.

I had just left my job, which meant no direct deposit, and a majority of our savings were in a credit union getting much better interest rates; the BoA account was basically a place to put my measly minimum wage checks for easy access, so there was no way we were meeting that minimum requirement.  Why would I want to have my money somewhere that is going to charge me to **use** my money.  I'd take my business elsewhere, or start using cash.

I was actually bored watching this. Why is it always the case that people who make things like this claim to love the original material and yet go on to butcher it so badly? Every damn time.

One of the things that I like most about the film Aliens (I'm referring to the special edition because that's the best cut) is that although it's an 'action' film, if we exclude the chest burster in Ripley's nightmare at the start, we don't see our first alien until 1h 10mins into the film. The film balances action and suspense, it has characters that we actually care about. These things come together to create a great film.

Quick, name one of the characters from this game! Okay, that's harsh it was just a preview, but you get my point.

The last Alien frachise game I played was [Aliens vs Predator 2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_vs._Predator_%28video_game%29) and although this game didn't do so well with the critics. I personally, as a huge Alien fan, enjoyed the hell out of it. Yes it was clichéd and yes it wasn't that original but it was solid game that looked quite good, played well and captured the right atmosphere. One of my favourite things about the game is that there was lots of little touches like foliage and machinery designed to look like aliens or have the silhouette of an alien, it was an example of good design. Enough about that though.

Colonial Marines just looks like a rehash of the marine campaign from AVP. And we already have that. So what is the selling point of this game? Why is this better and not just more of the same? Can't tell from the video.

**00:39** Just recycling what was in the film won't make a good game. The 'Ephora'? Is just the Sulaco with a different name. They even recreated the shot from Aliens, as if we wouldn't get the reference. Do they not have any different ship types? Maybe they don't, it's forgivable but uninspired (a word that describes the rest of the video).

**2:00** Boring sterotypical American marine banter. Straight in with the ""Xenos"" slang. First time the aliens are called xenomorphs is on the Sulaco and the marines don't know what it means, it's the first time the've heard it. They also don't have any information on them. This game is set soon after the events of Aliens. They're there to investigate what happened to the Sulaco and its crew. They're now so used to the aliens that they're using slang? Oh wait at 2:30 they show that they don't know what facehuggers are. Where's the obligatory ""bug hunt"" phrase, no doubt that'll be in the game somewhere... okay maybe this is petty but it's a pet peave of mine.

**2:30** Rehashing scenes from the film again. The obligatory facehugger trying to get the player through the glass tank. Not a problem if this was an event the player stumbled across but it's obviously a scripted event. No one making an Aliens game ever thought of including that.

**2:55** It's established that the aliens can tear open a reinforced steel door. Remember this.

**3:50** In Aliens the atmospheric processor is described to be essentially one big nuclear reactor. At the end of the film it goes critical and explodes. Earlier in the film Bishop said that the explosion would be roughly equivalent to 40 megatons with a blast radius of 30km (the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 15 kilotones, [see here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Nukecloud.png) for cloud size comparison). Yet in the gameplay demo there's still electricity and undamaged equipment. We even see the table with the map from the film lit up and relatively undamaged. What about nuclear fallout?

**4:34** Wait, you can't look at the tracker and use your gun? Didn't they learn anything from the flashlight problem in Doom 3?

**5:21** A marine overpowers an alien. Remember 2:55?

**5:52** WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? It's established in the Aliens series that new types of aliens come about when different species are used as incubators. Where the hell did this abomination come from? LV426 is not supposed to have any indigenous life. While we can debate how acurate that is given that the person who made that claim in the film didn't know about the aliens and crashed alien ship, WHERE THE FUCK DID THE ""Crusher"" COME FROM? Oh bullets can't penetrate its skin? Ooh how clever and convientient for pointless chase scenes.

**6:50** Oh yeah, I'm especially liking the lack of AA...

**7:50** Yet another scene recycled from the film.

**8:58** Oh, they cut the power? Obligatory, you're being attacked but you're no longer scared of the aliens because we've shoved so many of them in your face so how can we make it scary? Oh turn off the lights, that's original it hasn't been done in every horror game ever including the marine campaign in Aliens vs Predator 2010. Except in AvP it was done fairly well, while you were restarting the power and you didn't actually get attacked then it was just to freak you out and it worked. It wasn't just an annoyance.

**9:53** Powerloaders and APCs? For fuck sake. The power loaders in the film were on board the Sulaco I don't remember seeing them in Hadley's Hope (I could be wrong). Sure they might be there I guess but why do the marines in the game use them for combat? In the film they were for lifting heavy things, essentially glorified forklifts. Ripley only used one out of pure desperation to save Newt from the Queen alien. Sure maybe they're there on the base and maybe the marines had the same idea but that doesn't explain the APC which came from the Sulaco... maybe the marines brought it with them I don't know the story of the game well enough. But it just seems like lazy game design to me. Just throw in more things from the film! That'll make it good.

**11:00** Oh a Queen. Throw more things in from the film! In the film the Queen was basically an egg factory which only attacked Ripley in extreme circumstances. The marines in the game are getting torn to pieces why would the Queen bother? Oh yeah throw in more stuff from the film! It then ignores everything and goes straight for the player but doesn't just instanly kill him. Presumably the next act starts with him waking up having been captured and not killed by the aliens. Original.

Making an aliens game is harder than you might think. In the film you can have 1h 10mins with no aliens just suspense. You can't do that in a game. You also can't have just one alien and you can't make the aliens as dangerous as they are in the films because the player would get slaughtered. You have to throw hordes of them at the player with is completely contrary to everything that the aliens are.

In the film the marines get their asses kicked and spend the rest of the film running away and hiding. There are lots of aliens, yes but that's not the point.

In order to make a good Aliens game you'd have to break the mould of video game conventions. Which this game hasn't done. It'll be yet another game that's greatly anticipated by Alien fans but ultimately bombed. The best you'll be able to say about it is that it got *mixed reviews from critics* which means at least a few people thought it wasn't shit.","1317427821"

When you can't make the kids stop... when fighting back makes it worse... when telling the teachers makes it worse... when telling your parents makes it worse... what other options are there?

I chose not to do anything about my ideas, but I can see how, for some kids, the idea of suicide would gradually take hold and become a hope of an escape from an otherwise inescapable situation.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Oh, dear me!  You're correct!  It's truly unnecessarily harsh to call someone out on their inappropriate, offensive language.  And considering that I did that with a friendly tone, using a Family Guy reference, and never once name calling or belittling OP, I can certainly see how that would come across as too harsh.  I mean, it's *my* job, to educate OP, not OP's job to educate himself, and then come to the table to ask his questions, right?  The burden is on *us transgenders* to eat shit and accept it sucks, as long as there was pure intent on behalf of the person that serves us the plate.

I don't believe that we need to capitulate to the needs of others, even cisgender folks who are well intentioned but ignorant.  They actually have no excuse for their ignorance: a great big world wide web awaits their trans 101 questions.  They may find all the answers to the basics, and when they come correct, I am happy to oblige them w/ an info share, or whatever they are seeking.  I am offended, and you should be too, when someone, good hearted or not, can not take the time to learn the basics of trans 101, and then expects to stroll in, and being lauded for treating us with a modicum of respect.

Not doing the footwork (which includes proper etiquette and appropriate language usage)  results in consequences which can feel unpleasant, and embarrassing(at least for me, I've felt embarrassed when I've exhibited loutish behavior.)  As a result of being called out, the OP has seen that this is a serious issue.  

He had it beautifully, eloquently explained for him in what is currently the top comment.  He got called out by me.  I don't regret calling him out, I'd post the same comment again.  Hopefully, by OP seeing the range of emotions that his post brought up for people, he has learned a valuable lesson and will adjust his (and I really hope those of his friends,too) vocabulary and will now use language that is respectful of people of transgender experience.

"science","t5_mouw","It sounds like you're imagining some kind of dark star made of metal? In this context, ""metals"" refers to any element heavier than hydrogen and helium. Carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron, etc. are ""metals"". Even the highest metallicity stars have only tiny amounts of those elements, but those elements are what allow planets to form (even gas giants most likely start out as solid balls of rock and ice, and then gather hydrogen and helium when they get massive enough).

The Sun is a star with relatively high metallicity, and of course you can see it. In fact low metallicity stars are slightly smaller and dimmer than average, compared to other stars of the same temperature. But it doesn't affect how a star looks very much, and you need to take a spectrum of a star to accurately determine how much ""metals"" it has.

The purpose of Kepler is to find a very large number of planets of various types, so we can start getting some accurate statistical information on how common various types of planets are, and how their abundance is related to properties of their sun (mass and metallicity, mainly). This result is exactly the kind of thing we hoped to learn from Kepler.","1317427859"

Quinn took me some time to care about but he's going to be one of the more important supporting characters by the end of the series.
Aside from that, the seasonal characters are always good too, granted there's the great Lumen debate, but you can't fault Brian Moser, Liala, Miguel, Frank Lundy or Trinity. And personally, I liked Lumen too.

"reddit.com","t5_6","no it's not evil because evil is a concept based on absolutes and there are many, many situations where killing an innocent child might not be 'evil' thus destroying the concept of evil without a divine arbiter - this is a painfully simply thing!  
  
&gt;contributes to society and does not harm others on purpose.  
  
Hu?  That's an insane version of 'innocent' to use in relation to your above statement, who decides what helps society? who decides what constitutes harm?  You can't simplify these hugely complex issues, it doesn't make sense when you do.
  
Haha, wai- you're a world history major that doesn't know the difference between the bronze age and a small pocket of seventh century desert?  Who seems to have absolutely no knowledge of any of the major figures of twentieth century politics? haha, sorry but i either don't buy that or i have serious reservations about the quality of the establishment you apparently studied at.
  
Ah, so if you did mean immoral then the argument you used it in makes no sense - to contest that 'Slaughtering innocent people is evil. Period.' would indeed not be in accord with the standard and overly simplistic moral zeitgeist however i'd have to understand that zeitgeist to ignore it, wouldn't it make more sense to say that i could only deny their immorality if i was amoral?  Certainly we're talking about if evil exits, to suggest evil exists because i know it exists is begging the question; it's a contradiction of terms.  Further to suggest that if i deny evil exits then i'm accepting evil exists and acting against it; that's pure theistic reasoning right there - i mean, the only reason we can say we don't believe in god is because god made us able to say that, rite? 
  
It's not that i think nothing can be considered evil, we can use the term colloquially as much as we like - trying to use it as the basis or fulcrum of an argument however is stupid because we don't have a 'fucking universal definition for it.' as you suggest, indeed there are many times in history where the nature of evil has changed, i expect they forgot to teach you about that; weird i'd have though your school only believing in 6000 years of history they'd be able to cover the more recent events, oh well...  
  
The British Empire murdered millions, not just brown people that didn't count ether; we carpet bombed Dresden for example - was that evil?  Was America using Agent Orange evil?  Were the terrorists smashing a plane into the symbol of world trade evil?  The answers to all of these questions depend on who you ask, of course they do!  And why? because the concept of evil is transient and unfixed (for an introduction to this concept see 'Beyond Good and Evil', 'Will To Power' and other Nietzsche classics)  
  
Evil works as a throw away word which means doubleplusungood, however there is no room for it in metaphysics unless you go a long, long way down the dan dennit *(which i'm not against but were you to do so then you'd certainly not be using it in this way without mentioning the fact you're coming from an quasi-deterministic perspective)* or involve a divine figure.  
  
Just to touch on the immoral/amoral issue again, to deny the existence of evil isn't really either immoral or amoral - to say Hitler was fine to do what he wanted may be both or either however that's not what we were talking about, Hitler doesn't prove evil just as rainbows and bananas don't prove god - Bananas are like they are for very complex reasons, just as Hitler was 'evil' for very complex reasons -Hitler didn't have a switch which was accidentally knocked into evil mode after his experiences post ww1, he didn't suddenly decided to hurt people for no reason either - i can be immoral and amoral and dislike the actions of hitler, i can even be a/immoral and accept that evil exists and dislike hitler for being evil - none of these things will change the fact that evil isn't a stable idea, evil isn't a 'thing'.  In short both words were wrong but i gave you the benefit of the doubt, amoral would have been close enough to describe my viewpoint (until we realise that the concept of morality isn't linked to the acceptance of magical thoughts like 'evil' and 'karma' -would i be amoral or immoral for not believing in karma?

So, my answer would be, for sources only, with minor detail, end notes will be just fine; for more (parenthetical thoughts, additional details) add a footnote. That way, researchers who want to follow up can do it while the reader won't be flipping back and forth.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Its been my experience that they always seem to find ways to suck more money out of you.

Correct.  In fact, that's about all banks do these days.  They have our money, and now they're just trying to hold onto it until they can siphon more of our money into the pockets of their executives.  There is no trace of concern for the future of our country, only for the future of the bank executives, and if their obscene wealth can only come at the expense of the entire nation, the nation can go to hell in a handbasket as far as they're concerned.

The one way to stop this kind of greed is higher top-tier taxes.  In the 1950's, the top tax bracket was over 90%, which effectively put a cap on executive pay, which meant companies had more of their profits to re-invest in R&amp;D or whatever.  The way for top execs to make big bucks was to buy stock options in their company, which they could not sell for five or ten years (thus insuring that the execs had an incentive to make their company strong in the long run).

Those policies, combined with strong unions, gave us the broadest, strongest middle class the country has ever had, and the most abundant and widespread prosperity ever seen.

Thanks to decades of Republican-driven erosion of top tax rates, we now have a ""kid in a candy shop"" economy, where top execs view the company they're supposed to run as their private money reserve, and take all the money they can out of it.

Until this situation is reversed, this country is screwed.","1317427896"

Most liberal-leaning folks seem to see the Republican primary field as filled with asinine lunatics.  This is not an exaggeration; they actually feel that way when they see the debates/ads.   

If Republican perception is that the current President is as lunatic (or more so) than the individuals in the field for the Republican party, then it explains (tells) how it is that people can support what appears to liberals to be asinine lunatics.

Some (many non-Redditor) Republicans actually view President Obama as a Marxist-Fascist-Socialist-Communist-Muslim.  That bizarre sentiment is what leads the primary field to also be filled with bizarre candidates.

If the surgeon needs to define most of the parameters of movement (setting the boundaries of the ""holes"", for example, or writing an iterative series of instructions executed precisely) then it's still a telemanipulator. 

As someone else pointed out, the use of the word ""robot"" has been bastardized in so many places it's come to simply mean ""a machine that *appears* to move independent of its operator,"" rather than one that actually *does*.  The *BattleBots* competitions come to mind, where the camera mainly focuses on the machines doing the fighting instead of the operators fiddling madly with their joysticks -- as if when watching a chess competition there was an underlying assumption that the pieces were moving themselves.

What would make this more of a ""true"" robot is if the machine was given a grape, of varying size and orientation, and was able to peel it without direct input from a human operator.   And could then do something similar to a prostate.","1317427902"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I think that the addition of Justin as you said had a *huge* impact, but remember that Paul wrote a lot of the Aenima material, just left before it was recorded.

I personally think the biggest difference between those two albums was time. The band members all had awesome jobs already and didn't have to pursue music passionately like a lot of full time musicians would. it was something they did for fun on the side. Paul, Maynard, and Adam were all working in the film industry already. Adam Jones even fucking made the Jurassic Park dinosaurs! Pretty sweet gig if you ask me. After Undertow dropped and they became huge they were able to concentrate on Tool 100%. Three years of focus from four incredibly talented people, one year of which with Justin, results in something called Aenima.

There were probably other more personal reasons as well that aren't readily available information.

EDIT: By ""personal reasons,"" I mean drugs. Also Maynard's fascination with Jung and other psychological/philosophical influences. These aren't things we as fans can know about accurately, just infer from content.

EDIT2: After a bit more research, I found out that David Bottrill, who was King Crimson's producer, produced Aenima. I think that definitely had a huge impact, converting Undertow's raw sound to something more sonically visceral.","1317427904"

The politicians are the root of any current problems we're having, NOT business.  The government doesn't create wealth it only consumes wealth, that's a simple fact.  Business's with new ideas and goods/services in high demand create jobs and prosperity.  Capitalism is why our lives are full of so many wonderful products/services, not government control/planning. I don't blame the business's for asking for bail out money, why wouldn't they?  It was up to the politicians to stand strong for the American people and say, ""NO!  If you can't run a business than you go under, simple as that.  Somebody else will quickly take over and run things the right way.""  It's no different from natural selection, if a species sucks they fucking die out.

Big business's getting bailed out is only because we voted in spineless politicians that only care about staying elected and helping out their big business friends.  THEY are the ones to blame for any hardships we're enduring, not the corporations.  Corporations give me and half (used to be more till things started rolling down hill, and easily could be WAY more if we leaned towards free market economics) of Americans great healthcare and wages, if we increase taxes I will lose that and possibly lose my job.  How isn't that completely obvious?   What you're talking about is more government control, I really can't begin to comprehend that.

It's almost as if you see these politicians as children taking candy from a rapist.  They're grown-ups that don't give a single crap about you nor the constitution.  They will promise you the world, hence ""Jobs Act"" or ""No Children Left Behind"" or ""War On Drugs"" or ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"" or ""Etc., etc"".

Do you have any idea how hopelessly naive and ill informed you sound when you conflate Wall St with corporations in general with money in general, and then extrapolate it out to all societal evils? You do understand Wall St *only* represents financial industry firms, right? Saying Wall St is the root of all corporate evil is like saying Madison Ave is controlling all information, when you use a symbol you need to actually understand what it stands for.

And more to the point, your complaint is a more or less coherent one that could have worked: Money in politics is bad. You can build a movement around it, and it has a discrete goal (full campaign finance reform). It's got broad support, it cuts across party lines, you can build a coalition around it and actually have some more or less plausible road map from where you are to actual laws being passed.

This crap they put out? It's insane, it's retarded, and if there had been some vast new world order conspiracy who actually cared about this sad sack protest enough to want to strangle it they wouldn't have been able to do it in one stroke more elegantly than to pass this off as representing the protests.

Do you honest to god think that Wall St is behind sexism or racism in the workplace? You honestly think this is a thing sane, intelligent adults say? What possible fucking motive would there be for a vast conspiracy to reach down into each and every workplace in the world just to strew over Jane form accounting?

Or how about animal rights? What the hell possible connection is there between money in government and animal rights? Do you think Wall St masturbates to bunnies wearing mascara, or what?

And colonialism? You really think Wall St gets it's rocks off claiming australia for queen and country?

Or how about poisoning our foods. You think Wall St runs agriculture policy? Is everyone down at these protests really so completely clueless about how the world works that they don't comprehend there are different corporate groups who have opposing interests? Are you sincerely so uninformed that you don't know ""financially conservative"" commentators often rail against agricultural subsidies to large agricultural firms, who manage to hold on through their own oversized political influence in rural states?.

Honestly, you can go down the line with all of these. I put it in another post, but there were exactly 4 complaints that even remotely actually touched on Wall St, 1 additional that was related but was literally the most self-centered and unsympathetic thing to bitch about when people are unemployed and losing their homes (student loans), and 19 unrelated bullshit complaints that have no place in a Wall St protest and are almost universally written in the most asinine language ever (torturing nonhuman animals, poison the food supply, students held hostage, etc etc).","1317427913"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I find it interesting that we don't see a discussion/answer to OP outlining calculation of enterprise value, book value, earnings quality and analysis of future cash flows (DCF estimations for fair value), and so forth.  
If he intends to hold the shares more than a year--*and* picks companies that will likely be around five years from now, ten years from now, I think it's a great time to buy. Look carefully at earnings and cash flows during the previous three, five, and ten years, calculate total return, and picks likely *long term* strong companies. OP can do very well. If the market drops lower, so be it. 

I had a heated argument during the end-of-July/early August dip with someone here about total return and long term value. He insisted that a particular stock was ""overvalued"" and that the dividend wasn't strong. When I pointed out that the historic total return for any window of time I picked was good, and that the quality spoke for itself (via the market's ongoing opinion over many years), well, he still argued that he new better than the market. None of us know the future, but some companies will surely be around even if the markets and economies ""collapse"". It's a good time to buy if you're in for the actual long haul, in my opinion.   

I told that OP to ""keep watching"" the stock I was talking/arguing about--and it's finally reached ""fair value"" as a value investing candidate. Clearly it isn't overvalued any longer, and the company is a worldwide/international concern that has been around for over 100 years. (They're not going to get de-listed even in another great depression!) If I buy now and wait *long enough*, it can *and almost certainly will* give an incredible total return; five or ten, or fifteen years from now--whenever we reach a strong growth period.  

And sure enough large-cap blue chip stocks like the one I was talking about are still doing well and have a positive return from when I bought them during that August dip. Time to buy more, at least for me.

No, the difference is that England realizes that there is absolutely no chance that Scotland will secede, so there is no harm whatsoever to allow for the 'illusion' of this right.

Your comparison between the Scottish pro-independence party and the Tibetan government-in-exile is also highly flawed, seeing as how the latter are FORMER SLAVE-MASTERS OF THE REST OF THE POPULATION.

My relationship with the pantheist god is such that i view earth as part of a quark, that makes up an atom(solar system), that makes up a cell(galaxy), that makes up the god(universe). 
I dont believe that god can know that i exist, but somehow we could be entirely dependent upon one another to survive.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","&gt;You're telling me grinding is the sign of a bad game? So basically any RPG with a level system is a bad game?

No, any RPG with a level system *that lacks any variety at all* is a bad game.

&gt;In what game isn't the leveling mechanic the same at all levels? Does the game change the mechanic once you hit a certain level in the games you play? No. It stays the same. And the higher you get, the better tasks and courses you get to allow you to get more exp. It makes sense. And it's similar to 80% of other games.

Except that there are many games with vastly different and better leveling systems. My point was not that the problem is the unchanging leveling mechanic, my point is that the leveling mechanic is shit and always is, from level twenty to level one hundred and twenty.

&gt;Also, if you don't think you can spend a lot of time in front of the comp, then don't play this game because in order to get to really high levels you need a lot of time. I know people who go to combat level 100 in 2 months time which is nothing. You can even out most of your stats at 60 in about that time also.

I did play this game, for four years, in fact. So I know exactly how much time you do need to get good at skills and combat. And it's a lot. But I don't think it's the time required to reach those levels which makes the difference, it's the manner in which you reach those levels. Which is, once again, fairly shitty.

&gt;If you want to go higher, that's your choice. what's great about the game is you don't have anything to beat per say. There's always more to do.

That is usually a characteristic of many MMOs, and can be extended to other games as well (Minecraft, for example). So just because RS does a couple things right, that doesn't mean that there are many other games that do them better and without the multitude of drawbacks that RS has.

&gt;Hardly any video games actually do you much good. Don't just bash on RS. And in fact, most games actually teach you something. RS gave me some good ass stock market experience and lots of math involved. Same as other games which can teach history, math, and probably a couple other subjects.

Okay, so yes, video games can teach you something. I know that, hell, the comic describes doing just that. I'm bashing RS because it sucks, so getting a 99 skills isn't an achievement, it's either nothing to be proud of or something to be ashamed of.

&gt;As for Warcraft... same goes for that. It's a game. And i'm not sure what DDO is but if it's Dungeons and Dragons Online... then... dude. Come on man. Runescape is a free MMO with tons of hours to devote to it.

Also, you will find that cars that are more popular to modify will have a larger range of parts available at a lower price than others. DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING IF YOU WANT TO MODIFY YOUR CAR. Find a website/forum dedicated to whatever car it is you want, and ask questions about performance, pricing, appearance, or whatever it is you are interested in doing. There is no wrong car, or wrong way to modify one. It is the owner's preference. But do yourself a favor and do research on what car it is you want, and what it is you want to do with it. It will save you time, money, and trouble in the long-run. 

Also, always repair broken or worn parts before making a performance upgrade. An know what kind of an impact one system upgrade will have on another.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","People say the repeal of Glass-Steagall (deregulation) played a part.  I disagree, people who are calling for the reinstate of Glass-Steagall are fools, it will not change anything.   I'm not well aware of the other deregulations that Wall St. probably inevitably lobbied for over the years, but I'm sure they played a part.

I think regulation, that is --market intervention, was the culprit.   Greenspan not letting interest rates clear at equilibrium was mistake #1.  The government using the GSEs to back home loans and give the poor new houses they couldn't really afford was mistake #2.   Mistake #3 was letting credit ratings agencies rate MBS/ABS securities like Treasuries, it still boggles the mind that the government didn't step in here and differentiate between the two.  Mistake #4 was bailing out the banks.   In a free market, none of this would have happened, instead everyone was so babied by the government that everyone basically figured: if it blows up, the government will sort it out, and guess what they were right.     

the only place where I believe more regulation would have helped is in the fine print on the loans made to the poor.  Those not versed in finance cannot be expected to read a loan and sign it and be responsible.

The same applies to health insurance for Americans, it creates a great sense of false security.   I can take this risk cause I don't have to really pay for it if it backfires, because America will pay my medical bills!  

People need to start taking responsibility for themselves.  





Do I think the media overpromoted housing?  I think everyone did.  Everyone loved housing.  Everyone.   It was the get rich quick scheme that actually worked, which meant there's no way it could keep working.


Algo trading has to go.  Put it this way, if a massive radioactive cloud hits Earth and everyone dies instantly.  The S&amp;P will still be chugging away thanks to the algos.  It's like helium for the markets.  It's a bubble.   Eventually (if the SEC does not do it's job) one of these algos will go crazy and flash-crash the market bigger than the last one, rumors will start flying, and it will take down the entire markets for the day.  Beyond all that is is flat out illegal what some of these algos do, and it gives them an edge that most traders would kill for, considering any edge can make millions.    They need to go, they do not have any sentimental analysis...and that is dangerous.

It made sense and it didn't.  There were people who knew, even within Wall St. and who would speak up that the whole thing had to crash.  I mean all bubbles have to crash, the bigger they are the more they have to equilibrate.  People knew, but it wasn't popular, it wasn't given much airtime, it was kind of considered ""crazy talk"".   So long as the government backed home loans, it didn't seem risky at all.","1317427940"

I expected to be bored senseless...but instead, I totally got it.  When she talked about the logic of what her character would wear, how hard she fought for her vision, why some things worked and some things didn't, it made sense.  I learned more about ladies' fashion from that than I ever knew before, and it's down to Lalla Ward's good taste and her skill at explaining things.  

(It also made me realize that River Song is a bad dresser, but on purpose -- you're always supposed to feel like she's out of place, something unsettling about her.  With Romana, you're always supposed to feel she's right where she belongs and enjoying herself.)","1317427950"

"history","t5_2qh53","Frankly, it is an unfair question. It would be akin to asking what the Founders would think about air traffic control.

At the time of the country's founding, there was vastly more land than people. In fact, there were so few people that having more people loyal to the US and/or State governments was highly desirable in order to protect the fragile nation. Beyond Native Americans, Florida was ""controlled"" by Spain, Canada was controlled by Britain and the Louisiana territory (which was a huge swath in the middle of the country) was ""controlled"" by France.  So, we were surrounded by nations that would have been happy to take more territory were it not for Napoleon. Thus, too much immigration wasn't the issue so much as not enough. In addition, there are vastly more social services and police resources paid through taxes now which are drained by illegal immigration. That wasn't an issue at the time of the founding. At best, there was only the issue of immigrants ""taking"" jobs which did not come to the forefront until 50-60 years after the country was founded. 

The country is more mature now, there vastly more people in the world now, there is far less unclaimed land in the world and uncontrolled immigration has more costs associated with it now than just ""taking jobs"". ","1317427951"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;Believe it or not, but light doesn't always travel at the speed of light. Light only travels at the speed of light in vacuum. In our atmosphere it travels a somewhat slower speed, and in glass, even slower. It's the consistency of the matter in which it passes that determines it's ultimate speed. This effect is what creates the changing of the skies' colors between morning, noon and evening and also the fracture of light in a rainbow. What's interesting about neutrinos is that they don't tend to interact with matter around it the way light does, and this is why neutrinos were observed to be faster than photons.

They didn't actually directly measure a beam of light going through the same path as the neutrinos (one reason being that the neutrinos' trajectory was through the ground). When they say the neutrinos were found to go faster than light, they were using a calculated value for how long it would've taken a beam of light to travel the same distance (in a vacuum) that the neutrinos traveled, and they compared that to the measured amount of time it actually took the neutrinos to travel. When they talk about the speed of light, they're always referring to the speed of light in a vacuum.

As for your bit about the mass of a neutrino being so small that it can be treated as having no mass (and thus, according to you, relativity would predict the findings that were reported by cern), why would this have been such a big news story if that were the case? The whole point is that if these neutrinos were found to actually be going faster than the speed of light, that would go against what our current theories predict. That's the only reason it's in the news.","1317427959"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I'm not claiming to know exactly what that probability is. I'm simply claiming that it is very small. The reasoning that I followed to reach that conclusion is as follows. When we knew very little about the natural world, there was a fair chance that when we explored any of the gaps in our knowledge, we would find god there. Before we understood what stars were, for example, it was somewhat reasonable to think that god was a fair explanation. As we have learned more about reality, everywhere that god could have been, god has not been. As we have learned more about reality, the number of places remaining for god to be has gotten smaller and smaller. If we discount the deist conception of god, and the conception of god as somehow *outside* the universe, there is nearly nowhere left for us to find god. Accordingly, the probability of god actually existing, which has been decreasing for centuries under the onslaught of science, is now minute. This is not a probability in the sense that there is an actual percentage chance that we could pin down, but we can know that the probability is very small without actually knowing what it is.","1317427961"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I had my first in July, did not have an epidural or any other pain meds.  What helped that happen: I went into labor on my own, not induced; my labor progressed well and only lasted 12 hours; I went into it well-rested (napped while things were just getting started); had a doula; and knew that when it got incredibly intense, it would probably be over soon. And it was :)  I am a nurse-midwife so I've seen lots and lots of labors, and had an open mind about how it might go for me. I planned to get an epidural if I wanted it but I never got to that point.

I moaned, groaned, rocked, got on all fours, labored in the tub.  I did kind of lose my mind right at the end but then ta-dah, time to push!  And not having an epidural does tend to make for a faster second stage (pushing).  I pushed for about 15 minutes which was plenty.  Crowning did hurt like a bitch but was over very quickly.  The euphoria was incredible when he was out and I was done!

However it goes for you, you will make the right decisions for yourself.  You are the one giving birth!  And no two births are the same.  ","1317427971"
"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","
Until now I had been living with my bed out in the open, and I decided it was high time I built myself a shelter of some kind. I set out a final time, with this journey’s goal to gather a forest-worth of wood. The journey only lasted a day, and as the sun set I knew I should head home, but risked it and stayed into the night, as I felled the final few trees.

I walked home, hungry and still regretting my actions towards Enderbro, completely oblivious to the creatures of the night around me. It was not long before the inevitable happened. I walked and listened to the wind blowing through the trees, the feral cows calling to one another in the distance, pigs snorting to one another as they huddled for warmth, hooves trampling the twigs and leaves behind me, and the ever-so light sizzle of a nearby creeper…my eyes widened.

I spun around to try and defend myself, but as I turned I knew there would be nothing I could do but accept my fate. I stared into the eyes of the creeper as its body grew bigger, and its hissing louder. I began to back-peddle in hopes I could create enough distance to barely survive. Suddenly, out of a nearby bush, a great shadow darted out and past me towards the creeper. The shade pinned the creeper up against a nearby tree, and looked over its shoulder at me. Enderbro had returned! 

With tears in my eyes I knew what had to be done. I turned and mustered all the strength I could find to put distance between the explosion and I. I ran as fast as I could until I heard the explosion behind me, and immediately turned to rush to Enderbro’s aid. However, when I turned there was nothing but a crater to be found.  He was gone.

I stood there staring at the crater, mourning Enderbro, and thanking him for all he had done for me. As the smoke began to clear a strange sound caught my ear; the sound of a sheep calling out in my direction from a distance. When I turned towards the sheep, there was nothing; nothing but a wisp of purple smoke atop a distant hill.


TL;DR: I have a persistent Endermen in my world. He is not damaged by sunlight, teleports as if there's no tomorrow if you walk towards him (sprint hopping towards him doesn't make him tele), and is never aggressive to me even if I manage to hit him. He does not disappear on logout, or computer restart. Story may or may not have been exaggerated at times....*maybe*...

Im feeling good on the maca root.  So far nothing bad to say. As for a burst of new energy that I can say definitely came from the maca...no.

If you didn't have a thyroid issue, I would also recommend eating more broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower (cruciferous) family veggies.  But they decrease your thyroid function.

Fiber is also very helpful.  Fiber is great for removing toxins from your body as some of those toxins are probably aiding in the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

I guess I'm just lazy, and you can downvote me if it makes you feel better, but in the UK, you can rie with no lights, no brakes, on the path, weaving around pedestrians, and passing cop car won't even stop to bat an eyelid","1317427990"

Most people seem to think cops roll up on a shooting and stand there with their thumbs up their asses saying ""k, if you're going to shoot then I better holster my gun so that there's not extra shots fired"".

Honestly, think about it. If someone is shooting at you, you're not going to pay attention to how many rounds you have fired. You're going to shoot the fucker until your magazine is empty, then you'll hopefully do a combat reload, tap it and rack it, and keep firing until you're out of ammo or there is no longer a threat.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""Life gets harder...""  Life without challenges isn't worth living.  Be glad that life will bring you challenges, don't shy away from them.  Sometimes you will overcome, sometimes you will fail.  It doesn't matter whether you succeed or fail, only how you react to it.

""young people are naive and blind to reality....""  This is true, and yet is that very blindness that we value so much in youth.

""our expectations for life are almost entirely bullshit....""  This is also true. Young people tend to think they can just go out and change the world.  They soon find out that they are nearly powerless to affect the institutions that have taken hundreds of years to come into fruition. They believe that they have all the answers, and that no one has ever been as smart as they are.  They don't realize that millions of young people have come before them with the very same expectations, only to realize later that reality is not what they expected. 

It doesn't matter that the world is vastly different than you thought.  It doesn't matter that your youthful plans are based on fantasy.  Keep the dreams alive, because without those dreams, we would never have developed as far as we have.  Those stupid, naive dreams are what put a man on the moon, and what will one day cure cancer.

""looking back on the past, the present sucks, and the future doesn't look much better""  We tend to glorify the past, remembering it the way we want it to have been, rather than how it actually was.  The present is not all that wonderful in some respects, but it's awesome in others.  We are currently in an economic crisis, where in the 90s we were in boom times.  

We have a media that thrives on delivering bad news.  Don't let it get you down. You have some of your best times ahead of you.  I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat, except that I have a wife that I love more than life itself, and two wonderful children who are in a critical time of their lives.

He has several easy solutions obviously: 1 - Go to the corner store and buy a pedo-be-gone pill, cause, ya know, those are real and all. 2 - Just STOP being a pedophile, it's not like that's his neuro-chemical makeup he was born with or anything, that's just a bunch of mumbo jumbo just like those homosexuals, he chooses to live a life of pedophilia. It's a choice. 3 - Just give up and kill himself because of it, because it's JUST his life, no biggie right? It's not like he can seek professional help or anything. Tough luck Imamultiphile, life dealt you these cards so deal with it. 

""...I keep looking at my son and wishing you were in front of me so I could make sure that you never looked at another child, perversely or otherwise, ever again."" 

Oh please, spare me, if you REALLY cared about protecting children you would go out of your way to help Imamultiphile find psychiatric help or kill him.

""...As one of the kids who were abused and taped as a child, you watching the video/pics is almost as bad as them filming it.""

So what's the difference between the ""signal"" propagating along the wire when it's in a springy coil and when it's stretched out straight?

Or how about this, take the straightened wire and hold out horizontally (at least at one end) so it droops off into the distance.  (Basically take the helical spring and straighten it horizontally.)

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Interesting study!

&gt;Lasting change was found in the part of the personality known as openness, which includes traits related to imagination, aesthetics, feelings, abstract ideas and general broad-mindedness. Changes in these traits, measured on a widely used and scientifically validated personality inventory, were larger in magnitude than changes typically observed in healthy adults over decades of life experiences, the scientists say. Researchers in the field say that after the age of 30, personality doesn't usually change significantly.

&gt;""Normally, if anything, openness tends to decrease as people get older,""Griffiths says lasting personality change is rarely looked at as a function of a single discrete experience in the laboratory. In the study, the change occurred specifically in those volunteers who had undergone a ""mystical experience,"" as validated on a questionnaire developed by early hallucinogen researchers and refined by Griffiths for use at Hopkins. He defines ""mystical experience"" as among other things, ""a sense of interconnectedness with all people and things accompanied by a sense of sacredness and reverence.""

&gt;Personality was measured on a widely used and scientifically validated personality inventory, which covers openness and the other four broad domains that psychologists consider the makeup of personality: neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Only openness changed during the course of the study.

I believe I asked this forum some time ago about overall life changes since using psychedelics (at the time I was interested in learning about DMT mainly).

I put in the article to show such an emphasis on this topic of Natural vs Synthetic, not to sway opinion to my own. This does not promote deeper discussion to me. My bias already leans towards natural plants. Yet interestingly enough I enjoy LSD more. The article is from 2002 and the ending conclusion I don't think is a conclusion to this topic. We won't have science step into this further until the restrictions on these drugs/plants are removed.

Our discussion though has sparked me to write to someone I think can expand it. I'll email [Alexander Shulgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) to see his opinion on this and try to get back to you or on this thread.

The details (for example, you could point out that according to special relativity, the 60mph cars will experience a slightly shorter journey than is observed by people on the sidewalk) are only details.

This brings us to a classic dilemma in game theory. If 100% of commuters ride in buses, then everyone will get where they're going faster, because there will be almost no congestion anywhere. However, if only 10% of commuters ride in buses, everyone gets where they are going more slowly, because not only do buses travel more slowly than cars, inconveniencing car drivers, but cars create congestion, inconveniencing bus riders. Bicycles have a similar effect. They slow vehicle traffic to a crawl, but if everyone were riding them, the lack of congestion would be a considerable benefit. Given these realities, people are compelled by their own self interest to pick the ""wrong"" choice, i.e. the least efficient for the whole community, because otherwise they will inconvenience themselves.","1317428045"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","What this whole discussion was spawned by, was the argument that MULE's are a more forgiving mechanic if you forget to use them, compared to spawn larvae. You are constantly gravitating away from this whenever it is mentioned. You even gave a perfect example yourself earlier:

&gt;Let's take the same situation, where Zerg missed larva injects. Harass comes and kills most/all of their drones. They can use the banked minerals from earlier to reboost their economy by producing drones and/or continuing to reinforce their army.

You have showed how a zerg player who is low on larvae from missing injects, can either choose to spend their limited larvae on drones, or attempt to spend it on army to fend off the imminent attack. They can start to inject more larvae, but they cannot make up for those missing injects.

A terran player would have no workers, but have 4 mules banked. with those 4 mules it could begin to make workers, and an army of at least marines and hellions out of its production facilities. 4 mules is roughly the equivalent income a full saturated base as well. So it will be a little while before their economy even hiccups at the damage done. A zerg player would instantly have to make the decision of to stop all army production to begin to try and get back in the worker game, and their economy would take a massive hit from this instantly.

Albeit both players are fucked, this is a great example **by you** for exaggerating how banking MULEs is at minimum more forgiving than forgetting injects.","1317428057"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Agreed, and I'd like to second that thanks to big_ander for the redacted spoilers! Truly, big_ander, yours was the greatest Reddit comment to date.

I think people hate Skyler because of a combination of a) using TV logic (the logic that would apply to a much lesser show in which characters are much less complex) and b) Skyler's being a woman (yeah, I said it). If you're not convinced, the word ""cunt"" has been used 10 times in this thread 10 times - that I can see (meaning there are comments that have been downvoted into hiding). 

I'd argue that if you're saying things like ""I hate Skyler"" and ""Skyler is a bitch,"" you need to give the show about 10,000 more complexity points than you're giving it. Are there really any main characters that are so simple as to be either very lovable or very hateable? Don't you think the show is too good for one of the main characters be someone you ""love to hate""? 

Think about her motivations and psychology for a second, as well as the motivations/ psychology of other characters. Does the show ever have characters whose actions are without complex motivations behind them? Is it the kind of show where someone is ""the bitch""?

If nothing else, stop using the word ""cunt."" It's hateful language, and it's not an argument.","1317428058"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Oh I love this topic, urban winter riding is the best.  

Stuff in the pic looks good except if that's a cotton bandanna.  The moisture from your breath will quickly get it all wet, then it will be cold and wet. Which will kind of suck.  Over your face you may want something that still insulates while wet, like fleece or merino wool.  I have two different face coverings that I switch between or use together.  One is thin under helmet balaclava that kind of covers my lower face and one is a half face mask [that kind of looks like this](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=X37&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=ski+half+mask&amp;gs_upl=12187l13522l1l14523l5l5l0l0l0l1l256l1013l0.3.2l5l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=587&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=14338769319592175259&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8U6GTqHzF8Hg0QHp_sBL&amp;ved=0CHYQ8wIwAw).  Check out something called a Buff, those are super versatile and can be found in merino wool, which is an awesome material. 

I sometimes find goggles a little much for long distance rides when I'm hustling, so I carry clear lens glasses as well as sun glasses in my bag.  Be forewarned, tinted goggles can get kind of dark at night, as well as goggles restricting peripheral vision some. I get by with rose tinted goggles and every winter I say I'm going to get a clear pair....but never do.  It's doable with a light tint and lots of street lamps and I don't end up using them all that often.   

Under Armour base layers are a great idea, I swear by base layers.  There are cheaper generic brand poly-pro base layers out there that work just as well as UA. You may want to add another layer between your base and your outer most layer.  Depending on where I'm going its either regular clothes or a fleece sweater.  Just play around with layering combos, you'll quickly find out what works for you. 

You will absolutely want some wool socks, I often find myself doubling up on socks depending on distance and temperature. 

I find it nice to have some insulated gloves as well as non-insulated that I can use with a liner glove. But two pairs is a luxury, you can get by with one pair.  

As far as jacket make sure your primary one is windproof but not necessarily waterproof.  Waterproof doesn't breathe too well (i get ot easily) and windproof is generally water resistant enough for snow (depending on how wet the snow is and how long you're out in it.  I sometimes throw on a medium/heavy weight windbreaker, rain jacket or ski jacket shell to act as an outer shell if it is super cold and/or really wet.  

Normal shoes work, might be nice if they were semi-water resistant, or at least didn't have mesh all over them.  I personally wouldn't be comfy riding in hiking boots but there's nothing stopping someone else from liking it.  If you use clip-less there are some waterproof and waterproof/insulated shoes out there.  Check out a brand called Lake  

Watch for snow build up around your brakes and between your fender and tire.  Snow build up can make your brakes cease to work well or work even at all.

And most importantly LIGHTS LOTS OF LIGHTS! For gods-sake man use some lights. :) 

What city you riding in?

Edit:  I forgot about vests, vests are the best. I use my North face Denali vest, all the time in winter. So useful, especially for training rides or those warmer days and it has a bunch of pockets.  Don't discount the awesomeness of the vest.","1317428071"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","My experiences over the past 9 months trying to install this game from a game-card bundled with my GFX card.


* Download EA download manager. 

* Install. 

* Create account.

* Create account for some EA site.

* Create account for another EA thing.

* Create account for Sapphire Select club to activate/receive the game codes (progression unlocks, Vietnam expansion, unlock code for BC2).

* Start downloading game via EA Download Manager.

* Crashes at about 5gb.

* Restart.

* Gets to 100% complete, still downloading... now 1.5gb over. wtf? We pay for data in my country, about $1.80 a gigabyte on average, across the ISPs. 

* Stop download, start again as per recommendations from EA (others have had the same issue), gets to 10gb downloaded (8.4gb was 100%), stop again on advice from EA support.

* Reinstall Origin, try again. This time it gets to about 12gb, and some people have said to leave it running, but again EA support say ""No, it shouldn't do that, try re-downloading it""... 

* Fourth time lucky, I download again and let it run. It finally finishes just short of 13Gb, total cost is now about $50-$60 in data (our money, about $40-$50USD). 

* The game works! I get in an hour or two playing, then it crashes. Over the next week I play several times, but I never get more than an hour out of it (usually 20-30 mins) before it freezes, either requiring a force-shutdown of the PC or (if I'm lucky) task-manager process-kill. 

* Asking for support, I'm told it's either my motherboard's on-board sound being incompatible, or ""Just download it again!"". People say ""Buy a sound card or get a real computer"".
I have an ASUS P7P55D-E. It's not a shitty motherboard. Everything in the PC is decent except for the storage hard drives (green).

* I update mobo sound drivers, no change. Give up for a few days.

* Then I go to try downloading it again- the game is gone! It's not in my list of games! I have 0 games on my account!

* Reinstall Origin a few times and ask for support on the EA forums, no change. Several months later, it comes back- I decide to wait until I'm at a LAN with fibre and free data to download it again (faster and free), but when the chance comes, the game is no longer in my list... 

* Cue 8 months of ""Fuck EA and their shitty client!"" posts. 

* Origin comes out and I decide to give it a shot.

* At first, it wants to download the game again, but I think ""Fuck that!"", then the game disappears from the My Games list again when I'm at a LAN- what a fucking surprise.

* A couple of months later, I fire it up again (obviously I really really want to give this game a try), and it says that not only is the game there, but it's doing an update... this is promising!

* Update finishes, and the game works. No more crashes, no force-shut downs or task killing. No more ""My Games: 0"". I love the game and the client is working like a dream now- except nobody I know is using it so I have no Friends list.


Now, after all that, would you buy BF3 on Origin with cash (instead of a free game-card bundled with something you were going to buy anyway)?


**TLDR:** My free BF:BC2 + Vietnam bundled with my GFX card makes me jump through five goatse hoops before trollfacing me repeatedly and costing me about $50USD, then lets me play and trollfaces again by crashing after 20-30 mins average. Then trollfaces me some more by hiding my game on and off. EA trollfaces me with dumb suggestions, community trollfaces me by calling my high end gaming system shit, Origin trollfaces me by hiding my game again, then bingo! Finally everything is sweeeet and I love the game! But Buy BF3 via Origin? I'd rather have unprotected sober sex with your mother.","1317428073"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Coming from a country where pretty much no one gets circumcised outside of religious reasons, I'm pretty amazed with the things that are said by Americans for circumcision.  This is the first time I've heard: 'fewer problems with erections', so no is your answer I suppose.

Most of the things it's supposed to prevent I'd never even heard of happening before I came across debates of this online.

A lot of the claims with regards health reasons seem generally outdated, or at least in contention from anything I've read on the topic.  

As for penile cancer: 'Most experts agree that circumcision should not be recommended solely as a way to prevent penile cancer.'
[link](http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PenileCancer/DetailedGuide/penile-cancer-prevention)

Again I'm pretty sure the 'decrease in risk in certain sexually transmitted infections' is not fully accepted, and under debate.  Condoms and vaccines would be a much better alternative, your son could still choose to get circumcised before he started having sex if he wanted.

I've known one person to have a problem with tight foreskin, it was temporary, and a result of where he put it.  I am aware that it does happen, but the 'better remove it beforehand just in case' attitude makes no sense to me. 

You don't pre-emptively remove your child's tonsils just in case he might get tonsillitis.  You don't remove your child's appendix just in case he might get appendicitis.  

The only reason for the difference I think is erroneously calling the foreskin a 'simple flap of skin', it's more complicated then that.  For a start it contains a lot of nerve endings, and the sensitivity of the foreskin itself, its affect on the sensitivity on the glands, its role in protecting the glands, the foreskin's role in intercourse, etc. Are all under debate.","1317428081"
"GetMotivated","t5_2rmfx","Laying aside, for the moment, the question of whether or not this man is healthy for you, the fact that you are coming from a position of extreme neediness right now is an attraction-killer for any male.   Paradoxically, your depression, constant calls, and putting the onus of your happiness on his shoulders will only drive him further away.  If he does come back, it will likely be out of a sense of duty, guilt, or obligation based on your previous commitment and your fragile state.  I assume that's not what you want your relationship to be based on.

One of my first girlfriends was a vivacious, independent woman and more attractive to me than anyone I had ever known.  She had life goals and plans and was constantly working towards achieving them.  She was also skilled at enjoying life to the utmost.   We had a great relationship but eventually both moved on with our lives and she got married to someone else whom she had known for only a very short time..  The marriage was a disaster and failed within the first year.  

She came back to me, begging for us to get back together.  But she was in such a state of victimization and neediness that I found the attraction I once held for her had died.  If she had come back to me the same outgoing, assured woman, I'm sure things would have been different, but her spirit seemed to have been crushed.   Still, I felt a sense of obligation and duty to her based on our past, so I helped where I could - helped her find an apartment, tried to insert her back into our group of friends, etc., all the while distancing myself emotionally from her, which only made her more needy and me less attracted to her.  She eventually moved to another city.

Years later, she heard I was between relationships and showed up on my doorstep again.  Unfortunately she had not moved her life forward one inch.  She was still needy, still playing the victim, still mooching off of other people's kindness.   Instead of being a strong woman who could afford to help others, was now a weak woman, relying on others for everything.   Needless to say, I put her in the guest bedroom and got her a ride home the next day.

I do not have experience with depression, and so am unable to give you advice in that arena, but unless you use this time to plan your own life, make your own goals, and find ways to make yourself happy, you will only be attractive to co-dependent men at best.   If you do work on yourself however, you will definitely be more attractive again to this bipolar, pathological liar you're in love with now, and probably many more well-adjusted, healthy men as well.

As much as you seem to want to believe it, al-Awlaki was not simply an American citizen by birth.  He was also a citizen of Yemen who was a leader or regional commander for al-Qaeda.  He was so effective that many, many people died thanks to him and not just Americans, and many, many more would have died because of him except for extraordinary heroics of average folks and professionalism by cops.  That all makes al-Awlaki a leading enemy of the US.  I wish we didn't cause enemies like him to exist, but we did.


Basically, when al-Awlaki was killed, America dealt with a symptom of what ails us, but we haven't solved our real problems, and so the symptoms will probably persist.  We can take the high road, and try our mortal enemies in absentia, or we can end them.


Try al-Awlaki in absentia?  You haven't yet demonstrated that he had legal standing to claim constitutional rights given the full extent of his citizenship and activities.

Lets see here. There are definitely loads of awesome breakbeat hardcore tunes. There are tons I want to suggest but I don't (and i'm sure neither do you) want the set to be a bunch of anthem smashers.

The nice thing about the style is that there is stuff for all tastes.

Good labels would be After Dark Records, Suburban Base Records, Moving Shadow Records, Deja Vu Recordings, Ram Records, Out of Romford Records, Awesome Records.

As far as Producers? Nebula II, QBass, Dave Charlesworth, Slipmatt (for the SMDs), Carl Cox...Hmm, I could just go on and on. There is tons of different stuff both from actual producers and then you have the crap tons of white labels with no actual identifiable person. Going through these peeps' youtube accounts will be a good start for finding specific artists:

A quick look revealed the site to be blatant propaganda. This is the internet (actually r/skeptic) so it's important to be able to critically analyse your sources, preferably quickly.

&gt; And of course they have a clear agenda (so do the drug companies, so does the medical field, so do the anti- ""anti-vaccine-movement"" people).

Yes, all those people have an agenda. That is why it is important to use evidence, like science and peer reviewed research and not anecdotal evidence.

&gt; Also, what's wrong with organic food? 

Nothing is wrong with organic food. It's just intensively marketed to a target audience. I usually avoid buying branded ""organic"" products because they are more expensive and I don't trust or understand the veracity of ""organic"" claims. I have a deep distrust of marketing and the bias it cultivates in human perception.

&gt; &amp; grow most of my own so that I can say with confidence that I'm doing my best to NOT put unknown chemicals &amp; crap into my body or into the environment. 

Growing your own is great, respect. But can I point out that the environment is full of ""unknown chemicals &amp; crap"". I presume you actually mean ""man-made chemicals"" which, ironically, means these chemicals are probably ""known"" to some degree. They were used for a specific effect and have probably had some level of safety testing to estimate toxicity.

&gt; I wasn't talking about the website, I was referring to the interview which you clearly ignored. This is exactly what I mean by ""evidence to the contrary (being) completely disregarded"".

The interview reads like a conspiracy theory. It is full of vague anecdotal evidence. There is not evidence for anything, just some guys unverified, untrustworthy stories.

&gt; And WTF do UFOs have to do with anything?

It was a reference to the powerful human tendency toward [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).

What is your definition of ""aiding and abetted?""

&gt;Also with a lot of sourced material. But not like you are capable of reading it.

I'm assuming you didn't. I've followed this story very closely. From the sources in the wikipedia page:

""Mr. Awlaki, 38, the son of a former agriculture minister and university president in Yemen, has never been accused of planting explosives himself. But experts on terrorism believe his persuasive endorsement of violence as a religious duty, in colloquial, American-accented English, has helped push a series of Western Muslims into terrorism. ""

""U.S. authorities were limited in how far they could push Yemen to hold Aulaqi, officials said, because they have no pending legal case against him. The officials said ongoing intelligence-gathering efforts here and abroad prevented them from providing details about Aulaqi's suspected activities. ""

""Aulaqi served as a ""spiritual advisor"" to three of the 9/11 hijackers.""

NONE of the sources provide proof of actively aiding terrorists, though the government insists he did, but will not provide proof and had an ACLU case thrown out of court due to the ""state's secrets"" privilege. 

So I guess I'll just assume that you are OK with the state executing someone without trial for providing ""spiritual support"" to it's enemies without providing evidence of what that means or how it aided our enemies.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Nope.  Under Oregon law, which applies in this case as it's happening 10 miles from my house in Oregon City, aggravated murder must have the element of intent.  These parents did not intend to kill their child, so that charge does not fit.

[Source](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.095)

These parents acted with reckless regard for human life and/or neglegence, so the crime of manslaughter fits better.  Yes, what they did was stupid, but it was NOT an intentional killing.

The congregation of this church has been hit 4 times now with various charges involving the death of a child in regards to faith healing.  While it' a large building, the congregation is rather small, less than 100, which constitutes less than 0.4% of the population of Oregon City.  They are an extreme wing on the Christian religion.  Even though I'm a athiest, I won't bash an entire, billion-plus-adherant religion on the acts of a very small sect.  The church that I went to with my parets when I grew up was inclusive, kind, and didn't preach fire and brimstone.  They practiced tolerance and charity, often foregoing repairs to the church building in order to contribute to charitable works.  Their attitude about Christianity and the bible was ""This is God, he's a nice guy.  Here's a book that's about him, you sould read it, but don't think it's word-for-word truth.  Now, let's be nice to each other, and go out into the Narthex for coffee and cookies.""  We had several gay couples in the church, and the pastor had an adult son from a relationship when he was 17.  I liked them, they were all nice people.","1317428144"

I went off course and ended up flying over my mother's condo, and then I arced back down. I tried to land in a tree. It caught me. So... really scary, but everything went better than expected.

Another night, I dreamed a couple of men broke into my house and held me captive. But they left the house a lot... I remembered my old house phone was connected, and I dashed around the house ninja-style to find my phone. I had just picked it up to see if there was a dial tone, as I saw one of the men look into the house through the window, when I guess I couldn't take it anymore and I woke up, my heart pounding like I'd ran a few miles.

Basically, when you have a ""file"" input in your form, you have access to a $_FILES variable which holds information about all ""file"" inputs. If you name your input ""document"", you'll have

    $_FILES[""document""][""tmp_name""] -&gt; the temporary file in the disk.
    $_FILES[""document""][""name""] -&gt; original filename

If your uploaded files will go into, say, ""/home/webdesignnoob/files/"", you do

    move_uploaded_file($_FILES[""document""][""tmp_name""], ""/home/webdesignnoob/files/"".$_FILES[""document""][""name""])

The only drawback is that you can't get the ad supported model since the ads are targeted at US users, so you have to pay full price ($109).  It's still a steal though, especially given the strength of the yen at the moment.

In fact, I've clarified that this is *not* what I mean. And that I don't believe that it's what Thuro meant either. What I've said, specifically, is that going to the protest is better than doing nothing.

I'd like that, too, and I'd prefer it if the signs all had specific actions named on them. But as we've discussed, that doesn't seem to be what this protest is about. As I've said, it seems to have no specific goal. Do you know of any bills that passing/not passing would satisfy the protesters? I haven't looked, I'll be honest, I just got dragged into this protest that day and I haven't been paying any attention to the news since school started. But I'm going to hazard a guess that the answer is no, that there's nothing within the system that will solve these problems.","1317428169"

I'm sure this will be buried and I'm not sure if your grandpa wants to answer this, as my grandpa fought in the Finnish military with the Germans and against the Soviet, but if by chance you happen to read this I'd love to hear everything he wants to tell about card games in that period.

In any case I wish you long years with your grandpa yet, there's a treasure trove of knowledge there and it's a shame if it dies with him.

E: Bonus story: My great-granduncle was a sergeant fighting with the German Jagers in the 1st world war when Kaiser Wilhelm himself came to inspect. The Kaiser noticed my ancestor's accent and asked ""Wo bist du aus?"" to which my great-granduncle proudly replied ""Ich bin aus Finnland, Herr Kaiser"".

Sure, they're ""just following orders"", but it seems I heard that argument somewhere before. 

They chose to join, knowing what this nation's leaders have been up to for decades. They chose to join, for whatever reasons, the fighting goons of bad guys. That makes them bad guys.

Not the kind of thing you see come up for sale very often but if I had one I would expect it to sell in in the $500-$800 range depending on condition. Epiphones and Gibsons of the same era go for a a lot more but harmonys tend to be cheaper.

The amp I'd never heard of but I did a search and it's a small single ended amp with an 8"" speaker, like a champ with odd tubes. Those little ones are pretty fun for playing around the house. I'd expect this is worth $150-$250. Replacement tubes will be harder than usual to get. Won't find them at the local store, you'll have to order them online. On the plus side you should be able to get nice vintage ones for dirt cheap because they're not in demand anymore. On the negative side these are like old tvs that run off the wall with no power transformer and are less safe than other amps. If you get it make sure to have a tech go through it before you use it.","1317428194"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Lol that reminds me of a dude I once met. He has worked hard his whole life and appreciates the value of money. He's a bit wealthy now but he has always stated he wants his children to understand the value of money. He's the kind of dude who likes to be funny, sarcastic, and sumbtch (in the funny way.)

So he hid some money inside a plastic bag, dug up a small hole, and hit it there very nicely, you couldn't even tell he did it. So one day as his kids naturally started to ask for money to go out I think it was, he said: ""I once hid some good money for you guys some time ago for any emergency; it should be in the backyard"", and added ""since I just know you'll try and get it now... I might as well mention you might need a shovel"". His kids considering their wealth started predicting on the amount of money he meant by ""good money"" and started digging up holes in his backyard (it wasn't so big), and you could tell where to dig (a fairly-sized portion with no grass). After almost an hour and a half, one of them yelled at everyone they had found a plastic bag. So he reached inside, and found... a dollar. One miserable dollar. That's when the father smiled and said, ""that's how hard you must work for money""; ""Now clean this up, and find me upstairs"". That dude is my fking hero, and I'm doing the same shit to my children, lol.","1317428195"

Ride the heck out of it and ride it in traffic to get your defensive reflexes working again and also to get your muscles to remember what it's like to
steer the bike down and steer it upright again.

If you're not a very physical type, do yourself a favor and work on your upper body strength.

Also, if you spend too much time looking at a computer screen or TV, exercise those eye muscles by focusing back and forth on far objects
and near objects.

I also do neck exercises to loosen my neck muscles so I can look back over my shoulder while wearing a full coverage helmet.

Exercising the neck muscles will also prevent cervical stenosis from
causing pains in your neck that shoot down your arms to your wrists.

Riding your pedal bike should also alert you to the need to align your hands with your forearms while riding to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and Guyon's canal syndrome.","1317428203"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Sure.

The article talks about storage in farads, which is basically the amount of excess charges something has.  This is a LOT different than the amount of potential energy it can hold, because that has to take into consideration the voltage of the charges.

Here's the basics for a capacitor...

Energy = .5 (Capacitance) * (Voltage)^2

The capacitance is in Farads.  You can see that the voltage term is squared, which makes it the dominant term.

The tricky part in capacitors is getting them to maintain a charge with a high voltage.  The higher the voltage the more likely the charges are to move around to ground.  They already make low voltage super capacitors, but they aren't terribly useful.

I'm not saying that the invention is crap, but the article itself doesn't touch on the voltage aspect.  Their discussion on wattage is based on the math from the capacitance, which is misleading.

The nice part about Lithium ion is that there is a reasonable voltage stored.


TL;DR - having a whole bunch of capacitance isn't all that useful for most applications if it's at a low voltage.","1317428212"

The bank manager and a rep pulled me into an office and the branch manager guy (or maybe shift supervisor?) actually said ""fuck these guys, let's call them on the phone ourselves"" so sitting right there in a bank manager's office with one of their reps, they actually called verizon on the phone (albeit on speaker because verizon said they can only talk to the customer) and basically it ended up being a bug on their site (after weeks of ongoing communication with verizon). 

I've never had a problem with Chase, and that day they went above and beyond my expectations of how banks operate. I went to Chase from BofA because their customer service sucks and because like OP, there was a glitch in their system and I ended paying fees for it - although they later paid me back for those fees, it was a fucking hassle and they were total dicks about it.","1317428216"

"japan","t5_2qh2u","I think the author is  using broad generalizations and a pretty weak data set to draw some exaggerated and inaccurate conclusions.

Sure the Japanese take a different approach to the Internet, but it's not necessarily worse.   Consumers here take privacy and security much more seriously.  For example, finding an unsecured or non-WPA2 residential wifi access point is rare.   Also, Japan's online banks require two-factor authentication -- which greatly helps prevents phishing.  It's a pretty obvious step that most US banks still haven't adopted.

I'm also impressed by the bandwidth and connection options available.  A local  ISP sells a 100MB/s connection for about the same as a 12MB/s Comcast link.    The throughput on my wimax phone is often over 12MB/s.  The US telecommunication last-mile is still suffering from lack of competition and under-investment.

The author assumes that America's strategy and approach to the Internet and technology is the best, however each country has experienced different advantages and negative consequences.","1317428231"

5th grade, I meet a dude in a school setting, he was shy meeting me at first. I said hello and he sputtered out a hey. From that day forward we have been best friends, there was not a day there didn't go by we didn't talk. We would some times spend hours on the phone while we both played video games. We grew up together, we were and still are very patriotic. Going camping and sleep overs. Some day he'll be my best man in my wedding. 

As we got older our lives turned a little different, I signed up for college, he chose the army. I may be a man, but I cried the day he left. But he was only gone a little while and he came back, only to leave again. It's almost been a year since I have seen him in person.

He. Will never be. Forgotten.

You may not have someone in your life as close as me and my friend are. But you better be damn sure you won't be forgotten. I have also heard, that once boot camp is over. You will have a shit ton of more family than you came in with.

Chin up, shoulders back.

Best regards,

One thing I've learned as I have grown up is that *everyone is winging it* each day.  There is no manual, no roadmap to life.  Every person is just trying his or her best, and regardless of what an individual's best is, sometimes equivalent effort by two people in different situations will result in failure for one and success for the other; however, remember that failure in one attempt, or many attempts at that, is only one point of data.  It is not the end-all-be-all, and you can always strive to succeed in order to recover from past failures.

The truth is that every person who is successful in life has, at many times, failed, and failed hard.  Even those who are spoonfed their success have hit heartbreaking failures.  But the difference between them and unsuccessful people is the will to rebound from any and every obstacle.  This is a quality I believe everyone has, even you.

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","&gt; They would feel a sense of shame or guilt if they didn’t live up to the code. The code tells them when they deserve public admiration or dishonor.

And taken to the extreme - when people disregard emotional display and empathy in favor of a deep sense of shame and honor for actions bound directly to social judgement, we have...Japan. 

&gt; If you want to make the world a better place, help people debate, understand, reform, revere and enact their codes. Accept that codes conflict.

Maybe it's just me, but I have a feeling this guy is talking about other people's codes conflicting and needing adjustment, not his own. 

Empathy has a place. It is a starting ground. It points you in a direction, by telling you ""This is how you would feel if you were writhing on the ground bleeding to death"", so perhaps you have some better understanding of what to do in such a situation. It is impossible to dictate a 'code' without empathy. The only rules you would set up are the ones that you have directly experienced. Otherwise, the author is suggesting that people blindly follow a set of rules without any thought on their part. 

Also, no one teaches empathy as a standalone end to a situation. Empathy is used to get children to think about what it means to treat others with respect, and then to do so. It just so happens that most children (and people) are assholes, so whether you bind them to a social code or teach them to empathize, it will not matter. A social code may prevent someone from publicly shaming themselves, but what about what they do in private?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; You can measure the RMR/BMR value through the respiratory quotient (or doubly labeled water), which correspond to the caloric value of the food (as shown in Food energy). The energy we get isn't dependent on stress or sleep (as long as it doesn't affect digestion). Once you properly digest the food you have that amount of energy in your body (in the form of glucose/amino acids/fats).

&gt; Hormones affect how that energy is distributed; store as fat, build new muscle/organs, used as fuel or any other of the ways we might need it. This is where stress/sleep/etc. comes in, as hormones are affected by those, but it doesn't affect the actual caloric value of food.

The energy that food contains isn't the energy that you get from it; indeed, that, to steal a phrase that skeptics love to use, *would* violate the laws of physics.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy

Relevant portion quoted below;

&gt; The conversion efficiency of energy from respiration into mechanical (physical) power depends on the type of food and on the type of physical energy usage (e.g. which muscles are used, whether the muscle is used aerobically or anaerobically). In general, the efficiency of muscles is rather low: only 18 to 26 percent of the energy available from respiration is converted into mechanical energy.[10] This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating ATP from food energy, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body. The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used (fast-twitch or slow-twitch). For an overall efficiency of 20 percent, one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to 4.3 kcal per hour. For example, a manufacturer of rowing equipment shows calories released from 'burning' food as four times the actual mechanical work, plus 300 kcal per hour,[11] which amounts to about 20 percent efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output. It can take up to 20 hours of little physical output (e.g. walking) to ""burn off"" 4000 kcal[12] more than a body would otherwise consume.

Back to you;

&gt; Carbs (glucose) isn't a drag on your metabolism, it's a very efficient fuel. The problem comes when you over consume refined carbs/sugars and get massive swings in blood glucose and insulin as a regular part of your life.

I don't tell people not to have cake on their birthday. The problem is a regular diet full of carbs, especially, yes, sugars and refined starches.","1317428267"

When millions of potential dollars are on the line, they're willing to pay a few hundred thousand for someone else to guarantee, or they'll have to pay up. That's why open software hasn't caught on in the business world. Companies like IBM want full control of their software to make money and make high stakes contracts, and they back it up with profit earned.



Edit: Here's an example. You want a computer that works 24/7 no matter what, because it has free cell on it, and people will pay you $500 an hour so they can play your version of free cell.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Because most people believe that, in order to ensure that sex isn't coerced, it needs to take place between two people who are more or less of equal standing. That's why sex between doctors and patients, lawyers and clients, bosses and employees, adults and children, etc., are frowned upon: there is an unequal power balance, so it's impossible to know whether one party is using undue influence in convincing the other party to have sex. The general consensus is that 15-year-olds lack the life experience and emotional maturity to give meaningful consent.

Also, arguing from the standpoint of evolution isn't doing much for your argument. Humans evolved into their current forms thousands of years ago, back when we were barely into the hunter/gatherer stage of societal development. We no longer live under the same circumstances, so using evolution to argue about what is ""natural"" and ""normal"" can be used to justify any number of things that civilized people long ago gave up. For example, you could use exactly your same argument to state that murder is acceptable, because humans are evolutionarily designed to kill each other. The fact that we don't accept killing other human beings as socially desirable, even though it has strong evolutionary roots, is not disregarding simple logic.","1317428274"

If the gun is still relatively new, you may need to buy a non-marring hammer to aid in taking out the bolt pin and removing the receiver/barrel assembly from the polymer frame.  It's a bitch to take apart and reassemble, but once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad, just a little more daunting than your typical auto pistols.","1317428275"

As others have pointed out, Hush is a great start. Not just because it's a good episode, but because the lack of dialog means that it requires very little context to understand. You can basically brief someone with, ""She's the vampire slayer, these are her friends, the blond guy is a vampire who's still sort of an enemy, but neutered for the moment and under their care. The military organization is supposed to be unexplained at this point, so you haven't missed anything there.""

Lie to Me makes a great second episode. It's early enough on that every line isn't yet fraught with backstory, it shows them more of who Spike actually is, and it's heavy on the moral ambiguity. And it makes fun of vampire groupies, which can help offset anyone who's leery of watching the show for fear of being lumped in with Twilight fans.

Faith, Hope, and Trick is fun, and again stands well without context. The only context/spoiler involved is that it does disclose that Buffy killed Angel at the end of the previous season.

"science","t5_mouw","I have moderate anxiety issues and I've tried a number of psychedelics. Honestly, weed tends to cause me more anxiety than other things I've tried. One of my friends who gets so anxious from weed he once had to be taken to the ER for a panic attack handled psychedelics just fine. I would highly advise against mixing weed with other things though, at least at first, despite what you'll hear from a lot of ""heads."" The most important thing is ""set and setting;"" the one time I had a really bad trip was when I stupidly decided to trip alone. More often than not psychedelics erase any trace of anxiety or depression and fill me with infinite optimism, hope, and love. Personally I think they helped me but didn't cure me - I still have issues from time to time. As Huxley said, ""To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours the outer and inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and unconditionally, by Mind at Large — this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.""  

Changes in heart rate are pretty common but nothing to worry about. Obsessing over something that like is a pretty easy way to send yourself into a bad trip though. It's important to understand and remind yourself that drugs like shrooms, LSD, and mescaline are some of the safest drugs out there, illicit or not, and that you WILL feel normal again in a few hours.

A beer buzz can be an OK thing to take the edge off while you are waiting to blast off but I don't recommend getting drunk.","1317428298"

I think I like the Win7 better than the iPhone but it isn't even close to my android. I hate how locked down the phone is. I can really do WHATEVER i want with my android, change the keyboard, ect. Don't get me wrong the Win7 phone is nice but its just not quite as friendly as the android. I love that the android anticipates what you want and then tries to help. For example, open up the navigation with the gps turned off and android is like ""hey, your gps is off buddy, how bout I take you directly to the setting to turn it on"", it does the same with other settings as well. My android phone just seems to want to help. My windows phone is just all bling no substance.

Another thing is movement and awareness. Smart movement in Battlefield is key, don't EVER rush through the middle of a map to try and take an objective. Always work your way around the flanks. Also, knowing what's around you helps. Know when to run and when to stay and fight. If you see three guys, don't start shooting at them if you're fairly exposed. As exciting as it is, chances are you'll end up dying.

Lastly, STICK TO ONE GUN!!!!!! Can't stress this enough. Since I started using the M416 exclusively my K/D has gone up by .5 Using one gun will cause you to become used to it, so much so that you'll be able to subconsciously handle recoil and aim for the head without thinking about it.

I admit I do not know everything and NEVER will! But. . IT CLEARLY states CBNs and CBDs are higher when trichs are amber or opaque causing a more narcotic high.

For example the prefix ""ur-"" or words like ""leiwand"" are a total no-go.

The reason is that there's a bit of a split between Vorarlberg/Tyrol on one side and the rest of Austria on the other that's due to the geography. Vienna is kind of far away (you more or less have to drive through Germany to get there). But Munich and Zurich are near, and this matters, not least in the fact that the language is quite different.

Publishing the paper is making it public. At least with the media release, CERN gets to translate their paper to the press instead of relying on shitty science journalists' interpretation. The fact that even *that* failed shows just how atrocious the media is today.

Also, the results published in the paper *are* facts. They are the facts of the observations. CERN has chosen not to publish an interpretation of those facts, but that isn't uncommon at all. There's nothing at all unusual about the paper except it's relationship to Relativity and the unusual extent to which CERN went to try to find an error in their observations before they published. The paper is just properly done peer-review.

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","I just got out of BMT. I threw away everything I bought except my bag of toiletries and phone, wallet, ipod. DO NOT DO THIS! You put your civilian luggage in a closet for the duration of BMT so make sure you bring enough. I walked around for 3 days in the same clothes with a mullet before we got ABU's and a haircut. 

There were a few items you can bring to help yourself. I tell everyone to make sure they get WHITE toothpaste and shampoo. You're going to have to put a WHITE towel down to display all your items and if they leak, you wont have stains. Most people used just shaving cream instead of gel because the gel leaks and it's hard to find it in white. 

I recommend a good pair of scissors. Check cosmetics in walmart for a pair of inch and a half scissors. They are 5 bucks but cut like no other and the 2 scissors at BMT that you can buy cost just as much but are nowhere near the quality. $5 investment well worth it.

Everyone doesnt NEED the same stuff. The TI will walk around the isles and place items on the floor for what you need. If you have the white items then all you will end up buying there is a lent roller and some Hoo-Ahhs (certain brand of baby wipes that leave no residue) to wipe stuff down with.

I personally recommend ensoles for your boots. The boot store in the mini mall sells these for a few bucks more, but your knees will love you.

That's all I can think of. Heres just a few more tips:
LEARN YOUR REPORTING STATEMENT
the chain of command will be given to you and learn it asap as well.
Get a haircut before you leave to help yourself out a little bit.
Dont call a female SIR.

As a male professional, I weigh a slight amount (totally able to support myself in a quality lifestyle) and have been in the position of dating someone with significantly more weight (one with weight twice mine and another with egregious obesity, thus barely able to move.)

While it seems like I'm a fucking tool at the outset, being in great weight disparity can be painful to a relationship. Primarily because I believe it is important that each individual go through a period of time during which he/she can run a 5k - it helps us prioritize and balance aspects of our lives in a manner that simply does not happen when under the influence of a relationship.

However, having realistic expectations of a potential s/o is important. Would I ever be with someone who lived in a style vastly opposed to mine: unlikely. Do I have a great, trusting relationship with someone who approaches weight the same way I do (eat a good amount, periodic fasting, splurge occasionally): yes.

The raw number is meaningful, even indicative of an individual's success and aspirations within her career, but how she eats and exercises is larger to the foundation of the relationship.

I mean they had seen the Crimean War or the US Civil War. Of course the Franco-Prussian War was a counter example. But they had seen how the nature of war shifted. The Germans plan was very complex and relied on a quick offensive. Therefore they couldn't afford any doubt.

But the initial trigger came from Austria. Austria-Hungary had to appear strong. They were eaten by inner conflicts. They thought that they'd fell apart if they'd show any weakness to Serbia. The Russians had a similar dilemma. After they lost the war against Japan in 1905 the peasants they had so badly treated started to demand changes. So they were fully committed to help Serbia and mobilised their troops. That of course triggered the German Schliefenplan. Sure if the Germans had said ""no"" to Austria history might have been different. But I doubt it. Europe was changing. Nationalism and socialism/communism was on the rise. The time of multi-nation states was over. Maybe arrogance was the reason that those conflicts got pushed all over Europe. But the French wanted revenge for 1871 sooner or later and the UK was afraid of German influence in the Middle East (e.g., Bagdad-Railway).","1317428382"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","First question, no.  I think people say this because it sounds sort of fair on the outset, but in the end I don't think it is.  Each person was 50% responsible for the pregnancy and even though women may have more decision making power, that's just something we have to deal with due to biological differences.  It isn't as if men weren't aware that the woman they were having sex with could get pregnant and that they may decide on having a child.  It bothers me because if a woman really wants the baby but knows she can count on no financial support, she may be ""forced"" into an abortion which is a terrible thing.  If she has the baby but has a low income, it's the child that loses out if the man has opted-out of child support.  If a woman decides on raising the baby, I think she (and the baby) deserve financial support.  I think it makes sense that each parent should pay for the child's upbringing since they were both responsible for the pregnancy (which could be either parent depending on custody arrangements and income).  

Second question, definitely not.  This one I think is more clear cut.  A woman should have full bodily autonomy and there's no way I want to live in a world where a man can decide if I get an abortion or not.  It's her body and her decision.  I know you did not ask, but in the same vein, I also don't believe a man should be able to say a woman cannot get an abortion.   Another wrinkle in this scenario is that paternity is not always known and it can be dangerous to test in utero, so it seems like in either scenario, it would be difficult to determine who the father was for sure and thus, they couldn't have control over these decisions anyway.  

ETA: I didn't see that last question, I think men have a moral right to know.  I think women should absolutely let their partner know that they are pregnant, but I still don't think it should be a legal right.  In addition to being hard to prove and another step in getting an abortion, I think it isn't right to require this as I'm sure in some abusive situations having the tell the ""father"" could be dangerous.","1317428386"

A couple of things:

&gt; to dismiss these would require an even bigger conspiracy theory than the holocaust, one that is worldwide and has lasted for over 50 years.

I disagree. You could argue (if you were that way inclined) that both are large-scale conspiracy theories; the amount of 'conspiracy' required to convince the world of the holocaust would be much larger than the moon landing, in my view.

In your posing of the proof of the Earth's roundness, I could make up anecdotal evidence to 'rebut' most of the arguments. This simply means I have misunderstood or am refusing to listen to reason, as some people have with the holocaust.

I meant any and all interpretations of evolution. I don't know what you mean by 
&gt; Darwin asserting that evolution is how everything got here.

You say you'd be willing to accept challenges on evolution; if someone on an internet forum said ""watch this video, it explains why it's wrong"" and you know no serious scientist supported it, would you bother to watch it, other than for humour's sake?

"movies","t5_2qh3s","You were using the word ""professional"" to mean something other than ""person who regularly performs a job for payment"". I was disagreeing with that usage in that context because, although it is possible for the word ""professional"" to have a slightly different meaning (i.e., someone who performs their profession at a high level of competence), your comment seemed to assert that that interpretation of the word was the only correct one, which is kind of silly.

I probably wouldn't have even corrected you if you said ""Doing something as a profession doesn't necessarily mean you'll do it professionally"", because then you would be contrasting the *noun* ""profession"" with the *adjective* ""professional"", which highlights the subtle difference between the two concepts. I think that's what you were attempting to do in the first place, but it didn't really work out as well as it should have, because you compared ""profession"" to the noun form of ""professional"", and those two words largely have the same meaning. In fact, they basically define each other. In my opinion, they're too close in meaning to effectively create the contrast you were attempting. Thus, I made a comment asserting the similarity in definition between the two words you were using and then restated your opinion without the wordplay, making it much clearer.

Then, since you didn't appear to understand the intention of my comment, I decided to explain it in as much excruciating detail as possible :P","1317428396"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hi,

My story is quite long, but relevant.  So I hope  
I'm in NPO (rare disorder foundation) and I recently had a talk with my CEO as well.  I mentioned how Senior Staff's salary is unjustifiable and how there is poor management of the day to day operations.  However this guy is also my friend so our conversations are more candid and understanding.  We had our talk over beer.   We both also suffer from the same rare disorder, making our perspective and purpose for working at the NPO different than the non affected co workers.  
Sorry this is lagging..From what he told me, this is how it's brokendown. 

There is a certain ""culture"" inside my organisation.  This ""culture"" has existed for a number of years, and the workers have adapted to it.  It's almost like they don't know any better because it's been the only way they've been doing it.  Skating by just enough to float.  We also have ""lifers"" people there for over 15+ years.  The uppper management doesn't give a shit about the people we serve, and so there's a huge disconnect.

Salary:  This one is big, and obviously personal.  I looked up on Guidestar.org what we netted last year.   This site is amazing since it lists top salaries of the org, tax statements, you name it.  Our org raked in 9 mill in 2009.  The CEO made 300k, and the top Development President came in at 200k.  Fuckin amazing for a non profit.  
I then looked up the Leukemia Foundation.  Now granted Leukemia easily 20x bigger of a org.  This is their #'s, 2009 brought them 300 mill.  CEO made 400k, top VP was at 200k.  
I would bring this up to your Board of Directors, they might already know this.  Explain your story to them, especially during this economic crises and execs are killing it.  

Bottom line is that your CEO is prob well aware of what you tried to discuss.  However, the Big Fish don't want to change and are perfectly content with how the org is run.  There's a good amount of drama in NPO.  Not sure if your scenario is applicable to mine, but my point is, it's really no use trying to bomb the head or the org.  Save yourself the drama, and BS.

Everyone good still plays 1.6, source was the dumbed down mainstream version which midlevel players switched to so they could be the ""best"". It's still *way* ahead of call of duty, don't get me wrong, but it still pretty much sucks. Hopefully the new CS will bring back the old competitive glory - unfortunately I doubt that as, outside of minor fixes, valve has never really done anything to *improve* on the original game. They tried the whole CZ thing which was a joke. They tried adding nonsense like shields (2 of the new weapons were nice but I'm guessing that was more of an accident than anything). Then they basically ruined the community and stopped esports progress by releasing source. 

Do they even understand what made CS so good? I'm not convinced. I love valve to death, I like steam, I *love* all their single player games, but in terms of multiplayer they seem more suited for casual-compettive games like TF2 or CS:S - which is a great HUGE market in it's own right. CS was a mod not made by valve which stubled into some amazing gameplay mechanics which put it on a level above everything else - valve only seems to understand about half of those mechanics.

After that you can probably move up to real turntables, though for those you might want to use Serato Scratch live instead of Virtual DJ since you actually have to do some work. If you want to make the music from scratch check out Fruity Loops. I DJ myself, casually, usually for small parties, dances, etc. It's really fun once you get into it!

"WTF","t5_2qh61","OK, I will try to condense everyone's issues into one post.

1) Cars, buses, and bicycles do not all do the same thing. The reasons people drive cars include privacy, air conditioning, a comfortable seat, etc., or because they aren't going to the same place as 59 other people, or because public transportation simply isn't convenient where they live, or any number of other concerns. Bicycles are especially the odd man out in this diagram, because unlike cars or buses they are virtually useless for any journey of more than a few kilometers.

2) Some aspects of this image are misleading. It assumes the minimum possible density for cars (1 per vehicle), but assumes the maximum possible density for buses (60 per vehicle). We are obviously supposed to assume that buses are more space-efficient than cars, but we cannot know this without also knowing what is the *average* density of cars and buses. The angle of the first photo is also different from the angle of the other two, which further misleads the viewer.

3) Space is not the only important thing, which appears to be the main point of this graphic. All three vehicles travel at different speeds. Person-meters per second, i.e. how many people move how far in what amount of time, determines transportation efficiency. And that leaves aside other issues. For example people might ride bicycles for the health benefits, or they might be willing to sacrifice efficiency to ride in a car. Since health and comfort are things people pursue, they must be considered when measuring the social efficiency of transportation. After all, a bus that no one is willing to ride has 0% efficiency.","1317428454"

But some of the stuff from both DC and Marvel at the time wasn't really any better (DC vs. Marvel being a good example).  
  
I think Image made a serious impact, and had an important role in making comicbooks what they are today, where we see a lot more smaller publishers. But I agree, changes were likely going to happen anyway.  
  
I loved Spawn back when I was in my early teens. I was far too cool for X-Men, JLA and all those colorful characters. I have no clue how it is today either (stopped reading at around #50). Are they still making Spawn? I guess my title is a bit misleading, because for all I know, Spawn may have been updated to be as relevant as ever.

It's not surprising that there's pockets of support for creationism. I do have a problem with how misleading a couple of the quoted signs are, although in any protest there's always a few absurd viewpoints.

&gt;“Keep Church &amp; State Separate” and “Can I Teach Evolution in Your Church?”

The museum, which is a rather nondescript building from the outside, is not funded by any government. It's run by a non-profit, Life and Light Foundation. The second sign is even sillier. They are perfectly within their rights to teach whatever they want in a space that they own and operate.

I'm not sure what the point is of protesting a private institute. They already have a persecuted martyr complex, dismissing us heathens as beyond saving. If you look at the [website](http://www.lifeandlightfoundation.org/museum.html), they say that they're forbidden from saving gentiles because the wrath of God is upon them.

I'm all for keeping creationism out of schools and such, but I think this is beyond the boundaries of tolerance. ","1317428501"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","You've sorta got it. Your first year or two are usually more ""general education"" oriented, like you said a semi-highschool curriculem (but more advanced), and they get more specific to your major as you progress. A lot of schools don't even make you commit to a major until after your first year.

There are also community and technical colleges where you can get your Associates degree which is mostly those general ed requirements. A lot of people go to a 2 year school right out of high school as a stepping stone to getting a Bachelors or above at a 4 year establishment. 

Of course if you get your Masters or a PhD you're going to be there quite a bit longer than 4 years, and you can spend the entire time at one single school if they have the classes and programs you want.

I felt like Guillermo Del Toro mixed the first Hell Boy and Pan's worlds together and it just completely pulled me away from the story.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","most memorable moment so far was my first full game running recon with the ump,  my countersniping class i'll call it.  i was a defender for this match.

i used the extra ammo choice, and dropped a mobile beacon right in front of mcom b (so behind the rock for the attackers). it was dropped before the attackers reached that area, and once it was set up i started stomping on the snipers that were slowly crawling up the path by the pond, reloading both guns and going back over to the other side of the people sniping behind the rocks on mcom's a side.  whenever i'd get gunned down i would spawn on my beacon and flank the snipers again.   i defused a few mcom b's because of how close my beacon was,  my score really didn't matter because i was laughing with all the fun i was having, but it was around 24-8 or something like that.  2 defuses too.


the first night i played i tried my luck at sniping as a defender and somehow got behind the attackers in the 2nd part of metro, i cleared everyone running down the leftist side of the map and was immediately called a hacker.

unfortunately this is my first fps game on a PC since bf2,  and i didn't learn how to type in chat until the 3rd day of beta.  rush is fun for leveling it seems,  conquest will be awesome for the true battlefield experience.  i only played conquest in my days of bf2.  

and taking an rpg to the face the first time at the end of metro as an attacker was very entertaining to say the least.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Seems like some pretty arbitrary definitions of winning and losing because you're ignoring that you can lose in those RPGs.

You fight a boss, they kill you, you lose and the game asks if you want to play again.

You play a game of chess, they beat you, you lose and the player asks if you want to play again.

So if you play chess on the computer can you lose?

If you are talking about scores then do something like speedruns in any of those games. 



It seems like you are talking, very strictly, about player vs player and that those are the only games that can have winning and losing.

So whatever, if you don't think there's any losing because you get to try again then that's fine but RPGs (and every other single player game) have been that same way forever and will continue to be.

If you don't like it then give a proof of concept of a game with losing and only one player and maybe something will come of it.

Also you said

&gt;I think that being able to actually lose REQUIRES that you're also able to win, and vice versa. Both outcomes are the result of some kind of contest. If there's no contest, you can't really win or lose.

So according to you there can't be winning without losing. Yet here you're saying that you can win at these games but you can't lose

While I was at basic and for the first month of A school, I was still paid housing based on where my husband was living, which was some much needed $$ to help him with bills. Depending on where he gets stationed, if families are allowed to live there, the military will pay for you and all your household goods to move, or let you do it yourself and reimburse you. You will also have health insurance and a very inexpensive dental insurance to boot. 

As a girlfriend or fiancee, he/you will get none of this. If you take it upon yourself to move everything out to wherever he is (paying for it yourself) he would not get to live with you.

"law","t5_2qh9k","&gt;You know what, I wasn't trained in Constitutional law, so I don't know why a trial in absentia wasn't the proper thing to do.

Because the president says it's so and people like you are willing to kowtow to his authority. 

&gt;As much as you seem to want to believe it, al-Awlaki was not simply an American citizen by birth. He was also a citizen of Yemen who was a leader or regional commander for al-Qaeda. 

I don't think you understand how citizenship works. You are a citizen of a country unless and until you rebuke that citizenship in favor of another. You can't strip someone of their citizenship because they went to live in another country and said things you didn't like or that threatened your country. 

&gt; He was so effective that many, many people died thanks to him and not just Americans, and many, many more would have died because of him except for extraordinary heroics of average folks and professionalism by cops. That all makes al-Awlaki a leading enemy of the US. I wish we didn't cause enemies like him to exist, but we did.

Freedom involves risk. If freedom isn't your end goal, but security, you're right on base. The state should absolutely do everything within its power to keep you safe, even at the cost of the rights of its citizens. If on the other hand you seek freedom, then you can't just tear up the Constitution when it is convenient because you think it will save some lives. The Constitution was created with the explicit purpose of making it hard to destroy or ignore, even when it is really convenient to do so, because we think that undertaking some risk through forcing the government to not act or to act within these confines will produce a better country and a better life for all Americans in the end. You evidently do not believe this to be true. 

For the record, if it was up to me, I would strip your citizenship. You obviously don't adhere to the principles that America stands for, and you thus should have none of those protections that the Constitution offers. I'm sure you would balk at this, but it's only a short jump from denying someone their rights for promoting terror and stripping someone of their rights for promoting the destruction of what America stands for. Enjoy your hellfire missile. 

&gt;Try al-Awlaki in absentia? You haven't yet demonstrated that he had legal standing to claim constitutional rights given the full extent of his citizenship and activities.



&gt;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

There you go. Satisfied? I doubt it, since you don't seem to believe that the Constitution should have any force. ","1317428551"

If there is a pump designated your dwarves will build the one above it, even if construction of the lower pump is paused, as if the designated pump is complete.  If you forbid, then unforbid a sigle block that is needed for a pump low in the stack however, your dwarves will remove the designation and all completed pumps above it will deconstruct.

I have still successfully completed pump stacks 120+ zlevels high by designating the construction of every pump at once via macros but small mistakes can make it pretty frustrating.

As long as you have sand, just cut logs and make as much charcoal as you need for glass screws and pipes, then make blocks out of whatever magma safe stone you have avaliable.  Once the stack is mined out, make sure every dwarf has architecture and stone working enabled and they will build the stack pretty quickly.","1317428552"

However, using it in the way you describe doesn't really make any sense.  1/4 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/16 &lt; 1.  if the 1/3 note starts on beat two, then it lasts for all of beat two and 1/3 of beat 3. the next quarter note would last until 1/3 of the way through beat 4...  there's still two thirds of a beat left and you have is a 1/16th note there.  

Even if it did all add up.  Using a triplet in this way - only using one of them and then having other notes after it which are all offset by a non-standard amount would be very difficult to read and unlikely to be performed correctly.

This is not ment to bash The Ottawa Senators or its loyal fans

Im simply using Ottawa as an example of how even a Canadian teams attendance can be wonderful and then a few years later become a serious problem

Here is an [article](http://forum.canucks.com/topic/259233-ottawa-senators-attendance-decline/) on how poor their attendance was early on in the 09/10 and how they gave away tickets to hide the horrible #s

In the 08/09 season they averaged giving away 895 tickets per game

In the 09/10 season they gave away 3,047 per game.  


Only two other teams gave away more tickets each home game, and one of these teams is now called the Jets!

I Honestly cant find hard data on last years #s but lets be honest, the invisible elephant in the room is the fact that the attendance wasn't great.

Dose anyone truly think this years team will cause an upswing in the trend?


The Jets tickets went in a flash, fans are crazy and they should be.

They deserve a team and I'm happy to see them back. 

[Just remember](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators) Ottawa fans bought 11,000 season ticket pledges 3 years before the team actually played a game!!

Did you play Doom when you were that age? Wolfenstein? UT? Quake? There will always be fun, violent games played by children (as well as movies and music) and it is very hard to draw a line between violent and non-violent games. Even Sims can be considered a violent game (come on, your house can burn down with your sims still in it).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree that more cohesion would help this movement.  There are certainly concrete problems in our government and there is a coalition currently working on articulating the exact goals/objectives of this movement.  Here is the current list of issues being protested. 

http://october2011.org/issues 

1. Corporatism– firmly establish that money is not speech, corporations are not people, only people have Constitutional rights, end corporate influence over the political process, protect people and the environment from damage by corporations.
2. Wars and Militarism – end wars and occupations, end private for-profit military contractors, reduce the national security state and end the weapons export industry. War crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against peace must be addressed and those responsible held accountable under international law. 
3. Human Rights – end exploitation of people in the US and abroad, end discrimination in all forms, equal civil rights and due process for all people.
4. Worker Rights and jobs – all working-age people have the right to safe, just, non-discriminatory and dignified working conditions, a sustainable living wage, paid leave and economic protection.
5. Government – all processes of the three branches of government should be accountable to international law, transparent and follow the rule of law, people have the right to participate in decisions which affect them.
6. Elections – all citizens 18 and older have the right to vote without barriers, all candidates have the right to be heard and to run and all votes should be counted.
7. Criminal justice and prisons –end private for-profit prisons, adopt evidence-based drug policy, prisoners have the right to humane and just conditions with a focus on rehabilitation and reintegration into society, abolish the death penalty.
8. Healthcare – create a national, universal and publicly financed comprehensive health system.
9. Education – all people have the right to a high quality, publicly-funded and broad education from pre-school through vocational training or university.
10. Housing – all people have the right to affordable and safe housing.
11. Environment – adopt policies which effectively create a carbon-free and radio-active free energy economy.
12. Finance and the economy – end policies which foster a wealth divide and move to a localized and democratic financial system, reform taxes so that they are progressive and provide goods, monetary gain and services for the people.
13. Media – airwaves and the internet are public goods, require that media be honest, accurate and accountable to the people.
14. Food and water – create systems that protect the land and water, create local and sustainable food networks and practices.
15. Transportation – provide affordable, clean and convenient public transportation and safe spaces for pedestrian and non-automobile travel.

There are many organizations that are in support of this movement, http://october2011.org/organizations here is a link.


Here is some good information about the Occupy Wall St movement.  

http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/occupywallstreet.html

We are tired of politicians being bought and lobbied by corporate America.  

Eisenhower warned, (and the machine has evolved since his farewell address,)  “In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.

     ""We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.”

"gifs","t5_2qt55","Ahh, well obviously, but I think it comes down to a monetary issue. All hypothetical and drawn out of my ass but lets just say on average their are 10-15 'kicks' pergame that are designed to go into the crowd (not including balls that get lost to punts/wild throws). Now, at the NFLshop.com the Official balls are 90$ (lets assume that the NFL only has to pay 40$ per ball). 

Using only 10 kicks a game, that's; 10 x 40 = 400, 400 x 16 = 6400, 6400 x 16 = 102400

Approximately 100,000$ a year just so fans can catch a ball, and remember that's not taking into a count any other way a ball can be lost.

Annnd yes, if you get injured when your trying to *catch* a ball, then you are an idiot. Remember, during the extra points or fieldgoals people are probably getting food or going to the bathroom, not necessarily paying attention to the game. Also remember that football is a game sometimes played outdoors, sometimes theirs heavy rain/snow, not always the easiest weather to catch a ball in.

Oh, and legally theirs probably a reason why the NFL has to put up nets when the players are running a play **designed** to kick the ball directly at the crowd from a close distance. **edit**: Just like how the MLB has to have a cage behind the catcher, the pitcher is  *purposely* throwing in the direction of the crowd, the fouls/homers are not done at close range / intentional.","1317428598"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","In the provinces people are normally cooking with charcoal. It is fairly cheap, around 15p (35 cents USD) for 5 kilos. Some places are more than that, some places less. Grilling food is quite a bit different here than in the US, though. Grills rarely have lids unless you buy an American-style one and the grill is much closer to the charcoal so the food cooks quicker (still not exactly that quick). And for rice, people are either using a rice-cooker or cooking ontop of the charcoal.

Around Manila, cooking with charcoal seemed extremely rare (most likely due to their faster lifestyle). They mostly use stove tops powered by either gas or electric.

Gas lines don't run through the house, so if you are going to use a gas stove, you have to have a propane tank inside your house hooked up to it.

Most houses don't even have a place for an oven. They simply have all countertop space in the kitchen and you place the stove ontop of the counter.

[This](http://www.krisallendaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gas-stove.jpg) is what I'm talking about.

EDIT: I'd add that the common ""barbecue"" in the Philippines includes fish, pork (chopped up in little squares and shoved on a stick), chicken inasal (fucking delicious shit), and chicken intestine (which is delicious if you don't think about it). But really, anything is cooked on it. Those are just what people normally think of when they mention ""barbecue"", otherwise it is just food even though it is cooked the exact same way, basically. No idea why.

EDIT 2: People here are just as ignorant about American life-style. Whenever I mention that I can drink tap water people are completely amazed. Drinkable tap water, hot water heaters in every home, houses with gas lines, the huge distances in the midwest between cities.... lots of things.","1317428618"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","The second any article mentions the bechdel it's awful, because the bechdel test is inheritely awful.

This is my comment on the bechdel test.

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kq8a2/found_this_awesome_feminist_channel_on_youtube/c2mbbll

My argument is that sexism isn't binary, it's situation. 

A husband tells his wife not to work, would be sexist but adding to the fact

A husband tells his ill wife not to work,

A husband who is a doctor tells his ill wife not to go to work as in his professional opinion she'll most likely get worse.

If you use a bechdel test to support any opinion your opinion and the facts behind it aren't strong enough so you bring in some nonsense test which it is, because it uses mainly violent films which due to the nature on conflict which is monosexual, and men are more violent etc. Heck you could do an equally good job proving films are sexist towards men by using the bechdel test stating how many viokent films etc with males as the more violent.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","1.) No, because legal/fiscal responsibilities are about the child, not about the mother. The *mother* chooses to have the child, but it's the child that suffers if the mother can't afford it. Ideally (IMO) the government could step in to fill this position, but something like that is far off into the future. So no, I don't think that they should be- but nor do I support the often corrupt child support laws that exist out there. The father should never be forced to pay so much money that he has problems paying other bills, for example.

2.) No. It's the woman's body, it's her choice.

3.) I'd like the men to have a right to know, but it's impossible to implement it because there are situations where them knowing could put that woman in danger. What if there's an abusive relationship going on? How could we differentiate between women that actually  *don't* know who the father is, and women that choose to lie?

edit- I'd like to agree with hintlime9- I think that men have a moral right to know, but it would be impossible to implement a legal one.

Honestly, at the end of the day- *none of this is fair.* I see people go on and on about how it's not fair that they should have to pay child support on babies they don't want, how women shouldn't be allowed to have abortions if the dads don't want it, etc. I agree- *none of that is fair.* But until we invent electronic uteruses it's going to remain unfair. It's unfair to the dad to have to pay child support for a kid he doesn't want, and it's unfair for the kid to go without. It's unfair for a woman to have an abortion when the dad wants the child, and it's unfair to force her to carry a fetus to term that she doesn't want in her body. The list goes on. This is simply a situation where things are unfair, and there's not much to do about it, except for perfect male birth control and use birth control as effectively as possible.","1317428624"

It is to an extent about Walt, but it appears to be just as much about Gus. Jesse is in a very strong position within Gus' organisation at this point. Considering his alliance with Mike, it is not at all unreasonable to suggest that he may adopt a leadership role. Again, it is not clear that this will mean his taking over of Gus' empire, but certainly that he will run a mini-empire of his own.

"orlando","t5_2qh7s","Congratulations! My wife and I got married VERY cheaply just three weeks ago. We did it on the corner where we first met, on Church &amp; Orange, downtown, right in the median. It was a Saturday morning, so there wasn't much traffic. We invited a bunch of our friends and told them all to bring cameras. We had mimosas and pancakes at our house beforehand. It was a paper-themed wedding (since we'd be signing wedding papers), so everything was made out of paper: the dress, my tie (fastened with a paperclip!), the bouquet... even the rings. 
  
With the theme, our friends and tons of personal touches, it was a *fantastic* wedding. Very memorable, very personal, and very fun. The whole thing took less than a week to plan. The total price tag ended up being less than $200, most of it for the mimosas and pancakes for 15 people. The venue (out in public) was free, it was officiated by a friend (free), and since everyone brought cameras, we ended up with hundreds and hundreds of fantastic pictures... all free: [check it out](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150377508697784.413151.616182783&amp;l=6b2dcc3036&amp;type=1)!

I've heard a lot of complaints about replicas from the Official NHL shop (shit numbers and shoulder patches apparently), so if the NHL wants shit like that to stop, they need to get a grip on things. It's blatantly obvious what the problems are. Too expensive, and the ""cheaper"" option is sub par quality.

I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm trying to give you perspective, I don't think anyone really thinks you're an anti-semite. I'm not going to look through your blog for evidence of an accusation I didn't make.

I've attempted to communicate with you that I am not attacking you, don't think you're an anti-semite, etc a few times, you're too defensive bro.

I have read a few articles on your blog. Without citing specific posts, I will state that - in my opinon - you do cherrypick offensive comments which are easily argued against (which may or may not be the actual beliefs or opinions of the posters who make them) and use them as an example of what MR redditors' opinions and beliefs are. 

I have no issue with people being critical of /mr or with people calling out bigotry but when you attempt to frame that bigotry as the only argument that your opposition has I think it's deceitful.

Having spent a little time sort of 'in the thick of it' and wallowing among us do you still hold the opinion that MRAs as a whole are a laughable bunch of misogynists with no agenda other than defending their male privilege, hating women, and being rape apologists?

Who said this was the main focus of what they were doing?  From the original article:

&gt;To be fair, the police have clearly stepped up their presence in the South Slope, Greenwood Heights and Sunset Park area in recent weeks.  This week, police cars with their lights flashing were stationed at nearly every other block on Fourth Avenue outside of the Prospect Avenue subway station.

&gt;Sketches of potential suspects are posted at local businesses, and on a recent day Jay ""Rocket"" Ruiz handed out Police Department ""wanted"" alerts for three men accused of attempted rape

As for this...

&gt;(which, btw, have been disproven time and time again in study after study) that a womans dress has any correlation to the likelihood that she will be raped.

That may be true in general, however in this specific case:

&gt;""Officers are not telling women what not to wear—there's a TV series that does that,"" quipped Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne in an email. ""They are simply pointing out that **as part of the pattern involving one or more men that the assailant(s) have targeted women wearing skirts.""**

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Much as I dislike the man I can't say that I disagree with him on this; although a lot more would still have to be done outside of schools if he really wants to create a nation with actual second language abilities.

At the very least using the language outside of school in the same situations as English is naturally used would be necessary for children to gain actual ability and motivation to learn. More realistically our whole nation's mentality would have the change; children aren't going to learn well unless their parents care about them learning and every subject already has problems with this - let alone ones having to face our island mentality and postempire egos.

I think that a start to solving these problems could be to have TV channels dedicated to specific languages? Although hell'd freeze over before the Tories funded it something like having BBC German and BBC French low down in the freeview channels could make a huge difference.

Not wrong, but it does present a problem if people are getting hurt by it. If you place your pictures in a not-so-secure or private area of the net, you are basically putting your pictures in a big bin in the middle of a busy street and then getting upset when people go through and find it. Most people dont realise that once they place something on the net, unless it is a secure and private area, its not stealing or invasion of privacy if someone can find it. Its not like you are putting the picture up in your home. If someone outside those you select is able to view a picture of you, then the problem is with you and your use of the internet.

Another thing, why does people lusting over the picture become wrong simply because the owner of the picture is offended by it? What if people were praising and worshipping the picture, and someone was hurt, bothered and offended by people doing this with their picture? Does that then make it wrong? [You being hurt, bothered and offended by the actions of others is subjective and has everything to do with you as a person.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycXuYzmzNg) Just because you are offended, it does not make it wrong. it just means that its your problem that you must deal with and learn from.","1317428684"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","See, I beg to differ. If the game is made to be casual ready, more people are interested. The more people that are interested, the more people that play and inevitably watch the competitive scene. The more people that watch the competitive scene, the more advertising is paid out to sponsorships, streamers, and community. The more advertising paid out, the more frequently it will benefit holding small tournaments and attract smaller sponsors that are willing to dump a little bit of money here and there, and the more money the bigger sponsors of esports are willing to pour into the game in question, which is this case is dota2.

Everyone says you, 'know, HoN is the better competitive game', but the problem is that HoN compared to LoL and compared to SC2 is a relatively SMALL amount of gaming, even if it is 90% hardcore. Do you remember when S2 was supposed to hold those big cash prize tournaments? What happened? Is it because they didn't want to give out that kind of money? Maybe. Or is it because they didn't have the money because they don't have the cash flow? More than likely. 

Keep in mind the 1 million dollar tournament, that was no sponsorship churning of money, that was Valve spending a lot of money on advertisement. 

And enough with the community sucks and if you can't handle it deal with it mentality. That shit blows ass, there's no question about it.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","No, that's bullshit. Privatisation of common land will not decrease ""desertification"". A landowner would simply profit as he sees fit. Competition from adjacent lands would force him to increase production to keep prices low - and there you have it. Truth is, our appetite for resource cannot be bounded by political and economic ideology. So, corporate fishing outfits are free to sue BP as much as they want, I just can't see how they would be able to argue how their impact is any less than BP's. Generally speaking the ocean is governed by the United Nations Oceans and Law of the Sea conventions. It is a 'generally' agreed upon set of regulations regarding boundaries, demarcations and other shit. Functionally, it's useless - unless it serves to further national/corporate interest.
Technically it's easy to plot a section of ocean and lay ownership over it - you could collect resource as it passes through or drill on your section for minerals or oil. The real problem would be to lay claim over a particular animal. If you are raising a school of sea trout to eat later on in the season, but they won't stay in your section, the answer is obvious: lay claim to the entire species of sea trout, so you can own each one in existence. Or create your own species, so there is no challenge to your ownership! Then charge people a license for the use and consumption of your sea trout. Clearly this kind of thought can get out of hand (even though it's happening these days).","1317428704"

That being said, the smallest I'd go would be a 2nd generation KR808D1.  While big batteries have mass on their side, Volt and others (smokeless image) have 5v batteries regulated to 3.7.  Units like the Riva 510, are unregulated, they operate at higher power off the charger (4.2v), lower power toward the end of the cycle (~3.2).  This power curve should span 16 hours.  

Other egos offer regulated voltage.

While this doesn't sound like a problem it can be if people are discussing something important that others can learn from and then the conversation turns into how cute cats are or something unrelated.

At this point it's not worth obsessing about, and I drink out of a plastic bottle daily, but I think we should all use some caution when promoting BPA-free items when we don't know for sure that they are any better for us.

"Magic","t5_2qh74","Well it depends in my opinion. Most tricks that use the Hindu shuffle(either as a control or a force) can be done with a overhand shuffle. It comes down to what you find natural, as a performer and a magician. For me, and most of the world, the overhand shuffle is the way to go because how used to people are to it. While in the Asian continent, people shuffle the Hindu style. When I started out I learned all the hindu shuffle techniques, thinking it made me look cool and hip. I actually refused to do the overhand shuffle because I thought it made me look like an amateur. This was the period where the magic was about me, and how I looked infront of the audience. But I later discovered just how disarming the overhand shuffle is. People are used to it, and just accept it as a normal shuffle of the deck, even though it can be a full blind shuffle or a top stock shuffle. So while the hindu shuffle has one application that the overhand does not(the force part), it does provide a much more natural look. ","1317428734"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At this point, I feel like no matter what I say you aren't going to get it.

I explained to you why it is ignorant. You just didn't understand my explanation. You can ""expect"" to go to a post office and not get shot because shooting people is against the law. It is pointless to compare that to rowdy kids at a restaurant because being rowdy at a restaurant is not against the law. 

Still, I think the problem is your interpretation of the word ""expect"".  Just so we are clear.. we both agree that rowdy kids are annoying. I don't have kids. I don't particularly like kids... and I prefer they be well behaved in public or I will look down on their parents. 

That said... I'm aware that when I leave my house and go different places, I can expect to see different things. Smoking indoors is still legal where I live. If I go to a bar and get pissed off because I leave smelling like smoke, that is retarded. I knew people smoke at bars, I went there and people were smoking. I would prefer they didn't... in some cities/states it is even illegal. There are no states where rowdy kids are illegal. So by your standard, I should be able to ""expect"" to come home not smelling like an ashtray.. but we both know that's stupid.

What it comes down to is what you ""want"" is not what you should ""expect"". That is why I said the world doesn't revolve around you. If you want to go to a restaurant and enjoy a quiet meal and you choose Chili's, you are either too arrogant or too stupid to realize that no matter how much you want it to be quiet, it isn't up to you.

*Should* people be more considerate? Yes. Are they going to be tomorrow? No. The next day? No. The day after that? No. Then there is no reason you should expect them to be. Unless you go to the type of restaurant that would ask someone to leave if they were distracting other guests, like a nice steak house, then you can't expect it to always be annoying-kid free.","1317428762"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You seem to be maintaining that ""wholly atheistic"" means that you are a gnostic atheist. That is not the case. We have the two different scales for a reason. If you are an agnostic atheist, you are not ""less"" of an atheist. In fact, the majority of atheists are agnostic atheists, and that is perfectly fine and reasonable.

You are also maintaining that belief implies religion. Belief does not imply religion. I believe that Royal Crown Cola is delicious. That does not mean that I am a member of the RC religion, because that is not a religious belief. I believe that dragons do not exist. That does not mean that I am a member of the anti-dragon religion, because again, that is not a religious belief. I believe that there is no god, with the possible exception of the deist god (whose existence would be irrelevant for any practical purposes). That does not mean I am a member of some kind of ""atheist religion,"" because that is not a religious belief.

&gt; And as such you are on some slightly shaky scaffolding when it comes to telling other people to disregard their beliefs simply because yours have a degree of scientific backing.

What? I think scientific backing is the sturdiest scaffolding you could possibly have. Many people have a mistaken belief that vaccinations cause autism. When I tell people to disregard those beliefs because science has shown them to be false, and their actions on behalf of those beliefs endanger their fellow citizens, I think I am on very sturdy scaffolding. Many people have a mistaken belief that god exists and wants them to persecute gay people. I see no reason why the two scenarios should be treated any differently.","1317428764"

I don't see convince having any negative connotation natively, though context can make it negative.

Convincing is the entire point of negotiation. If you can't act to convince someone, there's no room for negotiation. So if you say that one shouldn't try to convince in regard to sex, then you're asserting that one shouldn't negotiate in regard to sex, and that's what I disagree with.","1317428764"

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","You have to take the parking question street-by-street though - if you put meters on Alberta and Hawthorne (for instance,) it's going to push drivers into the neighborhoods to park.  In the case of Hawthorne, because many of the houses do not have garages and are multiple-car households, there may already be three cars for the frontage of one house - and most lots are about forty feet wide.

In the case of NW, though this same argument would apply, I have less sympathy as the NW neighborhood association have fought ANY kind of multi-story parking development, despite the fact that NW/Pearl is one of the most densely populated areas on the West Coast (along with San Francisco and Capitol Hill in Seattle.)  It will be interesting to see what happens if they meter 23rd Avenue.

Those people would likely cause a small uproar if a computer videogame competition were aired on the network, as some people don't recognize them as sports.

However I do enjoy the prospect of MLG getting some station air time. It would boost ratings and views. But their only problem is that they probably don't have enough programming, or even money, to get a 24/7 network their own.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","On paper that works. However, much more is involved. Caffeine has been known to combine with other substances for added potency. Such as theobromine and theophylline. Both of which I believe are in coka-cola. 

Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than are others. If you're susceptible to the effects of caffeine, just small amounts — even one cup of coffee or tea — may prompt unwanted effects, such as restlessness and sleep problems.

How you react to caffeine may be determined in part by how much caffeine you're used to drinking. People who don't regularly drink caffeine tend to be more sensitive to its negative effects. Other factors may include body mass, age, medication use and health conditions such as anxiety disorders. Research also suggests that men are more susceptible to the effects of caffeine than are women.

Although moderate caffeine intake isn't likely to cause harm, too much can lead to some unpleasant effects. For most healthy adults, moderate doses of caffeine, 200 to 300mg, aren't harmful. But some circumstances may warrant limiting or even ending your caffeine routine.","1317428772"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","By ways of initiating, I am basically referring to two options. Jump in, or pull out. Pudge is unique in the sense that he pulls enemies heroes out to initiate the fight. Clockwerk, on the other hand, jumps in to initiate, as does Crix, ES, Magnus, etc. I don't think that Pudge should have both methods of initiation, not because it would be imbalanced, but because I think it is poor design. There are ways of making him a better hero without allowing the second method of initiation.

I, personally, would rather have another active ability. Merge rot with the magic armor part of flesh heap, and merge dismember with the strength part of flesh heap. This will give him a stronger early game by giving him an earlier stacking strength gain, while also giving some magic armor before level 10. It will also open up a slot for a more active ability. No clue what it would be, but that is why Icefrog and Valve's design team gets paid.","1317428775"

"travel","t5_2qh41","Here's the thing: you sound like a kid in a candy shop. You're still young, you do not need to eat all the candy at once!

But, if you want an interesting, spectacular, out of the ordinary vacation, and one that Joe at the office wouldn't have also done, I suggest Iceland. I actually suggest Iceland for everything except beach and sun worshipers. 

If you go, IcelandAir Saga Class or Premium Economy should be comfy enough (but expensive). I believe Delta is now flying there out of JFK, too, and I've heard that Iceland Express will start (has started?) flying out of Boston. But Iceland Air will take you from SFO, which might be nice.

Hotels will run you from €60 to €300+ depending on how comfortable you want to be. I tend to stay at the Hotel Borg, €101 with the more than four day discount, usually.

Reykjavik is the city. It's walkable, it's pretty, it's fascinating. Full of nightlife on the weekends, decent small-town shopping, hip, and very eclectic. Rent a car when you need it in town — cars are expensive here. 

The food is fantastic. Ask at the hotels and they will guide you to some of the best eats outside of SF, NY, DC, Spain, and London. Eat all the fish, for you won't find fresher or better prepared anywhere (it might change your mind about seafood, your wife will love it). Lamb, too. 

Once you've done Reykjavik, you can hop a plane for the countryside. Flights to Akureyri in the north are frequent and ""cheap"". It's a small town of 15K people, but the scenery around lake Myvatn (a 45 min drive) is spectacular. Spend a couple of days up there.

You can also do day trips to Greenland from here. Two hour flights and a day hiking glaciers. It's not cheap, though.

If you go in the summer, you'll have daylight 24 hours. In the winter, you'll be able to see aurora if the clouds cooperate. 

I'd also say it's worth renting a car and driving the ring road. You can do it fairly quickly, but if you take a week, it'll be enough time to see the country and not be rushed.

In case you haven't caught on, Iceland is my favorite place on earth.

Cost: it's not a cheap place. I was there a few months ago, and I think I paid €101 per night for five nights for the hotel, and probably another €400 in food and drink, plus €120 in my share of a rental car for four of those days.

If you decide to go for this, PM me and I'll happily answer any questions you have.","1317428778"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; I really think that how a doctor gets paid should be between the doctor, the patient, and any parties they choose to allow negotiate (eg, insurance company). I think any kind of salary cap for doctors would be a violation of their rights.

I agree with you here (although I will point out that state-set maximum payments for procedures have worked well in Japan). I just think that the benefits would be great if the negotiators of doctor compensation (insurance companies and government) were to change the way doctors were compensated (which they would have every right to do so, or at least to negotiate towards).

As to the rest of it, there are generally good reasons why most medications are prescription only - because you need a qualified health care professional to determine which one will work best, what dose, how to take it, how often, warnings about the medication, etc. I currently have almost finished my nursing degree, and medications are one of, if not the most difficult yet most important things to know, as you have to know what each medication does, at what dose, how it acts, how these actions can affect the rest of the body, what to watch out for when giving it, etc. Plus there are thousands of different kinds. Most doctors have to play around with medications before they get something appropriate for an individual patient, all the while relying on their expertise to prevent/minimize any negative effects. Now, if you make people with little to no training and experience responsible for that, you will start having a lot of negative effects on your hands.

As to the rest of your idea, I think it's pretty good, but there is absolutely no need to use doctors to do it if you want to reduce barriers to entry. Just use other healthcare professionals, such as registered nurses, nurse practitioners, the huge variety of therapists (PT, OT, etc.), or you could even create a new form of healthcare professional dealing with a narrow area of medicine. That way you can keep the accountability, trustworthiness, and basic competence that comes with licensing, while greatly reducing barrier to entry by having shorter and more focused educations.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I've used some of the smaller monitors from [Sensatronics](http://www.sensatronics.com/) before to monitor both critical equipment temps (Surgical tissues storage) as well as some basic data center monitoring.

They're not the cheapest option but they do offer sensors with calibration certs to NIST standards, and we've only had one sensor out of about 20 go back in the 5 years I've had it in place.

The big pros to their equipment is that it's fairly flexible- if you get the right unit you can throw multiple types of sensors on them, and they're very easy to manage- just thow them on the network, give them an IP, and you can either poll them several different ways (web fetch, SNMP, and several others) which makes them very easy to bundle into something like Nagios.  You can also get ridiculous numbers of sensors, in case you want to monitor more stuff (eg in my center we've got a wetness sensor under the raised floor, hot aisle temp, cold aisle temp, as well as a direct temp monitor on the outflow of the main AC, all connected to one base- the bases can go up to 16 sensors, I think)","1317428837"

You're welcome. I feel like other people have tried to make that same point, but maybe they didn't word it well enough (or maybe I give them too much credit by reading what I want to see into their words).

&gt;But in a federal court, in December of last year, a judge concluded that even though he happens to be a U.S. citizen, he can still be treated like any other belligerent.

No, he didn't. The case was thrown out because Awlaki's father had no grounds to sue. The judge also commented that he thought the government's decision to place Awlaki on the list was unreviewable, but that is not pre-authorization of any particular government action; it is merely acknowledgement that placement on a particular list is, in and of itself, not reviewable. The judge even welcomed Awlaki to bring suit himself (knowing full well he would not do so, of course).

&gt;And when it comes down to it, Federal judges make the rulings, not Reddit.

EDIT: Hmmm, downvoted. I'm not sure exactly why. I've seen this exact thing happen many times, from the female point of view. She has a white bf, and her parents don't approve. She does it anyways, and by the time the first kid comes, the parents are on board. When it comes down to it, the girl knows the parents love her and won't cut her out of their lives. There are 4 different cases:

1. Parents don't approve of outside race, girl knows and respects this.

2. Parents don't approve, girl does it anyways.

2. Parents don't approve, girl doesn't know until after she's dating, but does it anways.

3. Parents don't approve, girl doesn't know until after, and she breaks up with bf.

AIS, yes. de la chapelle, possibly. Perhaps the majority of transsexuals you worked with were intersexed but that's not representative of the majority of transgendereds. The issue is extremely complicated on all fronts but those disorders are pretty rare. Until we have an entirely gender-neutral and unisex military then we will continue to place people in one of two categories. The military does not need to create another category for the rare individual that doesn't fit into biologically male or female groups. It has not responsibility to make someone feel good or comfortable with themselves, it does have a responsibility to ensure that those who enlist are physically and mentally capable of performing the mission.

For the purposes of military medical and administrative classification, genetics should be used to determine biological sex and all personnel will obey that standard. **Deal with it.** If being the wrong gender is too much for you to function properly in society without transitioning then you are not psychologically stable enough for military service. You also have no business joining then requesting the government accommodate your desire to transition while in service and especially have no business expecting the government to pay for it.

Being transgender should not bar one from military service at all but how you *feel* about your gender is simply inconsequential. If you can do your job, wonderful. Welcome aboard. If doing your job requires hormone therapy and wanting to be recognized as the opposite sex from which you were born then get it done before you enlist, but you might be denied in the psych eval if you haven't lived long enough as that other gender.

We deny people for having the slightest of mental conditions. Anxiety attacks, various phobias, cutting, anorexia, ADHD; all conditions that even after years of treatment will prevent you from enlisting because it presents a potential for psychological instability. Transitioning from one gender to another is a serious psychological undertaking and the odds are that someone who desires that transition or has already completed it still needs a significant amount of therapy to adjust. That is not the type of person that needs to be an incredibly stressful environment where lives depend on mental stability.","1317428881"

"news","t5_2qh3l","Nothing you have said is correct.  You are clearly civics-challenged, so allow me to educate you as to how the court system works.

In our dual-federalism system, there are two distinct court systems - the state court systems and the federal court systems.

At the state level, issues typically begin at the trial court, often called the superior court.  A party who receives an adverse decision may appeal that decision to the next higher state court - the state's court of appeals.  An adverse decision from that court may be appealed to the state's highest court - often called the state supreme court.  At this stage, decisions are final and binding upon the entire state unless there exists some sort of federal question that would give appellate jurisdiction to the United States Supreme Court.  If such jurisdiction exists, the issue may be appealed to the US Supreme Court.  As you can see, a state court issue never reaches the federal circuit court of appeals.

Now, the federal court system is structured in much the same way with federal issues beginning in the trial court (district court), then being appealed to the circuit court of appeals for that region, and finally, if accepted, appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

As far as the circuit courts of appeal are concerned, each court only hears appeals for, and its decisions are only binding on the courts of, the states within its own circuit.  Despite your assertions to the contrary, a circuit court decision does not apply nationally.  Thus, a decision in the First Circuit Court of Appeals is only binding in Maine, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  Courts in other circuits are free to ignore that decision and come to a completely opposite decision if they so choose.  Therefore, because Illinois is within the jurisdiction of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, decisions from the First Circuit, or any other circuit, are not binding.","1317428882"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Banks are a business, first and foremost.  We love to think of them as stewards of our money, there for us when we want to by a car or home.

But they don't make a single decision without wondering, ""How does this impact the investors?""  And by impact I mean make money for.

The change to how they process transactions on accounts - ""structure transactions to make money on overdraft fees"" - cost them BILLIONS of dollars.  That money has to be made up.

Then, the fact that they could make, essentially, unlimited amounts of money from the business side of debit card transactions was changed - a regulation capped how much they could charge a merchant.

THAT money needed to be made up.

Finally, a HUGE percentage of standard bank accounts - mine for sure and almost certainly yours - cost them money to maintain.  Even if you have online banking, online statements and never write a check there is still real work that goes into processing a ledger balance for you every day.  If it doesn't cost man power, it costs server time, server space and network resources.  (This is why the Big Banks don't give a fuck if you go to a credit union.  If, and it won't happen, but if a huge percentage of people moved, the operating cost of maintaining all those accounts would drag a credit union under - or they'd be forced to make the same decisions the banks are.)

So, the banks get together (if not literally, figuratively for sure) and said, ""How can we make up the lost revenue?""

By charging for shitty zero balance accounts - both monthly service fees and usage fees.  The bank is not only going to charge enough to just break even - they're a business with investors to think about.  So, they set up a panel, interview a bunch of customers and do things like read aggregate news sites, and decide, ""You know what... If we charge a few buck a month for debit card usage, and a few more to keep the accounts open, **MOST** people won't leave.  So, let's do that shit.""  

And here's why they're going to make money.  I see a LOT of beef on this page about ""I'm taking my ball and going home.""  No, you're probably not.  A percentage - a *small* percentage - will go to credit unions, but most will stay with, or just as dumb - move from Big Bank A to Big Bank B.  The fee structure may be different, but in the end, it's the same thing.  

So, what's the answer?  I think you're right to go to credit unions, but not everyone can, and not everyone will.  And even then it's not the magical fairy-tale land everyone makes it out to be.  But, most people are just going to need to change the way they handle their money and play by the banks' rules.  Find a way to get up to the minimum balances your account needs.  Switch to direct deposit, or set up a transfer to a savings account, or open the 3 extra ""service"" accounts they want to waive those fees.  (""Service"" accounts are often things like online banking, online bill pay, online statements, combined checkings/savings accounts, etc.)

The banks have already taken into account that some of you will leave - and they are just fine with that.  You're probably not doing anything for them anyway.

So, if you can't/won't go to a Credit Union or alternative, **for the love of god** start changing your habits now.  You've got a few months jump on getting your balance up.  You've got time to find out what other ways you can avoid those fees.

But bitching about it?  Calling them?  (Seriously, do you know who you're talking to?  That person makes $10/hr and has exactly as much say as their supervisor, or their supervisor or even theirs - certainly anyone you can ACTUALLY talk to...)  Writing them a letter?  I'll even include closing your account...  That isn't going to change anything.  They already expect that and have plans to deal with it.

Either change how YOU operate, or just deal with it.  Self-righteousness will **NEVER** be able to compete with returns on investments.

**TL;DR: You have choices, but make them fast.  The banks don't care.**","1317428916"

2tblsp Suger
1 packet yeast
5-5 1/2 flour (all purpose or bread)
4 eggs
6 tblsp veggie oil
1 tblsp salt
egg wash (1 egg)
seeds or nothing

Mix warm water with suger dissolve then add yeast, add 1 cup flour and let it expand, sit it in corner for 15min till bubbly.

While going on mix eggs until light and frothy, add veggie oil to it keep beating it. Add in yeast mixture then when that's added add the salt. Add flour till doughy and pulls away from sides of bowl.

Knead it for a few more minutes till it isn't sticky adding any extra flour as needed. Cover and let rise in a oiled bowl for 1-2 hours or until you can poke the top of it and it doesn't spring back up.

Put on lightly floured work space and push it down, cut into half then each half seperate into 3 equal pieces. Roll the pieces out into a line then braid two smaller loaves or if you have enough room on a tray 1 large loaf with all the pieces. 

Let sit till the formed loaves have increased in size usually about 1 hour,  preheat oven and apply the egg wash and any seeds you want. Bake for 35-40min

Nearly 1% of the population is in jail in the US. Nearly 5% of the black population. This system was originally a way to re-institute slavery after the civil war, and that's still partly what it remains today, except it's just *exploded* in the last several decades. We've just invented new ways to throw people in prison. You can't just shove someone in a cell for walking in a white woman's shadow anymore, so we have to have the War on Drugs. Narcotics are criminalized, instead of addicts being treated, and this has two benefits:

- creates a violent black market and gives credibility to the systematic imprisonment of the unwanted superfluousness population

- keeps the poor and minorities from having any shot at an articulate political voice or another crisis of democracy like the civil rights movement

"BBQ","t5_2qxww","&gt;There is a problem with this approach for some cooks: The meat does not have a hard chewy bark on the exterior. Ball says that a hard bark is emblematic of overcooked meat. He wants a dark, flavorful, tender bark. But if you want a hard bark, the solution is to pull the meat out of the foil when it hits 180°F or so, and hit it with higher heat to dry the exterior and darken the rub. **Or just skip the foil altogether, do things the old fashioned tried and true way, and just be patient.** Either way, the results are superb.

This has always been my attitude towards foiling, water pans, and other attempts to thwart the heat plateau. Just be patient. That's why it's called low and *slow*. Besides, I have a lot of other things to do to get ready before I open, so it's not like I'm standing next to the pit tapping my foot and checking the clock every minute. :P

"Random_Acts_Of_Pizza","t5_2s7wq","A nice story about how I got my wife to marry me.

I was a young man with big dreams in NYC. Growing up in NJ, I had only gone into the city during the holidays to see the tree. Every time was an incredible experience, as I was captivated by the tall buildings, the bright lights, and the possibilities of everything... work, life, love.... you name it. I moved there just before my 19th birthday. I was ready to take on the world. I hadn't made a lot of friends, but I was so determined that it didn't matter to me. I just worked and saved. It wasn't even two months when I first saw her. My co-worker and I were getting on the subway when I spotted her. She was leaning against the wall, one hand holding onto a rail, the other holding The Divine Comedy. She was wearing a mismatched set of a scarf, hat, and mittens, obviously knitted by someone who loved her very much. Her long brown hair covered her face, just enough to be mysterious. She blended in perfectly with the setting of all that makes NYC, but she was the only thing I saw. Her eyes never came off the pages of her book, even as she exited at her stop. As she walked off, I nudged my buddy and told him, ""That's the girl I'm going to marry."" He laughed. I got off to follow her, but she was absorbed into the abyss of New York's rush hour.
Almost a year went by. I thought about her from time to time, but considered her part of the dream of the city. I was coming home from a meager NYE celebration when I saw that carefully stitched hat bobbing in the crowd ahead of me. I ran up to her and wished her a Happy New Years.
It's now almost 17 years later. We're celebrating our 15th anniversary this fall, in addition to the birth of our second child. We moved out of the city some time ago, but I still consider it to be the place where the most impossible can happen. My wife and kids are proof of that.

Side Note: Co-worker on the subway was a groomsman in our wedding.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","Not to pop a bubble, but saying *It's only a beta* this late in the game is basically playing the race-card, it's an irrational cop-out, it's old, and it's irrelevant.

These designs that you're seeing, though maybe not finished, are there with *intention*. They're not placeholders. They're there with direction. This means that this is the way it is going whether you like it or not. Game companies do not simply test new ideas this late in the game in terms of major design.

The only way you will see any changes to something this game changing is if people bitch and moan about it long enough, then, maybe, a few months down the road... For the record, the BF2 beta had the same squad lay-out as they did on release. Their beta also started *months* prior to release, not 25 days.","1317428955"

I crushed my weepy, pitiful emotion into a little ball and threw it in my closet for the night.  I did that.  It went well.  She was very nice.  Then we came back to my place.  My place with my closet with my emotion in it.  We started kissing.  I started sobbing.  It was embarrassing.  I was ashamed.  I thought, ""This isn't right.  I love someone else.  I should be kissing her.""  Which snowballed into a plethora of terrible thoughts.  My emotion burst forth from my closet, pointed at me, and said, ""You were having a good time?  Well fuck you.  This won't happen again - don't worry.""  and it hasn't happened again.  I'm fucking ***terrified*** of getting to that point again.  It was awful!

"bisexual","t5_2qwnx","Thank you for the reply.  I think...  It's the submission that turns me on.  As well as the humiliation.  The reason I want a woman there is because that's what turns me on in the scenario:  Having a woman alternately degrade and encourage me, ""train"" me essentially, as I submit to this strange man.

Would I prefer to be pegged?  Yes, definitely.  But that's also because of the submission aspect of the whole thing, which brings me back to men.  Am I turned on by the thought of a man dominating the hell out of me while a woman watches and humiliates me?  Oh, yes.  Am I aroused by the thought of intimately making love to a man and having any kind of emotional relationship with him?  Not really...  At least not the emotional relationship part.

Basically, there's always been this submissive little animal in me that wants to be trained, and lately that's culminating into me feeling this strange, new *need* to be fucked.  It's like this desire that I can't quell or move past until I try it...  Even if, eventually, a woman is not involved.  I've begun to consider that option more and more and it's becoming less strange.

Sorry this is so long winded, I guess I needed somebody to talk to about it.  In the end, do I think I'm bi?  I don't know.  I don't think so, honestly.  But I'm not sure because of what I keep thinking about all goddamn day long.  Do I want a man to fuck me?  Yes.  What do I do with this information?  It's freaking me out.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I'm from Münster (as it's spelled correctly). You need to know that Münster is known for having **A LOT** of bicycles. With a lot i mean like more than 500k bicycles for only about 300k people. Cycling is by far the most common and fastest way to get around in the city, and this is supported by bicycle lanes everywhere, allowing bikes to enter one way streets both ways and even allowing bikes in pedestrian areas. Additionally, the public transportation system is very well established, there are busses every couple of minutes to pretty much any part of the city. Nobody really uses a car here, many don't even own one. It takes forever to get anywhere because of the traffic (commuters from the rural surrounding region) and you won't find a parking spot anyway. So this image is just an ad to point out how well the city does without, or at least with less cars.","1317428979"

"cats","t5_2qhta","First off, I'd like to congratulate you on deciding to own a cat. They are intelligent, playful, loyal, loving, and independent. Of course that's all based on the cat's personality... but it's typically the average cat.

Few things you might want to consider, and I say them because I want to make sure you and your (hopefully soon!) little buddy are happy and safe. 

Make sure you are financially stable enough to be able to help your buddy out. Here's a helpful link. http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1838&amp;aid=1542

Remember cats can live 10-20 years or possibly longer (rare cases), so this is a long time commitment. Will you be able to live with your buddy for that long of a time? Will you move again and not be able to house your buddy?

As for the room, if you started with a kitten I'm sure that's enough space. Just keep a ton of toys around and make sure to give the kitty all the attention it wants. You could build cardboard tunnels or mazes and let the kitty explore! Shelves / additional shelves for no other purpose than to let your kitty roam the walls are awesome, they love that shit.

For the balcony, everyone has already mentioned it. Mesh or a harness, never leave unattended. Should be fine, cats dig cat castles. Maybe get a cheap one online and let the kitty look out the door on top of the castle?

For allergies, I'm sorry but I cannot be much of assistance. I would check your local pet shelter. (CHECK FOR NON KILL SHELTERS! You adopt there and they will be able to free up another space to keep another kitty alive. They are AMAZING for information, sometimes loans for vet bills or additional cat food / toys.)

Feel free to PM if you think of other questions, I'm going to go get drunk and I may forget about this thread's existence. I hope things work out and you get a new buddy! (I ended up waiting 4 years to adopt to make sure I could house them fine without issues. Totally worth it, I love my cats, I couldn't live without them.)","1317428989"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","It takes a lot of work to dismantle the Craig's version of the Kalam (it involves a understanding of logic, probability, physics, time and causality). And in a debating situation you have an even harder job as many who hear it have intuitions that tell them each premise is very likely true. It is a shame you have experienced what you have with atheists, though it doesn't surprise me.

I had a debate with a Christian about the Kalam (I didn't attack Craig btw), and I had a very hard time arguing that the premises are not so obvious wrt to the universe. In the end I was pretty much told that I just didn't want the argument to be true and that is why I wasn't convinced it proved the existence of God. As you can imagine I was a little miffed by this.

**Price manipulation of gold and silver**: When people buy gold, you don't actually buy gold. You buy pieces of paper that say you own gold. Then you're charged huge storage fees for the bullions. At the moment, there approximately a hundred times more gold deposits than actual gold bullion existing in the world

**Joe Casano** He's the guy that basically brought down AIG by making trillions of dollars worth of deals that the company couldn't back up, making millions (around 300 million) in the process and destroying thousands of peoples lives and potentially destroying the worlds economy. Yeah, he hasn't been punished at all.

**Data mining** Credit card companies using your personal data to such sophistication that they're even predicting when some people are going to get divorced. Then cashing in on it.

**Bonuses** It's great we bailed these companies out. What's even greater is the millions of dollars worth of bonuses these people gave themselves after they got the money.

**Betting on defaults** Federal reserves would bet (I'm looking at you California) on whether certain institutions (such as schools) would default on it's debt. When they did, they profited. Massive conflict of interests. 

**Destroying our generation** Our generation is going to have the largest amount of debt in recorded history to pay back. Thanks you fucking idiots.

**Spreadsheet manipulations** Yes, people didn't realize how fucked these companies actually were. Basically because they just lied on their balance sheets.

**Housing** They sold mortgages to people knowing they would default. Why? Because that's the American dream. And it worked so well...

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","What you call an ""NRE Rush"" is a biological function of the human body.  When people meet new people and get into romantic relationships with them, your brain chemistry changes a little bit, most people perceive it as a kind of muted euphoria.  It's basically evolution's way of encouraging us to reproduce.  Remember, everything we experience in our love and sex lives is based on traits we've evolved over the years that helped the species survive.  If this is a person you've already known for a long time before dating, your brain isn't perceiving this as a ""new"" relationship, so you're not getting that extra little kick.  Bad news is, if it hasn't come by now, it won't ever.  Good news is, you don't really know where you stand in a romantic relationship until that newness factor wears off anyway.  So, consider this a fast forward to a more mature level of understanding of the relationship you two have.","1317429046"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I'm sorry I'm not being more clear -- 

The relevant part of the distinction is 'within a single lane'.  And whether or not something is safe and practical is exactly the part of the law that falls directly into the CHP's discretion -- which leads us back to the point that lane splitting can be both legal and illegal depending on whether it's being done in a safe or practical manner as determined by the officer at the time.

At the moment, the CHP says, on the whole, the practice is safe -- but that's discretionary and not part of the statute.

I wish the legal system worked the way that you think it does, but it doesn't.  Any lawyer worth any amount of the billable hours that they claim (including the ones that bill me) will respond to almost any inquiry, 'It depends.'  This is not because the law is crystal clear in all cases and many things are sometimes legal and sometimes illegal, all depending on context.

We can talk about juries and why they're part of the process for a while as well, but the law is not crystal clear in most cases -- and this is no exception.

Ninja Edit:  Just wanted to comment quickly on 22350 as that's actually the one that gets used the most when people do get ticketed, at least the couple riders I know that have gotten snagged -- the argument is that filtering may be ok, but lane splitting is done at a speed that is greater than is reasonable having due regard for the traffic on the highway and that it necessarily endangers the safety of the property -- namely, the cars on either side.

If a CHP officers gets a bug up his butt, that's usually the ticket you'll get.

Battle of the anecdotes: in my case, the experience was entirely positive, I became a much wamer, more emotionally aware person and I stopped being so shy. Then I reached a point at which I felt no desire to do it anymore. It helped me get me through a door that I needed to go through, and after that I had to find other ways to grow. I don't regret it at all, but I also know that not everyone has such a positive experience and I've never recommended that anyone try it, though I have looked after numerous people on trips. I haven't used psychedelics for, oh, maybe 20 years. 

And maybe I would have changed anyway, but at the time it sure felt like psychedelics precipitated the change I experienced.

Oddly, weed doesn't do much for me.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","""Much of the time when you are going heavy gateway twilight council play you will want two forges and spend all of your chronoboosts on the upgrades. Chargelots become much much more effective with upgrades, especially armor. Generally speaking, you can get away with just one forge upgrading weapons if you intend to get fast(ish) colossi but you will want two forges if you are making a most chargelot/archon/HT composition.""


This is actually the exact opposite of what has been happening though. When mc/genius/most other top protosses go the standard chargelot archon build, they always went 1 forge/1council after robo around 7:30-8mins and got charge and +1 armour really fast and stayed on one forge going 0-1 -&gt;0-2 -&gt;1-2 and got templar archives just before 3rd base around 10mins as you start to bank gas. Then nearing 150 supp transitioned much later into collosus.

But this build is robo-&gt;double forge around 7:30-8mins, tc at 70% 1-1. 3 more gates and 2 immortals, start blink and 2-2 then bay around 11:30, you do alot more alot faster and you have to skimp more on gateway units so its alot less safe then original chargelot/archon build, its the reason you take such a late third base at 13mins instead of 10:30ish because you have 2-2 blink and charge and collosus/lance on the way.

This build imo would get crushed by a standard 1raxfe ghost timing with plenty of marines.

With the other 2(faster twilight into charge over blink with 0-1 or fast collosus, getting the twilight or the bay around 8mins) you can use forcefields to delay for your first collosus or for charge to finish(both around 10:30mins with the push coming a bit earlier than 10mins). But even with delaying for 1-1 your just gonna get kited with no forcefields, charge or collosus.

Just realised alive actually did the ghost timing to creator, but didnt attack down the ramp for some reason, but you can see the unit differences and easily guess what would happen if alive attacked, the build seems to try patch that weakness by getting 2 immortals out + cannons but i think emps and marines would easily rip through this build at that point","1317429060"

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","&gt;My main point is that there is a significant difference between the subs that a good majority deems 'objectionable' and those aren't. I don't think the argument that the removal of one type of content will lead to the removal of anything remotely questionable.

I would beg to differ on that. You just see them as ""clearly objectionable"" and for that reason think it should be clear to everyone else. Other people probably think the same thing about things you don't see objectionable.

Want proof? Me (a non-eupha-whatever and non pedophile) sitting here arguing with you, thinking that /r/jailbait is not worthy of deletion. The very fact that this debate is raging across reddit right now means that it's not as crystal clear as you seem to think it is.

&gt;Could you sell a magazine of dead babies? 

Yes, you absolutely could. 

&gt;I think the thing that concerns me most is that I really enjoy reddit, and I would hate to see it become something stigmatized based on the actions of a few. 

It's really not going to. It's not even a default subreddit. You see it if you go looking for it. 

&gt; It's hard to say that this place is free from society and outside influence, and if a large enough movement were started outside of reddit because of its 'dark corners,' I doubt any of us could keep the site up.

Really unlikely. The internet has a *lot* of dark corners, and there has yet to be a large enough ""movement"" to censor them, even in places darker than this. I can't see reddit and a few bikini pictures being the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's ridiculous that white, upper class suburbia thinks kids wait until they're 25 to have sex, and 40 to reproduce; in most parts of the world, I'm pretty sure that they'd have 2-3 kids of their own by then.  Fuck, I did my ob/gyn rotation in Detroit, and there were TONS, i mean TONS of 13 year old pregnant patients... pregnant with their SECOND kid!  Poor people reproduce in their early teens; that's how it is, and to deny it, and vilify the guy because he's older is ridiculous.

Also, another argument for young girls with much older men;  who would you rather knock up your teenage daughter, a 35 year old man who may actually have the interest and ability to raise a kid/support your daughter, or another teenager, who is going to, AT BEST, scrape by, giving your daughter and grand kid a shitty life, presuming he even sticks around at all?","1317429063"

It was very hard to deal with.  I developed depression and also physical symptoms the most intense was a cough that lasted about 10-11 months out of the year.  This went on for about ten years.  
Finally, I was prompted to write him a ""letter of forgiveness""  in this letter, that was about 3 pages long, I expressed how I felt about what had happened, how it had effected me and how much it had effected my relationships... and I decided to forgive him, because holding a grudge is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.  Holding on to the anger and despair was only hurting *me*.  Forgiving him did not mean that what he did was ok in any way shape or form, but only that I decided to let go of the bad feelings.  Then, I searched him out on the internet, found him and sent the letter.  Just the act of writing that letter helped me tremendously, my cough virtually disappeared overnight.

Most rational consumers are not going to buy a Range Rover. I can't find any data, but I would guess that LR2/Freelander and LR4/Discovery residuals are better.

It's true that LR has never had a stellar reliability reputation (and they have certainly earned it), however again I think the JD Power study is questionable in that the data comes from owner surveys (are you *really* going to fill one out if you had no problems? I certainly didn't do mine...) and there simply aren't that many LR2s and LR3/4s out there. Jaguar, which shares ownership, management and production facilities with LR, has top ratings in this same survey. WTF?

"AnaheimDucks","t5_2rqhz","For sake of discussion, let's just assume everyone is healthy, and that Hiller is 100%

Forwards


* 1st Line: RPG, I don't really think we need to discuss them. But if Getzlaf plays all 82 games, and if Perry continues doing what he does best and score goals, Ryan has improved every year too. Easily one of the best lines in hockey. 

* 2nd Line: Welcome back Selanne. The Masteron line may not be the flashiest, but they work hard every game. If Selanne keeps up his magic, that line should be an intimidating 2nd line. Koivu and Blake should do well enough in my opinion

* Bottom 6: Mcmillan, Cogliano, Belesky, Palameri (I know he was sent down, but I see him coming back up), Gordan (If keeps his play up, I don't see why he would be sent down), Smith-Pelly, Macenaur, Bonino(could come up) Sexton (Maybe). A combination of these players will form a respectable bottom 6 in my opinion. I mean obviously we would be leaning on the RPG line, and on the Masteron line, but I think this group of bottom 6 could do well enough. 

Defense: I don't really know of the pairings yet, but let's assume that Visnovsky and Lydman are the top pair again. That duo was amazing. If they are both healthy, we should be set on that. 

Fowler has looked really good so far to me in the preseason. His patience is incredible, I know players can enter the ""sophomore slump"" but what if he doesn't? Where will he take us?

Sbisa was one of my favorite players to watch last year. He was physical and got a lot better as the season went on. I'm hoping he continues to improve this year also

Beauchimin benefited greatly from playing with Scotty, but I still think he has some talent and can offer another shot from the point. I think he can be top 4.

I feel like Foster is kind of a wildcard. I have decent expectations for him but I guess we won't know until he can play. 

And then we have Brookbank as the 7th man? I mean I know our defense isn't ideal, but I don't think it's terrible. 

Goaltending:

Hiller can steal plenty of games for us if he's healthy. He has looked pretty damn good so far in the preseason, barring anything happening to him again we should comfortably be a playoff bound team. 

Ellis has proven to be a fantastic backup for us, and plus with the pickup of Deslauriers, I think we have a very underrated goaltending situation. 

Powerplay
-RPG line, plus Selanne PP magic, and with Fowler and Visnovsky, I think our PP should be great

Penalty Kill
-Hopefully Lydman recovers 100%, and Cogs played on the PK in Edmonton right?
-A healthy Hiller 

My final thoughts. We have the reigning MVP and Rocket Richard trophy winner. Lubo had the most points as a defenseman (4th in Norris voting), Lydman nearly had the highest +/- on a team with a very rocky start,  Hiller was in discussion for Vezina talks before he went down with vertigo (could he be the darkhorse for this year?) 

I realize my homer glasses are on and it's showing a lot. And there are some big assumptions I made, but I think we should in for an exciting season. And in my opinion, the Stars and Coyotes took a downturn this season, so hopefully the Pacific will not be as intense. ","1317429119"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","People are trying some amazing stuff, and yeah, the agreed-upon tradeoff at the moment is fidelity for dynamicness. Many great storytelling games are text-only for that reason. Emily Short's work on Alabaster, Glass, etc., are good examples.

Fidelity might catch up, eventually, but it almost certainly won't be a sudden accomplishment. Someone will make a huge advancement in vocal synthesis, and someone else with procedural language generation, and someone else with realistic dynamic facial modeling. Someone else will use something like L4D's director to make a game's tone and pacing consistent and good to help respond to the players decisions in ways its able to accommodate.

We may be a hundred years away from all that, but it's exciting and totally worth gunning for.

As far as saved games, meh, some games might have them, I suppose. It hardly seems like a generalization that can be made about all storytelling games. Failure in a story isn't always as show-stopping as death in games. Many great stories feature heroes that often fail their initial goal, but have to live with scraping by with their lives as their 'victory'. Firefly's a great example of heroes that fail regularly, without dying or the story fizzling out. Similarly, Romeo &amp; Juliet would have been a much less satisfying story if it was Tybalt that killed Romeo in that fight, and would have been a much different (but possibly still satisfying) story if Romeo avoided the fight in the first place.

The space of failure in games is much more than just the 'time to start from the beginning' one.","1317429127"

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is the classic fallacy of the right.  ""if poor people just work hard, they won't be poor any more"".  This is a load of bullshit, because where it is possible to climb out of poverty in the US, it is not common.  Poverty breeds more poverty, and wealth breeds more wealth.  
This may be the land of opportunity, but do you really think that a kid in the ghetto has the same opportunities as a rich white kid?  I mean, for poor black urban kids, they're either gonna be a famous rapper, a professional football player, or they're destined to sell drugs and die young.  

This is the reality.  You can work as hard as you want at that McDonalds but I can guarantee you you won't get that far.

""If you look at the poor in america, they are rich in many other countries largely because the rich and industrious have given them jobs""

No, they're rich in many other countries because there's a minimum wage.  Because the government has told companies how badly they can lawfully screw over their employees.  The object of business is amassing wealth.  If those ""rich industrious"" people could pay 17 cents an hour for labor instead of $7.50, they would. 

Oh wait, they do.  Its called outsourcing.  

The goal of business is the amassing of wealth.  To argue otherwise simply flies in the face of reality, past and present.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Yes to all.

First, I have never heard a good argument against women priests. I even asked the question on r/catholicism a while a go, and after a short debate, all they could come up with was ""WHAT ABOUT TRADITION ?!"", and even if I understand the importance of tradition in the Catholic church, it just seemed like a poor argument, because religion is a way to find *truth*, not *what we've done before*.

What about gays then ? Well, whatever your opinion on homosexuality is, you should be pro-gay priests. It just makes sense. If you have no trouble with gays, then you'll probably think they deserve the same career paths as heterosexuals. And if you think homosexuality is a sin, then let me ask you this :

Say you're a paedophile. You like kids, you can't help it. You know it's wrong, but hormones are not easy to control. Now, with your level of study, you get two career choices : one working in kindergarten, the other one in a retirement home. Which one do you choose ?

You'll probably answer ""the retirement home, so I don't get attracted to sin"". Exactly. You won't ask a blind man what his favourite colour is, so there's no reason for a priest's orientation to matter at all. When you don't fuck, you don't fuck. It doesn't matter if you're not fucking that gorgeous woman or that manly man, because in the end, you're just not fucking both.","1317429137"

"canada","t5_2qh68","I was very very fortunate to get out of school debt free.  My parents bought a second house with a loan from my aunt that we rented out to myself, my brother and a bunch of friends (we didn't pay rent).  Both my brother and I worked very hard all summer, saving most of what we made, and worked part time jobs all school year.  Our parents helped us out for second semester tuition (around 2-3K).  Thus saving us around 6-7K a year(half school/rent, we both paid utilities etc).  

Although this helped ALOT, neither of us had cell phones (we both have been done school for around 2 years, I took a couple years off after high school, he didn't) or cars.  We also partied very little,  and when we did we predrank and spend very little at the bar.  

Most students I saw that were complaining the most about education costs were eating meals purchased at school instead of taking lunches, buying multiple coffees, driving to school instead of taking advantage of the student bus pass, texting and using their data plans like crazy, and partying almost every weekend.

I might have missed out on parts of the college experience, and there were times I wished I had a car/phone etc. But getting my degree without owning the bank (aside from the bank of mom/dad) anything felt pretty great.  

Like many people in today's culture, students in my experience are living beyond their means, and blaming the cost of tuition (it's too high, I'm not arguing that) for all their financial problems, not their lifestyle.  

I know not everyone is as lucky as I am, however don't bitch about the cost of tuition when you have an iphone 4, macbook pro, and 5 dollar coffee from starbucks in your hand at the library.

Tsunami: If I need to worry about one, I think I'd try and steal an airplane because the rest of LA will be in chaos anyway.

Hurricane: Not currently prepared but I have some scrap wood that if a freak hurricane were to hit LA I could board up my windows and hunker down.

Plague: buy a furnace, find out how to get a vaccine, shit load of mouse traps/pesticides, start a small farm to grow food so that I can leave as little as possible.

Zombie Invasion: At first news of this invasion I plan to collect our families arsenal, food, Earth Quake supplies, and some tools and jump into two cars, one with 4 wheel drive. On the way out of LA we will grab more supplies and stock up on gasoline. We will continue to drive out of the ""No fly zones"" in the desert where they don't care what you do and start setting up camp. Then contact others to see what their plans are and adapt accordingly.

I don't know how it works in Canada. Most of what I know of the drug trade is from reading Mexican news over the last twenty years, and of US news that I've been getting through Reddit and other means since internet became common. Plus some personal observation and anecdotes in both countries.

Are all other recreational drugs also provided legally in Canada by the health system? Are some of them legal but provided by private for-profit or nonprofit means?

The major problem in the US is that the distribution of drugs is illegal and drug use is considered a legal rather than medical problem, which is intensely complicit in the problem we have in Mexico of bloody gang wars over control of the highly lucrative illegal distribution network to the USA.","1317429160"

According to this story, Potemkin, who led the Crimean military campaign, had hollow facades of villages constructed along the desolate banks of the Dnieper River in order to impress the monarch and her travel party with the value of her new conquests, thus enhancing his standing in the empress's eyes.""

Now you're gonna make me cut and paste. Are you aware that it's Friday night? Jeebus. Honestly, I don't know why I'm even bothering as you've already made up your mind to be an asshole contrarian who refuses to see how any of this might in the least bit be offensive to women who are just walking down the street wearing clothes like everyone else.

&gt;Lauren, a South Slope resident, was walking home three blocks from the gym on Monday when she was stopped. The 25-year-old, who did not want her last name to be used, was wearing shorts and a T-shirt when she claims a police officer asked if she would stop and talk to him. He also stopped two other women wearing dresses. [...]
**“He pointed at my outfit and said, ‘Don’t you think your shorts are a little short?‘” she recalled. “He pointed at their dresses and said they were showing a lot of skin.”
He said that such clothing could make the suspect think he had “easy access,” said Lauren. She said the officer explained that “you’re exactly the kind of girl this guy is targeting.”**

Especially since these spats pop up all over the place, with a few names appearing frequently. Sorry if I've pointed the finger in the wrong direction before my first coffee, but this has been brewing and I thought add my .02.

One more point: if we let the community decide with down votes on posts instead of making comments, then any questions that *are* crappy/trivial will disappear and the wisdom of the crowd will up vote the ones that are ""oh, interesting"" for whatever reason.  This is a major reason I read /r/apple - to understand and perhaps prevent ""unusual situations"" before I could possibly know to even anticipate them.

Voting identifies these outliers and punishes the banal. If a banal question makes it to the front page, it's because the competing submissions are worse (OMG iPhone 6 leaked!!1!) - fix those.

Tl;dr let the crowd evaluate questions on an *individual* basis as reddit is designed, surely...? Ban ""/r/applehelp is that way --&gt;"" instead; I think it's more damaging.

It's a matter of intent. A teen posts a photo of herself at the beach intending to share it with friends and family.

There are not multiple Americas in this case, nor should you confuse the trademark phrase ""Bank of America"" by adding a single 's' to America, so you wouldn't write ""Americas"".

When you consider those facts, I'd say the phrase as written is an acceptable shorthand for use on an Internet forum. Ideal would be re-writing the sentence...but they didn't do that, they just made 3 words bold. Ambiguity + no teaching moment = bad grammar nazi.

I think you hit it with Yaws and your Lambda article, Node didn't offer anything new but it stepped into that vacuum: it's extremely un-fun to write servers and daemons, evented, even concurrent programming in any of the languages people are *generally* familiar with today.   And while 9 in 10 can't tell you what Erlang is, folks had started to get their heads around asynch evented programming in javascript.  Finally, as a side benefit, the language used overwhelmingly by clients of said servers and daemons happens to be javascript.  With that impedance barrier lowered, lots of quite fun things can be done.

That is where node.js fits, that's what it 'brings.'  It inherits javascript baggage, but language bashing is so Blub, any language choice would have carried some baggage.

I got an industrial job out of school after having mostly research experience in undergrad.  Frankly, I miss having control over my own time, and I miss doing research.  The money is good, but I had to move to a high-cost-of-living city.  After putting together taxes and rent, my disposable income is just about as high as the income of my friend who did not-good-not-bad at his biology degree and got a job as a debugger.

If n = 2k is even, Z \ n is covered by the balls with centers 2l \neq n. So n is closed.

Conversely, since you've got a base of the topology, you know that every even number is contained in a unique minimal open set, (containing that number and the two adjacent). So if K is the closure of the point n = 2k+1 you see that Z \ K doesn't contain 2k or 2k+2. (If it did, it would contain the minimum open neighbourhood of these points, hence would contain n.)

I have a couple thoughts about this. First, you can make short games and ramp the difficulty up accordingly. This is what the arcade industry does even today. Most single player arcade games take a half an hour or less to play through once you have gained the skill to beat them in a single credit.

Second, DinofarmGames doesn't seem to have a problem with every form of save-game system, just those which allow the player to use saves as a crutch. I assume, for example, that he is okay with the permadeath save system that roguelikes use, as he has praised roguelikes earlier in this thread.","1317429273"

"redditcon","t5_2qt1c","&gt; it is not unreasonable to assume that 30-40 thousand people will attend.

Whoa, whoa, whoa... Actually that is totally unreasonable. I'm sorry to be so blunt. Gencon, the biggest convention in the gaming world has less than 40k attendance, origins the second has under 15k. 

I'd estimate that 2k attendance is likely for the first year, though I'd not argue with someone who thinks it'll be more like 5k. 

You have to understand that most of the international redditors won't be able to attend because of logistics. Similarly, 99.9% of redditors have no inclination to attend any conventions ever, that whittles the pool to 11k, half of those will have unshakable barriers to attendance , work, kids, money, etc. 

You do make some good points about outside attractions and public transit but 90% of attendees don't go anywhere besides the con, the hotel and local restaurants.

Conventions are much more like destination resorts than amusement park or museum type attractions. A good convention has something to do for every attendant for 8 to 10 hours a day and the rest of their time is sleeping, eating, shopping, and screwing. ","1317429275"

There are two types of topical anti-flea meds. 

Frontline: Not weight based, does fleas and ticks. Is ideal for your situation due to kittie's unknown whereabouts, and should not be used on kittens under 8 weeks.

Advantage: Separate doses for kitties under 9 pounds. Only works on fleas. Recommended for indoor only kitties, because why expose them to unnecessary chemicals? Can't be used by cats under 12 weeks. 

Conclusion: You should def pickup a kit of frontline. Application is easy, just rub it under her scruff and you're set. 

Also, vets are expensive and everything but you should really get her checked out as soon as possible to get her started on her shots as well as some basic bloodwork (to test for viruses, any deficiencies, and worms). [This link](http://www.kittencare.com/vaccines.html) has a schedule for kittens that seems applicable. Yours looks older than 3 months for sure, but it will at least give you an idea of what each vaccine does.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","As others have said hybrids are pretty bad and so is the Rokh. The gallente boats like the megathron get a dmg bonus which makes a difference, the Rokhs range bonus will almost never be useful.

If you are flying a ship just because of how it looks then go for it but if you ever want to be of use in fights and feel like you can actually win in a smaller group then don't use the caldari gun boats. Sniper BS used to be very effective but really isn't now. Artillery has better alpha and damage selection, lasers have better dps and range.

At the moment Minmatar is the way to go for smaller fleets/roams. For bigger stuff armor fleets ie abaddons are the way to go, though maelstroms are popular as well.

I fly primarily Gallente when I'm not in a fleet.  For ratting I like my vindicator with rails and sentry drones but I'd be lying if I said the Mach wouldn't do it better.

My suggest is to not go with the rokh. I have one and use it almost never. I think it got used to snipe some pos mods when we didn't have cap support and the more recent time was when a tengu was sitting 100km off our station and I just wanted to show him I could hit him. Otherwise it sits in my hanger.

Ewar is always helpful but be ready to lose your ships a lot. Another good way to get into fights which is always needed in a fleet and teaches a lot about flying is to go for an interceptor. They are cheap, fun and you make a really big difference in fleets. That's what I trained for originally and still love getting out and grabbing people when i have a chance to roam. ","1317429299"

Reddit creates communities, and the communities spawn these things. Google search does not create communities. You can use google search to find communities, but it isn't the same. Reddit's strength isn't in the information typed on it. It's the communities that drive the interactions.

Just because you view reddit as a different sort of search engine doesn't mean that's it's purpose. That is like saying ""why use a riding lawnmower? a car is faster."" the two, although both moving vehicles, have fundamentally different purposes.  Yes, you could get to the grocery store in a riding lawnmower, but that's not the purpose of it. That's not using it the right way, so  the assessment would be pointless.

In QuakeLive when you encounter an enemy you have to decide, in a friggin' split second, what weapon they have equipped and what weapon you're going to take out and then battle ensues. Depending on how its going (two seconds later) you decide whether your LG-on-LG battle is in your favor and you want to pull out the Rocket Launcher or keep wearing them down. Or if you have rail gun equipped and they approach you with a rocket launcher you can chose to either switch to something else and take them head on or stick with rail gun and increase your distance so that his shots are less accurate on you, however this also means you have to have dead-on accuracy as every one of your rails equals two chances for him to get a rocket on you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;This is the stupidest thing I've ever read on reddit. Congratulations.

According to the letter from the King of Jordan - who may well represent the arab minority position of the time - many Jews didn't *want* to stay in Israel. Why is it stupid to think that they would have wanted to reclaim the property that was stolen from them after Nuremberg? The US and USSR had no problem dividing Germany amongst themselves, I'm sure it was within their power to hand ownership over to the Jews for stewardship rather than policing it themselves. Israel's formidable military could have been built just as easily in Berlin, and the same sanctions that kept the Nazi party dead could have been applied to protect the new Jewish state. They might have been neighbors to states that hated them, but that's not all that different from the situation that led to the Six Day war.  And had a new, smaller German territory tried to attack the new Jewish state, France, Poland, England, and the USSR would have been ready to crush it.

I don't see how the concept is stupid, considering that 50 years later, Israel is still under threat of attack.

I'm well informed on the history of the state of Israel, which is why I didn't understand the widespread distaste for Israel's militarism. It seemed like every recent action by the IDF has been provoked by the Arab nations surrounding Israel. Given the belligerent history of other states in the region, I've always seen the Israeli military response as completely justified, even somewhat restrained.

Comb_over may be biased and his source may represent a tiny fraction of Arabs that do no hate the Jews, but I wasn't curious about why Arabs hate Jews - their mainline position is widely publicized and easy to understand. They hate Israel because it exists on what they perceive as Arab land.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","This guy did well but not great in the game he was playing. I've seen and played plenty of CoD games better. I think it's important to keep in mind that there are more young inexperienced CoD players, so you're more likely to run into shitty players in a pub. Counter Strike has been out for long enough that most of your average players still have a decent amount of experience under their belts. Since CoD is more accessible than a game like CS, obviously you're gonna have a lot of shitty players, because anyone can just pick it up and play, even though it does actually take some time to get good at it.

This guy definitely has a point, and because it's a response to all the immature, retarded shit CoD players spew about other FPSs, I'm on his side in a sense. I just think he did it in a stupid way. As for his question at the end, I'm entirely certain I can do better than he did in a CoD game, but I'm also certain I couldn't beast all over everyone in CS. They're completely different games, even though they're in the same genre. His challenge is essentially meaningless. It doesn't prove anything.","1317429347"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That's so odd.  I've heard a lot of people saying that right before you die, a huge release of a chemical called **DMT** is released in the pineal glad (""third eye"", or as some philosophers once thought it as the ""seat of the soul"").  This chemical has also been synthesized and many around the world use it for its hallucinogenic effects.  But what is interesting is that there a shared ""trip"" or experience between DMT users, where they often see ""Machine Elves"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_elf), a kind of 'robotic light creature of infinite happiness and wisdom'.  Shamans of many South American indigenous cultures would often take an almost ""spirit quest"" by drinking Ayahuasca (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) that contained DMT.  They would have a similar experience of communicating with gods (often reptilian). Joe Rogan has some good insight on his experience with DMT (surprisingly, right? He's the host of Fear Factor!).  Also, a man named Terence McKenna researched these drugs a lot.  DMT also seems to be the chemically released in your brain while you dream.

Does this seem oddly coincidental to others too?","1317429350"

You'd be missing out if you didn't get to have that first run-in with a Beserker, or deal with the Kryll or that final giant FUCK YOU to RAAM (the hardest fucking boss ever in the series).

Then you get the second and although really good it loses the charm of being original, but it makes up for it with the increased depth of story.  You start to feel for the main characters.

The third thus far has been the bookend.  It's really good but does it compare to the first?  To me no, just because the first set the story.  It was all new.","1317429366"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","It depends on the way you look at it. The problem is not just that Greece is heavily indebted, but that it is heavily indebted to various European banks, primarily French and German. First it's in the interests of France and Germany  to prevent a default, because then they'd only have to spend the same money bailing out their banks, or settle down for another Lehman Brothers style meltdown. 

But like last time, such a meltdown would not just damage France and Germany, because financial institutions around the world would again be suddenly unwilling to lend elsewhere, not knowing the liabilities of other organizations, and not trusting them to be solvent. That reduces the all-round availability of credit both to other banks and to heavily indebted nations, causing a cascade which would probably knock over Ireland, which is on the edge at the moment. And British banks have absolutely massive liabilities in Ireland (on the order of 100 billion quid). Britain does not have the resources to do 2008 again, not without really damaging ourselves for a generation. 

Not to mention countries like Italy and Spain defaulting, leaving the Euro to devalue, possibly leading to the full-scale dissolution of the Euro and the temporary non-existence of a money system in Europe, which accounts for about 60% of our exports. Even Japan, without such liabilities and on the other side of the world, is sufficiently concerned to offer money as part of a Greek bailout, despite being more heavily in debt than Britain. So we should all be hoping that someone sorts this shit out. We would all profit from a resolution.

Get more glue traps and set them near doors in every room and under sofa and bed.  Move your bed away from any wall.

Spray bug spray around the outside of your doors.  There is around-the-house-spray as well.

Then you need to bug-bomb the whole house!  They sell these at the store cheap.  Stay out for the day if you and your pets can.

For a pet you may want to consider a Green Iguana since they have been known to eat bugs inside your house for you and are ever watchful.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Iguana

Get spray foam at the hardware dept or store and look for holes in your house to the out of doors and spray the foam in plugging those holes.  Get down on your belly and look from the floor under cabinets and in back of water heaters, you'll be surprised how many holes there are.

If this still is not enough you may want a priest to come over to your house and perform an exorcism of the house  (especially if you see dead Indian corpses popping out of the mud in your back yard).

"breakingbad","t5_2rlw4","Can I ask, what are other people's views on Tuco? Both on the character and the performance.

I personally found him to be an extremely over the top character, bordering on the ridiculous I have to say. Unlike pretty much every character on the show, I didn't find him to be very convincing. I don't know if it was the performance or the part, but it all seemed a bit forced - a caricature of criminal rather than a criminal.

Now the only justification for it I could think of, was that he inhabited a stage in the show where Walt and Jesse's involvement in the drug trade was somewhat naive and caricatured itself. This was alluded to when Jesse says to Walt at the scrapyard ""This is like a...a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet."" 

Maybe Tuco is supposed to represent that, a non-criminal's idea of criminal. a simplistic representation of the somewhat simplistic view people have of criminality and evil. This is starkly contrasted by Gus' character, a man different to Tuco in almost every way, but ultimately a source of much greater evil.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I think that's the crux of your problem. Horniness doesn't exist in a vacuum. For me, its usually directed at someone. Someone who makes me horny.

If you're with someone who isn't turning you on, you probably wont be horny. Its going to have the opposite effect - in a way, you are kind of raping yourself. Over time, that part of you will go to sleep. When you meet someone who does make you horny, it will wake up again.

A lot of people are directing you to a doctor. I don't know, maybe you have a medical issue. Chances are, its just the way you are at this moment in your life. Doesn't sound like you are really suffering or anything. You're still getting the occasional morning wood, so it sounds to me like your equipment is in working order.

I'm a bit older. There have been times in my life when I have been incredibly sexual, and times when I haven't been at all. The craziest time was after my parents died. After death comes life. Lots and lots of life, which I expressed through sex. One of the lowest points was after my divorce. My ex-wife had gone off sex for years, and that part of me had completely shut down. Wasn't until I met the nasty girl I spoke of that the fire was rekindled.

Maybe you're caught up in the male mythology that involves wandering around with a hardon wanting to fuck anything that moves. I guess some people are like that, at least, some times. I know one 60 year old Austrian guy who lives in the Dominican Republic and fucks 3 hookers a day. He says he has 5 or 10 years left in which he can fuck, and he intends to fuck as much as he possibly can. That's one way to live. Its a bit, um, obsessive, though. He's got a really hot younger wife, and, um, she is pretty good in the sack (*blush*).

You're trying to 'debug' the problem by looking at diet, meds, etc. Maybe there is something else that needs changing, like your relationship with this girl. Have you spoken to her about it? Might relieve some of the pressure you are putting on yourself.

So - some Yoda wisdom might be helpful here. There is do and not do, there is no try. Similarly there is be and not be, there is no want to be. Relax and don't be too hard on yourself. Sexuality is complicated. Bringing a whole bunch of expectations into the bedroom is a recipe for, well, a more complicated situation. 

The best advice, the simplest advice, and as always, the advice that is most difficult to follow, is to just be yourself. Life is perverse and paradoxical. Once you let go of all the wanting-to-be, trying-to-be, etc, completely accept your present situation, and live that situation to the fullest, somehow doors open and pathways appear.

In your case, this means just accepting that you're not very sexual right now. Use this time effectively - you have no distractions. Learn UNIX or something.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I perhaps didnt make myself very clear, when i say concentrate on male-female relationships, I dont mean at the individual level, I mean in the grand scheme of things.

When I talk about the male-female relationship, I mean that its the relationship which shape's the world's attitudes, and in my view homophobia and racism are partly a result of this fundamental relationship between men and women. Most people are straight, so it stands to reason that the attitude of the majority shapes the landscape. 

My belief is that women control men through female sexuality, and there's a shaming of men as 'gay' so as to shame men into giving women resources (for fear of being seen as gay).

I believe a part of racism is due to re-directed frustration at females, because its not ok to be frustrated and angry with females, because if you do, you are seen as 'bitter' or some other defect, and not worthy of a woman, but its ok to be frustrated and angry toward any other group, black, asian, or gay. 

Racism in men is also partly a result of competition between men (something women encourage), but because of the *its not ok to be angry at women, but its ok to be angry at men* situation, we men displace our anger onto other men, and in the case of racism, onto men of other origin.

We cant understand the problem if we focus on gay rights, we need to look at the relationship which is producing the problems above, and that is the male-female relationship.

Im not saying gay mens rights should be secondary, Im saying anything that doesnt relate to the male-female relationship discussion should be discussed in its own space.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","If we're looking for the (boring) kind of god who's like a giant dude flying around in space, then yeah, we probably would have seen him with a telescope by now. I'm not familiar enough with Christian beliefs to know if that's how they think he works.

There's only room left for a god who's very alien to us. But I think it's very important to remember that there are still plenty of phenomena, on the absurdly macroscopic and tiniest microscopic scales, and everything in-between, that we have no complete models (let alone explanations) for. To me, this doesn't remotely *indicate* the existence of a god, but I think there's plenty of room left for him to hide. Godlike attributes (omnipotence, etc) would indicate that he's somehow integrated with the very fabric of the universe, anyway.

If there's anything I've learned from science, it's that we understand *nothing*, and we probably never will.

edit: I think the most convincing idea of god is that he's the guy running the computer that's simulating our universe. But he's not omnipotent... he's subject to the physical laws of his reality, just as we are.","1317429421"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;No, you just took intro level econ and applied it to prohibition of a single, specific substance (alcohol, which is neither as addictive nor potent as the harder drugs mentioned, and was in prevalent use before prohibition went into effect) in one country. 

Actually, I'm paraphrasing research done by [Mark Thornton](http://mises.org/books/prohibition.pdf) (PDF). He's also looked at [meth](http://mises.org/daily/4971) too.

&gt;You seem to believe that making it completely legal and easy to obtain access to methamphetamine, heroin, crack cocaine, etc. will result in lower abuse of those substances. It won't, however, due to the inherent nature of those substances.

Why is it that when these substances were legal that usage and problems were far less? Seriously, show me how many overdoses there were when meth was commercially available in the 1950s, or before heroin was banned in 1914, etc. Then, compare those deaths to the number of deaths from poor substitutes and violence due to prohibition.

&gt;Right now, I couldn't get meth or heroin if I wanted to, while I could buy a pack of smokes easily. Let's say I'm 13 and a little curious about what the big deal around crack cocaine is, so I try some.

I don't see how this is an anti-legalization argument. Actually, kids have access to more illicit drugs than they do the legal ones precisely because of the black market. 

I'm sure you know a guy that knows a guy that could get meth. Or if it isn't prevalent in your particular geographic area, you could get something different. Feigning ignorance about where to get drugs doesn't prove your point. 

You say people on drugs don't lead productive lives? I can point to many alcoholics who don't lead productive lives, and they are the minority of people who use that drug. I know plenty of people who take harder drugs and they function too. There is a silent majority of users who are able to handle their habits, and there are a minority that cannot. 

The question you still haven't answered is why drugs still exist, their prevalence hasn't decreased, and they are getting more potent even with prohibition. If the reason why alcohol prohibition failed was simply because ""too many people wanted to drink,"" then why hasn't drug prohibition worked to stop drug usage with their comparatively lower usage rates?

Further, you say to be wary of ""transposing the results"" of Portugal to the US, yet it's obvious how in Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK that decriminalization has led to better outcomes, and prohibition in the US has led to worse outcomes. So, if you're going to defend prohibition you're going to have to show the positives, which as I've demonstrated there are none. The drugs become more dangerous, usage doesn't decrease, and it becomes a massive money pit where the government spends more money trying to fix the problems of prohibition by creating more criminals and destroying the rights of those who haven't done anything wrong. I can't even get pseudoephedrine without being treated like a criminal for having a cold. That's prohibition's fault. 

&gt;This is all well and true, but it doesn't address the fact that substances like meth and heroin are far more destructive than alcohol.

They may be more harmful individually, yet alcohol is one of the most socially destructive drugs there are. How many people get in a car and drive after they smoke rocks? How many deaths do the hard drugs cause each year compared to alcohol? 

Prohibition does not work. You're just simply saying that these drugs are dangerous, which they are, but prohibition hasn't fixed the problems; it's only created new ones which are far worse.","1317429434"

For a balloon this means that it will start to swell or enlarge, as the air inside the balloon must expand in order to lower its pressure by the same amount.  The balloon has only a certain amount of volume expansion that it can take before it rips, so the ultimate fate of all balloons is to pop.  Now, if you make the balloon out of really stretchy material and you don't inflate it very far, then it might get quite high up before bursting.  This is the case with weather balloons, which can reach the edge of space before bursting.

However the short list of people who will be celebrated in 500 years probably includes (and I'm trying to pull from a variety of fields here.)

* Stephen Hawking
* George R.R. Martin
* Bill Gates
* Barrack Obama
* Neil Armstrong
* Paul McCartney
* Bill Clinton


Obviously I'm biased towards American history here, but considering America is such a big player right now I would make sense for some of the most celebrated people 500 years from now to be from U.S. history. Some other people who might be celebrated then, but I feel less comfortable naming simply because I don't know enough about them, include: 

* Angela Merkel
* Mikhail Gorbachev
* possible Vladimir Putin and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in their respective countries, depending upon the course of history. 


It's difficult to say for certain because people who are seen as heroes today often get forgotten. It is the strong and the influential who are remembered. Even if people didn't like them when they ruled many people look back with fondness on some leaders. Lincoln was not really a big hero in America until he was assassinated and became a martyr. We certainly think of him much more fondly than Americans did at the time. Similarly I believe if JFK had run through a full presidency he probably wouldn't be nearly as well remembered. His assassination somehow turned him into a hero in people's eyes.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","Can you ascertain that all the people you met are native Mandarin speakers or speakers whose mother tongue is Mandarin, and not any other Chinese languages? 

You've already gotten many people attesting that they have found Mandarin speakers to have no problem distinguishing English Rs and Ls, so what you observe seems like something highly unusual and unlikely, but let's say it does occur.

So here are a couple of possibilities:

* One. What you say is really true, that the Chinese people you meet are all native Mandarin speakers AND they all mix up Rs and Ls no matter if its English, Dutch, or German in all situations.

* Two. The Chinese people you meet did not all have Mandarin as their first language, but some other Chinese language that does not distinguish R and L to begin with, and that's what causes them to turn all Rs into Ls no matter what. For these speakers, the spelling can potentially contribute to the problem, because whenever they see ""r"", even if in real native speech of the foreign language it can be trilled or uvular depending on context, they'll just produce L.

* Three. There are other more complicated reasons contributing to the phenomena, that may involve anything from what other language these Chinese speakers might have learned before, influence of the established overseas Chinese community that they may be involved in (I do know most established Chinese communities in Europe tend to be from the south of China as well)  

* Four. Less likely, but definitely probable: Some of them have dealt with too many new foreign languages at the same time (let's say at least two at the same time, English and Dutch). They mix the two languages because it's psychologically too taxing to consciously deal with all the different new sounds all the time and switching back and forth between 3 systems, so for ""simplicity"" and ""laziness"" they just put all the Rs and Ls together no matter the context and produce them all as Ls.

* Five. Also less likely, but not improbable: Actually, the Mandarin speakers do differentiate Rs and Ls in English if they spoke it exclusively in an English-only environment, but in a multilingual environment where they have to switch back and forth between languages with different Rs, it is just easier to not bother, especially if they are not fluent enough in English to begin with.

* Six. A combo of some of the above or other reasons or scenarios I can't think of right now.

If what you observed in 1. is really true, I personally can't think of any good simple linguistic explanation for it at this moment.","1317429453"

It's not too easy to see the improved graphics on Metro, some things have just slightly improved whilst others greatly...eg. lightning and character animation. I mean the improvement is there but it's not obvious to see unless you got it next to BF:BC2.

I don't know if you got to play Caspian Borders but there you really saw how pretty BF3 is. Not only better graphics than BC2 but the maps are much much larger. Quite a shame that they didn't want to test Caspian Borders a bit longer. Only having Metro is going to ""kill"" that map. Everyone's going to be sick of it even before the game is released!

Now one might say it's the same for BF:BC2 beta, and yes to an extent BUT you had more variety, you had UAVs, tanks, quads, helicopters and buildings to take down! The only real big destruction you see in Metro is in the end..that you only get to once in a while. Minor destruction you see all the time of course but that's not enough to keep the map fresh for release.","1317429462"

BF is fed up. His sister is a very manipulative person and while he doesn't want to have to chose sides, obviously, he recognizes the way she's treating me/us is just rude and unfair.

&gt;During a booster draft, double-faced cards are open information that players are neither penalized for revealing nor required to conceal. Players may reveal either face of a double-faced card to other drafters during the draft. A player may take reasonable steps to conceal the identity of a double-faced card if he or she wishes, but is not required to do so. However, players must still remain seated during the draft.

&gt;...

&gt;As of the release of Innistrad, a player may place a newly drafted card anywhere on or in his or her pile of drafted cards. This is true of all cards, not only double-faced cards or in drafts that include double-faced cards. If desired, a player may start his or her pile of drafted cards with a basic land or checklist card and put any drafted double-faced cards underneath it.

Backstory:  Having been permabanned from the game, this fallen summoner has entered the League of Legends as an attempt to redeem himself in the eyes of RiotPendragon.

Passive: ""Endlessly Annoying"" - Every ability this champ uses sends a line of text to All Chat, disrupting communication and aggravating teammates and opponents alike.  Cannot be /ignored.  

Q: ""OMG, that champ is so OP"" - Kills himself to do damage based on number of champ kills target champion has.

W: ""QQ more"" - creates 1/2/3/4/5 clones of himself, who charge at the nearest champion with the most deaths and do melee attacks.

E: ""I'm gonna feed."" - Charges himself in direction of mouse for a short distance.  Upon stopping, casts a magic damage AoE attack. Additionally, upon stopping, an armor and magic debuff is cast all around him, affecting all champs and minions in a radius, including himself.

R: ""This team sucks, I'm gonna AFK"" - Creates a stationary clone of himself as he goes stealth.  Next attack does bonus damage based on the difference between his creep score and the enemy champion's creep score.","1317429491"

I recommend reading [this article](http://www.draftmagic.com/2010/12/14/the-chosen-five-a-journey-through-magic-history-part-1/) (the last section titled Jasmine Boreal).  
The thing is, those crappy vanilla humans aren't legends because they're great cards, they're legends because they're incredibly powerful *humans*.  
They're legends within the Magic universe, not in the collectible card game meta. The example the article uses is that Jasmine Boreal (a 4/5 vanilla human) is legendary because she can kill a Hill Giant and battle a Craw Wurm to death, and she's just a human. Killing giants and dragons are legendary acts. :)  
In generally a 2/2 is a master human... A 1/1 is a regular soldier. A 4/5 human (or that other guy... the vanilla 4/4) is a truly legendary individual. ","1317429497"

So the Night goes on and we were both complete intoxicated. Stumbled into my room we land on my bed, she then goes down on me... at this point i thought i heard her say that ""Has never slept with some one before""... at this point i was not completely sure if that's what she actually said and i could have cared less. After she is done going down on me it gets blurry ... except that i know we tried to have sex but i couldn't get in her, it was a drunken sloppy mess. Anyway the next morning i wake up in my bed with no one next to me, i go to brush my teeth but before i get out of bed i felt something wet all over the one side of the bed. At first i was afraid that i my have pissed my self, i dabbed my hand in the dark wet spots on my blue bedding at the time and realized that it was Blood. i took my sheets and threw them down the trash shoot immediately after.

That would leave just the weekends, when most places are closed and you've got the competition of 20.000 other students in town. Also, some 20.000 non-students looking for the same 'easy' jobs during weekends.

Sure, in contrast, some friends of mine are in university and have 3 lectures per week and some assignments if they're unlucky. If you find yourself in that boat, by all means work for your money.

You see, they were bums, but he was just one phone call away from his old salary.

He also spent a lot of his time cursing the government.  ""Why, if there weren't so many government employees taking money out of the economy, I'd be back to work in no time.""  While he was absolutely right about that, when his unemployment ran out, he was offered, and subsequently accepted, a job at the unemployment office.

Two years ago I started making more than he ever did.  He said I was lucky and that without his prompting I never would have made anything of myself.  What looked like luck to him was really years of schooling and hard, grueling work.  And I guess his idea of prompting was completely ignoring me most of the time to the point of uttering only a few sentences a week at me.

Probably the only reason you'd need to extend Collection or one of its subclasses is to add functionality or do something different than what they can do.

For treating n-dice as a single object, you do probably want to make a Dice object that wraps around several Die objects so that you won't have to be iterating over List&lt;Die&gt; or Set&lt;Die&gt; everywhere, which means you can add your own functionality and semantics to make your life easier:

"depression","t5_2qqqf","You have a sickness, ok? Like, a cold or a broken arm. Both colds and broken arms just happen, and they're not your fault. If you went to a doctor, and *didn't* tell them about your broken arm, it would be absolutely crazy. And you're not crazy, you're just depressed. That's all.

Depression isn't a state of being in which you're stuck forever. It isn't a sentence you get for having done some wrong. It's a chemical imbalance exacerbated by mood and circumstance. So absolutely, completely, without a doubt - raise it with your doctor. Even if you're cheerful in the moment, to overcompensate, just describe your symptoms as you've described them here. Heck, print out your original post and bring it with you - hand it to your doctor and say, ""Does this sound like depression to you?"" It's that simple.

I know that it feels like changing your postal code will leave all your troubles behind. And who knows? Maybe the energy and excitement of a new place and a fresh start is just the sort of thing to give you that head start that lets you do the hard work of dealing with your depression. But....that's a slim chance.

On behalf of American men who would like to have more gorgeous, smart, funny, creative English women around, I still encourage you to relocate to the U.S. But...do it because you're headed towards something bright, instead of fleeing something dark, and you stand a better chance of making the right move.

This is not a life sentence. You just need the tools to beat it. There are lots of tools to use - many arrows in that quiver - medicine, talk therapy, cognitive therapy, physical activity, communing with nature - you name it. But if it's really depression, it won't go away on its own, you'll have to do the work. But you can! You totally can!

And once you have, you'll be better equipped to detect it early and fend it off if it ever happens again in the future, too. Use those tools. Be honest with your friends, family and loved ones. Communicate as much as you can, because it's what will keep you engaged in the struggle, instead of brushing it under the carpet and keeping a stiff upper lip. No quiet desperation for you, ok? Make that desperation loud - so that it's also brief. ","1317429528"

I think I might take your advice and make a mental commitment to him and try to focus on other things (like my thesis!) I just have a really obsessive personality and the more I think about how I'm not supposed to think about something, the more I think about it. Urg!

As for grad school, I would want to go straight into my PhD and do clinical psych, but that's 6-7 years of grad school so I need to know what city he would be stationed in before I could figure that out.

As for getting deployed, since Canada has pulled out of an active combat role in Afghanistan and his specialty would be intelligence, and he would be fresh out of training, they would probably wait awhile before deploying him (although he can volunteer if he wanted to).

I was thinking about delaying grad school anyway just because I am a workaholic and I tend to do summer school, so I've been in school for 25 months straight. By the end of april it will be 32 months straight. I think it might be nice to make myself take a break before going back to school for 6-7 years straight. As well, it would be nice to pay down some of my credit card debt.

It is very unlikely to overdose by smoking or vaporizing or eating marijuana, but the [LD50 values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol#Toxicity) for THC are known for mice and rats and dogs and monkeys. We experiment on animals because human experimentation is unethical. I wouldn't dare to think it can't happen to humans. Personally I think it's more likely that someone high dies in an accident, or leads to an accident where someone dies.

Once marijuana is legal, it *will* be concentrated, just like smoke shops sell 40x salvia. According to the LD50 values, a six pound dog can die after eating 1.4g of pure THC.

Apparently the Marinol pill (which contains THC) has killed 4 people. Then there's the problem of people using marijuana with other drugs. THC has over 400 drug interactions. And if people mix marijuana with alcohol they can be even more impaired. If they use marijuana and two other drugs, or forget what they'v taken due to short term memory loss, they could end up with liver failure.","1317429565"

FUN PROs
-weapon sets w/ bonuses (like in games like Diablo 2)
-rare plants that give permanent stat bonuses (like in Risen)
-collectibles (like in most 360 games)
-achievements (like in most 360 games)
-spell runes(like spellbooks) and enchanted gems(like sigil stones)
-dungeons with interesting bosses and rewards
-better crafting, mining, smithing, hunting, etc.

ANNOYING CONs
-combat is a little iffy.  Some of the mobs are basically unable to hit you so long as you aren't entirely stationary.  
-leveling is a slightly modified version of vanilla oblivion, but has some flaws, like the only skill that raises Speed is Light Armor (wtf?)

I'd give it an 8.5/10, and I don't mind the German dialogue at all.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","The Earth is trying to move in a straight line with momentum carried over from the formation of the solar system as everything collapsed together. If you were to spin on ice with your arms out, you would go a certain speed, but if you bring your arms in, your speed increases. All the matter coming in does the same thing as it circles the center (which became the sun), so the planets got a good amount of momentum going.

The earth tries to move straight, but the bending of space-time around the sun causes it to ""fall"" around it. It's like you spinning a ball on a string. The ball would move out in a straight line if you let go, but it keeps going around because you're constantly pulling it towards you. If it slowed down enough, it would come closer. 

If the Earth lost speed, it would probably fall closer, which may allow it to pick up speed. Actually it does basically do this every year as it flies outward in an elliptical pattern. As it gets far, it slows, then it falls back toward the Sun, picking up speed and flying back out again. We're currently flying toward the Sun now that Winter is on it's way in North America.","1317429585"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Not a question but a comment...My family and I saw Mick at Santa's Village in NH two summers ago.  He was in the park, presumably vacationing with his kids(?) and he seemed to be having a ball just doing the rides and playing the games.  Was pleasant to everyone around him, note that he was not swarmed or as when I saw hounded for autographs, just a regular guy.  Closed one of the rides gates when my six year old started to inch a little too close before the attendant got back to the gate.  Just an pleasure to see someone who works so hard to entertain others, to have what appeared to be a genuinely good time with his kids.

Dressed up in the obligatory bright red Hawaian shirt and shorts.  Up close you realize how big these guys are - he is huge!  I am six foot and go over 300 pounds, but I felt tiny next to the guy.  I did  notice that while moving around the park, that he did have a noticeable shuffle, not really a limp, but a shuffle.  You could also see the scars from the years of abuse that he has taken to thrill and entertain the fans.

As a big fan, I just want to thank you Mick, for the hours of entertainment - both of the wrestling variety and comedic nuggets...also, from my observation, being a good father, enjoying the fruits of your labors with your kids...thanks!

PS - I did do a fanboy photo op of Mick riding on the roller coaster when my kids were on [Mick Foley on a roller coaster](http://i.imgur.com/JxKYN.jpg)

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Please don't include everyone in your blanket statements.  I'm born and raised in Western Canada, and in 39 years have never referred to anything but one of [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_knife) as a butter knife. I've never heard a single person refer to a normal-size (~matches the length/is a cm longer than typical forks/spoons) and everyone I've ever heard refer to those calls them a [table knife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_knife).  

So your blanket statement based on your limited population sample is false.  It may apply to you, but not to everyone else.  Similarly, my statements are based on the people I've known living in Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Calgary, and Edmonton, and don't even apply to everyone in those regions.

People I know have always referred to serrated/sharp knives as steak knives.  

Either way, butter is yummy, as are steaks, and I understand that if you lather a steak in butter, roll it in rock salt, leave it over knight, give it a quick rinse and grill it, that it tastes amazing...and you won't care about the knife you use to cut it...unless it's a butter knife which sucks for cutting stuff.

Jung, Freud, and their peers in the Analytical school of Psychology come up all of the time in the arts because their ideas sound cool and mysterious.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Then please enlighten me and indicate in which panels they are portrayed. I grant that the words worth, value, bidding, pay, discount, high yeild, savings account and interest all appear, as well as the metaphor 'the market has spoken', all enticing to the pecuniary mind.

I am speaking generally, not specific to the example. But anyway, worth, value, bidding, pay, discount, yield, savings, interest and 'the market' all derive from ordinal utility, which itself derives from philosophical views on the self, on self-ownership, natural rights, etc.

&gt;Is a complex and daunting statement, hardly seeming to be gainsaid, relying on a popular conception of economics. I take it this is meant as your explanation of how 'philosophy informs a view on the economy', which if it isn't an inaccurate paraphrase, I am to infer philosophy tinges my view of the supposed hypothetical economic interaction, a fifth inference.

I'm just trying to say that economic theory has certain philosophical views as its foundation. I suppose if your philosophical viewpoints varied from the foundation viewpoints, then yes this would affect your view of economics.

&gt; I might be inclined to deny any one the inferences thus far, but you seem otherwise capable enough to draw the obvious conclusions from common arguments.

&gt;This is to the effect that, if a price can be put on anything, then everything is economic. ... However If economics isn't conceived of so broadly, abstrusely (and Mill might have said repugnantly), but adheres more strictly to its traditional domain, say 'the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life' (with many quaint formulations to choose from), its preeminence and applicability here vanish. Deductions from or concerning human nature, and any consequent differing views are the traditionally the stronghold of philosophy within its domain, to borrow Hume. ... The motivation for, and elucidating these basic points and arguments, is very roughly how 'an economy' informs a view on philosophy.

Ah, I see what you are saying now. I'm not trying to say economics is a good replacement for philosophy, I'm pretty sure I agree with you that philosophy should be primary here. I view economics as sort of 'well given so and so qualities of man as presented by philosophy, how would complex interactions between many men in a world of scarce resources look?' Hence my initial confusion.

&gt;Alas I was under the impression you were asking what a utilitarian would do. Do you disagree Mill represents or is not an able defender of the general utilitarian position? If you are suggesting there is a more relevant or able modern utilitarian, whose contributions are more applicable here, the onus would seem to be on you to explain that, and introduce them, but that suffers from the obvious criticisms already outlined.

Oh no, Mill is the utilitarian. I'm just saying I already understood what Mill/a utilitarian would do and that I needed no explanation.

&gt;Which? How to construct some abstract function, or providing a counterexample for an academic theorem? I apologize, and repeat, I am not presently well versed with either of those, and will add I am not convinced of their relevance, not having encountered them among the writings of classical economicsts or utilitarians and thus cannot provide you with satisfaction either presently, soon, necessarily here, or possibly at all.

Ok, that's fine. Was just wondering if you had an opinion on it. If you don't, thats ok.

Regarding being relevant, story time! Once upon a time a bunch of utilitarian in philosophy and economist in job title type people had the idea that if they could actually create some kind of formula that perfectly encapsulated the utility of all actions, they'd be able to make an unbiased public policy machine which would always spit out the answer to all social questions. Then a guy named Ken Arrow came along and explained how that was all impossible with a as of yet still proven mathematical proof.

Thus Ken Arrow showed it was impossible to use a mathematical formulation of utilitarian theory to make social decisions. I was wondering if, as a utilitarian, you had any comment on that. If you are unfamiliar: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem","1317429637"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","In my opinion, that are good weapons which give you a good kick in your gameplay, that's right, but only in teamplay. 1on1 would be harsh, but still, possible.
The medic melee weapons are not really necessary to be honest. I like the ubersaw the most, but for what? No more damage, no reduced HP, just that loading of uber and slower firing speed. Does that matter? I don't think so.

Equalizer is the only weapon, which I think it's really necessary for that class. But otherwise, think of that. Both soldiers, both 5 hp. One standard, the other one with Equalizer. Just pull your shotgun and he's down.

Sandvich isn't also necessary. I've loaded the heavy with standardweapons. Sometimes you just need quick shots more than your own health. Otherwise, health would do it. But it depends on your situations.

What are you blaming about the flamethrower? It's just fine, it has flames and backblast. What do you want more? Backburner is the shit. Useful on massive servers without strategy, but nowhere else.
The Degreaser is good, but only if you use the Axtingusher besides. But against a pyro it's nothing else than the standard flamethrower.

Sniper with full set? Fuck him with rockets.

The strategy in that game is to choose the class what are the best against your enemy or for your team. The weapons do just slight difference to it, but nothing worth to speak of.","1317429671"

To some degree this would fall on the mods, but it's a big gap between online moderator and IRL coordinator. And no-one's being paid for services rendered.

Remorse isn't, however, I fear that I might just be a terribly selfish person, and that all of my ""emotions"" (like remorse) might just be selfish attempts to try to emulate popular behavior to get people to like me. I appreciate empathy, but I also like to get people to like me, which is – I'm afraid – a trait of a psychopath who goes by unnoticed and gains power, rather than an arrest record.

Then again, perhaps psychopathy wears off? Or, and I think this might actually be more accurate, I think I might have an alternate personality who's an asshole, and I happened to remember things that he did long ago. Today isn't the first time someone's told me about something asshole-ish that I've done of which I have zero recollection.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I will speak as a medical student in Canadian healthcare. There is, for better or worse, some truth to what the Facebook OP says, even though it is not nearly as drastic as a 16-hour wait (I don't know about Quebec but in my province it's pretty standard to be seen within 4 hours for most problems). However, the opposite (salary-based compensation) is equally bad for wait times, in fact, there is only one way to reduce waiting times and that is reimbursing for it.

The way patient flow is driven depends on the type of capitation to ER docs. In hospitals with a mixed salary/per-patient reimbursement (or full-salary, which is rare/doesn't exist yet), emergency physicians have little incentive to see lots of patients because they do not get paid enough to do so.

(Imagine if you are a barber making $50,000/year cutting hair at $25/haircut and at a new shop you now make $30,000 salary for doing nothing, plus $5/haircut, you can see how most people wouldn't bother working too hard in such a system).

However, because they have no interest in lots of patients, when things do get busy, they are much more likely to call in for help (the ""on call physician"") so even though wait times may be long, they tend to be fairly stable.

In contrast, some hospitals pay on a per-patient/per-procedure basis. While what the poster says about ""cutting time in half"" is retarded (emergency doctors work on shifts, so 2 doctors seeing 100 patients is no faster than 1 doctor seeing 50), what is true is that physicians like to constantly have patients waiting to be seen as opposed to the opposite, because any lull time is time they are spent at work not getting paid.

(Going back to the barber example, if you can cut 10 people's hair per shift, would you rather have 13 people come during your shift, or 7?).

The evidence shows that, the best way to reduce wait times is to incentivize it. This is what many hospitals are doing already - many have a 'flow manager' that ensures no patient stays beyond certain hours before a certain action (discharged, admitted, seen by specialist, CT scan'd, etc.) and there are also financial incentives to refer/discharge by X hours.

I would also like to reassure those that say this is 'just another example of Canada's poor healthcare system' is that I have not gone into triage at all. The fact is, if you are someone with an acute MI, you will be getting PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) within 2 hours. If you are a patient coming in with stroke, you will be put on the stroke clock and (if indicated) you will get tPA thrombolysis within 4 hours. If you are an active trauma or resuscitation you will be seen within 1-2 minutes of arrival by EMS.

Unfortunately if you are like 90% of the population that comes in with a sore throat or gastroenteritis or chronic low back pain, you will wait. :P","1317429686"

Week 4 Log: I was totally dead this week. No practice on my own, craploads of work to do, and I could only bring myself to go to one class this week, and even then my performance was anemic at best. Fortunately I can mentally retain what is demonstrated to me, and we worked on some nice combos that I will spend time practicing once I'm up and ready to go at it.","1317429696"

But I have stuck through it, I don't know what it is but even if the race ends up being pretty boring, I still get so excited knowing it's Sunday and that means I get to watch the race (or saturday as the case may be).  I feel like my overall excitement is still there, but not sure of what's going to happen when Jeff finally does call it quits.  I get the feeling he has a good 5 strong years left in him.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Downvoted - for anyone who actually understands game theory this was article should have induced a small headache due to how poorly it was applied here.

I am a frequent trash talker and I can safely say that nothing about other player's trash talking has ANY effect on my own decision to engage in it. If the other team is telling us to report their Caitlyn and she is just trolling in chat, I don't just into the fray. Even if my own team is getting pissed off at someone, i.e. a bottom lane partner who botched a tower dive or something, I typically don't engage in verbal beatdowns just because OMG PRISONER'S DILEMMA because... those utility incentives just don't apply in this situation. Hell, I'm probably more likely to rage at someone in a relatively civil game because I want to let them know that they are making poor choices even though the rest of the team seems to be accepting of them. Likewise, if someone is already getting trashed by teammates and the insults are beginning to get people distracted/killed, then I'm more likely to tell everyone to drop the fighting and focus on the game. 

TL:DR: Trash talking in video games doesn't even come close to replicating the Prisoner's dilemma in terms of decision incentives. ","1317429707"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I think there's a lot of problems going on in the relationship, which I interpret as:

1. Self-esteem issues on her part.
2. Differences in how you express yourselves emotionally (be it love or anger).
3. *Possible* depression on your part compounding the issue.
4. Dismissiveness from you, overreaction from her.

**Sorry for the TL;DR, but you can always skip what's between the blue text if you're not interested in that.**

**The following is why I think this might be the case.**
-----
&gt;Talking to her doesn't solve my work problems or fix my friendship problems, so ultimately I still feel shitty. 

It's fine that you think that way--but this might be a fundamental difference in how you handle being in a relationship. Some people--particularly women--like words of encouragement and moral support. To be cheered up. Some people are cheered just by knowing their SO cares. It sounds to me that she doesn't understand that it's not the same for everyone. You sounded a bit dismissive of her efforts, and that could be angering her or making her feel bad--although I don't know if the tone you took here is the one you used with her, or if she picked up on it.

But I imagine she doesn't understand why her presence and words don't make you feel good, when it would make her feel good. This isn't saying you're doing something bad, this is saying that having a fundamental difference in how you go about relationships or how you see/interact with people often causes friction, because she feels she's not doing enough, and/or that you don't care that she's trying.

&gt;I find out today that she was so upset about this because I knowingly made her drive back home by herself (she has a fear of driving at night by herself)

She should have said it would have upset her. She doesn't have any right to hold it against you if she didn't express it would have made her feel bad. If you made her do it anyway, she might have something to be upset about, but she didn't. That's not saying that it wouldn't have been nice of you to remember and try to be extra appreciative about it, but you certainly can't be faulted for not doing so.

&gt;and that she thinks she's a bad girlfriend because she can't even cheer me up.

Yes, I sense self-esteem issues. They sound similar to mine, when I was younger.

It was hard of me to bring up things that I felt were burdensome, even if they were things I felt were important. So I wouldn't say anything, but I'd still get upset over them, and then I'd blame myself, but I'd also be angry at the other person...

&gt;She tells me I'm not trying at all and it's making her very unhappy.

Again, I think she just doesn't understand the differences in expression.

&gt;I care about her very much and all of my effort goes unnoticed whenever one bad things happens. And when that bad thing happens, all of a sudden I'm a bad boyfriend.

OP, it does sound like you might have a problem with negativity and depression.

Your expressions of love and endearment might be too different--if you see helping her with her laundry as the ultimate expression of love, and she doesn't, she probably doesn't translate you as doing a lot of amazing things for her. However, she might see being there for you as important, and since you reject her efforts, it seems like you don't care. 

It does seem like you both have issues in how you express and communicate with each other. I don't think your take on a relationship is entirely healthy:

&gt;She overreacts all the time about the littlest things, and it leads to her getting very mad at me.

Depends. I'd have to know what they were about. Maybe she feels like you are highly dismissive of her.

&gt;I end up apologizing just so things can be good again. 

And this seems like you never try to resolve the issue to her satisfaction, but rather you both defend your points of view without coming to an agreement, until you crack and just apologize. Which doesn't solve the issue, and means there are lingering bad feelings, and that the issue will keep coming up, and might be leaving you both dissatisfied. 

&gt;I almost never get mad at her because the little things don't need to be fought over. 

But do you still feel resentment? Do you think ""I'm mad, but I don't want to express myself and get into a big fight""? Because not saying anything doesn't mean there's no problem that needs to be dealt with. Do you blame *her*, internally, for not expressing yourself? Do you think, ""I don't want to fight because I'll only have to apologize and she makes such a big deal about things it's not worth it?""

Possible fixes
----
Examination first. *Are* you depressed--clinically depressed, not just in a rough spot? If so, you might want to seek help. 

Try to figure out what she does, specifically, that makes you mad, and why it makes you mad. Try to form as coherent an explanation as possible. If you're bearing a grudge (and I think you both are), it might be overshadowing the relationship.

Once you have an idea, sit down and talk to her. Tell her you've been having problems. Explain what you've been thinking. Give her a chance to explain. I can really only offer advice like ""Just talk and try to be honest"", because these things are sort of on a play-by-play basis, but the idea is that you want to come out of it with all of your feelings expressed, with an idea of why it's been happening, and what you both need to do about it.","1317429713"

OP, your anus isn't ready for a penis yet. Keep working on that finger. If it hurts, stop.

In my case, I didn't have a plan. I was close to just going nuts and attend a culinary school and rack up more debt, and risk being a low paid food service worker until I can get my own restaurant. I decided that wasn't very practical.

I ended up taking a full time job at a utility company customer service center. Shitty hours, bad pay and benefits, with the hope that if I stick with the company, baby boomers would retire and I can bid on apprenticeship positions. (union company) I was in the call center a year, bid out to a clerical job with a meager pay boost and gained excellent benefits. Did that for a year and now I am a bottom level field worker. It isn't glamorous, I work nights alone, but it works. I still don't have an apprentice level job, but I have had training on all sorts of construction equipment and the company paid and trained me for a CDL license. I got lucky.

Obviously the altered state of mind is the result of a chemical reaction in the brain, and many people say they felt this sense of interconnectedness while tripping that has lasted well after the drug wore off.

And as for the OP's sex question, in different particular cases you will find just about every situation you can imagine. Most women do still want sex, but they *generally* do not pursue it as much as men do. This does not mean that they do not want it, but they do tend to be more selective about with whom and at what times.

To your third point - I agree as someone who lives here that it would be nice to have more time, but you have to consider the artists, most of whom *don't* live here. Extending the initial vote to more than a week makes it difficult for out-of-town artists to participate.

This was at the Reno Air Races a few years ago (the same annual event where the p-51 crashed into the crowd a couple weeks ago). My dad raced in the Formula One class which are these little small one-seater planes designed solely for racing. I got to be on the runway itself as part of his pit crew so I was really close to the action. 

As the 8 planes in his race came around a turn near the crowd on their second or third lap one of the front-runner planes clipped the wing of another plane and they both instantly went down. One plane nose dived straight into the ground and crumbled apart instantly, the other crash landed a few seconds later...It happened so fast that I only saw that the plane that crumbled had a similar color to my dad's plane.  So for about a ten minute period of time I thought I had just witnessed my dad die right in front of me. It wasn't him but the pilot who nose dived to the ground did die instantly. The other guy who crash landed somehow walked away with minor cuts and bruises. I gave my dad a huge hug when he was back on the ground.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm sorry to hear about all this, it must have been really tough losing your mom at such a young age. Like you, my mom also never drank/smoke, took hormonal bc, was a healthy weight and nursed all of us for at least 4-6 months. At 28 years old she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which is extremely young. I'm 21 now and am supposed to get mammograms done every year since 19, but was pregnant/nursed my daughter while I did have health insurance. Now, unfortunately I have no health insurance and can't get one done :/ My thoughts on the issue though is that as long as you're taking care of yourself, checking yourself monthly and get mammograms when the doctor recommends so, (from what I've read/know) breast cancer is a treatable cancer, and the majority of women will survive as long as it is caught early enough. I personally would not get a major surgeries done trying to prevent it, such as a hysterectomy, but I love children and hope to have a lot more. However, I do try to do smaller things like not be on hormonal BC for long periods of time and I try to remember to check myself every month/other month. 

This is something that's really up to you, and it is whatever you feel is the best way to go about it. I would most likely suggest talking to a doctor, telling them your family history and let them give you advice.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","I think she might have been aware of Snape liking her. But he kind of threw it out of the window when he called her a mudblood. After that, she probably didn't care because she knew Snape was getting too far into the dark arts. Also James really fixed his attitude and stopped attacking Snape and became Head Boy. He seemed to have really tried hard to impress Lily by being a good student. We know how taken by James was because of her patronus. So even though James used to be Snape's tormentor, both of them had changed. James for the better and Snape for the worse.

As for them having Harry at a young age, I think maturity in the wizarding world is different. They graduate at 17 and go straight into their full time career. Putting this into perspective, Lily worked for probably 3-4 years before having Harry (most people say 21). I think if college didn't take so long and kids graduated at 17 irl there would be a lot more people having kids because they could actually support a child because they had a job. And yeah, James and her defied Lord Voldemort several times and escaped which is badass. She already did have an awesome career. Perhaps she felt like it was her duty to protect innocent people against Voldemort instead of doing something like potions career. Gryffindors /are/ supposed to be the brave ones. Also they had a crap ton of money, so it would be wrong to say they probably weren't successful. ","1317429785"

"AlienBlue","t5_2rt3a","I had to down vote, but I'll at least explain why and maybe you can change my mind. I am a pretty avid Reddit user and I'm using the iPad app almost exclusively. I keep my subscriptions down pretty low to achieve the most preferable front page. A lot of people subscribe to a lot of reddits--some people don't.

That being said I still check out new subreddits all the time. Whether it's in a comment or a direct link I'm finding new ones to explore every day it seems. I just feel like if this app asked me to join the subreddit right off the bat every time then that would get kind of annoying. Especially considering sometimes people in bed links in text which means I'll be getting it even when I don't intend on wanting it at all.

Furthermore, I like seeing the actual CSS web site when I look at new subreddits. Some of them have great personality and design that you would otherwise be missed if you don't connect to the mobile in-app browser. You can glean some insight from how the subreddit presents itself. Besides, while you're there you can read the sidebar, which is great because (as far as I know) this app will only let you read the sidebar info of a subreddit you are currently subscribed to. Now that would be helpful. Maybe a button or something at the top to give you the option to ""Read Sidebar Info"", ""Subscribe"", or ""Shelf"" which would add the subreddit to the ""Casual Subreddits"" list. 

(That nifty casual subreddits list is a great way to stash rarely used, or single serve reddits. That or for testing a subreddit to see if you will seek it out again, even in a insignificant way. I have dumped some boarder line subreddits this way and avoided a lot of junk. I could never do any of these things on the website. Props to the dev.)

We've stayed as true as possible to Mechwarrior franchise and we have a completely open Non-Commercial Agreement with Microsoft to do as we will with the franchise. I love how after our game debuted new Mechwarrior games arose from the ashes. That means we did something right.

If you'd like to play a Mechwarrior game built from the ground up by Battletech/Mechwarrior fans, please, play our game. It's in open beta and we update it all the time. You can usually find a copy of Crysis Warhead on Steam for cheap, especially during sales.

There is a fine line between discipline and punishment; discipline teaches actual respect, and teaches life lessons. Don't do x because the consequence will be y. Punishment teaches fear. My siblings and I didn't dare act up in public when we were kids, not because we had real respect for where we were, but because we were certain that we would be flayed alive when we got home (after the initial spanking in the store).

The rear element is made up of several separate sections, whose angle can be adjusted separately, much like the flaps on an airplane's wing.

For me, I think it's important that we're aware of both. If someone posts something that's on the fence between orientation and gender, I don't think it's a bad thing. At the very heart of men's rights, woman's rights, LGBT rights, are all the same. Equality. I said the same thing earlier today on a feminism thread. I think labels like men's rights, or feminism, or what have you demean the purpose of those groups. I think they create a false sense of community, and promotes further separation between the things we're supposed to be fighting against. Our goals are all the same, equality for everyone everywhere. I also think that the people in those groups who are against the perceived enemy do everyone a disservice. As people who work toward equality, we should be working towards everyone's equality, not just one particular group. Personally I think we should just call it a human's rights group, and be done with the labels and whatnot. 

That said, there are times when LGBT issues are about LGBT stuff, and gender doesn't play a role. Those times are when that stuff should be posted in LGBT, the other stuff, maybe cross posted. I dunno. ","1317429812"

As an example, if you believe the probability of one premise is 0.5 it entails your beliefs that the whole argument is true must be 0.5 or less (provided you are reasoning correctly).

You accused ""the media"" (which, again, is not a hegemony, despite your weird personal beliefs) of ignoring this story in favor of ""lowest common denominator"" stuff.

Now, here is the problem - it's *your opinion* that the stuff they report on is lowest common denominator, and it's *your opinion* that this story is more important.

Do you understand what I mean now?

Anyway, as I've said elsewhere, it's *necessary* for the media to editorialize. It's not possible for them to report on every single thing that happens, so they have to decide what to report on. And, again, I think it's a good idea to report on the things that people are interested in hearing about. Maybe you don't; that's fine.

But I think it's a *bad* idea for the media to report on things that *they* think are important for people to hear. And, in fact, the very thing that *you* are suggesting the media should do, is *also* the same thing you are accusing them of doing now! You are saying that they should decide what stories people hear, in order to influence peoples' opinions.

Actually, Ron Paul believes the Texas anti-gay-sodomy law that existed until 2005 was Constitutionally valid:

""Consider [the Lawrence case decided by the Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas#Arrest_of_Lawrence_and_Garner) in June. The Court determined that Texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct, because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment “right to privacy.” Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be, there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the Constitution. There are, however, states' rights — rights plainly affirmed in the Ninth and Tenth amendments. Under those amendments, the State of Texas has the right to decide for itself how to regulate social matters like sex, using its own local standards."" -  [Ron Paul](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html)

"skateboarding","t5_2qig3","Yeah. It should have been ceramic vs. ABEC-7 steel/titanium bearings.

My dad used to work as a mechanical engineer for a company that made bearings for industrial use. Ceramics are the fastest and most durable you can get. 

He used to always bring me ones that fit my board. Literally cost him about 20 cents each and they were probably higher quality than the Bones Swiss Ceramics. (Swiss doesn't mean shit btw.) I mean, his company would test their bearings beyond anything a skateboard would ever encounter: 20,000+ rpms, temperatures over 2000C - ceramic bearings aren't even really necessary for skateboards, they were developed for industrial use where they actually get to thousands of degrees Celsius. Ceramics are known for their excellent thermal resistivity. 

I have always thought about getting someone to make fancy box for them and usersell Bones to local shops...just never got around to it.

They also had a machine to custom stamp shields (some industrial ones don't need shields, but for applications where dirt/grime is a factor i.e. skateboarding, they are a necessity). So I could have had any name stamped on them.

Pretty much all sk8board bearings are a HUGE ripoff. They are not engineered specifically for skateboarding, no matter what Bones/Lucky etc's marketing teams try to tell you. It literally costs them maybe $1-$2 for a set of 8 bearings. The packaging almost always costs more than the actual product. My dad still laughs at me for when I bought a set of Lucky 7s for like $50. ","1317429852"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think widespread, local organization is exactly the right way to go about this.  There's another post over in Something Awful that details strategies for fighting at the local level.  Here's a preview:

""Tahrir Square is the wrong model for you to follow. Egypt is a very different country than the United States in many critical ways ranging from the structure of the government to geographical population distribution. Attacking one single point with civil unrest will not work because the government doesn't derive its power from one single point. The U.S. government's power is rather decentralized, there's no one fault line that you can press until it cracks. However detestable some members of the movement might find this suggestion, you need to be aping the Tea Party and other elements of the political right - you need to agitate in hundreds of different congressional districts. All politics - even federal politics - is local.

Protesting is effectively a mass, public form of lobbying, and you need to keep that in mind. Expressing anger is all well and good, but at the end of the day you need to be pressuring someone to do something or the entire exercise will merely continue on until it burns out with everyone watching scratching their heads. Media attention is starting to roll in, but you've probably noticed that it's mostly confusion as to what this is about. Truthfully, I sort of share that view. There's a lot of anger on the streets there, but anger can only go so far. You need to start thinking about solutions too. More specifically, you need to figure out what you want changed and who has the power to make that change happen. Otherwise the situation becomes silly because even when the media does pay attention there's no message for them to convey to the rest of the public.""

When I got my BA I started working in theatre, did that for about ten years, moving to NYC in the process, and also expanded to go back to school in sculpture and to work for sculpture fabricators and other cool stuff.  Eventually got an MFA in sculpture, kept working in theatre at a college as a technical production director, and then took a stab at making a living as an artist.  HA.  Went back to school *again,* got a CA art teaching credential, and now I teach art at a really great middle school and *I love it.*  Who'd 'a thunk it?","1317429916"

Likewise the Andromeda galaxy is speeding towards us and the light from its stars are ALSO travelling towards us at the speed of light.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Timothy McVeigh was a citizen plotting against the US. He was not working with a foreign agency. That is the key difference.

 Al-Awlaki was a leading official of a foreign agency that had publicly declared war against the US. That means Al-Awlaki was not a citizen anymore, as clearly stated in the US Code of federal laws, Sec. 349 a 3, as stated above. So any constitutional protection you cite is not afforded to him. He was a war combatant first and foremost, his protections as a citizen left when he decided to fight for Al Qaeda.

&gt;13th Amendment is quite clear about citizenship: 

The 13th amendment ends slavery. Check your facts and shit.

The 14th amendment does say that children born in the US are citizens. But as pointed out, Al-Awlaki was not a citizen anymore. So there goes that.

I really don't have to even about the fifth amendment then, but I will say your interpretation is incorrect. So like, go ask a constitutional lawyer or someone like that. Or just Google what something means before talking about it next time.

The whole point is you can't argue for a person's constitutional rights as a citizen of the USA when that person **isn't a citizen of the USA anymore according to USC federal law**. And since you are so big on the Constitution, section 8 gives congress the power to pass laws pertaining to naturalization and citizenship, including laws for loss of citizenship (specifically Article 1 Sec. 8 Clause 4, go read about it on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Loss_of_citizenship))

I've got two questions.

In Countdown to Lockdown (brilliant, underrated book, by the way) you talk a lot about whether or not you've got another big match in you. The big scuttlebutt is that Wrestlemania 28 may see a return of more faces from the past than just The Rock (there's been rumours of CM Punk/Steve Austin, and if I had to guess, we'll likely see Nash/Triple H given the way that the story has been told so far). Naturally, I don't expect you to confirm that you've been asked, or there's plans in the works, or whatever - I'm just interested in who you'd want to wrestle, should such rumours prove to be true?

Second is a much shorter question - how do you feel about ""the dirtsheets""? I know that you've mentioned in passing that you've been aware of what's written in them, but I'm curious as to what so-called ""story"" about Mick Foley made you laugh?","1317429944"

It was shut down &amp; banned a few months ago (Early May I think) and then was re-opened between a few weeks to a month later with a different group of admin's / mods. And now a few months after it was reopend, with new mods, it's on Anderson Coopers show used to paint the site in a bad light which I find rather interesting (almost like it was planned since it closed an was reopened with new admin/mods) 

I know this because there was a thread in r/circlejerk that discussed this happening and how it transpired. One of the original mods was posting in the r/circlejerk thread. The person comes staright out and says something along the lines of ""I was a mod of this r/subreddit until it was banned today, this is what happened and this is how we  have been conducting ourselves"" (forget his handle but I think it was lordvobus {sp?})

I'm surprised the fact it was banned at one point about 2 months ago has not been mentioned yet since this is r/conspiracy (should be able to search reddit for the relevant threads refering to the sub reddit being banned/unbanned)

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Veteran assumes that you've fought in a war.

no, it doesn't.  the term assumes an honorable discharge and a certain length of time served as active duty, or a lesser amount of wartime service - usually 180 and 90 days, respectively.  but i guess your opinion supersedes the legal definitions used by the VA or countless state-level veterans' organizations, that have been upheld in countless court decisions at every level of government.

and explain to me how stopping someone from beating or peppering a civilian is political.  OP said he would ""punch all the punchers"", meaning he wasn't taking sides, and he would intervene to help police who were victims of unprovoked attacks by protesters, if that were the case.  the video that i've seen on the subject says that it's not, however.  there is nothing political about stopping the commission of a violent felony, regardless of who the assailant is.","1317429970"

 &gt; Because the president says it's so and people like you are willing to kowtow to his authority.


He reviewed the findings of teams of lawyers from multiple branches of the government before anyone was put on the enemy combatant list.  I know, it can sound like big brother and the effects of an echo chamber.  What it should sound like is cross functional due diligence.


 &gt; I don't think you understand how citizenship works. You are a citizen of a country unless and until you rebuke that citizenship in favor of another. You can't strip someone of their citizenship because they went to live in another country and said things you didn't like or that threatened your country.


""Said things you didn't like is different from encouraging and equipping mass murder and global terrorism (in my mind anyway).  I think there was a firm and clear rebuking here.


 &gt; Freedom involves risk. If freedom isn't your end goal, but security, you're right on base. The state should absolutely do everything within its power to keep you safe, even at the cost of the rights of its citizens. If on the other hand you seek freedom, then you can't just tear up the Constitution when it is convenient because you think it will save some lives. The Constitution was created with the explicit purpose of making it hard to destroy or ignore, even when it is really convenient to do so, because we think that undertaking some risk through forcing the government to not act or to act within these confines will produce a better country and a better life for all Americans in the end. You evidently do not believe this to be true.

For the record, if it was up to me, I would strip your citizenship. You obviously don't adhere to the principles that America stands for, and you thus should have none of those protections that the Constitution offers. I'm sure you would balk at this, but it's only a short jump from denying someone their rights for promoting terror and stripping someone of their rights for promoting the destruction of what America stands for. Enjoy your hellfire missile.


I was totally with you on the first paragraph, and then you seemed to dive into the dark side on the second paragraph.  That was a weird leap, my friend.


 &gt; Try al-Awlaki in absentia? You haven't yet demonstrated that he had legal standing to claim constitutional rights given the full extent of his citizenship and activities.

 &gt; No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

No person?  Was Hitler not a person, and was he indicted?  Was Emperor Hirohito not a person, and was he indicted?   Was Mussolini not a person, and was he indicted?  And so on....


 &gt; except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger



Dude, you've made my point for me.  Thanks.

On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

"politics","t5_2cneq","There **IS** mass famine! ~~Are you dense?~~ And even more damning, we have plenty of food! ~~Get out from under the rock (or basement) that you have been living under.~~

Progress, automation, science, whatever way you want to frame it CAN fix these things, but instead it is being harnessed to amass power and wealth in fewer and fewer hands.

That, in a nutshell, IS my point.

Read up on the [Green Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) if you aren't familiar (Not that it is perfect by any means though).  And then contrast that with say, the recent Iraq War.  Both are demonstrations of our progress in many ways.  One I am proud, as a human, to be a part of.  The other I am ashamed as an American and saddened as a thinking, feeling, human.

Look around:  the Arab Spring, London Riots, (most of) Africa, the economy, etc.  I'm sure that is all happening despite people feeling all happy and optimistic because they feel things are on the right track.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

You seem to think that the iPad costing half as much as last year is a meaningful measure of progress.  I see the doubling of the cost of milk as regress. 

P.S.  I was actually thinking about suggesting fusion as an example of an alternate possibility for our ""direction of progress"".  I was going to say that if we poured every cent of every military budget worldwide, plus doubled down by issuing bonds on the fund, and then committing outright fraud to obtain all the funding necessary to blast through the biggest Manhattan Project-style assault to succeed in developing Fusion in a decade...  Most people would call that crazy, and yet don't blink an eye that we do that for military use and drugs and gambling and on and on.  Now fast-tracked fusion may be a good plan or not, another fun debate, but I **know** that is a better plan than we have now.  And that is why I hold the views I do that give you the idea I am a Luddite.


tl;dr Progress requires purpose. I believe our primary purpose *must* be the good of the many.

Be nice to people, that's surely important.

On the other hand, dont let them stomp you. If you're a programmer make your point clear. When you have 2 bosses, that's one sure way to go insane and kill the project.

If they want a product they have to say CLEARLY what they want. They can change their minds, that's fine, but make it clear to them ""will take 3 weeks to implement that change. Are you ok?"".

And, last but not least, deliver. Deliver the product that they want. Have one boss, have one guy to make decisions. If that guy asks for your help when he/she needs to convince 1000 stakeholders, that's fine. Present the 5 ways feature X can be implemented. Present your way of thinking. 

All of this BEFORE the feature is brought into the sprint, before you started working on it. You HAVE to know wtf you're doing before starting, otherwise is just a waste of time. Waste of time equals waste of money. Client's money, company's money, etc. And nobody likes that.

"masculism","t5_2rb6c","&gt;How can gender be ""100%"" socially constructed if it has ""genetic underpinnings""? 

Because we are a social species we take the world around us and put our own labels on it and divide people up based on biology, but with our own interpretations of the world. 

&gt;How can a transsexual have a ""female brain in a male body"" if the only identifier of a female brain is a set of social constructs? 

Female is what I use to refer to sex, while woman is what I use to refer to gender. The female brain has biological markers, although it's unknown what exactly those markers are.  

&gt;How can sexuality be something you're born with if it's something that a culture defines on a whim.

Culture doesn't define it on a whim. Culture defines the expression of the biology. Think about a mother. There is the biological mother and the socio-cultural aspect of a mother. Although mothers are biologically created, what it means to be a mother is extremely culturally dependent. What a mother is, what a mother does is highly variable from culture to culture. 

&gt;Your initial claims in no way match with the evidence you've given. You should clear up that discrepancy or change your claim away from a 100% social constructed gender.

Does that clear it up or should I explain more?

&gt;You may not know of or have experienced this as a women, but I can assure you the first accusation that escapes anyone's lips when a guy acts effeminate is the accusation of homosexuality

I am well aware of this. I am also well aware of why this exists too. 

&gt;This is probably because of a perception bias that, since a large portion of the gay community is effeminate then that becomes inherently linked to homosexuality.

But is this biological or cultural? Are gays naturally effeminate? Nope, not when you look across cultures. Only in cultures where homosexuality is associated with femininity or with a third gender do you see very effeminate males. There are cultures where homosexual sex is widely practiced and all the men who engage in the act are considered manly, not effeminate. This is a cultural construct. 

&gt;The important thing is that their particular societies definition of gay doesn't change their underlying sexual attraction but rather their ability to express it. 

That's basically what I'm saying. That sexuality and sex have an underlying genetic bias. Society influences how we express it. 

&gt;It's clear from the language you use that you believe that people have an innate gender identity that underlies that which society encourages. 

Yes. 

&gt;The implication of this is great because in a completely socially constructed society people wouldn't have personal definitions of gender they attempt to fit into a grander society. 

Do you mean that in a society where biology didn't exist and every thing was socially constructed that people wouldn't have personal definitions of gender? Because I don't think that's true. After all, I'm one of those nerds who argues about the difference between the nerd, geek, and dork. By 'personal definitions' do you mean 'gender identities'?

&gt;If they didn't have that force behind them then surely they'd go along with whatever gender role was prescribed to their sex. This completely flies in the face of examples of transsexualism so I can't see how you can escape from the obviousness of a large role that genetics plays in shaping our gender identity.

I never said that genetics don't play a role, they certainly do. There is biology underneath it all. If there was no biology at all, then people would go with whatever they were told. The biology is important, but society is as well because society changes how you express it.

Going back to the gay example, look at how lesbianism has changed over the year in the US. In the beginning, one of the partners behaved and dressed masculine. The other partner, feminine, wasn't considered gay. Over time, the roles evolved, so that both were considered gay by society. Then, dykes started dating dykes and femmes start dating femmes and, at first, all hell broke lose because that was *not done*. Even now, there is still the expectation of gays and lesbians that one partner takes the 'female' role and another takes the 'male' role. Although these people's underlying biology never changed, how they expressed their homosexuality did. 

&gt;I have to ask does it really matter? Does ID'ing yourself as whatever really change who you are on the inside?

As we are a social species, we love knowing where we fit relative to others. The first time I was able to put a name to my feelings and ID as a bisexual female, I felt liberated. As a counselor for transgendered/transsexual people, I've seen how people have been helped by realizing that their feelings not only have names, but also are shared by other people. When it's only you, it can feel very isolating. 

I see biology as the frame of a house with social cultural all the contents, decorations, doors, windows, etc. Two houses with the same frames can look very, very different depending on the individuals who decorated and accessorized them. ","1317430022"

It's funny you mention enjoying LSD more, despite a personal bias toward the natural. The more I learn about LSD, the more (quite literally) magical it seems. Given the circumstances behind its discovery ([this particular interpretation of events is worth reading](http://www.erowid.org/general/conferences/conference_mindstates4_nichols.shtml)), the time in human history we discovered it and the fact that not only was it one of the very first man-made psychedelics but remains a favorite even among those who have tried hundreds of synthetics... It's hard *not* to come to the conclusion that there's something special about LSD.

As far as the OP's original question, I gave my opinion in another comment, but I'll restate my feelings here... LSD and mushrooms are both excellent for catalyzing introspective, personal experiences. Which is better is definitely a matter of opinion, and likely depends mostly on the personality of the person taking them (as well as the whim of luck that particular day... sometimes you just don't get the trip you're looking for).

Personally, I prefer LSD for introspection. I find it to be a bit more clearheaded than mushrooms, which is what I want if I'm looking for something specific. In my experience, mushrooms lend themselves to a more confused mindstate. This is not a bad thing, just different.

I think MDMA can also be tremendously helpful for dealing with personal problems, but I think that it requires more ""work."" I mean this in the sense that you can take LSD and get something deeply personal out of it without trying. With MDMA, you can get something out of it, but the drugs won't take you all the way there. It's very helpful to have a close friend to talk with while on MDMA and help you work through the issues.

I've also heard very interesting things about iboga trips and how it basically involves confronting all of your personal demons, one by one, and dealing with them head on. You're supposed to come out of it practically a new person. (This likely has something to do with its radical success treating addiction.) However, I haven't personally tried it, so all I can do is refer to OP to other sources.","1317430030"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","You have to think of a record company-artist relationship as a relationship between a venture capitalist and a startup company.  The record label invests in numerous artists, hoping maybe 1 in 10 will turn a large profit and offset losses incurred from providing those million dollar advances to artists that go nowhere.

By looking only at artists that sell millions of records, you're not getting the whole picture.  For every artist that sells a million records, there's at least a good dozen that get signed but don't go anywhere.  The money made from those few artists that sell a million records these days is not even close to enough to balance out the losses.  All major record labels are losing money.  There's a reason for that.

Also, I find people always say that they know what artists are good and that they wouldn't sign flops if they were in charge of a record label.  Sometimes, that person has has no idea what they are talking about.  More often, they list off artists that are fairly safe bets.  The problem with that is that there's so many labels out there trying to sign the next big thing that labels have to sign artists very early in their careers, before anything is certain.","1317430033"

I mean seriously, people point out that OWS hadn't made it clear what they wanted. So what do you asshats do? You compile a list of every political hot topic thats happened in the last decade and say yea we're fighting for that!

Honestly, if this is your idea of being taken seriously, then you might as well pack up your bags and head home because you won't be getting a damn thing done.

Not to mention that since yesterday I've seen 3 lists all claiming to be the official list of demands. Things need to change theres no doubt about that. But you dumb fucks are making it impossible for any organized groups with reasonable demands to make any headway!

You stand on your soap box pounding your chest ranting about all the problems with the world. But never once do you offer a reasonable solution to any of the problems. All you're doing is loudly proclaiming THESE PROBLEMS EXISTS!! IM SO ANGRY!!! Yea no shit, I could've told you that 6 months ago. Meanwhile the reasonable people with actual plans too fix things can't be heard because you won't shut the fuck up.","1317430037"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","No, you didn't have faith.

If you had faith you would have ACTUALLY BELIEVED Christ was the son of God, and the concept of disobeying such a being would be anathema to you. If your dad was an all knowing, all-loving being that could end the universe with a breath, would you turn around and tell him ""sorry, I don't actually think you exist""? Sure, you'd whine and complain when he asks you to take out the trash, but you'd never actually disown him. 

The mere statement of ""I was Christian"" is a contradiction in terms. You either ARE a Christian or never were. If you ARE a Christian, then good luck with your trials. If you never WERE a Christian, then it is up to God to guide you to him. I can't give you faith. There aren't even words on earth to explain mine. I can only tell you that you aren't even looking anymore. 



The geocentric scientific community was convinced and had proof that the earth was the centre of the universe. All the math and science at the time said so. They were CONVINCED to the point that they hamstrung and hung Galileo out to dry for saying otherwise.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, there is a lot we still don't know. There are plenty of other good a priori arguments against theism, though. You mentioned omnipotence, but omnipotence can be logically shown to be impossible. The proof goes something like this: an omnipotent being would be incapable of being limited. An omnipotent being would also have all powers. Limiting things is a power. An omnipotent being would be unable to limit itself, ergo, an omnipotent being cannot exist. QED.

I agree that we can't be 100% certain that there is no god of any type. We really can't be 100% certain of anything at all, though. I believe we can be certain enough that the distinction becomes unimportant. First, we can be very certain that none of the deities worshiped currently or in the past are real. There are countless a posteriori arguments that make that pretty easy. Second, we can rule out the existence of any god whose existence makes a practical difference in our lives. We can do this through the aforementioned a priori arguments about our understanding of reality and the logical impossibilities of claims about god. While there is a lot we still don't understand, most of it is on very microscopic or macroscopic scales, like you said, which means that in practical day-to-day life, the existence of god in those realms would be unimportant. With those out of the way, the existence of god becomes irrelevant. Maybe the Great Clockmaker exists, and created the universe and then left it alone. If that is true... so what? I think it is perfectly rational to be a gnostic atheist with regards to 99.9% of the gods we can conceive of, and the other .1% are simply irrelevant.","1317430054"

I know in Spain, I had a terrible pain in my elbow, it had been going on for a while whenever I'd throw a football or use my arms actively for a while (not too long, mind you).

I sort of ignored it, but one night the pain became so sharp and for so long, and it didn't subside as quickly as it had other times that I went to the ER.  There weren't really people in the waiting room but there were people being attended.  Someone came in after me and got attended first, because I suppose she had more pressing matters.

They kept me waiting and I ended up leaving.  I got the feeling the whole time that I was being cast aside.

It turns out since I told her the problem had been coming on for a while, but it was never that bad, that I should have seen a regular physician.  They didn't consider me to be urgent so I waited for quite a while before finally leaving.

It sucked, but I see why.  If I told them it was the first time it happened and made it seem like an emergency at the moment, they would have probably taken me in and x-rayed me and such.  This is what my mom told me to do.

I decided to be honest and although the problem **was** urgent this time, to the point that I decided to go to the ER, the fact that I didn't do anything about it when I knew I had it caused them to not let me take up doctor time when people with real emergencies needing it.

I don't know if there are laws that prevent that here, but if they see it as profitable enough to allow it to happen, it's not just the people that are at fault.  Parents will continue to take their kids and people will continue to go, if there's a chance that they'll be treated.","1317430063"

"politics","t5_2cneq","As far as the specific suggestions go, check this out:

""So, in response to the requests for ideas I suggest the following:
1) Figure out who in Congress might already be sympathetic to your cause. Reach out to them, ask them to start making public statements in support of the cause. They're your base in Congress, and you should be trying to work with them since they can probably offer useful support in the form of information as well as a megaphone.

2) Figure out who in Congress is persuadable to join you. Off the top of my head, outside of standard progressives you're probably looking for people who represent Rust Belt and Sun Belt constituencies that have been completely decimated by the real estate bubble and other kinds of financial sector shenanigans. This part is a great way for people who aren't able to physically join in to help. Have people examine voting records and district demographics to figure out a list of moderates who could be persuaded that they stand to gain electorally by joining the cause (or, conversely, who stand to lose electorally if they don't join up). 

3) Help start letter-writing campaigns, occupations and and marches in the districts from list #2, and by people who are registered to vote in those districts. That last part is really important and is something that can easily be overlooked in a movement that exists heavily in digital space. Letters coming in to a representative's office from people who can't vote in that district are toothless. You need that representative's constituents to persuade him or her that they're furious. Ten million emails from outsiders are worth less than ten thousand letters from the people who actually vote for him or her.

4) Keep repeating steps 2 and 3, trying to pick up a few more districts each time. Remember to keep to one core, focused message. 

5) Concurrently with 1-4, draft the legislation that you want Congress to pass. One trick that makes it easy for corporate interests to get favorable laws passed is that they constantly pay think tanks to draft template legislation and float it around Washington, even for topics that aren't on the current agenda. This way when something does happen, lobbyists can rush in and offer ready-made legislation so the congressmen don't have to do anything but make speeches and take credit for it. You need to turn this tactic to your own ends. Find some sympathetic political scientists (there are more of us than you might think) and lawyers (good lord are there a lot of un/underemployed lawyers running around, go read the lawyer thread in B/F) and ask them to start crafting legislation a friendly representative could introduce as-is. The less work you leave for Congress, the easier it will be when push comes to shove.

The ultimate goal I'm suggesting here is to get smaller-scale but still significant movements happening in enough congressional districts that, when someone brings your bill before Congress, people in each district can all push their respective representatives to support it.""","1317430066"

Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity, while others oppose modernism and seek a return to the way things were.[2][3] ","1317430079"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","The PPI is on wikipedia, but if you really wanted to calculate, I believe its done like this:

The screen size for the Transformer is 10.1"" diagonal. ""Equation 1"" is a form of Pythagorean's Theorum to solve for each of the side lengths:  
screenWidth^2 + screenHeight^2 = 10.1^2 = 102.01

We also know the aspect ratio, which is 16:10. That makes ""Equation 2""...  
screenWidth / screenHeight = 16/10 = 1.6

Use some basic linear systems of equations skills, and we can combine the two equations to solve for either the width or the height. I'll go width.  
screenWidth^2 + screenHeight^2 = 10.1^2 = 102.01  
screenHeight = screenWidth / 1.6  
screenWidth^2 + (screenWidth / 1.6)^2 = 102.01  
screenWidth^2 + (screenWidth^2 / 2.56) = 102.01  
(2.56 \* screenWidth^2 / 2.56) + (screenWidth^2 / 2.56) = 102.01  
3.56 \* screenWidth^2 / 2.56 = 102.01  
3.56 \* screenWidth^2 = 261.2  
screenWidth^2 = 73.4  
screenWidth = 8.56 inches  

After we have that, we just divide the number of width pixels by that number. That's what PPI is (pixels / inch of screen).  
1280 / 8.56 = 149.5 PPI

For completeness sake, I ran the numbers for the screen height through Alpha. It came out to be 149.49 as well.

That's pretty close to the published value of 160. At least you can say you learned something today :)","1317430102"

The only reason I don't eat meat is because of the effects of its production. If it was bad for the environment, I probably wouldn't eat it, though. But I don't think it would be bad.

By the way, to defend the people who say they would not eat it, I completely understand where you are coming from. Being a vegan IS an accomplishment, at least for some people, and although their choice to not eat this meat doesn't derive from the same reasons as their choice to not eat most meat, it's not hurting anyone, and it would just make them feel uncomfortable to eat it for the first time again. Imagine not drinking milk for a year, and you just did it to not drink milk for a year. Would you be comfortable drinking milk again once the time was up? No, it would feel like you had undone your accomplishment. For some people, it SEEMS that it's meat. Therefore they would be extremely uncomfortable eating it, moral objection or not.

I submit, though, that those vegans who eat lab-grown meat ARE STILL VEGANS. It's like saying that you're not a vegan because you eat soy bacon or soy burgers.","1317430107"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","So if taxes are not raised on CEOs they would not give themselves pay raises? I don't think so. Each CEO is going to give himself as much of a pay raise as he can get away with whenever he can. They will joyfully use any new regulation as an excuse for an increase, but their increases may have no relation to the magnitude of the tax/regulatory change (i.e. increasing taxes by 1% will not spur them to increase pay by 1%, it will spur a 10% increase or whatever other percentage they feel can be 'hidden' by blaming the tax increase). The issue here is political power among board members and between the board and shareholders rather than a real tax issue. 

Now will that result in price increases? Probably not for two reasons. 1) Saying that it will assumes a price increase will increase profits enough to cover the new higher compensation cost. If increasing prices would increase profits then they should have done that before. If increasing prices does not increase profits then it should not be done at all. The only way the an increase in taxes can change the situation from a price increase not increasing profits to a situation where it does is if the tax increase helps the whole market coordinate for a price increase (acting like a oligopoly) or if it somehow makes the customers more willing to pay the higher prices. That might happen but it's psychological bullshit and power politics, not cause and effect.

2) The highest paid CEO made about 100 million last year (UNH). His company had revenue of ~100 billion. A 10% increase in his compensation would be paid for by a 0.01% increase in prices. Their price increase last year was 13-34% depending on location. Obviously something more significant is going on. Now an increase in payroll taxes would impact their entire salary base and that would be much more significant.

Bank of America can increase the price to consumers because it expects other large banks to follow in a cartel-like fashion. There is every reason to believe this is correct, partially because they have in the past but partially because the change in the fees they can charge for transactions was cut by 70% which is enough to get anyone's attention (it is the rough equivalent of increasing personal income tax including that on capital gains to 80%). Small banks are exempted from this regulation so they will probably continue to offer debit cards without charge or with lower charges.

Oh, since this morning I found out that there are multiple layers of wholesalers and processors between merchants (who pay the interchange fee) and the banks. Those layers are likely to take the opportunity to suck up most of the price decline from the banks and not pass it on to merchants - at least in the short term - so the money will shift out of big banks and to these wholesalers who will get a quick windfall until competition pushes them to pass along some of the savings.

If Bush wiped his ass with the constitution, then Obama just stuffed the rest of it into a paper bag and lit it on fire on the countries door step.  

This is not a symantical debate on freedoms, the government now has the power, and the legal precident after this assassination, to deny people any legal proceeding and target them for extrajudicial killings.  We don't even know whether he is guilty of actually planning terrorist acts, we know he was a firebrand cleric in al Qaeda, we know he was calling on people to join al Qaeda and the Jihad, that's all above board.  But how do we know the rest, because we were told so, no minimally publically accountable legal proceeding, no due process, no nothing, we can't even see the evidence because it is a ""state secret"" regarding sensitive military operations.  

Obama just murdered a man, justly or no, and can do the same to anyone, with the same level of oversight, none, the decsision will be made based on intel only available to unelected, unaccountable defense personnel, because some one was determined a terrorist, who decides who is a terrorist, Obama based on that unaccountable defense beuracracy.

Be clear, be concise and for the love of God stop the dancing and drum circles.

Do this, pick good issues and people will listen. A few items I'd consider are:


1) H1B visas being used to in-source cheaper labor keeping wages low and people unemployed. Demand a reduction on the number of visas issued  

2) Regressive payroll taxes, this year a person making 50K will pay about 7.6% in payroll taxes alone and next year it increases to 9.6%. Demand that the Obama payroll reduction be extended and payroll taxes become graduated. 

3) Currently Social Security taxes stop taxing income at 107K demand the cap be lifted. 

4) Demand Capital Gains be taxed as normal income. 

5) No tax holiday for repatriated profits. Corporations make billions by outsourcing but don't bring the money home due to being taxed on the transfer. To circumvent this Corporations lobby and receive periodic tax holidays where they bring the money home. 

6) Raise the min wage. The min wage has had its earning power diminished by inflation let's see it restored to the earning power it had and the bicentennial. 

7) [Too big to fail is too big to exist](http://rortybomb.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/bank_mergers.jpg). By letting these large corporations merge time after time they have become dangerously large and competition has been all but eliminated.

I took a look at jailbait his afternoon to see if my impression of it's content held true and it did.  Posts were bragging about the age of the girls and flaunting h sexual nature of them.   This is beyond defensible.

I called you a Sketchy fuck because the truth is, outside of reddit, the voltaire act about defending the right to say it doesn't fly with any responsible group of people when were talking about a web forum created for the purpose of archiving sexual-type images of underage girls, if you were to take your position to mixed company IRL it's very likely many people would think you were a sketchy fuck.

Doing a bio build with Terran is all fine and dandy, unless your Terran opponent is going biomech/mech. You can follow a formula, but getting things here and there out of the formula is always good.

As I said, itemizing is very important. Itemizing for the early-game by getting 3 doran's blades, getting a chain vest and negatron cloak in the mid-game as a bruiser so you're tanky *enough* to take aggroe. Going avarice blade, philo stone, heart of gold, and kage's lucky pick because you want to rape end-game. Start cloth5 because that damn garen is just going to shit on you otherwise. 

Runes and masteries: these supplement your items. Getting a 40 armor rune page against garen to further counter him. Doing it so you get both akali passives at level one. While they do not do *too* much (items of course have more impact), it's still very important.","1317430184"

I find CoD to be boring too, I never felt there was good potential for team dynamics in CoD.

CS is awesome to watch, especially dust 2, inferno, train, mill all the good maps etc especially when there's two teams and it's close.

CS is really perfect because when one person does really well it stands out a lot. I find with Street Fighter the match can be over before it's begun sometimes, and that really a lot of what goes on is character choice and rock paper scissors stuff, but overall it's usually great to watch.

Quake 3 would be great too, not Quake Live but Quake 3.

It was visible yesterday almost from ocean beach--&gt;scripps (which were all the spots I checked) but nowhere near as bright as it was on Wednesday night.  

Wednesday during the day the water was noticeably more red and rust colored then it was yesterday (not as bright at night) and today

This happened last year and lasted about two months but at no point do I remember it ever being as bright as it was on Wednesday.  

Reddest water during day translates to brightest display at night given limited amount of ambient light.

Apparently this one has been going on since late August but started getting intense on Monday 9/26/2011.

Although it was barely visible last night, once we paddled out past the break it was still very intense offering amazingly bright light being generated by the slightest agitation.

Although this particular red tide is harmless, it is correlated with a higher presence of bacteria that feed off of it than normal which can cause problems if you are prone to infection.  ","1317430208"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Thanks.  While I'm at it, here's the rationalization:

* 99% millionaire tax: because **fuck you all,** that's why.

* Capital gains and no carried interest: my favorite phrase for this is ""speculation should not be taxed less than perspiration.""

* Ending corporate personhood: this right here would stop a lot of shenanigans.

* The embargos: right now, a big motivation for outsourcing is that corporations can shift arbitrary parts of their operation overseas, pay abhorrently low wages, oppress their workers, and befoul the environment.  If we don't want to support those actions, we can't support economies that do.

* Universal medicare: it's simple, it's unambiguous, and I even threw in a way to pay for it.

* Executive pay: back in the 50's and 60's, nobody hated the bosses because they weren't living in Gilded Age splendor while the rest of us lived in foreclosed houses - they had a bit nicer houses, yes, but they were still friends and neighbors; one of us.  The end of this connection to the average man is part of what allows executives to justify their extravagance, malice, and indifference.

* Deriatives trading: there are zero good things, and a boatload of bad things, that happen from it, so why allow it?

* 20 minute wait requirement: it's insane how fast high frequency trading (or ""HFC"") has become these days, and how many 100+ point swings in the market it's caused, completely devoid of any human action.  A 20 minute wait is fine and dandy for normal stockholders, and it helps disincentivize panics by making it much, much harder to trade on the upticks of a falling stock.

* Weed: legalization guts the cartels, gets hundreds of thousands of people out of jail, and lets us focus our time, energy, money, and political will on things that actually matter.","1317430217"

Now if you post it in a smaller subreddit (like r/Halloween, although I'll admit I've never visited it) with fewer posts, but still activity, you will get response from people who actually care. You may be asked about how to make it, suggestions for improvements etc.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The top marginal tax rate on federal income is significantly higher than any of the numbers you listed.  It's around 35%, I believe (and yes, I understand the concept of marginal tax rates).  Add to that state tax (as much as 10%), city tax (if you live in NYC, the top marginal rate is nearly 4%), social security tax on the first 106K or so, medicare tax, as well as property tax (which can be 1-3% of the value of your home per year, with 1% being typical), tax on almost everything you purchase and god knows what else I'm forgetting.

Edit:  I'm not even counting payroll tax here, which is effectively a stealth income tax.

In reality, if you're a high earner, and you don't primarily get your income from capital gains, you probably pay a lot more than 40% of your income in taxes.   The lower capital gains tax is essentially for people who are already wealthy and don't need to work.  The OP is remarking on the disincentive for people to try to get rich (as opposed to complaining about the taxes on the already wealthy).  FWIW, I don't fully agree with the OP, but I think your post misses the point.

Bless them, and bless O.P and family.. But do you teach how the Americans built concentration camp and imprisoned the Japanese, and would torture, and rape? How Eisenhower killed over a million Axis soldiers in his death camps? How allied soldiers raped over a million woman and little girls, sometimes in front of family to humiliate them further getting them pregnant and giving them STI/Ds . How the Germans were willing to sell the Jews from the camps for their freedom but Zionist Jews refused? I'm not being ""anti-semetic"" or trying to be offensive to all those that lost their lives in this tragic event in human history, but i find it funny how it is forbidden to question certain aspects of the holocaust. Millions and millions of people died in WW2 not just Jews who are a small number compared to most.  Hitler was concerned about Zionism as were most the German public, they got the ideas from such books as Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. They also believed Jewish bankers were responsible and played a part in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany was hit hard economically during end of WW1 and the great depression. Hitler was cautious of how Jews or better yet Zionists were infiltrating German media, banks, trades, taking jobs that Germans believe were theirs. He was even scared of the Jews within his own Government. Jews declared economic war on Germany in 1933 which infuriated the Germans who were already struggling, I could go on for hours but my point is as you being a teacher..Teaching to the youth of this planet, the next generation.

I know it's a reach, but I'm wondering if there's some connection between the desert and Gus' tempting of Jesse to betray Walt. Gus, for me at least, has appeared very much cast as a Satanic type character. He changes shape regularly to trick his targets and he is unquestionably the primary source of evil on the show right now. Jesse, in contrast, has been marked out in this series for rebirth and has been branded with the infinity symbol. Is the journey through the desert the devil's temptation of Jesse? 

Maybe, as I say it's a reach. But the no car thing is strange without a deeper explanation.  ","1317430257"

Assuming you are talented, and want to live off your investments...


Let's assume your worst year you take a 10% drawdown, and that will probably happen every 5 years, and you will not tolerate risk more than this.  Let's say you generally expect to make 15% a year.  You have a 6:1 reward to risk here.   over time. 

It will take you 1 year to break even after your 10% drawdown.  Say you need $50,000 to get by each year.  That means you need to start with at least $333,333 but you have to offset the loss, so you will need to actually have more than that.  probably $400,000 in the bank to comfortably live off of the stock market as a single dude with limited expenses.   

This assumes you can beat the market 80% of the time...good luck...this is why most people fail.  

Trading is a different game, but similar story, even if you're amazing you need a good $250k in the bank before its worth the risk.","1317430262"

"Military","t5_2qh8y","For what purpose? Both platforms are quite good, with their longevity as proof of that. The strengths and weaknesses of each are much exaggerated depending on which side of the argument you are on.

The AK47 does have slightly worse ballistics than the AR15, but most of it's reputation for inaccuracy is based on the fact that third world users are untrained, likely have not zeroed their weapon, and as is the case with Arab culture find things like full automatic to be ""manly"" and things like using the stock to be ""unmanly"" (true story). I feel that a good shooter would have few issues hitting a target at 300m.

The AR's reputation for being high-maintenance are also exaggerated. It does have to be cleaned for top performance, but so does any weapon. 

Now, my personal choice? A modern styled M4/short AR15. I like the default sights over the AK slot sights, and the fact that the rear sight is much closer to the body (as part of the design, AK sights must be mounted much further away). I like the flattop design on AR rifles that allows optics to be mounted closely (some AKs can do this, but require fairly expense extra pieces). The magazine well on AR rifles can be reloaded faster, even under stress than the snap-in AK magazines. As an especially personal preference that came from growing up on ARs, I prefer the straight back recoil and the AR gasblock is good for my unique grip style.","1317430272"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; But that's not what jailbait means at all. Jailbait means that these are girls that, you know, you would go to jail if you were sexually involved with. …  If they're just hot women who are young (but over 18) why call it jailbait at all?

You say ""that's the definition"", but I don't think that's in the dictionary. I would personally say that the point is that they're mature enough that you can't readily tell their age for sure.

They could easily be one day past their 18th birthday, they could easily be a day short of it - that's the only way I've ever heard the term used outside the internet. Walking with a friend, one of us has gone ""wow! that girl is hot"" and the other will reply, ""I'm not sure - she could be jailbait. She's hot though"". Yes, it is saying that they're illegal - one day or one week or maybe even 6 months short of some arbitrary line - but you wouldn't use the term if you hadn't already questioned the matter. It's perfectly natural and normal to be attracted to full-developed young women.

&gt; I don't object to jailbait because I think it's lowbrow and not classy enough for my taste. I object to it because it's extremely skeezy and not something I want a community that I love affiliated with

That just seems like two different ways of saying the same thing.

What's the difference between ""skeezy"" and ""not classy""?

&gt; I also object to it because I think it's a really shitty thing to take pictures of random girls (it's a very small percentage of the images that are actually posted by the girls) and put them on a site where people are going to fap to them, without their permission. 

We must be looking at different subreddits, because practically all the photos I'm seeing are posed. They might not be posed *for* reddit, but they were posed and posted on Facebook or somewhere. And to be honest, to me that doesn't matter - there's no point in moralising about something you can't control, the photos are out there and the genie is out of the bottle. 

Guys fap over girls they see in the street, guys fap over their female friends and even their step-sisters. Guys fap to the photos of girls half-dressed in stormtrooper pics. ","1317430277"

The word ""advice"" in this abbreviation is misleading - this is a binding rule and is not up for discussion.

Unless you're doing a ridiculously easy bachelors/masters or you're a fucking genius, you simply cannot work fulltime and pass these requirements. For reference, fail 2 out of 8 classes in a year and you're out. Period. In some cases, failing a class can be as simple as skipping too many lectures.

If the wife was a stay at home mom, she essentially gave up the opportunity for advancing her career to do mother things, meaning economically she's pretty much screwed after the divorce - hence, alimony. Now, if she was also working and neither party gave up anything for their career then no alimony would be justified by this logic, but generally married women work less as the family income rises.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Guys, if we want to be taken seriously and not be called things like ""an equally misinformed, only Leftist version of the Tea Party"", then we should probably get our facts straight. I have a feeling most people here don't really know what they're talking about when they all clamor to repeal the Glass-Steagal Act.

The only thing congress took out of from the GSA was the rule stipulating that ""no bank or financial institution that contains a bank will own, invest in, or sponsor a hedge fund or private equity fund, or have proprietary trading operations unrelated to serving customers for its own profit."" So, of course, it will still be completely 100% legal for banks to ""gamble with the money you deposited""; arguably, they'd just be doing it at a smaller level. The more negligible losses that most of the banks actually had were in hedge funds and private equity funds, while the biggest losses came from defaults on home loans.

The main cause of the economic collapse was in fact the banking system. But let's look at how and why. The Federal Reserve's artificially lowered interest rates to force a boom on housing. When the collapsed banks turned to the government sponsored enterprises ""Fannie Mae"" and ""Freddie Mac,"" who were just as irresponsible, had no money to pay. This really fucked over the taxpayers and further damaged the economy.

The real issue here, is definitely in part with the GSA, but the part we should be focusing on is the installation of the FDIC and how we can eliminate it, as well as the Federal Reserve. By guaranteeing the money a bank lends out to entrepreneurs and homeowners, obviously they are going to be more careless with their money because if anything bad happens, then the taxpayers will just bail them out. Its a highly complicated issue, so before try to call me out on things like ""bank runs"", I suggest you look up the differences between a fractional reserve bank, a non-fractional reserve bank, and why the FDIC and the Federal Reserve establishes a monopoly on the former.

Though I will concede that as long as we have a central bank, it makes sense to impose tighter controls on banks in order to minimize the damage the central bank's policies inflict, but a much better alternative is, of course, calling for an end to the fraudulent practices of fractional reserve banking and the absence of any central bank.","1317430295"

Explains why the body prefers to run on glucose, or to store it as glycogen before storing it as fat.","1317430307"

"zombies","t5_2qi0e","You can't really overthink zombies, because ultimately the zombie falls apart either way. The brain needs the support of the body as much as the body needs the brain. Broken rotting skin allows infectious bacteria to pass into the bloodstream causing infection to spread to major organs. As soon as the infection hits brain, heart or lungs, brain death is not far off. Large open wounds lead to blood loss, no blood, means oxygen doesn't get to the brain, braindeath. Punctured or collapsed lung, you are facing the same situation. Without liver and kidneys the blood becomes tainted and carries infectious agents throughout the body. Unless there is a mystical cause for the zombie, the zombie cannot truly be dead, and if the zombie is not truly dead, then it would have an expiration date of just a few days, It would probably only be mobile for a day after infection. Which is why there can never be a realistic zombie movie.","1317430312"

Of course, if I come across a distro I'm unfamiliar with, I'll probably use google to find out how to do certain things with the init scripts, or the package manager. I find these 'secondary' skills to actually knowing how to use a linux system though.","1317430334"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","My brother and his wife recently fired their nanny after three days. Smelled heavily of smoke on day one, was 30-some minutes late on day two, and smoke again on day three. Each day she was constantly on her phone (nanny cam) texting and calling friends, basically ignoring the kids. This woman was in her early 20's. She came highly recommended from an agency and had good references, but they didn't feel comfortable giving her responsibility over their three kids, one of which is a newborn. 

Unfortunately, I think their perception of the profession is irreconcilably soured. They sunk a lot of money in finding this person and it ended in a complete waste. Are there any words of encouragement or advice you could give to rekindle their faith in giving another nanny a try?","1317430335"

Honestly, I find it ridiculous that you exposed your kids to technology at the age of 2. It is your choice after all so I respect that, and it's great things worked out for you at the end, but firstly the OP's child is a girl, meaning that more likely than not they wouldn't care about DOS and all that computer tech stuff. Secondly, you're assuming that every kid actually wants to become a computer nerd like you. I'm sorry to say you are really, really wrong on that one. I'll tell you, my cousin would HATE you for the technology training you are forcing on the at that age. 

So do you pity like 99% of all children out there because they don't give their kids expensive things or teach them how to use the computer so early in their life? ","1317430335"

Statistically, you're * definitely* not the only gay guy or gal there, but unfortunately the majority of them are probably going to be in the closet.

Just hang in there... High school is tough, but it's over before you know it. Feelings of isolation and loneliness suck, but you'll find someone eventually.

Hey all, I hope you are just as excited as we are for Fall 2011's PUSO MODERN AUDITIONS!

Here's some important info that you will need to know:

Everyone's invited! Just because we are a Filipino branch, doesn't mean it's only limited to Filipinos!

If you want to come just to learn a few steps, feel very welcome!

But if you are there to audition:

There are THREE DATES that you must clear for the whole audition process. Two learning days, and one audition day.

10/4 and 10/6 are two learning days. 10/4 you will be learning one piece, and on 10/6 you will be learning another.

and on 10/9 you will audition the two pieces for the directors/choreographers.

What if you can't make any of the audition days? Well here's something you can do:

After each learning day, the pieces will be recording on video, one time from the mirror, and one time from behind the dancer, and will be uploaded onto our public youtube channel, ""pusomodern"" That way, if you miss a learning day, you could still learn it off youtube, and you still have a couple days before the actual audition to do so!

What if you can't make the actual audition day? Well here's an IMPORTANT thin you must do:

Contact us. We will do everything we can to schedule you an alternative audition date.


Here's a couple of things to keep in mind:

- come with an open mind! The dances are there to challenge and test you, but more importantly, you gotta have fun too! If you aren't enjoying what you're doing, you will have an even tougher time learning

- come with comfortable clothes! It's not a fashion show, come to sweat adn WORK.

- come with a smile on you face! No matter what the outcome, this can serve as a great experience for you! And hopefully and fun and exhilarating one at that!

ALSO, CHECK OUT OUR GROUP PAGE! 

( Search PUSO Modern Dance Crew ) 
Show some love and ""like"" it if you want =) 


It's going to be a fun experience for all of us! See you there!","1317430349"

Also I've paid $5 a month for years for my debit card (about to go up because I turned 25). Is a debit card not the same as an ATM card? Here they are.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","As has been said, damage spread is an approx. 15% variation in the damage done by a weapon. Non-melee weapons have damage dropoff over time, so a point blank shotgun does far more damage than a shotgun from the other side of 2fort. Damage spread then subtracts or adds up to 15% of the damage at that distance by a random number roll. Critical hits remove damage falloff and spread, and do 3x the ""100%"" damage. Crits are random, but they become slightly more common the more damage you do in a life. Go practice airshots on tr_walkway and after a few minutes you'll see a lot more crit rockets than when you started.

People don't like them because it adds even more random chance to the game. Pros apparently like having a consistent damage output. I kinda like the random aspect it adds to the game myself, but I understand why some people would prefer it off.","1317430359"

As to the bigger question, does Reddit have the right to keep r/Jailbait up? Absolutely! Do I think that keeping that is good for the site and does it attract the kind of people we want? I don't think so.

We all have free speech, but Reddit can restrict that as it chooses, and I'd say that a good decision would be to disassociate with those types of subreddits.

That being said, I think that this is the beginning of a downward spiral because NO ONE is happy right now. Between memes, people unhappy with the amount of political discussion that get out of political subreddits, and now this, it doesn't look good.

I've lurked on this site for 3 years every day, and this is by far the worst it's been. I'm ever hearing that Digg is the old Reddit. That says something.

There have been threads posted asking what the downfall of Reddit will be, and I think we're seeing it. It has nothing to do we Anderson Cooper, we're being killed because we're too big. It was fun when it was small and there were no celebrity Redditors.... Those days are gone.","1317430362"

The problem is the lack of critical thinking and adversity to change and innovation. This applies to all aspects of Japanese society which is inherently very regimented. You have hikikomori and low birth rates. Women's rights has progressed at a snails pace. Japan has an aging population and yet is still staunchly against letting immigrants with skills come in.

My impression of Japan is that they are happy to continue letting things remain mostly unchanged, still believing they are the crown jewel of civilization in Eastern Asia.

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","Heh. If you could call it dating. Maybe two or three times a year I meet a new girl and ask her out to coffee. Maybe 50% say yes. I never hear back from them after the first date. 

Appearance: I'm nothing special. I'm a little overweight, but I'm on a diet and it's going alright. Been on this diet since June 26th, and I've gone from 195.4 to 187.6 as of this morning. Slowly, but I'm making progress. I don't dress particularly fancy on a given day, jeans and a t-shirt, but I can and do clean up when the occasion requests it.

I don't have real confidence. I have fake confidence. That really obvious, overcompensating kind. It seems to work, at least a bit, but it makes me feel inauthentic, drained, like it took all of my psychic energy to put up the false front, and it'll take two weeks to recover. As for your definition of confidence: Moderate cockyness is down but it's very obviously fake. Overestimation of self, I'm getting alright at it but it's still hard, given that I was raised to believe that I would go to hell if I wasn't modest enough. I cannot be rude to people, especially strangers. I'm canadian though so I might get a pass on that. And being completely calm, I can do that, at least for long enough to court someone. 

The problem is that I don't really love myself. I don't hate myself. I just, I don't really care overly much about much of anything really. I find it hard to be confident about my work, because I simultaneously know that a) I am much much better than the average of people with my level of experience, in my line of work; and b) I am by far the worst at my job, where I work. Which kind of saps one's confidence a lot.

As for hobbies, my problem is that I don't really have any serious hobbies. I haven't found anything that really catches my fancy. There are a few things I am interested in that might be cool, but I just plain can't afford. For example, hang gliding. I went ultralighting (hang glider with a motor) once this summer. It was super fun. But it was $250, and a 90 minute drive away. I cannot afford $250 with any regularity, and I don't have a car. 

I recently discovered a group called the [Society for Creative Anachronism](http://www.sca.org) and this seems promising. They go to the archery range every week. Archery is something I've actually always been good at, and maybe I will take it more seriously.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","If you look at the evolution from Opiate -&gt; Undertow -&gt; Ænima -&gt; Lateralus you can kind of see a pattern there. In Opiate they had more of a garage band sound. They clearly stood apart but it wasn't like they were going to be legendary or anything. Then they got a bit of studio time and produced their first ""real"" record (Undertow), which led to a more composed album with insanely involving videos. They blew up on that album, which led to them having more time/freedom to devote to Ænima. With Ænima they obviously started really moving towards the type of music that they really felt was significant. Songs like Pushit and Third Eye had a level of composition that they really hadn't shown before, while songs like 46x2 showed off Maynard's brilliance and ability to put huge ideas into the format of an amazing song. Then came Lateralus, where they really embraced that Pushit/Third Eye composition and expanded it across an entire album. They went from Maynard's lyrics containing ideas to laying entire tracks as a display of executing equations while Maynard sang about it. 

It's almost like they just discovered how fulfilling real composition was and devoted themselves to it more and more as time went on, realizing that they had the ability to make some really special music. 

I don't know, that's the explanation that I've come up with after thinking about this for quite some time. ","1317430390"

Go [here](http://www.single-bid-auctions.com/us/index.php) for more items that are $1 or less and sort them by ""ending soonest"" to get a great deal

Go [here](http://typohound.com/) and do a search for brand names and you'll find a shitload of misspelled listings.  Misspellings = fewer bidders.

1. Food speculation facilitates food production. When farmers can sell contracts for the future delivery of food, it decreases uncertainty in the markets. This means it is easier to produce food.
2. Considering the financial market has exploded due to the influx of government debt, it's of no surprise that some of those would have gone into the food market. Also, with the drought going on in many parts of the world, this also drives up prices.
3. The proportion of food spent on food in developing countries is higher because they don't have stable income from a productive economy. Industrialization leads to more income and the ability to buy more goods with the income, meaning the relative prices of food decreases.
4. The only regulation that needs to happen is deregulation. Borders impede trade across borders, meaning people will be made poorer and less goods will be available. You want better nourished people? Get rid of protectionism.","1317430399"

In my office, like many offices in Japan, we still use floppy disks and fax machines. They probably use floppy disks and fax machines over at Tokyo University, where they are actually making important scientific and technological breakthroughs. If you focus on superficial aspects like that, then its easy to miss the real development.

As for ebooks, it isn't about the technology. Japan has a very complex network of publishers and a maze of legal issues. Most of the ebooks sold aren't novels, but disposable manga for phones to amuse OLs on the train ride home. And the fact that, as you said, the Japanese like tangible things, like you know... books. Don't get me wrong, I like my Kindle, but I also like the fact that Japanese people actually read. Go to any bookshop any day of the week. It will be packed. I can't remember seeing a packed bookshop back where I'm from. They like books, they like the format, they like the whole ritual. I kind of miss that when I'm back home.

You need to compare with an absolute or a relative precision (depending on your usage, for accounting, absolute precision may sometimes be what you need. For simulation, you probably need relative precision).

For absolute precision, do something like this: abs(x - y) &lt; Epsilon where Epsilon is an absolute error sufficiently small for your usage

For relative precision, better do something like this: abs(x - y) / (abs(x) + abs(y)) &lt; Epsilon

where you define Epsilon as a relative error sufficiently small for your usage.

I'm kinda saddened by his Deconstruction album in a way, because I get the feeling he doesn't feel like he's succeeded in making a (difference/impact) on people, or that his influence hasn't been as great as he'd hoped... I'm getting this from the lyrics of ""The Mighty Masturbator"" (You can't ever save the world, you fool, you child)...but for me it's the raw emotion from him that enlightens me, to hear it expressed in such an entertaining and thoughtful way.

My grandma is from Sibiu, Romania. She went to the market one Summer morning in 1944 to get the day's groceries for her family. A train pulled in, Russian soldiers stormed out and captured everyone they saw, including her.  EVERYONE. She never saw her family again. My grandmother spent the next 2 years digging coal by winter and laying railroad tracks by summer. She was raped and beaten several times per week. Russian labor prisoners were often treated worse than the Germans treated the Jews; they'd just work prisoners to death then go capture more. Food only came once or twice a week in the form of a bowl of hot water with a cabbage leaf in it. You didn't make friends because they'd be dead in a week or two. How she survived she doesn't know. She managed to escape, travelled west by night for several months, until she found herself in Austria in late 1946 to learn the war was over. She was never able to reunite with any of her family that might have survived.

Russia wasn't any kind of hero, please remember that.","1317430444"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Baked Brie with fig or apricot preserves. So easy and my friends always love it and ask me to bring it.

There are many different ways to do it, but this is mine:

 
You need:

1 can refrigerated crescent roll dough

1 round of Brie (I usually use the smaller one, I think its 8oz, also I cut the rind off, but I've heard of people who don't, so your call.)

1 Egg

1 can of preserves (I prefer fig or apricot, but whatever tickles your fancy :] )


Open dough, it should already be perforated into two squares, each square divided into two triangles.

Separate the dough into the two squares. Then meld the triangle perforations together so there are two full pieces of square dough.

Place the brie in the middle of one of the squares.

Fold the corners of the square up on top of the brie so the dough hugs the brie.

Place the second square of dough on top and fold the corners down so brie is now completely covered in a pillow of dough.

Press the corners into the dough so they stick.

Now scramble one egg, and if you have a brush use that, I'm not that fancy and just dip a paper towel in the egg and rub it all over the dough. The egg makes it more flakey and delicious.

Pop in the oven on a lightly greased pan at 350 degrees for somewhere around 15 minutes (just keep an eye on it till it looks golden brown.)

Serve warm and spread the preserves on top.

Now prepare for a dance party on your taste buds.","1317430444"

The 2nd amendment is not for hunters. It's for the people. It clearly states it is for the people. It also clearly states it shall NOT be infringed.

The funny thing is, if you were a car enthusiast and someone told you you could no longer own a car that goes over the maximum speed limit in your municipality and you'd have to get permission to drive it outside of your town and take it to a shop to have the speed limiting device removed you'd have a shit-fit. There is NO constitutional right to owning an automobile and the gov't would be well within their power to do exactly what I just described. Not so with firearms.

Also get a clue, handguns are concealable so people can defend themselves. Lots of people carry handguns and you don't know about it.  Get over it.

What I said about water, tea and steam still holds especially true, particularly tea.

Sirening is a good exercise to gently warm up the upper range; say the word ""sing"", but then hold the n sound and adjust the pitch like a siren. Start somewhere comfortable in your voice and gradually slide up and down, oscillating further and further away from your starting note until you reach the limits. Don't push if it hurts and don't move too slowly over the extremities. Make it one smooth, continuous siren and don't be afraid to slide a little higher than you'd expect to be able to; it's an easy consonant to slide into high notes on, just as long as it doesn't hurt.

Once he mentioned Wall Street, it means he's joining in the political message.  If all he did was maintain the police, then fine.  But that's obviously not what he's doing, especially once you read his other comments.

&gt;but i guess your opinion supersedes the legal definitions used by the VA or countless state-level veterans' organizations

Those definitions determine eligibility for aid, not the definition in terms of colloquial daily [use.](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/benefits/a/vetbenefits.htm)  Regardless, that has become semantics seeing as how OP has clarified his status.

First, it'll need better acting talent than the web series. I think the director attached seems to be pretty decent, but the webseries definitely had that ""budget actor"" feel.

Second, it needs to have a unified feel to it. The webseries was all over the place, especially with the Kitana/Mileena bit.

This is also kind of my third thing: the movie will need some very good writers who aren't afraid to deviate from the source material. The Mortal Kombat characters are all awesome ideas, but a lot of the fluff and backstory is completely ridiculous and unfilimable. The universe will have to be heavily re-imagined to make a coherent movie. This will be tough to do.","1317430479"

It's like, I dunno, trying to drive over 90mph on wet roads.  After a while you start to get cocky, and more comfortable stepping on the gas, and slowly you creep to 100mph, then 110mph, and then you gotta decide: ""is it even important to me to get where I'm going safely?  am I going anywhere worth getting to?"".  But it's a trap because after a few years of driving in the rain, what could you have possibly built up for yourself other than tolerance for speed and danger?  So you say ""nope"", and keep pressing that gas.  120mph, 130mph---now you're fishtailing and other drivers are looking at you like ""what is wrong with him?  why can't he slow down?"".  But they aren't like you anymore.  You're changed.

Also, some time when you are not running the game but doing anything you usually do when you do run the game (for example, do you usually have your other computer on when you run the game? If so, have it one when you do this) then I would like you to visit both [here](http://www.speedtest.net/) and [here](http://pingtest.net/) and see what you get. The combination of these should determine whether you are having a computer problem or a network problem. Also, just for kicks, open up system monitor when you're running tf2 and see what you get for CPU and memory load.

TF2 updates tend to be pretty hard on macs, so I would *not* be surprised if an update killed it for you. However, it didn't kill it for me, and I have a mac, so it would have to be an individual thing. Mind sharing your computer model + specs?

A couple last recommendations; first, did you back up your config folder? If so, restore it. If not, well, I'll see if I can see how to get that back to normal, it should be simple I just need to see how. And also, try playing around with your graphics settings, (if it is CPU that is the problem, that is) maybe use the auto balance?

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","You are confusing having ""nice"" fans with people not caring about your squad. There's no major sports demographic down there. And for you to say that people understand that they don't have to pay all the insane costs of going to a sporting event better down there, you are nuts. Everyone comprehends that.  It's not an original thought. All I have to say about that is ""cowbells."" What kind of ridiculous fan base thinks cowbells at a baseball game are a good idea? What is this, DIII Lacrosse? 

Btw, you are wrong about fans converting. If you are capable of being born and raised as a die hard fan of one team for your entire life and then instantly switching because of a little success somewhere else, then I'm sorry, but you were never a fan in the first place. Especially within the division. It's weak minded bandwagon jumping.

Give it a rest about there being bad fans around the rest of the country. There aren't. There are bad people everywhere. Bad people do bad things. When there are sellouts every game in a city and exponentially more fans, then clearly problems will coincide with sporting events more often. It's not some mystical accident that where the largest number of fans are is where the largest number of fan-related legal problems are.

Sorry, man, but hey, it's not the fan's fault they are phony. The team has been around for like 10 minutes. Give it some time. Maybe someday that city will be Philly, Boston or NY. But most likely not. It'll probably always be LA, Atlanta or Miami. Places where sports are an afterthought or a socializing event and not a passion.","1317430504"

"Warhammer","t5_2qqd4","Honestly for a first time list that's largely on the money, a nice list of good units that will work together well. NOW FOR THE CRITIZUMMZ!!

So your Nobs don't care about having a big shoota, if you tried to offer a Nob one he wouldn't take it as he's too busy krumping tanks and ruining fools with his Powerklaw. They are a nice cheap upgrade but they belong in the hands of the boyz. 

20 Boyz will do ok, 30 Boyz will do everyone. Bigger Units of Boys are better, those extra ten boyz will probably be dead by the time you hit their lines but that's what they are there for, to soak up the pain and make sure that an effective unit makes it into combat. 

65 points on a Trukk?!? That's about 60 too much!! Ditch those pricey upgrades, Red Paint and a Reinforced Ram will do. A rokkit launcher will draw unwanted attention when all you want to do is go flat out and get your boys into combat, it is very much a transport vehicle. If you really want a pimp upgrade check out boarding planks but only if you have the points for them lying around.

Bonus Pro Tip!! Koptas can be taken as units of 1, as you have the slots to separate them, this will stop 2 running off if 1 dies an also stop extra wounds bleeding over onto the other koptas, you can still fire all of them at the same stuff so it's pretty much a win/win.

Overall a great list for a first go, there's a lot of good advice already in this thread, take it on board and you'll be krumping in no time.","1317430505"

She says she feels unappreciated with you not give her credit to come see you. Do you help pay for expenses when she comes to see you? And what kind of person is not affectionate with the person they love? The only time I've been unaffectionate with an SO is when I'm not really into it. Love makes you do things, like being affectionate with your loved one.

Not knowing anything about the situation or the relationship, sounds like she's not happy and you're being kinda clingy. She definitely holds the power in this relationship and you're left to sit there and look up at her and whimper like a love sick puppydog to their 'unaffectionate' master. 

Sorry if its harsh but I've been in her position before and said the same things and had the same response back and it just made me even less into the relationship. I've also been on your side and had my partner be on her side and they weren't honest with me and strung me along so long at the risk of not wanting to hurt me (which hurt more). I'd ask her what she really wants, point blank, and ask if she's still into the relationship. Hopefully if she is, you guys can work things out, and if she isn't, things might still be at a point where you guys can still be friends.

Again, I don't know anything about the situation or the relationship or who either of you are, this is just what I'm getting out of the messages.","1317430508"

I don't think there is any chance of this happening because there are literally hundreds of economic free zones in the world, some of which are pretty free (such as the Lekki Free Zone of Lagos, Nigeria, which sports zero taxes, zero import/export restrictions and full foreign ownership). None of these have been attacked, and neither has Hong Kong and Singapore. They are not tax havens but rather build up their own economic production. It's going to be extremely hard to justify attacking an African country for reforming its government in the direction of economic freedom.","1317430509"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I drew up a quick draft of my own, feel free to comment if anything is missing or needs to be improved:  
  
Grievances:  
  
-The ratings agencies have abandoned their mandate to do due diligence on the ratings they assign, and have thereby undermined the ability of individual investors, and the market at large, to make sound decisions.  
  
-The large banks have moved off the partnership model which incentivized the long term health of the bank and have failed to adopt a new model that similarly incentivizes the banks actions. They have instead instituted models that provide warped incentives for high-risk behavior through awarding large bonuses for short term success.  
  
-They have leveraged themselves far beyond any sane level.  
  
-They have intentionally deceived investors and sold them assets known to be worthless as a matter of policy. Consequently they have engaged in unsound investment strategies, backed by the knowledge that they can sell their mistakes to unwitting investors should they go bad, before their worthlessness is publicly known.  
  
-They have embraced a vision of Wall Street that derives most of its profit not from the efficient allocation of capital and the attendant growth in the wider economy, but from the zero sum trading games exemplified by the Credit Default Swaps which were essentially pure bets.  
  
-They have taken taxpayer bailouts designed to ease credit markets and have refused to use them for their stated purpose of lending to businesses to allow new investment and growth.  
  
-They have bought and sold influence in Washginton with greater fervor than they have bought and sold investments, and have rewritten the laws that govern their businesses to the disadvantage of everyone in the country but themselves.  
  
-They have abandoned their responsibility to manage risk, both for their clients and for the sake of the stability of the wider system. They have at times allowed entire departments in their organizations to operate with no internal oversight.  
  
-They have engaged in, or encouraged, predatory lending practices, knowing that they could pass the losses from eventual default onto investors.  
  
-They have engaged in regulatory capture and evasion by either deceiving regulators, or buying them off entirely.  
  
-They have conspired to mask the extent of soverign debt outside our borders, for the express purpose of deceiving the European citizenry and profiting off of the economic turmoil of America's allies.  
  
  
Demands:  
  
-Robust oversight of all financial activities, both internal and through strong federal regulation  
  
-Reasonable leverage caps and fractional reserve requirements  
  
-Prosecution of any and all individuals who engage in fraudulent activity, especially activity designed to deny information to the market or act on privileged access to information  
  
-Robust laws requiring the documentation of all activities and internal decision making, and strong prosecution of any institution that fails to deliver such documents upon subpoena, for any reason  
  
-Changes to compensation strucutre, especially at the executive level, that would reward long term stability and solvency over short term gains.  
  
-Fines for any legal violation of an amount significantly in excess of the profit derived from such violation.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Military veterans and members,

As some of you already know, there are regulations to wearing the uniform. Please consider wearing similar CIVILIAN outfits as opposed to any military uniform. Consider the spin news agencies will use to summarize the situation: ""Rogue Marines don(sp?) uniform for wild protests,"" etc. You can wear BDU pants with black shirts and cover, wear similar civilian clothing intermixed with military outfits or something.

If you REALLY have to wear full military uniforms, look outstanding. Proper ribbons, correct order, verify that everyone with you actually served and/or has a clean record... If ONE bad guy acting like a military servicemen gets in there... It WILL look bad.

Do your best to show uniformity and to work within and around the legal framework we've been given. This has just as much potential to make our servicemen look bad.

They key element you all have is that our servicemen always need our support but the moment Fox News or whoever breaks the mold ... It wont be a trump card anymore. 

Good luck... I'm so proud that we have veterans willing to stand up for us........

my third point - I don't understand your argument here i guess - i work at an exhibition center, many out-of-town artist didn't come, one came from out of the US but left after two nights.  Not all artist stand next to their work for 19 days so I don't see how the length really comes into play.  also i was just talking about delaying the top ten announcement not adding days to the competition, sorry if that wasn't clear.

It should be clear by now that while he remains in power, there is no democracy in that country and I dont think the west will deal with him, because it certainly looks like the system has been set up with corruption in mind.

The Sri Lankans are hard working and highly intelligent people. 
The west could certainly benefit from these people who have suffered so long.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The point that a lot of new urbanists make is not that cars don't make sense - it's that the urban design that makes cars *necessary* is itself unnecessary.

You could bike to work if work was closer - but with the standard North American format of putting office parks way off in the middle nowhere right next to a freeway, this is not possible. You could *bus* or take the train to work if you lived a walkable area (and your work is similarly in a walkable area). Note that this doesn't necessarily mean high-density urban centers - streetcar neighborhoods (which by modern definitions would be suburban) existed before cars and worked very well.

There was a TED talk a while back from a new urbanist who demonstrated the negative impact of meandering suburban streets on walkability and transit coverage. Basically, at the same density level, a grid-shaped planning allows people to walk more places, faster, than the standard North American design of the suburb with meandering country-like roads. The whole ""but I like my yard!"" thing is really a red herring when it comes to standard arguments against transit-friendly development.

You wouldn't *need* a car to go shopping if shopping was on your way home from work. I had this arrangement in Seattle, and I never had to buy enough stuff to need a car, since it was on the way home and I could shop 5 times a week without any real impact to my time.

What new urbanists propose is not banning cars or doing anything silly like that. What they propose is a radical redesign of our cities such that car ownership is *unnecessary* - and that once we do so, people will naturally start getting rid of (most) cars and living a higher quality of life for it.","1317430558"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","So all of your friends get together the day after Halloween to trade candy. Charlie has *a lot* of lollipops to trade, Evan brought all his Mars Bars, and Andrew brought those little gummy Dots. You brought [insert favorite candy here]. You're all trading back and forth, hoping to get the most candy from everyone else at the cheapest price, so you bargain. You trade two of your favorite candy for one of Evan's Mars Bars, which you then trade to Andrew for four boxes of dots. While Andrew is trading with Charlie, you trade two of the four boxes of dots to Evan to get two pieces of your favorite candy back, meaning you end up with more than you started with. 

Everyone's trying to come out on top, trading back and forth for whatever candy is the best value at the moment when suddenly Charlie yells to stop. He announces that from now on, his price for four lollipops is one box of dots (the candy that you all use to value your own), or an equivalent value of another candy. He will no longer accept offers of different amounts. Only one box of dots for four lollipops, final.

What does this mean for you? It means that now there is no reason to trade for anyone else's lollipops at any other value. If you trade one box of dots to Evan for three lollipops, you'll be worse off than if you'd traded them to Charlie for four. And why would anyone trade five lollipops for a box of dots when they could go to Charlie and get the box four for lollipops and keep the change?

This is how China gets away with devaluing its currency. Basically they say, ""this is how much one Yuan is worth, and if you don't pay it than you don't get it."" no one else pays any other price for Yuan because there's no reason or profit in doing so.

The Chinese do this so that their products will be cheaper in other countries. A widget that costs four Yuan to produce will only cost one dollar in the United States. If the exchange rates changed to, say, only 2 Yuan to a dollar, that product would suddenly cost two dollars and less people would buy it.

Other countries do manipulate their currencies, but in different ways, often by controlling the amount of money in circulation (simply printing more money causes the value to decrease, and removing it makes it more valuable), but that's an explanation for another time. Suffice it to say that it's not in their best interests to do it to the extent that China does.","1317430566"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","On the food score, I'd say it depends entirely one whether Costco has items that you would normally eat. In the case of this author, clearly it pays. In my case, the jury is out on that because I don't eat much processed food at all and get all my produce and meat from the Farmer's Market, which, while more expensive, really doesn't compare at all to what is available at Costco in terms of freshness, flavor and quality. 

However, Costco memberships can easily pay for themselves on single purchase items. One can easily save much more than the cost of the membership on a single purchase like a fiberglass extension ladder, or a cell phone, or a very few repeat purchases of things like salmon, olive oil, etc. Or, another example is that some of their supplements are competitive enough to pay for a membership by themselves over the course of a year, easily. 

So, there's lots of reasons why a membership makes sense. The trick is to not get drawn into purchases you would not have normally made. That's how they make their money. It's not about scheduled routine purchases, it's about luring you into impulse buys that you otherwise would not have seriously considered. ","1317430577"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Even though you are probably starting it with close friends, make sure you are equally inviting to anyone you don't know who looks to get involved. This is really key in starting an interest club in high school. People might not know that much about the game but if they enjoy themselves they will certainly get interested.

That way it will expand beyond just you and your buddies and become a real social experience. When your explaining things to new faces ask if anyone is completely new to the game, That way you will know to explain things out, the same way casters approach a casual audience.
 
For your first meet-up, get some cheap, funny posters around the school, maybe give out some food if you can swing it. (Korean Candy?) Then you can show an epic game up on a projector with maybe some light explanation beforehand so everyone is hooked.

There's a few videos of huge outdoor BW games with players in capes, and insane audiences that could certainly raise a few eyebrows from people who have not heard of Starcraft before. Then you can show them some modern SC2.

If you guys have any guest passes kicking around that might be a good thing to pass out if anyone has not played. If you do have a few of those around make sure to mention it on the posters, a free game demo could certainly get some people in the door. Just note the limited quantity, you could do a quiz at the end of the session if too many people show up. Otherwise point people towards the free edition of SC2 that is out now. (Just be clear it is not representative of how awesome the full version is.)

Also be clear with the scheduling of the next meet-ups after your first session, get email addresses, numbers, the whole thing will be killed if people can't find out when it is. Inevitably people will have some conflicts, so talking about this will allow you to find times which work for meetings, to the best of your ability.

Getting everyone to pitch in for GSL/MLG passes would be a great way to save money, that way you can enjoy the games together without turning people away by telling them they have to spend a but-ton of money on streams to know what is happening competitively. 

I would investigate how these things work with multiple people trying to access though. (Like watching GOM VODs from many addresses.) If there's a problem you can reserve them for watching games just from the school address. This depends on how your club skews from watching, to playing together of course. ","1317430586"

I can definitely see your moral dilemma. I don't think you need to work for a religious group, there are plenty of alternatives. 

Check with a local University. I know my local college does a [Food Not Bombs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs) event every week in the park, I'm sure they're up to something on the holidays. 

Your local Food Bank may also need people, I'm sure their work picks up around now. They often need both logistic and manual help. 

Toys for Tots? I don't know if the're religious.

My mom works in a nursing home. For the love of god, if you play an instrument go around and perform. Those people are completely forgotten - it will seriously make their year. Or bring in your dog for some pet therapy. The holidays haven't been special for those poor people in a long time. 

Remember that wherever you choose to volunteer, you may need to sign up a little bit ahead of time in case they have a mandatory training program. 

Also, maybe there would be a semi-religious group you would be more ok with - maybe a Buddhist group? Or Muslim group, just to even the numbers?

Thanks again for the great idea - it would be really neat if this could be a movement within the non-believing community. ","1317430591"

Maybe that's why we hate on them. For us, they've outlived their purpose.

However, I don't like either either of these organizations because they don't reveal a complete picture. They are just as biased as the world they try to get away from. Some pet peeves:

* 'stealing' good dumpsters away from those of us who need them to run our community food programmes

* not revealing the full scale of government repression. Sure they'll encourage you to ride the rails, but will they tell you proper ""how to cope with the police"" etiquette when you're getting deported for riding said rails?

* not teaching people how to really start their own initiatives. Even *Recipes* (which I bought for instruction and inspiration) doesn't teach me how to start an urban repair squad. But it should. It is these initiatives that we need to encourage others.

* encourages people to call themselves ""anarchists"" when they're not, really. This also why I am sometimes annoyed at the black bloc (even while I am working with the bloc)","1317430599"

"confession","t5_2qo2a","If the girl had turned out to be horribly ugly, deformed, or even a withered crone, you'd feel foolish, betrayed, depressed, and lots of other things, to be sure.  But because it's a 'he'--your emotional connection, your sexual compatibility, your personal attraction to another human being notwithstanding--you feel rage enough to tear him limb from limb.

What if he were a post-op transsexual, and you just found the evidence of her previous gender?  Would that make it just a little more okay?  Enough to transmute your murderous rage into some compassion for this person you've had, dare I say, a relationship with?

You're assuming that you've been ""played"", that this person's only possible rationale for lying to you in such a manner is to trick you, to humiliate you, to expose to the world that awful shadow side of yourself that you won't even allow yourself to see.  But they didn't actually expose you, or humiliate you in any way.  And this wasn't an omegle chat session, or even a short fling.   This was a 4-month relationship--not even the most cold-blooded psychopath would dupe a complete stranger so well and for so long without any ulterior motive.  

No, it is a virtual certainty that this person is struggling with some powerful identity issues.  They didn't betray you or violate you; they simply lied to you about one (fairly major) thing.  And let's not forget that you lied to them about one fairly major thing too.  So as far as that goes, the score is even.  Can you imagine what this person might have felt if, instead of you finding out their lie, they found out yours?  Betrayal, violation, stupid.  All guys on the internet are cheating assholes just trying to get someone to type dirty to them while their girlfriends are asleep in their beds.

So I invite you to take this opportunity for some profound personal growth.  Some of your negative feelings are completely reasonable, if also completely deserved.  But the intensity of some of those feelings is a wake-up call that you have some profound cognitive dissonance going on, and you would rather murder the messenger than face your deepest fears.

You almost fell in love with a man pretending to be a woman on the internet.  Does that make you a little gay?  Does considering the mere possibility terrify you?  Why is that thought so profoundly unbearable?

Why would feeling a romantic/sexual attraction to a boy be so much infinitely worse than cheating on your girl?

Again, this isn't about me and my own relationship (wow, seems like a movie scene now like it really is about me) but just curious how men think, or why some men think like that. Do you think some men do those things because they truly aren't interested in the woman? If I was a guy, and I was doing that, I'd rather just break up with the woman and find one that I would want to have around to participate in those things with. Shoot if I was a woman and I was doing that to a guy, ignoring him, he wouldn't be around anymore. I wonder why some women put up with it. Maybe some guys do too. I wouldn't know but it was sure interesting to think about when I originally posted this.  Thanks again.","1317430603"

"recipes","t5_2qh56","A basic, add anything to it recipe.  We like to make a big batch and freeze it into smaller containers.  Then we re-heat it as needed but add different stuff to it each time.  You can add anything to make it different from the last sauce - meats, herbs, spices... 

We usually make a big batch, but I'll keep it simple.  Double, or triple it for your needs.

* 29 oz can Tomato Sauce, usually use Hunts
* 1 or 2 TBSP tomato paste
* Green bell pepper, chopped
* 1/2 Red onion, chopped
* 3 or 4 cloves minced garlic (We like garlic, use 2 cloves if you're not sure)
* 2 TBSP Olive oil (use canola oil, vegetable oil, butter, whatever you have)  Whatever you use just eyeball it...
* Salt and pepper to taste

How to: 

1. Heat a pot, add oil, peppers, and onions
2. Cook veggies till they're nice and soft then add garlic
3. Cook for about 1 minute then kill the heat
4.  Add tomato sauce and paste.  Stir to combine everything
5. Turn on heat until the sauce is as warm as you like it
6. Salt and pepper to taste

That's it.  Enjoy!","1317430608"

"Chattanooga","t5_2qnd8","I got my last car at Long Hyundai. Compact, six years old, 55k miles, one previous owner and no major past incidents. They were charging 7000 for it, but I went through a credit union instead of financing through them, and the credit union argued 800 off the price. About six weeks after purchasing the car it developed an intermittent problem. Took it to the dealer, they worked on it, I paid some money, then as I drove away, the issue happened again. Took it back and they kept it for a few weeks and gave me a loaner in the interim, and never charged me another cent. It has been three years since then and I've not had another issue with the car. So I felt like they treated me right in that situation.

$2900 may not buy a great car but it would be a good start on a better quality one. ","1317430611"

I kept a wallet full of business cards for the two foreign owned restaurants in the entire city, the one foreign owned hostel, and had a small 1 page guide of the city to where to drink, where to eat, and where not to go if you didn't want to be accosted by hookers. 

Which of course could be used by those who did want to be accosted by hookers, but each to their own I guess.

I used to give them out to lost looking travelers and would I sometimes invited them to my school to hang out with the rest of the foreign teachers. The other teachers thought it was weird, but the kids loved it. They'd be lining up around the block to try to talk to the new foreigner.

So yeah.. BE nice to the local expats. Not all of us are cold fish who avoid staring at other foreigners.

I just wanted to say I appreciate this post. Hits on a lot of things that I've been thinking about since this whole upheaval over r/jailbait began.

I'm ~~probably~~ definitely biased as I'm infatuated with someone (he's 32) who is an ephebophile (I look young for my age so that no doubt plays into his sexual attraction to me). I hate to see him vilified; he's a good man and arguably my best friend. He would never pursue an underage girl but he shouldn't have to feel guilty about his ""kink"", if you even want to call it that, since there's nothing unusual about being attracted to a girl who is sexually mature (even if in every other way she is a child). He should have access to a place like r/jailbait where he can, in the privacy of his own home, get off to whatever the fuck turns him on.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;But why would you necessarily start from the logic of self ownership? Why not start from the logic of everyone being part of a connected ecosystem with each person sharing responsibility for the common good and the natural environment as well as oneself?

Because the logic of self ownership is the only one backed up by actual biology and science. Self Ownership is not an opinion it is a demonstrable fact. You literally cannot give someone total control of your body in so far as they can manipulate you to do anything they want. All actions involving you and another party on some level either involve force (which would be unnecessary if you did not own yourself because they could simply control you) or voluntary interaction (which implys that there are two people making decisions) From the absolute fact of self ownership comes all the rest of the NAP. If a man owns himself than no other person can own him. If no other person can own him than the things which have sprung from the use of his self ownership are owned by no one but himself. If the things that he owns are his and only his than I cannot simply take them without expecting retaliation. If I cannot take without expecting some form of retaliation than the best way to acquire goods without risking losing my own is voluntary interaction. NAP.","1317430639"

I'm sure that there are a ton of bands out there that could match syllables to the Fibonacci sequence, but I don't know if another single band out there could make it work so wonderfully throughout a song, especially while writing lyrics that seem transcendent to the human experience when they're about a sequence of numbers.

"RenewableEnergy","t5_2ryj2","Off grid has different incentives in Canada.  Most of the incentives in Canada are sadly Ontario-specific and have weird domestic content requirements.  For us the benefit is the lower lifetime kWh cost, even with replacement of AGM batteries every 4-5 years.  The lifecycle cost of operating a small diesel generator is something like 48 cents per kWh, and propane isn't much less.  It also has huge logistical difficulties with hauling fuel to the tops of 1400 meter mountains in snowcats in the middle of winter.  

The challenge is that a system which produces 500kWh a month in mid summer has an abysmal winter solstice power output (mid December) at 52 degrees north latitude.  The solar needs to be significantly oversized and we still have a 2.5kW propane generator to run a battery charger a few hours a day for a couple months out of the year.  Still, $500 to $550 a year propane bill is much better than the alternative.

"java","t5_2qhd7","Looking at your code, I think it would really help you to work on the early, boring phases of your programming process.  It's generally in the first chapter of your programming book, sometimes it's the entire first chapter.  It talks about writing out the goals of your program and what-not.  It'll mention things like functional decomposition, and will generally try and put you to sleep if you've never written a program before.

This section of the book is meant to be revisited.  I was never actually told this by any of my teachers, but it helped me out tremendously.  This section, more than any other, will help you write good programs quickly and translates to any language.  

Until you feel like you have a solid system down that can tackle any programming challenge known to man, I would keep revisiting that part of your textbook with every knew program you write, and try to find more and more efficient ways of planning out your program before you actually start coding.  Once you get good at that boring shit, programming gets SO much easier.

So, with this problem you've got right now.  I would try and start fresh, and try and divide the program up into sections before you tackle it.  You know you're going to need a 5x5 board for the game, so you're going to need a block of code that stores 25 nodes with 3 possible states each (X,O, or Null).  You're going to need a block of code that translates the previous block of code so that it can display the board to the user.  You're going to need several more blocks of code.  You know what a lot of them are, just from casually glancing at the program instructions, so write them down.  Once you write down all the needs of your program, put them into your code as comments and then try and flesh it out.

Not only is your coding easier this way, it really helps when you ask other people for help.","1317430663"

I'm pretty sure to most people Paleo is a guideline, a framework for better eating and living, not a strict diet you have to follow or you are a poser.  

80/20 is fine, IMO.  Just don't go crazy that 20% of the time and you should be fine.  That said.  If you love pasta, learn to hand make it, and use coconut flour or something in the place of wheat (semolina).  

It seems to me everybody has their own version of paleo, from tropics natives to eskimos, each vision is strikingly different.

Eat real foods, mostly meats and vegetables and limit processed foods as much as possible (little to never) and you are on your way to being paleo.

Imagine if you took the assembly instructions for a car, deleted a few parts, switched a few steps around, generally screwed around with it.  The end result wouldn't look the same.  Your DNA carries the genes that are your body's assembly instructions.  Yours get screwed up, you can have problems.

But this isn't as clear cut as Mr. Greenwald makes it. I enjoy his writing but he oversimplifies alot.

This situation didn't exist 200 years ago, not even 100 years ago. We have a U.S. citizen wanted for inciting/colaboration/leading terrorists (I mean this guy has been linked directly to almost every al qaida plot in the last 10 year) who is hiding purposflully in a non extridition country.

He removed himself from due process by fleeing to Yemen. If Obama had him killed in say france, or south los angeles, then yes he was deprived of his rights. But he ran to a terroist refuge. To give him the due process Ron Paul and Mr. Greenwald opine for would require we do another Bin Laden style raid but add the complication that we take him back alive.

Well... that may just be something you need to discuss with them in a very frank manner.  ""You can continue to live here until you're 18, or as long as you're going to school (or working?).""  Once 18 hits and they're out of high school (one way or another), you need to make the decision about their commitment level.  Let them stay if they're going to continue school, or if they're making a job commitment... but if they're just going to sit on their asses, make it known that they have X months to get in gear or get out.  Sometimes they just need the realization that if they don't shape up, you're not going to continue to support their bad habits.

I'm going on first-and-a-half-hand experience here.  My own son is only 3, but I've been closely involved (as an adult) with friends and family who had to go through these situations.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Ok, first off -- I'm going to need you to calm down a little bit and try to read my words in a less attacking tone, please. You seem to be getting defensive and I'm not interested in going that direction.

It has to do with its priorities in your life. If it's as big and emotional of a deal as you claim -- you would feel the need to assist in fixing it. Obviously it's not so cruel you feel the overwhelming need to DO something about it -- so that brings in to question just *how* cruel is it. You are primarily focused on the people doing this and don't even seem to have a care that activists and the government are putting them in this situation. Again, this speaks volumes for your priorities on the matter and seems to communicate to me that you aren't interested in fixing the situation, offering suggestions, or anything to help -- you're just interested in being upset to be upset. There are times that's ok -- for me, for instance, there is a ban in smoking in restaurants where I live. I think that's wrong but I don't care to do anything about it -- it's obviously not THAT important to me -- but as an American, I view banning smoking in a restaurant as very wrong. I'm trying to say that your view on the situation is akin to how I feel about the ban on smoking.

Going back to the point -- these aren't people who are doing this because they don't like pets. These aren't people who do it *just* to see animals in pain. These are people who feel they have no other *PRACTICAL* option.","1317430711"

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","Probably has to do with your arm length. I thought of this to kind of illustrate what happens.

Get a broomstick and go to a wall. Face away from the wall and lean against it with your shoulder blades. Fully retract your shoulder blades and hold the broomstick out like you're at lockout on the bench press. It's like a bench press set up but you're leaning against a wall instead of getting pressed into a bench.

You can get the broom a certain distance away from your body while keeping your shoulder blades perfectly locked together and retracted. But, to move the broom any further from your torso and your shoulder blades *have* to come apart. The fully retracted position is the ""tight"" position and anything less is ""losing tightness"".

For some, myself included, I have to unlock my shoulder blades (just a tad) to get the bar far enough from my torso to unrack it. Right now for me, at 175 pounds at 165 bodyweight, I can kind of reset my shoulder blades once I get the bar where I need it. My elbows are fully extended the whole time, but the bar noticeably comes closer to my torso a little bit when I do this. I'd imagine at oh shit weights that powerlifters are putting up, you don't really have the luxury of being able to retract your shoulder blades with 2-3x your body weight pressing down.","1317430711"

I keep forgetting who I've said what to, so apologies if I repeat myself. My plan is to seriously consider my options in the new year. Late january is pay review day. If I can get the raise I'm hoping for, I will stay here, be miserable for another year, and suck it up. Because I'll be able to bank like $2000 a month. I can suck it up for a little while to give myself an emergency fund. Whether or not I will get my hoped for raise is another question. In any case, that is the time when I will re-evaluate my situation. I have some friends in some relatively high places in San Francisco; just last night one of them told me she could pretty much guarantee me a job in my field within a few months, if I so chose. So we'll see where that goes

No one should be *interviewing* for the Revolution, here. Perhaps the media should be focusing on this very poignant and OBVIOUS symptom of the CLASS WARFARE underway? Wherein OWS has become the front lines?

Instead we have people in the 99 telling the 99 to dress smart, like they brought an entire warddrobe with them to the protests or have the ability to *fucking pop down the local Brooks Brothers* and pick up a quick something. 

How obnoxious. What people are wearing to the protests is an insanely Hollywood way of approaching the issues, and a red herring from what needs to be discussed and heard. Upvote.","1317430719"

They did not volunteer and donate against it, they didn't, and what percentage of the voters do you estimate are growers?  If they acted like the petroleum industry and had a super P.A.C. and had paid lobbyists and people to organized and work a campaign that would be one thing, but they didn't just look at the numbers. Did they give you any bumper stickers? The papers said, people say, just like you are, that's not proof, it's a slanderous rumor, just like the kind the political opposition tends to plant about their opposition.

But the point I want to make is that language learning is a life long adventure and you will always be learning and it will take a long time before you consider yourself ""fluent"".

That said, I was able to achieve a passable level of Japanese (i.e. enough to get me through most of my daily life) within a couple of years, and was able to engage people in conversation after 4-5 years.  Throughout my time in Japan I have only studied with an instructor 1.5 hours a week (though I have been doing that for the whole 14 years).  If I had taken a more intensive language course or studied longer, I may have had much faster progress.  Everyone is different too, and depending on the person and language it may take more or less time.

So, I tried looking up ""Liberty Square, NYC"" on Google Maps, but I couldn't find it exactly (Liberty St, Liberty Pl, Liberty Square in NJ... but no exact match). Since the ""How to get there"" link on occupywallst.org isn't working, I couldn't figure it out from there, either.

So, I just looked for the closest Papa Johns and Domino's to Wall Street. This is what I found:

Papa John's Store #3223 21 Maiden Lane New York, NY 10038 Phone: (212)608-7272
Domino's STORE 3682 181 Church Street New York, NY 10013 Phone: 212-566-8888

Is there anybody who can confirm this? (I feel like a dumbass not being able to figure it out, but geography has never been my forte, and I've only been to NYC once in my life.)

Also, I know beggar's can't be choosers... but are there any local pizza joints that folks could point us to in the area? I always like to support small businesses when I can - ESPECIALLY IN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS ONE!!!!!

EDIT: I have just sent an email to their general inquiries to see if they might be able to give us a list of nearby pizza places. I know they probably have a gazillion emails to sort through, but I figure it's worth a shot.","1317430740"

""These people"" cannot be lumped into a single category. 

Also, a vast majority of them think you deserve many rights, right to live, right to vote, right against search and seizure... maybe not the right to marry. 

&gt;They do not believe their children should know anything about homosexuality.

Not for their entire life, just maybe not at the age of 6. I don't agree with it, but I don't want to parent for them either.

&gt;They directly cause children to kill themselves because of these attitudes.

Actually it's *indirectly* 

Yes it's horrible, so is non-homosexual bullying which also kills people. 

&gt;There is nothing to 'understand' here. There is nothing to 'respect' about what they say or do. Not one fucking thing.

False. These people are your neighbors, have kids that go to your schools, work with you, go to book club with you (or whatever). They are fellow Canadians, not the boogyman.  

&gt;Would you tell Jews to respect the opinions of Nazis?

Not comparable at all. The Nazis directly rounded up the jews, put them into camps, made them slaves and killed them. The issue of homosexuality is far more complex, nuanced and subtle.

&gt;Would you tell black people to respect the opinions of the KKK?

A group that existed solely to deprive the other of their rights, harass  and often kill them. In contrast most people you identify as not deserving respect are middle class normal, nice and normal unassuming Canadians. 
 
&gt;Would you tell women to respect the opinions of people who believe they shouldn't be allowed to vote/drive/have control of their own wombs/whatever?

This touches on very complex issues. In the 1700s yes I suspect many women would respect men, even if they were not permitted to vote, it was a different time and what was acceptable/unacceptable was also different. 

I'm not touching the control their own womb point, that is also a point of significant contention.

* the plants tell you when they need water, they droop. So you have to get use to the frequency of watering, and once you do, seldom you will allow them to droop.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","she brightens at that and we start talking about china. she's from shenzen city which is the capital of sichuan. luckily i'm studying mandarin on campus and my eventual goal is to do business in china with my computer science degree-this is important and will be in future pickups!

it was (young) money! i (finally) asked her her name and gave her mine, and we talked about visiting china, she asked me if i knew any cities in china (wenzhou, nanjing, guangzhou-i mispronounced that one). when she mentioned beijing and shanghai i teased her saying everyone knew about those cities. it turns out that she's going to university here to get her m.ed (master's degree in education) and has dreams of teaching secondary education. as the train rose over the trans canada highway, she asked where i was from. i told her.

so then i asked her about the rest of her outfit clothes and where she got them. ""from an internet store in china,"" she replies. i ask to feel the velour of her hoodie and she lets me. i dunno why, i always wanted to do that though! then, i complimented her on her dimples, calling them ""really cute"". but something told me that she wasn't completely comfortable with it. most of the compliments i gave her in fact were pretty direct. cultural differences?

as we reached her stop (i wasn't going to bail now!) i decided to show her footsie. i think it was an excuse to indulge in my ugg fetish, and she asked me ""what's the point of that game?"" ""nothing,"" i replied. ""it's just a silly game."" we left the train and i asked her how tall she was. 165 cm (5'5), she replied, after coaxing it out of her (she first said ""i don't know how to convert it"") but i'm 5'8-5'9 and she seemed kinda tall to me, so i told her the uggs gave her a few extra inches. again, fetish. luckily i didn't make it clear!

once we hit the bus loop i was butchering mandarin to her delight, rattling off phrases i learned (like 您贵姓 ni gue xie-what is your surname) she was giving me major ioi's (i think) from the time i told her i knew something about china-she asked me what was the hardest part of learning mandarin, how i learned it (""characters or pinyin?""), etc. i gave her some anecdotes from my instructor, like formal nin vs informal ni (""you""), if you're pissed at your mom you call her ""ni"", etc. we talked a little about learning english in china (in china, unlike in canada, you learn english in specialized schools for the purpose, and they can cost 8000 yuan while most people don't make more than 25000 yuan a year). i asked her if she did karaoke (she called it ktv), and she said she couldn't find a ktv bar in vancouver (she found lots in richmond though). ""we should go to one of those someday,"" i said. BINGO! vague plans from magic bullets. now i could get her contact info.

on the bus, i gave her a button from a volunteer gig i did in the summer. it had a red heart and the words variety club at the bottom ([variety, a charity for children with special needs ](http://www.variety.bc.ca/)). i told her it was a gift to welcome her to canada. she was intrigued and asked me what the volunteering was like, and what variety was. she likes what i do?

we traded facebook names, and i said my goodbye. i asked for a hug and she was like ""no, i'm sorry"".


WHAAAAAAAAAT?!?! 


oh my gosh, i was heartbroken. but i kept my resolve and didn't show my afc like griping. i said something even headed (something like ""i'll remember what you did to me"" but not in a serious tone) and ejected for the walk home. in fact, this wasn't the first time i was denied kino. when we were sitting together on the bus, i tried to take her hand but she pulled it away-maybe that's why i was denied a hug. i'm not great at kino.

when i got home, there was a rerun of 30 rock on. instead of brooding in the negative, i decided to watch, and soon it was all forgotten. during my walk home i really had to drill the point home to myself that it was no big dead. just because i was denied a hug from this one girl, out of the thousands i will meet in my lifetime, it means nothing. i made huge leaps and have to be mindful of that. this is the biggest success since i started pickup.

goddamn, i want to go to a bar or something and pick up women now.

And the army is not all bad. I am excited for him, and I really hope they accept him because I think it would be a really good fit for him. I think it will open a lot of doors, challenge him in the ways that he wants to be challenged, and help him grow as a person. Plus, we live in Canada and officers are paid quite nicely, so it also means enough financial security for us in order for me to go to grad school without too much strain.

Once again, Palestine was only British for a few decades.  What I'm pushing at and what you seem very eager to avoid is that between 1516 and the end of World War One, Palestine was just one of many parts of the Ottoman Empire.  Palestine was about as independent from Jordan as New Jersey is from New York.  Different accent, some cultural quirks and some demographic differences, but they have a lot more similarities than differences.

It isn't irrelevant.  The Arab League denies Palestinians citizenship in any of its member nations (basically the whole Middle East) ""to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland.""  If Palestine is a legitimate nation, that's at least somewhat valid.  Cruel and inhumane, but there's some logic to it.  If Palestine isn't a legitimate nation, and instead a part of a much larger contiguous region, that policy is completely baseless and the situation changes considerably.  Most of their homeland is still controlled by Muslim Arabs, and the Palestinians are being blocked from settling there.

Regardless of whether or not Palestine is a nation, the Arab League's decision to ban Palestinians from being granted citizenship is the single greatest crime against humanity in the entire conflict.  Nothing else either side has done even comes close.  The fact that they receive nearly no criticism for using millions of human beings as political pawns disgusts me and should disgust you too.","1317430778"

Here's a little quip from a thread on Silverfish on the topic;
""Soft [roadside]/harder [boardside]:
This provides a very stable center, while still allowing a good depth of turn. As you lean, the amount of turn you get increases expontentially (a bit) so for more lean you get MORE turn. This is due to the top bushing compressing more, which almost acts like a higher angle truck. Gives a fun lively ride, this one is my favourite for everything."" 

Since you said your cousin is planning on doing most of his riding at speed I would recommend running barrels all around.

Then I scout him and see if he's going gateways/stargate or robo. If he goes gateways/stargate I go roach and hydra and when/if I survive their 2 base timing which nearly every single toss on my level do, then I transition into usually broods, cause they are insane if you can protect them. If it's a 3 base timing, then you should be able to tech before the toss attacks, just remember not to max out on hydra/roach! 
On the other hand if I scout a robo I ALWAYS throw down a spire and as soon as they throw down the robo bay I start slowly making corruptors. If you spread your creep and make a nice wall of spines, then you can hold your own against gateway/collossus army with a roach/corruptor army fairly easily, at least at my level. It all depends on scouting and your ability to discern when the timing of the attack from the toss is coming and if you can recognice when to stop making drones.","1317430801"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","""Idea seems rather stupid"" pretty much covers anything related to fashion. 

If we wanted to wear functional clothing men and women would just wear durable workman style clothes appropriate for the season. 

I'll take an example from male fashion: the pocket square. I love pocket squares. I have tons of them. They're, from a practical-fashion-standpoint completely superfluous. The origin of the pocket square is from centuries past when a man would carry a perfumed handkerchief in the breast pocket of his coat so he could cover his nose/mouth with it when he passed through the foul smelling areas of a city which, until the last century, was pretty much everywhere in a major city like London or Paris. 

So clearly it's silly for me to wear a pocket square... but a suit looks naked without one. Every suit I put on gets an appropriate pocket square. Form over function for fashion's sake, I suppose. =)","1317430812"

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","&gt;Do you believe that the uncertainty over the cost of action[1]...
 
This is the kind of language you get when you try to compress issues which would take a whole volume to express with any clarity, into a single sentence. One of the hazards of trying to create a quick poll of this sort. 

Looks like this could be referring implicitly to the definition of 'risk' as being the degree of harm that an event will bring (however that may be enumerated), multiplied by the probability of its ocurrence. So, for example it would be completely devastating if aliens turned Earth into a burnt cinder, but the likelyhood of this happening is zero. On the other hand I would certainly invest in a warm raincoat for the coming winter.

I would see three major grounds for uncertainty over the cost of action. Firstly, it has not been established that there is a prospect of very much harm. Secondly, it has not been established that this potential harm is likely to come about. Thirdly, it has not been established that the (very expensive, and opressive to liberty) means to prevent that harm are in any way effective.

With this in mind I am inclined to vote for the second option, that it is better to allocate precious resources to dealing with events if (big if) and when they occur, on the grounds (1)that those resources remain in productive use until they may be required (2) if it becomes apparent that some action is necessary, then it will be much clearer what needs to be done, and the resources can be focussed on precisely that, and (3) the inevitable rent-seekers won't have time to establish their fiefdoms, so they will be compromised in their efforts to divert resources for their own benefit, and in their ability to string out the crisis in order to maintain their position of privelige.

I think that Kokey is looking for some kind of snapshot that he can use to make further inquiry (unlike Thingsbreak who was just looking for ammunition). Also, I am inclined to trust Kokey's motives and intellectual integrity. For these reasons I will answer the questionnaire, even when I am not comfortable with the qrestions.

I was in the 3rd ID, we had about the highest redeploy rate of any unit in the Army. 

I wasn't there for the invasion of Iraq but the unit was I got to the unit not to long before it deployed for OIF 3 (about one year after they had left Iraq) we weren't even back in the states and we were told that we were going to deploy again for OIF V. Originally we were going to deploy before x-mass but we got to stay home for the holidays but our year tour was extended for 3 months so we didn't get back till March of 2008 I left after this point but the unit again deployed to Iraq in December of 2009 and were again in Iraq for another year. 

But when you total that out between 2003 and 2010 the unit deployed 4 times and spent a total of about 49 months in Iraq. 

TLDR unless he was in a unit that deployed for only 6 month tours he would of had to reenlist at some point to be deployed 4 times. ","1317430833"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Maybe I'm not that versed in good FPS's, but I don't see the points you made, especially the spawning. After playing CS I can say that those aren't as good, but I wouldn't say they're bad. Just different.

The sounds needs to be made different since it's a different game. I don't feel like you're going to need the full depth of sound out of BLOPS as opposed to CS. For instance, sound makes a lot of difference sometimes in CS, especially footsteps. With BLOPS I'm not going to need that because it's hectic and crazy and a huge, 5-minute firefight.

I don't quite know what you mean about animations. Like, they look stiff? It's not lifelike?

Feedback I think is nice, but I haven't played BLOPS in awhile. It's obviously different from a PC game in general since I lack a rumble feature, which I think adds a bit of difficulty in controlling, but PC games have on-screen recoil and such to counteract that. Unless I missed what this point was about.

Spawning I think is pretty brilliant. Never have I ever been spawn-camped in BLOPS, but then again I don't play many games outside of Team Deathmatch. Maybe that's a failing on my part. I guess Nuketown would be one where that happens a bit, but I'd chalk that up to an incredibly small map.

The Maps... nah, I can see that. Nuketown is pretty shit in my opinion, especially on a Team Deathmatch as it's just utter and complete madness trying to do anything. Sure, the guy in the video fended himself pretty well, but if you have anyone against you with any idea of the map layout and is aware, you might get frustrated with how low your KDR is.

Customization is fun to me, and I wish they had more. I don't know what more you could add to guns seeing as I don't even know what else you'd add onto them in real life, but I feel like 6-ish of the same options for all your primaries is kinda lame. Even if they did a Borderlands thing, where you had some type of mod to grenades that made your everyday grenades do something different at no extra ammo cost, it could spice up the game enough for me.

As for the gameplay, I feel that it's just the people I'm playing against. I'm playing in a pub against scrubs and that's just how it is, I can't really do much to change the community. I'm just one teen. And even though it's not CS levels of teamwork and communicating (honestly, I don't want to communicate with those guys), I don't think that it's bad or hollow. Just different.

That's just my more in-depth 2 cents, though.

Also, thanks for the Armored Core recommendation, I love me some customization.","1317430845"

My checks are direct deposited and any personal checks I get I just deposit with my phone. The phone has a $10k daily deposit limit, which I never imagined would be an issue. The one time it was (insurance payment from a car crash) I was able to deposit it at the UPS store on Merrimon without issue. 

I'm not sure if that would qualify or not, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to ask them. On a side note, I've also been unable to find cheaper car insurance than with them.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Your grandfather is just a couple of days older than my father.  My grandfather emigrated to Canada from the small Ukrainian town of Khoshch, near Zhitomir, in about 1920, when it was part of Poland.  He was able to bring his sister out in the early '30s, but all the rest of his family stayed and were wiped out in 1942 or so.  I think by that point they had stopped putting Jews in ghettos and were just marching them into the woods and shooting them.  There was one survivor, a teenage boy who was out collecting firewood that morning and hid in the woods, watching everything unfold.  He was able to escape to Russia, migrate across Asia, and eventually ended up in Australia, where he wrote in Yiddish to the surviving relatives of ever family he knew of.  It was a small town, just a few hundred people, but he must have had a memory like a phone book.

My grandmother saw the letter and hid it for 4 weeks before she showed to my grandfather.  He took it to the bedroom and stayed there all day.  He never spoke of it.

So as horrible as your grandfather's experience was, it seems that he at least had a small chance at survival.  Does he know why the Jews in his area were treated differently than in Poland-occupied Ukraine?  Or was it just that it was harder to summarily execute a larger community?","1317430852"

Surely thats irrelevant if you have effective rate data?

&gt; add to that state tax (as much as 10%)

Or 0.

&gt; city tax (if you live in NYC, the top marginal rate is nearly 4%)

0 for the majority of people.

&gt; social security tax on the first 106K or so, medicare 

Numbers above include FICA &amp; SECA individual contributions. Without these the bottom 70% move down, bottom 50% end up at -1.1%.

Below AGI's of $10m the peak AGI portion of capgains is 8% and peaks at 55% in the top 400 so a good few people :)

&gt; In reality, if you're a high earner, and you don't primarily get your income from capital gains, you probably pay a lot more than 40% of your income in taxes.

This simply isn't supported by the data. I agree taxes across the board are too high but once credits and refunds are worked in people simply don't pay as much as they think they do. People at the high end also pay more then most people think.","1317430855"

In gaming, for example, I've taken a stand. I'm not sure if you're a gamer, but games recently have been releasing something called ""DLC"", or, digitally licensed content. The idea is that you pay for something after a game has been released to extend the lifetime of the game. In my experience though, this material is usually overpriced, and in the case of online games cripples your play experience by shoving you into some figurative back room, where you can only play with other backwards retards that didn't fork out the money for the content. In single player, what you have is what you've got, save for the fact that companies have been holding back material, that was already developed, at release time, to sell it to you a few months down the road for an extra $10 or $15.

I've never bought DLC, for any game, ever, and never will. I have to sit here though, and watch the state of gaming spiral down into the shitter, as everything is monetized to an increasingly alarming degree.

Yes, it is a possibility that there can be a corruption free political class with a low salary, it just has yet to exist. flamearrows said higher salaries can 'decrease' the temptation, not remove all corruption.

There are five remaining portraits from the series, including Insane Woman. The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in Géricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health. *His observations of the human subject were not confined to the living, for some remarkable still-lifes—painted studies of severed heads and limbs—have also been ascribed to the artist.*""","1317430917"

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","Here's how I see it:

note: There's no drive shaft on this thing!!!

  1. Convert gas into pressure

  2. Convert pressure into piston movement

  3. Convert that movement into current.

  4. Convert that current into movement...err.

  5. Apply that movement to the wheels.


Doesn't step 3 and 4 seem sorta silly? In a standard engine, they aren't there! The total efficiency is the efficiency of each step multiplied together, so the less steps the better! This is why you won't see any intelligent car company using a gas engine to charge batteries...it's more efficient to put the power to the wheels.


You will find this movement -&gt; current -&gt; movement method used in trains, however, because the insane torque requirements would cause a direct drive engine to have either an insane transmission (to gear it low enough), or insane prolonged pressures and torque (like a steam engine)...and fluid coupling is crap.


If you look at the direction of the forces that will be on these bearings, they'll have to be in a pretty wide (angularly) socket. Unlike most bearings you'll find in an engine (that have zero contact velocity), these will be constantly spinning in their sockets, rubbing against the housing and smooshing the sticky oil around. I can't imagine they'll be all that efficient...but they admit it's something they're working on.


Anybody know why they didn't use cylindrical drive bearings?

Lumbar spine manipulation:
If having 4 of the 5 variables, a lumbar manipulation is HIGHLY likely to result in decreased pain and at least 50% improvement in function.

""We always hate to feel sorry for Bank of America, but they
are a good example of being vilified at every turn. Last week they
were inept because they couldn’t make enough money to satisfy
their equity holders. Yesterday, they instituted a $5 monthly fee
for debit card usage for non-premium accounts and it turns into
the first headline on CNN. Fees are something bankers and the
public need to come to terms with, as instant access to cash is a
major service that largely goes unheralded. It wasn’t too long ago
that the public had to go into a branch every week to cash their
paycheck and take out a wad of money to carry around. Now we
have the huge infrastructure of ATMs and point of sale terminals
that need to be paid for and regulatory constraints on how to do
just that. Despite the press, bankers need to continue to review
fees, in an effort to pay for infrastructure, since net interest
margins will remain compressed.""","1317430947"

I'm not talking about ""it offends me"" moments. That's what I mean by ""off the cuff"". It's not random It's not like I'm just saying ""Oh, I don't like that"" as if it's random or arbitrary.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;Why are RF frequencies used to generate artificial plasmas? Why is is that RF frequencies are particularly good at doing so?

RF frequencies are used for nonthermal plasmas when they are configured as capacitively coupled (CCP) and inductively coupled (ICP) plasmas. The basic idea is that electrons will respond to the changes in the electric field and be able to reach high energies (~3-10 eV, 10,000s K) however the ions and gas will stay near room temperature because their mass is too large to respond to the electric field. [Basic idea, the x-axis can be treated as mass instead of frequency]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harmonic_oscillator_gain.svg) The reason RF is so suitable is: 1) there is a limited range of frequencies where this behavior is possible 2) RF power supplies were cheap and available. Interesting tidbit: RF (13.56 MHz) is dominate in US and Europe while VHF (70 MHz) is dominate in Japan and Australia do to the differing availability of cheap power supplies when these systems where first developed.

Since this might be a little confusing in the context of sputtering. I should elaborate on why sputtering works even though ions and the gas are low (near room) temperature while in the plasma you would not expect them to sputter your target. This is due to the plasma sheath, which is basically a region near any surface (in this case your target) that due to the nature of the plasma a large electric field will exist. This means that ions that get near this sheath become accelerated to high energies (very high velocities) into the surface and can basically knock-off (sputter) atoms on the surface.  

&gt;How does 'self-ionizing plasma' sustain itself? My understanding is that a plasma is struck, the power supply/gas supply is turned off, and the plasma continues to exist. What prevents the plasma from extinguishing itself?

Your understanding is incorrect. Likely both the power supply and gas supply remain on. A self-ionizing plasma just describes the ionization mechanism.

&gt;On all the plasma chambers I see a 'ctune' and 'cload'. I figure the c stands for capacitor, but what do these values actually indicate?

The impedance of the power supply must be match with the impedance of the chamber and plasma. In commercial applications this is generally done automatically, however the principle remains the same as a [Ham radio.](http://tymkrs.tumblr.com/post/5219965187/25-standing-wave-ratios-ham-lesson-o-de-day)

The basic idea is that a plasma and chamber have some impedance, in order to couple power to the plasma the power supplies impedance must be matched. In order to do this adjustable capacitors and inductors are used. Key words for google: RF matching network. There are basically two types used in RF plasmas T-type and Pi matching networks, depending on the frequency and mode of coupling (CCP vs ICP). These deal with the configuration of the adjustable capacitors and inductive.

&gt;We also have other chambers that dope the wafers with boron by generating a plasma with boron triflouride or diborane. How, if at all, is generating a plasma for a compound different than generating one for a diatomic or noble gas?

The doping chamber likely uses Ar as its main gas and dopant precursors as a small amount. For different types of gases the plasma can change significantly. ","1317430991"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I would make the distinction between historical anti-semitism and now. The Palestinians are Semites too you know, so the term would be specifically used in this context with the Jewish people. 

Most Europeans, (as far as I know - as I am one, live here, and so do my friends) don't give a hoot about Jewish people in that they wish them well at best and at worst it doesn't figure in their day to day life. The fringe elements (white nationalists, etc.) do make a lot of noise because it's quite un-PC / outright scandalous to make racist comments, obviously, so I think this kind of shitty opinion about Jewish people in general is disproportionate to the amount of publicity it gets. Empty vessels make the most noise and all. Joe Soap on the streets just wants people to get along without conflict. 

As for our governments and politics, their actions and comments revolving around Israel in Europe - there are a multitude of different things at play here. Who is friends with who, what you can do to help realistically etc. But the overall message is that international laws are broken, and a peaceful resolution needs to be found ASAP with compromises made on both sides, ala Northern Ireland. This leads to a lot of frustration here if you have followed peace talks over the years in Israel / Palestine that a peace can't be brokered. Now the common opinion of Europeans following the politics of Israel / Palestine is that the Israelis have a bigger burden to do things right as they are the big modern power and a democracy which should adhere to certain civilised principles in dealing with the Palestine question, not a ""he hit me so i'll hit him back"" mentality. It's easy to say that as an outsider who isn't living in the reality of the situation. But as one who has lived through very similar circumstances, it's enough to say its time for reconciliation, to get past old wounds for a better future for everyone involved. I'm not going to get into who is right or wrong on individual matters but from a PR perspective, or diplomatically, the feeling is that Israel is doing itself no favours. Whichever side of the equation is looked at everyone in the region is there to stay and obtuse ideology is not going to resolve anything 

Where there is a conflict is the actions of the Israeli government, specifically. The beef is not with Jewish people, this can't be stated enough. Most people here know that although Israel is the proclaimed Jewish state, that the actions of their government is not the collective will of the Jewish or Israeli people, its more complicated than that. Such is life.

So the hatred that you feel on here, is actually more of a frustration with the stalemate in talks for a peaceful resolution more than anything. The point I made about empty vessels, you are seeing that in microcosm here. Joe Soap European won't defend Israel in these forums (as it sees it as up to the Israeli government to find a resolution and they feel like they are not helping themselves) as much as it wont attack them either, anyone who is saying anything different has an axe to grind, and I mean this with all due respect, same goes for the Israeli people posting on here. Of course they are going to go on the defensive if they see someone criticising them, but its not a critique of them as a people or as Jewish people, or even as individuals but as a state that can't work things out.

I hope I didn't step on anyone's toes here, and I don't want to get into a prolonged debate about points I made. (Although i'm open to correction) I know this is a very complicated issue, but i'm just trying to get the average European's point across, be it grossly misinformed or otherwise.

Peace and love.

To reduce unemployment, my 2 cents:

Technology has replaced several people from the workforce. That is the nature of any technology - to create efficiency, and we should embrace it entirely. But shouldn't we also enjoy the fruits of technology ? If technology has made so much improvement to our lives - crunching numbers, doing laundry, then why are we still working the same number, if not more, number of hours than ever before. It has changed the number of work hours each day. I propose that we go down to 4 day work week. In the short run, it will reduce unemployment and little bit of everyone's income. In the long run, it will probably boost creativity, help people live healthier lives, and create stronger families.","1317431006"

 XRotNRollX, I didn't pull anything with you. In my 35 years of professional performance experience, coupled with the 1200 composition I have completed and had performed as well as recorded. I do know a thing or two about how to write to facilitate a sight-read performance. This kind of pedantic minutia is a drag for working cats. There are many ways to write anything. IMO this composer should have merely indicated the shift to Gb by writing the conventional 6 flats. 

The creator of this piece is also a giant asshole for writing ""Play without bitching about the key"" which pushed my buttons and incurred my ire. Every professional I work with never bitches about any key. They have mastered their instrument, as have I. 

I caught myself going into asshole mode so I excused myself to calm down. Redditorfor16 days seemed to be saying ""well man, Gb major IS really hard on MY instrument""  and seemed to be missing the entire point, so I told him what Freddie Hubbard said to me.  He was the one I was addressing. I will refrain from any retaliatory insults toward anyone as these do not facilitate a discussion. I'm very passionate about music, and I can be emotionally volatile at times. My intention was only to offer insight into what a working cat wants to see on the bandstand. I will defer to your graduate music theory studies and sheet music store experience about the commonality of indicating a C natural in the key change followed by a C-flat, but In my years of touring have never  seen this kind of thing on anyone's bandstand. If I did, I would question it at the very least.","1317431016"

I get a better feel for the road the lower I am.  The first two cars I ever drove were a Oldsmobile Cutlass Sierra S (painted grandma blue) and a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Now I looked cooler driving my fathers Jeep, but I felt more confident about my driving ability in my great grandmothers Oldsmobile.

But I know someday I plan on getting married and having kids.  I'll probably be a van dad or go with a RAV-4 myself.  I've driven my grandparents van and my sisters Toyota.

I've been pretty lenient because her past 3 boyfriends had cheated on her, so being jealous and insecure is understandable. I'm working on helping her get over this.

She has trouble trusting people in general because one of her old boyfriends cheated with her best friend at the time. So she's had trouble opening up to people ever since.

So, given this, I'm trying to give her time and help her get over things, but it's been a long time (she was single for 3 years before she met me) and the truth about not trusting her friends only came out a few weeks ago. I really did expect them to make up by now.

I also think the ""emotional cheating"" thing is something that is beyond explainable by her history. I don't think I'm a ""polygamist"" who needs to be loved by many people. I think it's normal to have a few close friends.","1317431027"

&gt; the lower speed, citizens maintained mesh is not designed to handle the throughput of routing the internet's commercial traffic.

So I went to my other banks and (being a fair guy) asked them to match the deal so they could keep my custom. None of them budged. So now I am entirely with NAB. I have moved my credit cards and loans over to NAB (and they enjoy my interest payments) and they charge me nothing for my 200 odd electronic transactions a month (but what does that cost them REALLY?). When I get a mortgage I will surely get it with them and they will make a decade of interest out of me and they win.
I think all banks should go this way.

The oddity is even more pronounced because we can assume limb regeneration would never be overlooked by the patient.

I guess I shouldn't blame society (I wasn't exactly doing so on this post but I did afterwards) as much as the people (or person in this case) who are suppose to be responsible for helping to educate those people. All I really know of Dawkins is that NDT called him out for doing something that sounds like it could be related to what you are talking about.

In light of your explanation, I'd like to rephrase things a little. Maybe they should not have released the information in the way they did because they should have known it would be misconstrued by the media(as everything is nowadays) and by the public(who have been under educated).

 However my point still remains that people haven't looked into this at all and are running around saying physics is broken and that Einstein was a retard, when there is no base for those assumptions other than that some people think its funny(this is what I should have meant I guess by. I personally don't find it funny or offensive it's just not right as far as I'm concerned.

Although the results in the paper are fact. CERN having toppled general relativity is not. Correct? I'm genuinely asking because that doesn't seem to be the case, but I could be wrong, I'm no physicist. Also, some of those results could have been (though it seems they have checked to there best ability) erroneous right?

You can't change his behaviour because that is not in your power, what you can do, is change yours. Now everything you have done up to this point has allowed him to continue doing what he has been doing. Now I don't know what behaviour of yours will result in him changing his ways, but it certainly isn't the ones you have been doing. In fact, everything you have been doing, stop. No nagging, no telling him to do something ever, and no talking about it. Don't cover for him when he hasn't done his share, leave it. Let the place get filthy if you have to, and be pleasant about it. If he hasn't booked the holiday tickets or hotels, then you're not going on a holiday, or you're sleeping in a car once you get there. My guess is that you have been stepping in where he has been falling slack. Don't get shitty or nasty that he hasn't done things. We are expecting him not to do those things for a good while.

Personally I would abolish the whole state apparatus all-together but you can at least pit two power hungry groups of politicians  and bureaucrats against each other you can work out for yourself where you'd rather live. Let's take a hypothetical situation, say the Federal government banned the use of a certain plant, what are the chances that *you* could get that law changed?

Now imagine that your town passed the same law, chances you know and have seen your local leaders around town you can speak to them directly and talk to others in your town, to convince them that the law is bad and should be repealed.

Running to cover not farther then 3 seconds away is **very** smart, I like to always bring up my scope/sights when I reach the cover always aiming at the direction of the opposing team.

Also tip for MG's ... **use your c4**!!! I constantly get double+ kills either rigging the C4 to mcoms or around tight corners I know guys bunch around (The 3rd area on metro in particular, and always the first 2 mcom stations as someone always rush's to arm, you will most likely always defend the fast attack this way). As far as I know C4 doesn't really have a range on detonation, so you can trap both stations and set up a nest in the gazebo, or the rocks in front of it.

Actually, if he consistently delivers slapping as a disciplinary punishment, then there's no indication that it doesn't fall under authoritative parenting, per the link.

Edit -- From the link that exactlycake says is the better parenting style:

Characteristics of the Authoritative Parenting Style

Authoritative parents:

    Listen to their children

    Encourage independence

    Place limits, consequences and expectations on their children's behavior

    Express warmth and nurturance

    Allow children to express opinions

    Encourage children to discuss options

    Administer fair and consistent discipline

When children break the rules, they are disciplined in a fair and consistent manner.

""As of May 15, 2009, GMAC's banking unit officially changed its name to Ally Bank.

On May 21, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced it would invest an additional $7.5 billion in GMAC LLC, which gave the U.S. government a majority stake in the company.

On December 30, 2009, the U.S. Treasury department said that they would invest another $3.8 billion in GMAC because the company had been unable to raise additional funds in the private sector. This raised the total government investment in GMAC to $16.3 billion.

On May 10, 2010, GMAC Inc. announced that it re-branded itself as Ally Financial Inc.""","1317431101"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Markets simply cannot account for externalities when a public good is involved.  Yes, if air were readily privatizable we could potentially trust the market to price pollution appropriately, but there's no realistic way to do this.  So we can only get to an efficient level of pollution through taxation.

Further, the point of taxing pollution isn't to raise revenue, but to reduce the amount of pollution being emitted.

This summarizes your argument. You do *not* understand the physics, so how can *you* claim which evidence is relevant?

But in reality that does not really work that well.

Think about how USA history may have been different if Roosevelt had to step down after his first two terms?

Its a protection against ""dictator for life"", but on the other hand, for the last 20-30 years, all presidents basically did the equivalent of: ""under my presidency, USA will live healthy, we'll go on a financial diet, and will eat and exercise.. My plan is we eat icecream and cake until +8 years, at which point my plan calls for switching to beans and broccoli plus rigorous exercise regimen""

Congress goes ""woot great plan, short term we'll enjoy tons of icecream, but the great thing about it, we'll still be fit and healthy, because of the brocolli part down the road"".. and passes ""America responsible eating and  exercise"" law.

Of course the brocolli part never happens, and next president repeats the process.

IMHO without term limits, president running for his 3rd term would have a hard time kicking the can down the road...

"FixedGearBicycle","t5_2qo7a","Firstly I can totally relate to your situation.  I've had 7 surgeries, on my knees, stopped basketball, track, rowing and swimming (used to be a squad swimmer and the knees cant handle that either) all by the age of 19, im 6'3"" too and started road cycling with little success because I was a little ignorant about the mechanics of cycling and how it effects the knees.

I can only give you advise from personal experience, but either way its important to run with a lower gear ratio (your what 18 yrs old?) because if your still growing etc your muscles and tendons are still getting their act together especially if you have grown a lot lately, the patella tendon (the one that joins your knee cap to your low leg) is particularly likely to either get tendonitis OR [Osgood–Schlatter disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood%E2%80%93Schlatter_disease) both of which can be exacerbated by the heavy strain a single speed bike puts through your knees when getting up to speed, or by having a high ratio which means slower pedalling which puts more strain through your leg for every stroke.  The Osgood Schlatters disease is associated particularly with people who do a lot of sport and have had growth spurts, mine were so bad I had surgery on them.

Next concentrate what your knees are doing during the pedal stroke, your legs need to work like pistons.  Its very important that as you bring your leg up and push down that there is no sideways movement or wobble (by having a high seat as I suggest in the next paragraph this is also made easier), any lateral movement can cause havoc with where your knee cap tracks (the kneecap sits in a little valley of bone and should slide up and down that smoothly) but if you knees are pointing out then you can be pulling the kneecap onto the inner face of this valley which creates problems with rough spots that make some movements very painful.  This lateral movement can also cause problems inside this joint can pinching on the cartilage.

For big guys like us, is to make sure you are running with your seat quite high, especially if you long legs for your height.  By having the seat high you will then have a shallower pedal stroke (i dont know the correct term is here) and you are putting less pressure through your knee again less pressure though all your tendons and the kneecap.  Also make sure you are using the flick in your ankle (look up the correct pedal stroke because there is whole blogs devoted to this) by using your ankle more you use less motion in your knee, again a positive thing.  At the same time make sure you dont have your seat so high that you slide round on the saddle or require any movement in your hips to complete your pedal stroke, this would be a whole new kettle of fish and another major problem.

Make sure your saddle is on the correct angle, now thats still pretty subjective but I found as I got taller that a slight tilt, higher at the back lower at the front left my lower back better aligned and quite often with repetition injuries its not just where it hurts but a whole load of factors coming together at the weakest link.

Other people have mentioned a short stem as well, sometimes the upright position helps, to be honest this wasn't an issue for me.


For me it was important to rock out with all of these things together, the lower ratio and higher cadence, the refined pedal stroke, the high saddle, anything else leaves me struggling to walk (i wont borrow peoples bikes unless I am allowed to set it just right). getting into fixies with the front brake turned out to be a blessing for me because by using my legs to slow down in traffic (not skidding) has actually equalised my muscle balance which has allowed me to play a couple of games of basketball here and there for the first time in years (gave it away at 16, I'm 23 now).  You should see your doctor or if you have a physiotherapist so they can see if you have tendonitis which will require treatment before you feel any better.

hope that helps, sorry for the essay but I've been through the mill with knees.

If I am writing on something I need to research (as when writing an essay), I'll do it, but I will write my notes on paper and organize on there as well.  I also do my point form portion and layout before I even open word.  When I go to write what I need to, though, I find that I can type faster than I can write and, thus, my thoughts can come out quicker and with more... legibility.  But by this time I have already utilized the paper to organize my thoughts.

The first thing that seemed fairly low risk (I'm mildly introverted)  was to take a look at an online dating site.  I was ultra picky, looked for someone that was all the things I'd always wanted in my ex.  Lucky for me, I found one (OKCupid's matching thingy seems to be pretty good for this).  We met up, the chemistry was almost instant and we had the most incredible sex of my life.  It's like black and white comparing the two, my new GF has quite an active libido, probably more than me, it's fucking awesome.

I've learned more about dirty talk, sexting, having sex in risque places and being jumped on unexpectedly in the last few months than I did in a decade with my ex.  I love it.  Being the object of someones desire is a huge confidence booster.  I can only recall two times in my entire marriage when my ex-wife initiated, and they were both in the very early years.

my face is a small piece of a gigantic mural installation hanging in a building at Babson College. (I was the personal assistant of the artist who created it and helped with the installation). Last I heard of him he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine in 2005(4?). 

I once facilitated the acquisition of fine cannabis smoked shortly thereafter by Lenny Kravitz, who then inquired about the procurement of multiple pounds of the same (alas this was just not convenient) .

I've gotten drunk with and hugged chemist Alexander (Sasha) Shulgin.

My father was a founding member of the Center For the Advancement of Applied Ethics at Carnegie Melon. When he committed suicide in 2006 the campus newspaper reported his death as disease-related. 

My piano teacher during highschool in rural Vermont is the head of ear training at Juliard,  and commutes by plane twice a week to and from NY. That lady is a badass.

Edit:

Also, in regards to this:

&gt;It's one thing if you as a people are inventing new words to express newly arisen concepts, but this is different from having foreigners come in and inventing words for you based on concepts that you aren't aware of.

You’ve basically described what linguists refer to as ‘borrowing’ which is probably the most common way that languages augment their lexicons.  It occurs all the time, naturally, and doesn’t ‘change’ the grammar of a language.

Either scenario means sitting out the rest of your existence in the dyson sphere where location shouldn't matter in the same way as its just one big computing substrate.
