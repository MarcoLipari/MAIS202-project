I'm not going to my 5th Okee because they usually have a lineup like a mini Roo and a setting a bit like electric forest and a beach had a baby...

It's the degenerate hijinks at the Frick Frack Black Jack table.

The constant wave of smiling people enjoying the sunshine.

It's that feeling when you finally find a person selling pre-rolls after you've looked for two days because weed is the hardest thing to come by...

Singing ""Okee Okee Okee Okeeeee Chobeee, Chobeeeee"" with Griz every year

The family we grow every time we go back

Sneaky easiest medium size festival to navigate and get around due to the roads and generally flat ground of FL

Being able to walk from a major headliner to an up and coming soon to be superstar to the perfect banger EDM set in just a couple minutes all super close.

Bad-ass hawks flying around all morning trying to dive between cars because they usually hunt in that field

Could easily keep going. Always meet the best people at Okee. It's a special place. Just let it be what it is and it's beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Single day tickets**

&amp;#x200B;

1. We want more people in the crowd. Crowds are fun. It's part of why some of us go.  Get fuckin hype.
2. If they undersold camping, that's chill as fuck.. Now camping will be more of a homie fest we all might get closer because of it.
3. Let's see what happens and have a good time yall

"notjustbikes","t5_287xxc","It‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and ‚Äúnegative‚Äù freedom, and a fundamental disagreement about the nature of freedom between traditionally conservative and progressive ideologies. 

Conservatives tend to focus on ‚Äúnegative‚Äù freedoms. That is the absence of external constraints on your freedom to make decisions. Think The Bill of Rights. ‚ÄúThe Government cannot tell me that I cannot have a car!‚Äù

Progressives tend to focus more on ‚Äúpositive‚Äù freedoms, which is exposure to the maximum opportunities from which to choose from. ‚ÄúThe government provides me with the infrastructure so I don‚Äôt have to have a car‚Äù

So, we are left with two options:

1. If we assume arguments in good faith, the people against 15-minute cities see the idea and without extra context immediately think it means that the government will restrict their movements to within 15-minute travel time from their homes. That is the context they are normally thinking about. 

2. If we assume bad-faith, then right-wing agitators/businesses/grifters/etc (bad actors) are using this bias towards negative freedom framing to stir up controversy where there isn‚Äôt any to further their nefarious ends, taking advantage of the people described in #1",1675209600

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","OK, so you have until March 20 to prepare.

The thing to keep in mind here is that Google is just the facilitator. The individual project is the one that you need to impress. You're not applying to GSOC and then they match you up. You're applying to do something specific to a specific open-source project. If the project thinks it's a good idea then they give it a thumbs up and then Google gives you the money.

So what you need to do is find an open-source project that you like, that you WANT to contribute to.

C++ is an option but keep in mind that C++ is a super difficult language, most open-source C++ projects are going to be massively large and complex. For example I used to work on Chromium. Just in order to compile it I had 24 cpus, 128 GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. Same with Mozilla. Other projects aren't as massive but you won't be able to handle C++ with a low-end laptop. And GSOC doesn't buy you a new laptop as far as I know.

MERN may be more realistic, if you know your way around MERN you might be able to find a MERN-based project or something that uses pieces of the MERN stack that you could contribute to.

To get ideas:

* Look at past organizations that participated in GSOC
* Think of all of the software libraries / apps you've used personally, in your own personal projects
* Explore GitHub

If you find a project that looks interesting, look for:

* An active development community. Lots of PRs every week, and good communication.
* Lots of issues / bugs, and frequent activity. Lots of bugs doesn't mean a buggy product, it means a lot of users and an active development community.
* Very very good documentation for how to build and contribute to the project. If it doesn't have this, stay away.
* Optional: if they have ""good first bug"" issues

Don't wait to start contributing! Start as soon as you find a possibility. Remember, the goal is to contribute. GSOC just pays you to do what you presumably were going to already do anyway.",1675209600

The transparency push would apply to thousands of companies doing business in the state that make at least $1 billion a year

***



___

By Ari Plachta

Companies that generate a billion dollars or more a year doing business in California would be required to publicly release their carbon emissions data under a bill introduced Monday backed by environmental and sustainable business groups.

Supporters of SB 235 say it would strengthen regulation of greenhouse gas emissions generated by some of the most profitable industries across the economy as the state strives to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The bill is likely to face opposition from business interests.

State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, reintroduced the bill after an earlier version failed to clear the Assembly in August, amid opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce and several Democratic lawmakers who joined Republicans in voting against it.

The new proposal would make California the first state to require companies with annual gross revenues of over $1 billion to make public their greenhouse gas emissions in line with an independent global emissions measurement framework known as the GHG Protocol.

The new disclosure rules would not be limited to California-based corporations, and are estimated to impact some 5,500 companies operating in a state that could soon surpass Germany as the world‚Äôs fourth-largest economy.

Companies would be required to submit emissions disclosures to an online reporting platform and a third-party audit. The California Air Resources Board would then be tasked with incorporating the data into state climate goals.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for the corporate community to come clean about their progress toward meeting our climate goals,‚Äù Wiener said in a statement. ‚ÄúTo tackle the climate crisis, we need new standards to improve transparency and raise the bar for the business community across the nation.‚Äù

U.S. industry emitted 5.9 million metric tons of carbon from consuming fossil fuels in 2020, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Efforts to require corporate disclosures of emissions are underway at the national level, with a proposed ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1675209600

Eu inclusive piorei minha tendinite porque minha cachorra de 7kg √© reativa com a guia e outros c√£es na rua e esse neg√≥cio de puxar o tempo todo cagou meu pulso.

Al√©m disso, o cachorro puxando o tempo inteiro vai se machucar. Seja com coleira ou peitoral, n√£o importa qual for, se ele sempre estiver fazendo press√£o ele vai se machucar e desenvolver uma les√£o.

O ideal √© que os c√£es andem tranquilos, com a guia frouxa, seja do seu lado, atras ou na frente e que voc√™ nunca tenha que puxar ele pra algum lugar, que um comando ‚Äúvamos‚Äù baste e ele j√° volte a andar pra onde voc√™ quer.

"urbancarliving","t5_2vdsp","The one thing you might struggle with is a job with Uber and living in that same car. Driving Uber you would have to have all the seats available and legroom and typically we use that for storing things, even ripping the back seats out for more room. It would be a logistical nightmare for me personally making my home into a workplace I have to keep empty to transport 4 others.

Solution would be obviously another job. Maybe door dash, Uber eats or those food services if you like similar work to what you already do.

There‚Äôs no harm giving the lifestyle a go though. Do the bare minimal in making it livable and go away for a week.

The thing is it‚Äôs not going to solve your problems of playing games and wasting life. Sometimes it can add to it because you‚Äôre alone from others and have very little space to move. When it comes to feeling shit about life it‚Äôs good to pay attention. Your souls basically saying ‚Äúhey this isn‚Äôt working, listen‚Äù and we need to sit in quiet to hear it out and process it. 

I get the games stuff too. Played them for years and wasted a lot of my life. It‚Äôs even harder to quit these days because a lot now have a social factor to them. The only way to successfully move on is find something to move on with. Another activity which you grow with and enjoy. For some it could be making a business, it could be something creative, something maybe where you enjoy giving back is always fulfilling, ect.

Anyways if you wanna do the car thing think about how your day to day life would be. Every step from waking up and brushing your teeth to setting up sleep. If you can see it working and don‚Äôt mind being in solitude then it can definitely be a cool little adventure.",1675209601

I'm renting so I made sure to build something that is relativity easily disassembled. It's far from artisanal but it's a world apart from an ikea table I was using.

I mean it all depends on how high in terms of mortality you want to go and how technical you want to get. Because  technically, the sun can kill you wil a sunstroke alone, forget about any kind of long term damage. 

Even so, skin cancer is one of the most common and deadliest and it is caused by the sun

As I said \*everything\* (to an extent) is ok and the issue arises when you abuse it, that includes sugars. The issue with a lot of stuff in the aisle as you said, is exactly that : Excess (that and ignorance about nutrition, which should be more thoroughly and pedagogically taught at school)

&gt;There is no positive moderation, there's only bad and less bad

Agree, but again, that applies to nearly everything. You cannot really avoid a lot of sutff, and if you really did your best to maximize your chances against something like cancer, you will have likely a misserable life and you can \*still\*, by a long shot, develop it

The reason to avoid that kind of stuff is to avoid  obesity and risk of diabetes",1675209601

How did your lawyers let you sign a lease where they can do that during your lease term without some sort of clause for re-imbursement for costs? Why would you reno the new space without having a lease in place to ensure that the investment of the renos could have a chance to get paid for.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","On immigration and housing, the literature is divided on the impact on prices (and also on the impact on prices versus rents). Some even find that immigration lowers home prices.

But at least based on analysis of Canadian data, the effects of immigration on house prices were positive but [small](https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=15f555fa-ec44-4908-893d-7c31b6c10b5b%40redis). The increase is mostly driven by *past* immigrants (because recent immigrants do not buy homes) and that the impact of a 1% increase in immigration on home prices is about .1%. 

And anyway, that impact is largely going to be dependent on zoning laws. If we have bad zoning laws, population increases will tend to raise house prices. But if good zoning laws that won't be much of an issue. The population of Texas doubled since 1980, while house prices remained low (until the recent bubble). Indeed, in Canada, our population surged in the post-war era, yet prices remained reasonable. Prices are rising now in Canada even as population growth is *slowing*. 

Thank you for the article about the fiscal impact of immigration - it was certainly interesting, though the paper itself notes that other analyses have much higher estimates using a method called generational accounting. The author criticizes the method, because he thinks that austerity measures could be implemented sooner, limiting the fiscal impact of debt (and he claims governments would be forced to act). I'm not sure that idea holds up so well. 

Generational Accounting models have been criticized for making apocalyptic predictions about demography (i.e. populations shrinking a great deal), but so far that seems a quite accurate depiction of aging societies like South Korea and Japan. And certainly, analysis of Canadian [data shows a positive fiscal impact](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2012.00905.x) from immigration (though certainly, immigration alone can't stem fiscal challenges).  

&gt;in a budgetary sense, but does have overwhelmingly negative short term consequences in key areas like housing and healthcare.

Immigrants play an important role in staffing our healthcare system (despite our protracted failure to recognize credentials). Immigrants make up 28% of [employees](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/75-006-x/2021001/article/00004-eng.pdf?st=KE_D2qbN) in nursing and healthcare support professions. Immigrants are also younger than the native population, and [healthier](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/82-003-x/2011004/article/11588-eng.pdf?st=ItqgpbND), so it's hard to imagine how they represent a negative consequence for the healthcare system. 

I would simply add that immigration seems like a great way to address shortages in the construction industry, and in other skilled trades.",1675209602

""probably dropped to zero"" ummmm they just showed that the bivalent were only very slightly less effective for infection for xbb, then it was for ba.5. so clearly, it didn't dropped to zero suddenly. i wonder whoever wrote this piece, would have thought when the vaccines first came out, ""why are they releasing outdated vaccines, clearly their protection is zero against infection for alpha"" my point is, protection against infections won't drop to zero all the sudden",1675209602

"photoclass2023","t5_4tatnh","Hello,

I'm in the latecomers group as well as I just learned about the course yesterday but needed time for my photo of a tree.

As Dadthumbs I started to learn some years ago with a Canon camera at my work with a 18-55 mm lens.

Thanks a lot for what you do Aeri73, that's really the kind of Internet I love. I'm French and so you won't be the only one using weird expressions ;-) I live in Atlanta till June, hope it will help!

Just bought a Nikon D7500 with 3 lenses and a tripod 1 week ago

My favorite photo is a photo I took with my phone. As I want to step up with my new camera, this is one I took 3 days ago[https://imgur.com/RKBMQFb](https://imgur.com/RKBMQFb)

Here's a photo of a tree I captured 1 hr ago, named it upside down , not sure it's very original :) [https://imgur.com/5SIge3R](https://imgur.com/5SIge3R)

Once again, thanks a lot for what you do Aeri73!",1675209602

"Coldmirror","t5_32vcj","trans sein und schizophrenie sind zwei sehr verschiedene dinge, das ist kein guter vergleich. und es sollte allen menschen frei stehen, eh mit ihrem k√∂rper zu machen, was sie wollen. es gibt ja auch leute, die zb keine ""pille, die sie cis macht"" nehmen w√ºrden, weil ihre erfahrungen als trans person ihren charakter und ihr sein stark gepr√§gt haben.

ich will dir auch gar keinen hass auf irgendwen unterstellen oder nicht unterstellen, die meisten wurden, wenn nicht trans feindlich, dann trans ignorierend sozialisiert, das ist halt so.

ich versteh das mit den toiletten sowieso nicht, vergewaltigung etc ist eh verboten, in wohnh√§usern gibts auch nur unisex klos.. meiner meinung nach soll einfach jeder auf das klo gehen, dass an ehesten seinem geschlecht entspricht. die meisten trans personen gehen ja auch erst nach ihrer sozialen transition (wenn nicht sogar noch sp√§ter) auf die entsprechende toilette.",1675209603

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;A large segment of Socialists really want to deny that scarcity exists

The adage that every criticism of socialism is actually a criticism of capitalism is looking more and more accurate. Of course resources are scarce.  The decision has to be made with how to allocate resources: equitably, or based on who can take the most.  If resources were allocated equitably then people wouldn't have to rely on dipshit celebrity stunts to not be blind.

&gt;they want to avoid thinking through any trade-offs, and they really despise the fact that reasonable people might have different priorities than they do.

The old adage strikes again.  You are celebrating celebrity charity to the impoverished.  In a just and equitable society those people would have their medical needs met without random handouts from wealthy attention-seekers.  It's not the celebrity handouts that are the problem, it's the underlying conditions that create such extreme concentration of wealth among a tiny handful of people (capitalism).

Basically, people are upset at the brutal conditions that exist in the world as presently structured under capitalism, particularly in the context of the vast resources squandered by a handful of wealthy and powerful people. There is no help coming for most disabled or afflicted people, but billion dollar yacht orders are at all-time peaks.

"tuesday","t5_2r8s0","I can read it, yes, and it has issues like this page:

 https://imgur.com/Mpd1EFM.jpg

Section b., Aside from being poorly written, references ""pornographic"" content or prohibited content under section 847.012, which is...

http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0847/Sections/0847.012.html


Notable inside:

&gt;(6)‚ÄÉAny person violating any provision of this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.


Hey, look, it's the *exact* statute and potential criminal charge people are referencing, which now has a new context to be applied in. That's the point. It itself references this:

http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0800-0899/0847/Sections/0847.001.html

Which includes: 

&gt;(7)‚ÄÉ‚ÄúHarmful to minors‚Äù means any reproduction, imitation, characterization, description, exhibition, presentation, or representation, of whatever kind or form, depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it:
(a)‚ÄÉPredominantly appeals to a prurient, shameful, or morbid interest;
(b)‚ÄÉIs patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material or conduct for minors; and
(c)‚ÄÉTaken as a whole, is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.


(b) in particular has potential relevance here. 


So, again, the issue isn't that this creates a new crime or redefines the categories; it is that the new *context* it is bringing the old terminology into inherently creates uncertainty and potential liability. School libraries were already monitored for content and appropriate material, but this new law explicitly brings in terminology and requirements from *criminal statues* to the process. Unless you want to argue that the new law somehow changes *nothing at all* it makes no sense to argue that now including preexisting definitions or statues means there is nothing to worry about for teachers and staff. Instead of being governed by administrative policy, the legislature now has them following guidelines that *explicitly* come with the threat of felony charges.",1675209605

‚ÄúOh no the album is too long‚Äù
Its not supposed to be a sit down and listen album if you dont wanna listen to all of it dont.

Its party music its pick up and go, like oh i like this song let me play it type shit.

But he was supposed to release allty5 first, but bc there was no hype around it he had to generate hype by‚Ä¶ you guessed it

*Fakespot analyzes the reviews authenticity and not the product quality using AI. We look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.*

*We give an A-F letter for trustworthiness of reviews. A = very trustworthy reviews, F = highly untrustworthy reviews. We also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",1675209606

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"realestateinvesting","t5_2qnt1","&gt;the fact of the matter is, when I said lower rent, i wasn't comparing tot he time it was being vacant. I'm sorry you didn't understand that, and have gone all out to not admit your misunderstanding, altghough you've already acknowledged it earlier (though you try to say its b/c my writing wasn't clear, but I didn't realize I had to clarify a simple assumption anyone with a brain would make...)  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;If you would have simply agreed with me that your argument was entirely oversimplified, poorly worded and factually inaccurate from the beginning when I gave you the chance then we would already be done here.  
&gt;  
&gt;you have a mental problem of needing to have hte last word, you misinterpreted it, it  WAS a very generic oversimplied hypotehtical, its pretty damn obvious since,k you know, i didn't discuss any of the multitude of in depth factors...  
&gt;  
&gt;again, sorry you misinterpreted.

Again, it's not that I don't understand what you said. What you actually said isn't logical and isn't accurate. What I was initially doing was clarifying your inaccuracies, had you simply admitted that your post was poorly worded, or what you actually said wasn't what you were trying to say then it would be different. But again, you instead dug your heels in and spent 300 posts proving just how little you know while attempting to insult me the entire time

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;valuation immediately changes regardless of if that value is ever realized or not. not necessarily, there are plenty of scenarios where it wouldn't, whos making the oversimplified arguments now?

That's simply not true, additional vacancy will immediately impact a property valuation, that's why lenders keep tabs on rents rolls. Valuation is a snap shot at 1 given point in time, not something that is fixed until it's convenient to value again. 

&gt;\&gt;, the comparison is no longer old rent vs new current, it's 0 vs new rent.  
&gt;  
&gt;THAT is the comparison you are trying to interject, that is not the comparison I was making. There are plenty of times you would be comparing the old rent to a new lease even with a vacancy in the middle

Again, my comparison is the only comparison to make. It's irrelevant what an expired tenant paid. It's only relevant what a future tenant will pay and what current market rates are. Expired lease rates aren't worth the paper they are printed on. THEY. MEAN. NOTHING.

&gt;again, you are having your own argument, own tangent, and trying so hard on it, its laughable. Clearly, i never was comparing the vacant time, hence why 'lower rent'  
&gt;  
&gt;\-&gt; you even agree you wouldn't have lower than - rent, so obviously I wasn't comparing to 0 rent..  clown

Type all the insults you want, still doesn't change the fact that what you said isn't accurate. It just makes it even more fun for me to continue to see you spew more nonsense proving just how little of an understanding you have with commercial real estate.",1675209607

Rentals can be really hard to find so follow lots of community pages in case you find someone breaking a lease. 

If you are coming with your family you might want to move where there is some local public transport. Buses (the most common), trams (a few) or trains. Most people live outside the city because it's cheaper. If you like wine the hills are nice. If you like the beach Henley and Brighton are nice. Norwood is also nice and has a lot of restaurants. 

When you get here make sure you have a working visa and read the customs form carefully and don't bring food in. The fines are quite harsh. Hope the job works out well and you have a nice time.

In a sense, the work of early chemists randomly mixing solutions is a kind of alchemy, hypothesis-less testing and observation. I think this is science-like, and it lead to the development of chemistry as a proper science, but the two are not the same thing. The problem with calling alchemy science is that it means we can't tell the difference between science and pseudo-science.

The cataloguing that Geriatirichyrdalisk mentions is critical to science, but it isn't science itself. 

There are practices that are essential to science, that are not science. 

It's obvious we need to have some ideas and guess of what the world is like (it pulls apples to it, sometimes if you mix chemicals stuff happens), but those aren't scientific ideas. I agree with you that not all of us are always doing Popperian in science in a pure method, but I think we can all agree, like Popper, that there are practices which are sciencey or sciencelike or science adjacent that aren't science itself.

""As a scientist"" I would think you already would have learned ""correlation is not causation"". The presence of something like acetylcholine in a plant doesn't prove, or even provide evidence that plants are experiencing things.

As for the second link, like I already said, plants do react to stimuli in more complex ways than a lot of people are aware of. That includes transmitting information, but the fact that something is reacting to stimulation and transmitting information does not indicate the capacity to feel. The computer I'm typing this into is reacting to stimuli and transmitting information.

Unconscious people still react to stimuli in complex ways as well, all while not actually experiencing anything.

&gt; Sentience is defined as the ability to experience feelings and sensations, which plants have near undeniably [unless you're one of those science deniers] at this point in a modern understanding of the world. 

Go ahead and find me a reputable source with actual scientists that takes the position plants are capable of feeling. Actually, find me a couple since you're implying this is something currently accepted by science. It should be extremely easy if this is the scientific consensus as you're implying. I'll wait.

You would need to have their support really before hand, and whilst people may suggest asking another GP, it can be, ultimately, a practice wide approach. 

You are welcome to ask for clarification from your practice, by email if necessary, in order ti best understand what they mean currently. It will inform your next choices, along with readily available information that you may be able to provide to them.

If your scheme fails, it's better for people to have the option to mow lawns rather than being our of luck altogether. If your problem is with generous welfare benefits making people making people be lazy and skip trade school, then cut the benefits or deny them to people who haven't gone to trade school. I personally think this is needlessly cruel, there are plenty of people who just can't hack it at trade school who might need access to low paying jobs.

The transparency push would apply to thousands of companies doing business in the state that make at least $1 billion a year

***



___

By Ari Plachta

Companies that generate a billion dollars or more a year doing business in California would be required to publicly release their carbon emissions data under a bill introduced Monday backed by environmental and sustainable business groups.

Supporters of SB 235 say it would strengthen regulation of greenhouse gas emissions generated by some of the most profitable industries across the economy as the state strives to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The bill is likely to face opposition from business interests.

State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, reintroduced the bill after an earlier version failed to clear the Assembly in August, amid opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce and several Democratic lawmakers who joined Republicans in voting against it.

The new proposal would make California the first state to require companies with annual gross revenues of over $1 billion to make public their greenhouse gas emissions in line with an independent global emissions measurement framework known as the GHG Protocol.

The new disclosure rules would not be limited to California-based corporations, and are estimated to impact some 5,500 companies operating in a state that could soon surpass Germany as the world‚Äôs fourth-largest economy.

Companies would be required to submit emissions disclosures to an online reporting platform and a third-party audit. The California Air Resources Board would then be tasked with incorporating the data into state climate goals.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for the corporate community to come clean about their progress toward meeting our climate goals,‚Äù Wiener said in a statement. ‚ÄúTo tackle the climate crisis, we need new standards to improve transparency and raise the bar for the business community across the nation.‚Äù

U.S. industry emitted 5.9 million metric tons of carbon from consuming fossil fuels in 2020, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Efforts to require corporate disclosures of emissions are underway at the national level, with a proposed ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",1675209611

If you did know her well, YTA but I have more sympathy for you. I can see how your friend is making you feel left out by constantly speaking languages you don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd suggest talking about your hurt feelings in a way that doesn‚Äôt attack her. 

If she‚Äôs a random roommate or someone you barely know, then I have zero sympathy. You need to understand that your roommate is not there for your entertainment. She‚Äôs her own person and is living her own life - she has no obligation to watch shows in a language you know or talk to her friends in a language you can understand. Her life has nothing to do with yours, and she doesn‚Äôt give a crap if you find her boring. Expecting your opinion to matter to her is pure arrogance. Whatever your relationship was before this, you‚Äôve destroyed it, so the only thing you can do is apologize for being a jerk and stay out of her way. 

Lucky for you, you‚Äôre a freshman and there‚Äôs plenty of time to grow out of this.

"hoggit","t5_2tifv","I do not deny the value of track files in debugging SW and the issue I have is not asking us to submit tracks with bug reports in general. Specifically, the issue I have (and presumably the poster) is that ED will not even do the slightest bit of investigation into a bug without one. Even bugs like the F5 RWR where they can load into any server and experience it themselves. Instead they tell us, THE CUSTOMER, to go and create a track file that needs to be &lt;5mb (if you want to upload to their forums) or go and host it on your own Google drive account (or equivalent). Most missions will exceed the 5mb threshold due to the number of ground units, so now you're asking the customer to take their own time to create their own limited scope mission just to replicate the bug in a &lt;5mb file?

The bug itself is easily reproducible but ED wants their customers to jump through hoops before they lift a finger to even consider something as a bug. As a customer, having this canned response regurgitated for easily reproducible bugs rubs me the wrong way.",1675209612

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"findapath","t5_2wqq6","What is your major? Often times. It comes down to using transferable skills that you came from college and your degree programs. I was a double major in communications journalism and graduated in 2006 and social media became a thing six months later and basically nullified my degree. I also majored in social studies, education, and quickly learned in student teaching. I had no interest in being a teacher for the next 30 years. So I had to use the skills gang from the degree programs and found a path.

It was windy. It wasn‚Äôt perfect but I found my niche in workforce development advising after having done some political campaigning work and then non profit management after

Today I utilize both of my degree programs, and what I do even though it may not have exactly been what I envisioned when I got my degrees

Depending on your career interest, an extra certificate could even do wonders. For example, someone in IT, who may not want to exactly do IT for their whole lives can go get some certification and analytics, and make good money because of how in demand that is right now

Someone who wants to work in management, but has a good understanding of social media can go make really good money  etc.",1675209612

"intj","t5_2qowo","¬´¬†SURPRISINGLY¬†¬ª KAKDDKS darling‚Äî feeling lonely is an inherently negative feeling, in contrast to simply being alone which is neutral. Being lonely is characterized by a feeling of emotional isolation, which is detrimental to humans, as we are inherently social creatures.

Unfortunately, I struggle with this too, the main reason being how I suffice to myself most of the time, and don‚Äôt feel the need to spend energy on cultivating or preserving friendships. 

In short term, the way I‚Äôm able to remedy to these feelings is by processing my emotions on my own. See, loneliness comes from a feeling of isolation, which in turn comes from the desire to share something with someone else. When I feel that desire rising, I focus on the thing I would want to share with someone, and instead, share it with myself. This helps being self-sufficient in terms of emotional needs. Although beware: trying this is NOT recommended if you are in a bad place mentally, for example a depressive state, as in that case your brain is stuck in a dysfunctional loop that can only be broken by having emotional support. So in that situation, remaining isolated is the WORST thing you could possibly do 

A more sustainable solution (which I haven‚Äôt achieved yet) is to cultivate a group of people around you that you can go to when you‚Äôre feeling lonely. What‚Äôs important to remember is that acknowledging you‚Äôre struggling with this is a stepping stone, as beating yourself up for being least pro efficient at something than the people around you is counterproductive

"valheim","t5_jb05l","You have to trap them in an enclosure, feed them, and then leave them far enough until they calm down (red exclamation point goes away). Feed them by dropping food in their enclosure. You'll know they're eating it when yellow hearts pop up. It takes a while to tame them but you can tame multiple at once, and you can tame a wild animal in a pen with tame animals.

An enclosure can be a fence, walls, a pit you dug, or pretty much anything they can't escape. They will probably damage your fences so repair occasionally.

If you build a gate, leave it open, make them chase you in, close it and jump out.

You can check their tame % by hovering your mouse over them but if they see you they'll probably get angry for a while. Once it's 100% their HP bar turns green.

3) The saints rebuild is so unique in NFL history, where they have basically been 100M over the cap for 5 years, and using void contracts to push that into further seasons (always adding more in the process). Him leaving is a very good move for himself since eventually the Saonts will need to reset with only players being paid very low salary.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","""Negotiating"" wages is nothing more than the boss trying to manipulate you into taking less than the amount your labour is worth, so they can increase their profits. It has nothing to do with pragmatism. It is not even a negotiation. Every time you swallow your pride and dignity to take a job paying you less than you know you are worth, you aren't doing it because you ""accept reality"". You are doing it because you have no other recourse. Your own product, which is your worth as a worker, is in **supply**, and you are exchanging it for something in much **higher demand**, the job and the money it represents. What's more, you have to undergo this trade between unequals, otherwise you starve and die under a cold sky. You are perfectly willing to defend the business' interests, because you take it for granted. Since this is capitalism, why can't the workers have their own interests as priorities? Why should they give way to the bosses? Oh right, because...

&gt; that‚Äôs not how the world works

Then perhaps we should change it. And a good first step is to change the dynamic of the conversation between an unemployed worker and a job-offering boss. That is, don't undervalue yourself and your labour, because in doing so, you are bringing the rest of the workforce down with you. You are normalizing accepting being exploited, and you are driving the ""price"" of labour down for every other worker in your field, in your place of employment, in your area, and then everywhere else.

* 195 g/tile/day - Diamond crystalarium (with gemologist profession)
* 171.9 g/tile/day - Starfruit wine keg, with starfruit grown outdoors using deluxe speed-gro to cut down on the number of starfruit tiles you need to plant outdoors in order keep up with the kegs. Assumes artisan profession.
* 165 g/tile/day - Ancient fruit wine kegs. Assumes artisan. Also assumes you're growing the fruit in the greenhouse or on ginger island; since a yearlong planting on your farm is complicated and I don't want to math it right now.
* 150g/tile/day - Diamond crystalarium (no gemologist)
* 131 g/tile/day - Starfruit wine kegs+ starfruit in garden pots. Assumes artisan and no speed gro, since you can't have both speed-gro and retaining soil and garden pots without deluxe retaining soil are infeasible. Assumes 2 starfruit tiles per keg tile, which is slightly worse than optimal but lets be real you're only harvesting the garden pot starfruit on keg days.
* 100 g/tile/day - Fire quartz crystalarium without gemologist (Much easier to gather than diamonds, in case you're worried about getting the starter gems for the crystalariums. Pretty annoying tho, since you have to harvest every day, so you'll want to upgrade to diamonds if you go this route.)
* 40.2g/tile/day - Casks with starfruit wine
* 29.5 g/tile/day - Casks with ancient fruit wine

Outdoor tiles and indoor tiles required for a given set up are not counted separately, instead just factoring into the ""per tile"" part of g/tile/day. Also assumes you're doing this at scale, so you have (for example) have 129 starfruit plants with deluxe speed gro keeping 100 kegs active 7 days a week instead of 1 starfruit plant feeding 1 keg and losing 2 keg days because you're waiting on the starfruit plant. Also for machines where the actual run-time is measured in hours not days, rounds to the nearest day to account for the fact that you're probably not sitting there waiting for the machine to finish.",1675209613

# Generate spooky vampires with this embedding!

Use this embedding by including ""*vmpr*"" in your prompt. It can make some pretty spooky/bloody things, so be wary. Generally creates characters with lots of red, white, and black colors. Glowing eyes, sharp teeth, and lots of blood. Good at both male and female characters, unlike my previous ""ghost"" embedding.

Works well with models like [Dreamlike Diffusion](https://civitai.com/models/1274/dreamlike-diffusion-10), but works with many other models as well, like [Dreamshaper.](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper)

The mouths of your characters might be a little off depending on your model, usually has many sharp teeth and is very bloody. If that's what you are going for, then good. If you don't want that, maybe try out some negative prompting.

### I hope you enjoy this embedding, if you make some cool things with it please share it with me! I love seeing what yall can create :)",1675209614

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","Sorry ur experience interviewing has sucked. Interviewing itself is tough especially for corporate jobs with no experience, dont feel bad. Many times they are going to take the person with experience no matter how good ur interview was.

This may sound strange but I would go work in a restaurant as a server for the time going if I were u. Two main reasons there-

It sounds like u just need some desensitization from the anxiety of meeting new people. These interviews are triggering u and u need to just get used to meeting someone u don't know over and over again. I promise no matter how anxious or bad at it u think u might be the progress u will make from day one to day 30 will be dramatic. Serving will let u relax and just speak to people during interviews instead of freezing.

Second reason-this is actually a good resume builder for many jobs out there. I've known many people who go from serving to other customer facing/corporate jobs. 

Third reason-tons of these jobs are available. Just walk in and ask for the manager. I bet if u do this at ten nice/decent restaurants one will give u a shot. 

Hope this helps! Def get out of that job it sounds like they are fucking u over. Not getting paychecks in full is not normal",1675209614

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Socratic questioning. 
Look up some videos on street epistemology.

Ask him why he thinks that. 
Likely it's because someone told him. 

Is something true just because someone told you that?  If I told you the sky was green,  should you believe me right away? 

Talk to him about evidence required for things. 

If being trans is against god, there should be something in the bible that states it (there isn't).  

If you were strictly following street epistemology you'd question why you should believe the bible... but for the sake of continuing your religious bent,  you'd deviate here and question the contents rather than the actual validity of the source:

Quite often it will be ""god created men and women"".  Maybe... So if god created man and woman who created every other child since then?  Being trans isn't a matter of free will,  because free will is the ability to make choices.  Being trans and transitioning into what you are meant to be could just be seen as gods will.  It's no different from a baby having heart surgery to correct a congenital heart problem.  Any other person taking medications to fix a genetic problem.  Having eye surgery to fix cataracts etc.  Intersex people exist.  They are not strictly man or woman.  If God created the original, we have evidence of many things that are not strictly perfect according to those originals.",1675209615

I say ""allergic"" because it's very similar and people don't understand that ""intolerant"" is a medical term and not just that I really don't like something. People who are sweet enough to consider my condition are so very appreciated. However, I've never actually had anyone truly follow the diet I have to stick to. They'll say, ""well that sounded too plain so of course I added &lt;thing I can't eat&gt;.""

Many times they think if I don't have full blown anaphylaxis then I'm not allergic. I'd prefer not to have swamp butt for 2 weeks, vomiting, feeling like I've been poisoned, cold symptoms, migraines and more. People do get insulted when you can't eat food they have, homemade or not. Then they spend a lot of time asking, ""are you SURE"" and ""I'm sure if you wanted to you could!"" And those are the times when it's considered at all, which I really don't expect anyone to do. But if I bring something they act like I'm trying to martyr myself. It's exhausting and I just have to avoid going to things. It's pretty isolating.

I share all of that to say that you, OP, went far beyond anything most people would expect. I have zero clue why anyone would act that horrible about you doing something so kind.

Bus riders and rail riders are the same people (Until they give up and buy a car).

The way the lines are organized is fine‚Äî there are many bus lines that could support (and once did support) 10-minute frequency based on surrounding density and connections, but the line only has 30-minute frequency because ‚Äúridership is low.‚Äù Obviously, because a bus unreliably running every 30 minutes is almost never a viable alternative to anything.

From 1996 to 2006, Metro was under a consent decree (ordered by a judge) to provide a certain level of good service. As soon as it expired, metro started gradually cutting bus service during their bi-annual service revisions, which has continued since. This is the real reason why Rail ridership was dropping before Covid‚Äî the bus riders were riding to train stations.",1675209615

if the current pacing remains the same until the arc ends then Wano arc will have 0.69 chapter per episode pace

for Dressrosa it was 0.86 chapter per episode

for WCI it was 0.82 chapter per episode

it is weird though, even though Wano arc has a significantly lower chapter per episode pace than Dressrosa when watching the anime the pacing for Wano feels better than it was when watching Dressrosa, might be because the extra content for Wano doesn't feel as dragged out as it did in Dressrosa arc, great animation and extended fights help too",1675209616

"ershow","t5_ci6ic","Overall, I liked her character and how she ended up with Ray. But the stint at the Mini Mart was difficult to believe -- it felt like the writers decided she needed to step out of medicine for a while, and cutting to scenes of her working in retail or in an office would have been jarring in contrast to the rest of the show. ""I've got it,"" one writer must have said. ""She can run the cash register at the place where all the doctors and nurses get their coffee! We'll just have more coffee scenes this season."" (If the diner hadn't burned down, my guest is that she would've been taking their orders for burgers and scrambled eggs.)

By the way, I could identify with her early seasons where she was doubting her ability as a surgeon.

After testing a bit on Duelingbook I realize that the archetype has more problems keeping hand advantage and getting another monster on field that can change their battle position than intended, so this 2 were made to help with that.

Some of the old card also had have their effect slightly changed: Jack now activates directly from Deck instead off adding, so you can search the Trap and not lose counters, Funky Hopper now can Summon from hand and GY and now all the Spell and Traps are Jitterband cards instead of Jitterbug Bands, because I think its sounds better. Because of this Willie adds ""Jitterb"" cards from GY instead of Jitterbugs cards, but gameplay wise it act the same as before",1675209617

Without going into too many details, I'm trying to hack something that is not intended to go together.

I'm trying to attach what is basically a bbq grill (will not be used as intended) to the frame so when I said rod it's basically the frame of the grill. The whole thing is 30cm by 44cm, made of stainless and weight no more than 400-500g. There is no load on the grill itself, it only need to stay reasonably rigid and will be attached on two sides. 

About the distance from the frame, the maximum acceptable distance is 1cm. It can be closer, I just can't have it further away. I wanted to eliminate fasteners that would attach the grill too far away.

I started to consider extruded aluminum for my project only a couple of days ago and am a bit overwhelmed after visiting 8020.net. Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Let‚Äôs use Nazism as an example. If some Nazis, whether it be a personal preference or a misinterpretation, also thought killing dogs was a good idea, would Nazism include dog-killing?

If nazism was what drove them to kill dogs, then their nazism would be about killing dogs, yes. Then, if that nazism was the nazism of the nazi party, or those nazis in power who make all the changes, then ye, we could say nazism is, at least in part, about killing dogs. Of course, this is a bad example as nazism really has nothing to do with dogs, whereas feminism is kind of necessarily about the sexes, so it's an entirely different topic vs just going too far.

&gt; No. In fact, a feminist who thinks women are superior to man isn‚Äôt a feminist, they‚Äôre a sexist. Definitions might be contextual, but they can‚Äôt just be fixed to any situation.

And how many feminists need to think that way before it stops being ""That's not a feminist"" and starts being ""that's just how feminists are, and thus what feminism really is""?

As an adult, she got a job at a dog boarding / grooming place.  I think that's when her eyes started to get opened to the reality of what it's like to own a dog.  And to dog nuttery.  


She eventually owned a few dogs with her husband -- but that was all his idea.  When they split up, somehow she got stuck with the two dogs they had at the time.  By then, they had three kids (she has primary custody).  She was the only adult in the home,so she was stuck doing all the work associated with the dogs.  This continued her education to the reality of dog ownership.  She eventually called her ex, gave him a deadline, and said that if he didn't come get the dogs by then, she would find new homes for them.  He didn't and she did.  


Dog-free life is so much better, of course.  And now she understands part of why I said ""No way, Jose!"" to every request for a dog from her and her brother when they were kids.",1675209618
"AskLibertarians","t5_2yqo4","Negligence only becomes harmful where a contract has been violated. Where there is no contract, there is no tort due to negligence. Your claim that failing to maintain a property is harmful to anyone is stipulated by your belief in inherent fractional ownership, which still needs to be demonstrated.

As promised, here are the examples of harms you listed, with the real causes for each:

* Starvation: caused by biology.
* House burning down: caused by whoever started the fire.
* Bleeding out: caused by whatever or whoever created the wound.

Current claims of ownership over a given resource can be denounced or supported on a case-by-case basis, based on how the property was acquired throughout the entire chain of custody.

You are risking a total burnout which wont be good for either side. So try and figure out something before it gets too much.

"uAlberta","t5_2spif","I know you‚Äôll get lots of perks, so from someone with a few regrets, here‚Äôs some warnings:

1. You‚Äôre just a number. In most classes, there are too many students for the prof to know you. Therefore, you won‚Äôt be able to form much of a connection and it‚Äôs largely ‚Äúhear lecture, try assignment, do test.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt true in all classes/departments, but in sciences it‚Äôs very often.

2. Most professors are here for research. Teaching is a side-job they have to do, and many of them show it. Therefore not only do most of them not have any teaching background, they also often seem to put the bare minimum into class preparations.

3. Parking is absurdly predatory. $120-$200 per month, more for indoor. Don‚Äôt want a monthly pass? $15 per day. And don‚Äôt sleep in, because it expires at 6am and they have enforcement out that early sometimes. $100 per ticket, and my friend once got one for ‚Äúno payment‚Äù and ‚Äúnot observing signage‚Äù at the same time, when the signage was just that you needed a payment.

4. Expenses in general. Everything on campus or involving campus is more expensive than you think, I promise.

The University of Alberta is a for-profit institution and they‚Äôre proud of it. Education quality has taken a noticeable dive in the last 3 years especially, and yet fees just keep going up. Use your judgement and make your own decisions, but from my point of view a smaller school provides the same degree and likely a much better experience.",1675209619

Baby, I'm 52 years old.  The only abuse I haven't suffered from a man is physically.  So you can dismount right off of that high horse.  I have been to almost every level of Hell with the men in my life.

&gt;You can‚Äôt seriously be equating cheating with drunk driving and almost killing me. FWIW you run over me, either sober or drunk, and I‚Äôm not forgiving you. 

Except it does equate.  Harm has been done.  With a car?  Harm is physcial.  With cheating?  Harm is emotional and harder to get over.  

Do you understand what being cheated on feels like?  It's like the person you love and trust most in the world ran over your heart with a Mack truck and now you're forever mentally crippled.  How can you trust anyone again?  How do you feel like you're a lovable, worthy person again when the person you love betrayed you?  

And sure, you can say ""It was an accident, it was a mistake"", but guess what?  That person is still on life support due to your actions.  You, with your car broke every bone in my body.  You, by betrayaing my love and trust, have broken the very essence of *me*.  Broken bomes can heal easier than a broke heart.

"Pixel6","t5_3fy38","What version OS you running? When is the last time you grabbed a security update on your phone. I mean 4 hours is horrible, but I hate to say this but. I am in distress from your post. This is normal behavior with a beta phone running the worst OS ever Android 12.

Make sure your running Android 13 as that is flawless. Also your phone has the bad modem which is horrible and on top of that your phone heats up like crazy for no reason.

Not to long ago for like 2 weeks or so; Google says send us your P6 Vanilla and well give you a brand new Pixel 7 for twenty dollars plus tax. The Pixel 6 has a sh\*T modem. Now even MKBHD is on the Pixel 7 Pro. He had a S21 Ultra for year and half then 6 came out and he gave a good review of it and saying its nice blah blah. But each month when its update time his phone would get weird problems and he could not recommend the phone anymore. Hey goes through tunnel on way to studio and his S21 Ultra never loses connection. WIth the P6P once he entered the tunnel there was a loss of signal until your out of the tunnel.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR   


Now Pixel 7 series their using a Exynos 5300 top of food chain modem. A unrealeased modem for the G2. Now MKBHD can go through tunnel without signal loss. Also another story where some guy came to Califnornia from Utah and had his signal on in the plane,, it never went off ever, even for 1 second. Then in California and back to Utah he did not loose signal even once.

The Pixel 8 will use the 5300 modem as they have said so. Which is not a bad thing. Its a great Modem that wont eat you up in a fire pit style lol.

The Pixel 6a at this point is a better choice. But, if you can wait a little, like a few months and in May the Pixel 7a will come out and it wont be budget or value. It will use the G2 Tensor along with either the GN1 main camera sensors weve been using since P6. It is a 2019 sensor. 

The P6 was a compromised phone. Great phone Ive used and like it, but the heat issues when doing nothing or able to take 20 second video her ein LA. Just make sure you change to LTE 4G then you can record a video and it will never shut off or give warning message. The 5G while taking video makes the P7P crazy hot on a not so hot day. These heat issues are just not there, but the fact 5G takes more battery and makes it feel like a fire pit. Then your resting sitting down and play a 4min video or chat and its hot as hell.

The P6 is a first attempt by Google. The P7 came and the rapture. Phone of the Year. Best Camera of any phone for 2022. 

But the 6a is amazing with the G1 tensor using same IMX363 from 5 years ago, but in the camera blind test run by MKBHD. With all phones and a picture is the same one they look at it of him sitting back laying on couch. Also since hes black we can see how it does justice with real tone. In other words if you take a picture of a bannana all the results will look same. MBKHD was smart in this situation.

After 20 million people voted for the blind camera test. They have no idea what phone is showing what. All the players are there like Honor Magic and Xaomi and iSh\*T phone.

For best normal picture or just using a main sensor and point and shoot and guess who won.

For regular pic taking #Pixel 6a then #2 Pixel 7 Pro. For low light pictures and Portrailt shots the Pixel 7 Pro was #1. Then low light photos again Pixel 7 Pro won. Also the P7P has the best display according to DXOMARK. I do know its 1049nits peak indoors and under sun goes to 1500nits. This destroys the Pixel 6 Pro. Also the display curve is not same, its now very subtle curve and not bothersome. Plus when you swipe around on a flat phone your finger hits the case everytime. Curved you just feeling the phone no bump to go over and so on.

THe Pixel 6 was a okay sensor and nothing to call home about. To me it was same as P5 dummy phone I have.

I feel bad for those that missed the send us your Pixel 6 and well send you a P7 for 20 dollars plus tax lol. Thanks for reading this long if you did. Scholarly sh\*T uh.",1675209620

Multiple people I know have since left Xfinity/Comcast altogether, are subscribing to NONE of their services - and are *still* on Peacock Premium.  
  
So I wonder if this little venture is going to extend to finally scrubbing old subs off their premium tier that haven't been Xfinity customers for the last year or so.

A quick search says she inherited $75million when her dad died, as well as getting $12million per year from old Rio Tinto royalties. All of which she inherited in 1992 - she was setup to succeed with the mining boom hitting its stride and not hitting speed bumps until 2011/2012.

Like, yes - she got to billionaire status herself. But she started with a huge leg up from that inheritance, particularly when you're getting a guaranteed $12million per year in royalties, which allow you the freedom to take risks when you know you'll have those royalty checks roll in.

Beyond that, as I said - her inheritance was in a booming industry. It's not like she inherited her money/business in car manufacturing.",1675209621

&gt;Many women in these shelters suffer from PTSDas a result of sexual trauma

I'm sure there's at least a few cases of PTSD resulting in racism. Is that a basis for keeping black people out of dv shelters? 

&gt;It manifests in many ways, including being uncomfortable around people with penises in a place they go to to receive support.

How do you know if any given person has a penis or not? Checking is a far more problematic behavior that should probably keep you out of a generalized shelter. You need more specialized care at that point.


&gt;It isn‚Äôt assuming that trans women are all rapists or even that the woman in question thinks they are, but they are uncomfortable nonetheless.

My boyfriend (29), was showing me an IG post and I (24) saw almost nothing but thirst traps. It was at least 90% thirst traps of men doing various poses. Not gonna lie it made me a little jealous. I really did not want to be that boyfriend that polices his social media and nor do I actively do that. I made a comment about it and at first he was very defensive and told me i was being ridiculous. Later on in the night he treated me very harshly and yelled saying he deleted all the thirst traps. Am I being ridiculous?

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA, BUT! I get why. 

Teaching is a particular type of exhausting. I was a teacher while I lived with my parents (at 28!), and I was probably a difficult person to live with. Managing 160 kids for eight hours a day wore down my social battery and by the time I'd get home, even little things would make me snap. Some days I was so tired or bitter from a terrible day, I didn't -want- to talk. I empathize with not knowing where to put that frustration and exhaustion, I'm sorry you're going through such a tough time. It's really common for teachers to burn out like this. 

Some advice?
1. Apologize to your folks. We all make mistakes. They seem really supportive, I'm sure you'll all be past it soon. Maybe have some conversations about giving you space, or tell them what kind of support you need given this is job demands so much of us emotionally and mentally.
2. Quit your job. Teaching is not a job you should do if you hate it. Our kiddos deserve (and desperately need) educators who have the capacity to love and nurture them. I suspect you're probably just burnt out and haven't been properly supported by your campus administrators, it's pretty common. If you enjoy teaching, but are just tired of this job, you're in luck! Teachers are in high demand all over the country. Find a school with administrators and school culture that can better support you, so that you can be the best you for your kiddos. Either way, quit when you're able to.

Wish you and your family the best Teacher Friend.",1675209622

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","Tabletop gaming is fun. It's an interactive story, where you're a part of what happens. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.

Some notes:

- Combat can feel slow as everyone acts in turn, but it's still fun if you have a good group of people
- My first character, I made the mistake of wanting ALL the skills and assigned minimal points to as many as possible, which is most systems mean you suck at everything. Don't ""min-max"", i.e. don't make it so that you are STUNNINGLY amazing at, like, one thing at the cost of everything else, but‚Ä¶ choose a few skills and be moderately good at a few things.
- It's best if everyone wants to play and storytell together. I was a part of one group where a couple of people just wouldn't compromise on their characters' motivations - the party decided to go investigate something, and they went off and did their own thing. That's fine sometimes, but the point is to play together as a group‚Ä¶
- Have fun. Rules are great, but storytelling should be more important than the rules. 
- Finally, in a good group - rolling a one (typically a special failure) shouldn't kill you, just be bad; and rolling a twenty (or other high roll) shouldn't be an automatic success for anything you're doing - it should just indicate that you did especially well in the circumstances. Doesn't mean you can jump a hundred foot gap, but it means that maybe you only fell and broke your ankle instead of dying or breaking your back. :)",1675209623

"CelebWivesofNashville","t5_2ntkrt","So if you go to Broadway and it gets too obnoxious, veer off a bit into Printers Alley nearby-there‚Äôs a fun divey Karaoke bar (can‚Äôt remember the name) and a burlesque bar there called Skulls. Still some tourists but usually less aggressive. Check the calendar for both the Basement East and the Basement-sometimes you can catch really cool shows at both last minute. If you like songwriters, try the Listening Room-the early shows are typically newer/younger singer-songwriters and artists, and the later shows tend to be more established songwriters with some hits-and they‚Äôre one of few places in town that actually pay the writers. (Lots of musicians around town are playing for tips or a super low base pay and tips.) LR are fun storyteller type shows that give you the backstory on the songs. The late shows can sell out early so get tix in advance! For just hanging out, I‚Äôm partial to the east side-there‚Äôs a fun speakeasy called Attaboy, a nice chill cocktail bar called Henry James, and a few cool little tiki bars. If you venture into Madison, there‚Äôs a great divey place called Dee‚Äôs with live music. Plenty to do as well in the five points area, where there‚Äôs a cluster of bars. 
Although locals (me included) can get complainy about tourism and traffic, Nashville is an electric city with lots of energy and an incredibly talented arts community. Enjoy your trip! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1675209623

Which is a nice bit of normalization - ""we need Blanc to be with someone so that we can get the door open without revealing anything too early. Give him a husband.""

It would definitely be nice to have more focused representation, but I personally appreciated the way they did it. It feels like a lot of representation is ""look, the character's sexuality relevant so we've earned the right to show it!"", so I liked something where it was ""this is irrelevant but just so you know he's queer"", y'know?",1675209624

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) ‚Äî A bill that would ban the sale of assault-style weapons in Rhode Island was introduced Tuesday.

Gov. Dan McKee and other state leaders held a news conference formally announcing the legislation that would ban the sale, manufacture, and transfer of assault weapons.

‚ÄúI want to say this loud and clear: Rhode Island is ready for an assault weapons ban to help keep our communities safe,‚Äù McKee said. ‚ÄúAs governor, I‚Äôm ready to sign that bill into law.‚Äù

Violators would face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $10,000 and the guns would be confiscated.

Gun rights advocate Brenda Jacob, of the Rhode Island Revolver and Rifle Association, said the state is using law-abiding citizens as pawns in the issue.

‚ÄúThey keep saying, promoting how they want everyone to feel safe in their home,‚Äù Jacob said. ‚ÄúWell you know what? I feel safer with a firearm in my home.‚Äù

Watch: McKee and other local leaders announce the bill (Story continues below.)

R.I. Attorney General Peter Neronha pushed back on the claim.

‚ÄúWhat we often hear when we are proposing new legislation is we‚Äôre turning law-abiding citizens into criminals,‚Äù Neronha said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what this legislation does and it‚Äôs not what any previous legislation has done.‚Äù

A spokesperson for R.I. House Speaker Joe Shekarchi said the speaker is keeping an open mind on the issue. After the bill is introduced, it will be assigned to a committee and the public will have the opportunity to testify.

‚ÄúLike all legislation that comes before the Senate, this proposal will receive an extensive review through the committee process,‚Äù Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said.

In 2022, McKee signed three high-profile gun control measures into law, including the ban on high-capacity magazines containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition and raising the age to buy a gun or ammunition from 18 to 21.",1675209624

"SisterWives","t5_2zkgl","Fair enough. 

I will say the distance is not a reason or assumption for her only seeing him ""exactly"" twice. They are 8 hours apart. Myy step son was 12 hours from us and we had him at least 6 or 8 times,  a week at a time or in the summer we had him like 6-8 weeks. He was only about 9, maybe 10 when we started flying him-- every airline offers ""unaccompanied minor"" services and they are VERY strict with the kids, so it's very safe. And he was nowhere near as mature or sophisticated as Truely. But 8 hrs isn't even that hard of a drive, especially if they met halfway, which is what we did before we started flying him.  And we're just ordinary people. We don't have their money for plane tickets,  etc.  There's no reason she couldn't fly down there for a long weekend.  She was even homeschooled last year.  She could attend school from their house as easy as Christine's.  

So no...I don't agree that's a logical assumption at all.",1675209625

[https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/the-prehab-guys/id1447527674](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/the-prehab-guys/id1447527674)

For instance I strained my back playing last week, couldn't turn at all, every deep breath hurt my spine. I did the Prehab app middle back/thoracic spine class for 5 days and have pretty much a full recovery.

"NecroMerger","t5_5wudnp","I'd say your main goal is getting the tip stone skin for extra honeycomb next time (I use for either extra flower lvl up or extra hive for bee production if I am active) I believe it is doable. the necromerger skin might be too much. 

Next time after you get the skin try to get a other flower merge bees to lvl 2 around both with as many low hives then get the cheap hive, upgrade flower%/honey% once, get the next flower, then the last hive In the shop and upgrade flower% and honey% once again. Look at honey production you'll need 5,575,000 to get the max hive upgrade if you can get that in the remainer of the first day you can max hive upgrade as you go to extend how long you can afk and get another flower for day 2 (6 bees around it). I put tip stone and necromerger right below the top flower bottom left and the other flower below them taking up the whole left side  with 8 bees around first 2 flowers (right merger can be reversed) and the next flower would go 1 space away from the tip stone in between the two flowers in the middle for 6 bees to be placed around with max hives an merging getting extra bees for the new flower should have 5 hives possibly 6 in the beginning for extra bees but I found eventually you will need merging space. Make sure you only have 1 space for honeycombs (the 6th hive should be merged into having only 5 at this point) and if you can't merge and you have a honeycomb don't waste it wait till max maybe wait for hives to fill up some more so you can always have bees around flowers and max the honeycomb in like another 40 minutes

Another edit: day 2 would focus on damage maxing, extra flowers for possible 1 lvl 4 and 2 lvl 3 flowers (3 flower strat) shop buying the 10m hive might be out of reach without golden lily but flower and cheap hive aren't too crazy

f2p guide doesn't buy the 1m hive suprisingly and does 2 flower strat (I didn't make it). I say try to remember how many honeycombs you have near the end after black bar killing and spend it on flowers/a extra honeycomb or 2 early on for more bees.",1675209625

Looking now, I have closer to 40-50 guards, not 60..  I must have lost some from fights, because they're not as packed as they used to be..

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

2. If the eldest son has always shared his food with _both_ his younger siblings now withholding it from just the one who didn't clean up after him will absolutely, and frankly legitimately, feel like a punishment to an 11 year old. 

Sure, it's the son's food and he can choose to share it or not share it with whomever he likes. But singling out his sister because she didn't want to do his work for him is just _not very nice_. He could find some other way to thank his little brother that doesn't so overtly take something away from his sister.",1675209626

"france","t5_2qhjz","La partie ""financement"", n'est pas tr√®s s√©rieuse.

Je prends toujours le temps de lire pour garder un esprit ouvert. Ils expliquent avoir besoin de 55 milliards d'euros par an pour financer ce programme dans les premi√®res ann√©es (ils oublient de pr√©ciser qu'il faudra *beaucoup* plus ensuite, avec le vieillissement, mais oublions ce point pour l'instant).

Sur ces 55 milliards, ils parlent de r√©cup√©rer 10 milliards en augmentant les cotisations patronales. M√™me s'il y a ""patron"" dans le mot, c'est une simple augmentation du co√ªt du salari√© pour un m√™me salaire per√ßu. L'augmentation du co√ªt du travail a un effet direct, largement document√©, sur le ch√¥mage. La hausse du ch√¥mage r√©duit les recettes fiscales et augmente les d√©penses sociales. Moins de ch√¥mage, c'est au final davantage de cotisations puisque les ch√¥meurs ne cotisent pas et g√©n√®rent des d√©penses sociales additionnelles.

Ils disent ensuite que ""l'avancement de l‚Äô√¢ge de d√©part √† la retraite se traduirait par des √©conomies sur les allocations ch√¥mage et les prestations sociales de 3.6 milliards"". Je v√©rifie pas le chiffre, on va dire ok pour √ßa.

Ensuite, on parle de 28 milliards gr√¢ce √† des hausses de salaires obligatoires (augmentation du SMIC, qui est la base de nombreux salaires fix√©s √† x% du smic, donc m√©canique d'augmentation g√©n√©rale). Sauf que pareil, hausse du SMIC = augmentation du ch√¥mage. C'est une d√©cision politique d√©fendable d'augmenter le SMIC, mais il faut √™tre s√©rieux et prendre en compte le corollaire de la destruction d'emplois, qui g√©n√®re des d√©penses sociales importantes. Ces d√©penses ne sont pas comptabilis√©es, alors qu'elles r√©duiraient probablement fortement les 28 milliards √©voqu√©s, voire les annuleraient.

Le sujet principal de la r√©forme des retraites, *c'est* le financement. Pourtant, seules 2 pages sur les 40 de ce document y sont consacr√©es, et c'est davantage de la posture politique que du d√©tail financier. On retrouve la th√©matique de ""l'argent y'en a"", dite aussi ""argent magique"" qui est courante dans les discours de LFI.

A contrario, la th√®se du gouvernement est qu'il faut minimiser le ch√¥mage pour assurer un bon financement du syst√®me social. Le ch√¥mage des jeunes est pass√© de 26% √† 19% pendant le mandat par exemple, notamment gr√¢ce aux aides √† l'alternance. On peut rappeler aussi que le gouvernement a notamment augment√© fortement la prime d'activit√© (pour aider les travailleurs pauvres, jusqu'√† 400 ‚Ç¨ / mois, et √©viter les situations o√π travailler ne vaut pas la peine), et a aussi augment√© le minimum vieillesse. La r√©forme des retraites est dans le m√™me esprit : travailler plus longtemps pour garantir l'√©quilibre et augmenter les plus petites pensions.

Bref : r√©former les retraites, c'est difficile et n√©cessaire. Je suis pas d'accord avec la m√©thode du gouvernement, et la solution des 64 ans est peut-√™tre pas la bonne, mais il faut trouver de quoi √©quilibrer le syst√®me. En revanche, vendre 60 ans aux gens sans r√©duire les pensions ni augmenter les cotisations, c'est se moquer du monde.",1675209627

Drivers aren't happy because they make garbage money to have to hustle constantly to make ends try to meet, using their own vehicle and incurring the miles themselves, not to mention gas.

Restaurants aren't happy because of the fees DoorDash charges them. Maybe a McDonalds can afford lower margins in exchange for higher volume because they're a behemoth, but your local restaurants, already one of the hardest businesses to turn a profit in, can't afford the lower margin. Already hard enough to keep employees paid and the lights on.

DoorDash isn't happy because even though they're the middleman pocketing the fees, as a company, they were only profitable one quarter of existence and lose hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Turns out being a leech isn't that profitable after all. Raise fees to make a profit? You lose customers. No easy solution or way out.

Meaning we won't colonize anybody.

&gt; Because it was rare and difficult to obtain, but in this situation, there will be a much bigger market. 

Nukes are not a commodity, they won't become any cheaper because the market gets bigger. Terrorists won't get those resources ever.

&gt; I think we are heading towards a world where Western sanctions will matter less and less as time passes. As we have already got most of the world to hate us, our only option to realistically scare a country off is to threaten to invade them. We already have pushed so many major economies to divest themselves from the West that us sanctioning someone will just lead to them selling to trading with someone else.

So long as we are the first economic power of the world, the fact that we are no longer overwhelmingly powerful doesn't mean we are not still exceedingly powerful. We don't need to invade anyone for that.

Anyway all of this is irrelevant to the current subject, which is enabling other countries to obtain independance from Russia.",1675209628

I‚Äôm not saying he was a jerk for trying to go back on the terms of their deal after the fact - he put a bad taste in my mouth about him being open to doing the game adaptations, but then badmouthing them and being openly resentful of them only because they were more successful than he thought games could be. The main posts on this thread are defending him for being so neutral with the Netflix abomination, but he wasn‚Äôt neutral about CDPR at all - he was positive about the actual product, then it did well and he got jealous and resentful and trash talked it and said it was for idiots, and then he sued them for a bigger cut of it and then went back to quiet about it.

The games brought a ton of people into Witcher fandom and they introduced a ton of people to his books. He‚Äôs been asked about it in interviews and he has been openly resentful of that idea, like he‚Äôs legitimately bothered by/jealous of his own IP‚Äôs success in an area other than the original books.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's weird because POC being most often victimized by fellow POC is irrelevant to the discussion of self-defense. it was including race without race needing to be included. Whether a POC is attacking a POC or non-POC, the issue of self-defense is the focus. Not who is attacking who, but that anybody is being attacked at all. Are POC attacked more? yes. Does it matter who attacks them more? Not in the slightest.

That isn't ""a lot of it"". That's the incredibly vocal smaller amount of gun owners in the US, the ones that are sensationalized because their rhetoric is ridiculous. 

The CCW-murder rate is not comparable to China or Russia because neither allow a legal process of carrying a weapon. 

i didn't include suicides, and murder suicides are counted as murders in any statistic (i.e., one person murdered and one suicide, so only the murder is counted in the murder). If you even clicked on any of the 3 or 4 sources I included, you'd have seen that. 

The last statement is dependant on where those ""gun-nuts"" are. But those gun nuts make up a very small amount of gun owners. [2% of gun owners own more than 50% of the total guns in the US](https://fortune.com/2016/09/19/us-gun-ownership/). Given that only 30% of Americans own a firearm, you are talking about less than 0.006% of the US population. They aren't the ones committing anywhere near a statistically significant percentage of murders, either.  So you are truly complaining about an *incredibly* small amount of owners. The average firearm owner has one firearm, and it's for self-defense.",1675209628

What likely happened is she marked the box you can check plagiarism with as a seperate assignment, meaning that once you submitted your draft, it was entered into the system. Then, you turned in the final draft with a seperate box. And perhaps even beyond that, if there was an option for her to mark assignments as being part of the same class, the software probably looks more closely at assignments within that class, to make sure students aren't cheating off each other in the same class. What she should have done was allow you to resubmit on the same assignment, so you can do the plagiarism check and then resubmit for your final draft. All on the same box. That way it wouldn't check between your multiple submissions.

"CPAP","t5_2s99h","On SleepHQ you can go to a particular day and use the Share Link button to generate a non-personally-identifyable graph/chart of that nights's activity. One of the key graphs you're going to be looking at is the Pressure graph.

For instance, check out this crappy night for me:

https://sleephq.com/public/020dd489-15e1-4622-8c83-70176bc3e321

* Ignore the big gap in there, as well as the time of day, and look to the far right of it.
* That night, I had my pressure set from 7 to 11. Why? I had some gassy discomfort for a few nights and thought it was pressure related, so I messed with my settings, but it turned out it was humidity level related. 
* You'll notice that even though I start at a 7, I immediately jump up to a 8 or 9. That tells me my minimum pressure of 7 is too low.
* Now notice how throughout the night, during my apnea events, my pressure is pegged at the max of 11. 
* That tells me my machine wants to give me more pressure to help with my apneas, but since I told it to max out at 11, it won't go any higher. Meanwhile I'm getting terrible therapy because the air being shoved down my nose isn't enough.

Now, check out this graph:

https://sleephq.com/public/74826193-7094-4dfb-a540-4cff28a884c3

* I'm now set to a minimum of 11, maximum of 20.
* Notice how my pressure goes up and down, but seems to settle at a minimum of around 11.1 to 11.8. That tells me my minimum pressure is set properly. I probably could go down to 10, but I don't have any discomfort or mask leakage if I'm at 10 or 11. So mine as well keep it at 11.
* Note how earlier in the evening I jump up to 17+, and then the rest of the night I'm more in the 12 to 14 range. Sure, I can probably optimize it further and set my max pressure to 18, because I rarely go above 18.... but again I'd rather have Max set to 20 to give me that extra burst of wiggle room if I need it.
* Finally note my AHI is much lower with these settings because again, the machine has the ""room to move"" that I didn't give it before with my 7 to 11 (or 5 to 15!) settings.

You should also sign up for a forum account over at cpaptalk.com - they're experts (not doctors, but long term CPAP users!) in there with some people helping new CPAP users out for years and with thousands of posts.

Of course like anything the big caveat is that I am NOT a doctor and not even really an expert on this. I just have learned to read my graphs and that quick analysis of a couple weeks of data has helped keep my AHI below 2, and often below 1.0. I learned how to analyze the data myself with help from cpaptalk and also because my sleep doctor's next availability was months away and I didn't want to have shitty sleep while waiting for them to look at this same data.",1675209629

Honestly, not being able to afford something is not a shameful behaviour, everyone's financial condition and lifestyle is different, learn to be happy with what you have or you'll forever be ashamed of not having enough. 

For sharing personal stuff with your friends... You can ask yourself if it ticks everything below, and add on any other worries to the list. 

1. Are you comfortable with telling them? Sometimes relationship changes and they may no longer be friends with you, and now hold a deep personal secret about you. 

2. Are they comfortable knowing it? Some people just want to be friends that connect up to a certain depth, and don't want to know or be involved in personal and family related issues because these issues should go to a professional, like a family/personal therapist. 

3. Do they have the maturity and capacity to listen and offer support?

There is also the issue of inconsistent purity and the too frequent combination with alcohol and cigarrettes, which increase the risk of a cardiac event like 10 fold together. If you don't have any heart issues, and don't die from your first line, all you have to do to not have a heart attack is to always source the best purest gear you can find, start low, weight a dose on a scale when you're home so you can eyeball it more precisely on the go, don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes and don't redose if your heart is going fast or in pain. You don't really see 70 year old recreational meth (or, lol, pyrovalerones) users around (at least not living a normal life), but I've met many older people that still use cocaine weekly or so and they're not dead or psychotic. They are ""normal"" functioning members of society. Compared to most of the shit cathinones like hexen and NEP, and especially all the fucking pyros it is far less dangerous, more predictable and all the harms it causes are known.

&gt;Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking.  
I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.

The strategy I'm laying out is that you would extract the ovum of the female prisoners and have them fertilized by a male slave you don't care for. You then implant the embryos back into the immobile female prisioners. The resulting babies born can then be adopted into the colony and placed into a growth vats until they grow into children and can be useful. 

Wether they die either from being a casualty of war or from harvesting their organs, or from having their brain RIP scanned, the only negatives you would get would be a minor one for losing a colonists as their mother is incapable of moving and their father was disposable. You also have the benefit of not having any of your colonists having to deal with the effects of being pregnant themselves or risk losing a child if the mother  is one of your combat colonists.

With the new nutrient paste mod, you can place a dispenser right next to the prisoner's bed so your colonists don't even need to interact with them until it's time to harvest. Before you ask, the milkable colonist mod doesn't work for this strategy as it seems to be incompatible with Biotech.

Typically on the ram there's only one clip on top.

So when you insert the ram you want it to click in both the top and bottom even thought the bottom won't have a clip.   Add a little pressure and it will go in.

Also it's really important for you to update the bios for you computer to work properly.  There are many cpu microcode, stability, and compatibility updates.  It's literally too much to list.  So even if you get your ram in properly, it might throw a code due to the bios update.

Also make sure you run the intel assist below, it will update all intel drivers, but more importantly the Z690 intel chipset driver.

"Capitalism","t5_2qiyc","Surviving capitalism is not innate, surviving as a species is... just because we have survival instincts doesn't mean our bodies and brains are physically and mentally equipped to withstand ""working"" by the standards of Capitalism. Many studies show the standard 40hr a week is harmful.

&gt;Yeah you are just wrong. Capitalism is a system built of the free market. To sum it up, capitalism is basically a theory of how the free market applies to us as humans.

This doesn't counter that capitalism is not a natural system. 

&gt;The free market is a natural system. It is the most natural of systems there is to the human state.

This also does not either. Your previous paragraph refutes it being a natural system. LMAO


&gt;Capitalism is not a government, and enforces no will upon humans. It simply allows humans to be humans.

LMAO, how old are you?

&gt;Systems such as socialism will never work because it does not allow for this, which is why it is only a good on paper. At its core it denies the fundamental traits that make us human. It morally robs humans of their free will and individualism. Further, it will always create a ruling class and a poor class, because of this fundamental issue that doesn‚Äôt work off paper.

What parent brainwashed you? I literally quoted Einstein who made the same implication with Capitalism. He actually makes a great stance, you should read 'why socialism?'. If you can't refute Einstein, then don't parrot red scare narrative. Lol

&gt;However, even under capitalism, you have the ability to create a commune of people that does this, and are willing to sign that agreement, sacrifice their freedoms for the good of the community. You can go and do this if you want, capitalism is not stopping you

It isn't stopping anyone but that's not what socialist want, let alone democratic socialist, they want to help those who are affected structurally by capitalism, or the planet. You know what the free market doesn't fix. 

&gt;Also to your point about how it is destroying the planet: capitalism is the reason we have renewable energy, electric cars, the incredible advancements in medicine and cures for diseases. So you are mostly wrong there.

No. When it is profitable for the corporations, to be on the side of preserving the planet, then yes. But many corporations only just started to recently be environmentally friendly because that's what consumers demand.

[Greenwashing is the process of conveying a false impression or misleading information about how a company‚Äôs products are environmentally sound. Greenwashing involves making an unsubstantiated claim to deceive consumers into believing that a company‚Äôs products are environmentally friendly or have a greater positive environmental impact than they actually do.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp)

People complain about evil things that evil characters do and say - and I wonder what part of evil they don't understand.

(1) I make a cup of tea. 

(2) I add honey to the tea (because honey reminds me of bees, and bees remind me of busyness and productivity).

(3) I wave a small wasp‚Äôs nest (which also reminds me of bees even though they‚Äôre completely different animals) over the cup of tea in a hexagonal shape (more bee-ness) while I say this three times: ‚ÄúI am focused. I am productive.‚Äù I *must* say it out loud, or it won‚Äôt work. 

If you don‚Äôt have a wasp‚Äôs nest handy‚Äîbecause, I mean, *really*‚Äîyou could use anything that suggests ‚Äúbees‚Äù to you. So, a Honey Nut Cheerio. A honey dipper. A Burt‚Äôs Bees chapstick. Whatever.

""what will you be doing when you're 80 years old? squabbling with you? wouldn't that be nice""

barba comforting liv when noah is kidnapped and her actually feeling comfortable enough to break down around him when she wouldn't usually

the way he looks at her when he comes to check on her after noah is back, and then noah calls him uncle rafa which hints that he's there a lot more than we see

barba being mad pissy and jealous about liv and tucker boning

every time liv calls him ""rafa"" in a super emotionally charged way

barba being willing to take on cases he shouldn't because liv ~impairs his judgement~

liv finding him at forlini's bar the first time because she knows him so well and he's sooo predictable

the colours speech when barba left the show which was basically him telling liv he loves her without actually saying it imo (i know some people believe barba loves liv romantically but not the other way around which i can understand) and THE FOREHEAD KISS!!!!

all that being said i'm perfectly content with barson only existing in my mind and fanfiction and EO getting their endgame, as long as liv and barba make up as friends before the show ends because it'd be a massive disservice to them to allow it to end the way it has so far",1675209632

Can your move the modem closer to that wall outlet and use a shorter cable? You can probably log into your modem by entering the  IP address of the modem (usually something like 192.168.x.x) and logging in with the user name and password that should be printed on a label on the bottom or back of the modem. You can then see, by navigating around the menus, what your signal levels are. There are well-known standards for what those signal levels should be that you can find on a place like Wikipedia. If your signal levels are not within the range in the standards, your only solution is to call your internet service provider. What speed have you signed up for?",1675209633

There are very, very few people who I trust to prepare food for him. A lot of the time when we go to family parties we bring his own food and maybe have him eat from selected shared dishes (a cheese board, veggies and dip, stuff with few ingredients to avoid cross contamination). It sucks but it‚Äôs our reality and we make the best of it. 

I would have been touched if you had sourced a celiac-safe meal for him. 

However, I would like to offer some grace to the parents. I think they overreacted but I think few people understand how isolating it can be to have kids with these kinds of conditions. As parents we are constantly running around working our butts off in the background so our kids can have normal challenges. It‚Äôs exhausting. I have definitely had moments where I was upset for my son because I feel bad that he can‚Äôt eat like everyone else.

So, if dark matter is supposedly evidence of a lack of creation (according to your model), and creation does not need dark matter to exist then in your view this should be inconsequential. That makes it not evidential. In the scientific view, dark matter has an existenciality that we cannot define at the moment, so it is also inconsequential for our view.

"DirtySnapchat","t5_2vuxw","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines here:
&gt;    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

[Nota Original](https://verificado.com.mx/circula-imagen-falsa-movilidad-taxis/) | Reducido en un 31.32%

*****

&gt; En redes sociales se ha difundido una imagen supuestamente publicada por la Secretar√≠a de Movilidad y Planeaci√≥n Urbana de Nuevo Le√≥n que informa a todos los taxistas que no pueden rechazar carreras cortas, ni cobrar tarifas m√≠nimas, pero esto es falso.   

&gt; Las y los usuarios han detectado diversas irregularidades como el rechazo de los taxistas a las carreras largas pues algunos √∫nicamente aceptan carreras cortas que cobran entre 35 y 40 pesos.   

&gt; De acuerdo con un ejercicio realizado por El Norte, un taxi de TPA cobr√≥ 700 pesos a los periodistas que viajaron desde la Terminal A, en Apodaca, hasta G√≥mez Mor√≠n y Alfonso Reyes, en la Colonia Jer√≥nimo Siller, en San Pedro.   

&gt; Otro viaje que realizaron fue desde el Aeropuerto hasta Paseo de los Leones y Pedro Infante, en la Colonia Cumbres Las Palmas Residencial, en Monterrey.   

&gt; El n√∫mero para realizar un reporte que aparece en la imagen difundida en redes tambi√©n es incorrecto, por lo que para levantar cualquier queja sobre alguna anomal√≠a, desperfecto y mal manejo vehicular del servicio que ofrece el transporte p√∫blico de Nuevo Le√≥n, como¬† son camiones urbanos, transportes escolares y taxis son los siguientes:   Por Liliana El√≥seguiUn mensaje distribuido a trav√©s de WhatsApp alertaba a usuarios sobre un supuesto ""hackeo"" en el portal del Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria...   Por Leslie OrozcoEn Twitter, se populariz√≥ una fotograf√≠a que supuestamente muestra a un grupo de mujeres encapuchadas fuera de las instalaciones del Partido Revolucionario...

You can grab the CPU/RAM from Micro Center. Yes, the RAM is free.

* CPU - one of the fastest on the market, making it great for gaming and modelling. It also has 8c/16t for longevity. Be sure to enable Eco mode, which greatly reduces your temps and power draw at the cost of a tiny bit of performance.
* Cooler - looks great, reliable, performs well. Top mount as exhaust.
* Mobo - high quality with all the connectivity you need, including WiFi/BT. If you can find this or the [Gigabyte Aero G](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bCjBD3/gigabyte-b650-aero-g-atx-am5-motherboard-b650-aero-g) at Micro Center, you get $20 off.
* RAM - free. 32 GB of fast 6000 MHz CL36 RAM.
* SSD - 2 TB of fast Gen 4 NVMe SSD storage.
* GPU - the RX 4080 is good for 4K gaming and will give you a smooth viewport in 3D modelling.
* Case - good build quality with top tier airflow and easy cable management. This case comes with 3 fans and fits the aesthetic perfectly.
* PSU - high quality with fully modular white cables to minimize cable clutter. 850W is perfect for these components, if not slightly overkill, so it'll operate quietly.
* Fan - extra for rear exhaust.

I was lucky enough to get a job with the first Austrian job I applied for, it was a very senior manager role and the interview process was similar to UK accept it was 100% remote.  I had a screen with HR, an interview with my boss and finally a sanity check with C-level,   They did say at the end that the middle interview was one of the longest interviews they had done but that reflected the importance of the role to them.  I didn't meet my team in person for 6 months.

I interviewed others while in the role and speaking with HR it was a standard process, we even used common application tools with minimal configuration and most of them are American cloud providers. 

I changed job after two years and secured another senior IT job and it was pretty much the same process.

Both my roles were adversied and recruited in English as a lot of companies use this as an internatiional language,  I never had to learn Austrian.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) ‚Äî A bill that would ban the sale of assault-style weapons in Rhode Island was introduced Tuesday.

Gov. Dan McKee and other state leaders held a news conference formally announcing the legislation that would ban the sale, manufacture, and transfer of assault weapons.

‚ÄúI want to say this loud and clear: Rhode Island is ready for an assault weapons ban to help keep our communities safe,‚Äù McKee said. ‚ÄúAs governor, I‚Äôm ready to sign that bill into law.‚Äù

Violators would face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $10,000 and the guns would be confiscated.

Gun rights advocate Brenda Jacob, of the Rhode Island Revolver and Rifle Association, said the state is using law-abiding citizens as pawns in the issue.

‚ÄúThey keep saying, promoting how they want everyone to feel safe in their home,‚Äù Jacob said. ‚ÄúWell you know what? I feel safer with a firearm in my home.‚Äù

Watch: McKee and other local leaders announce the bill (Story continues below.)

R.I. Attorney General Peter Neronha pushed back on the claim.

‚ÄúWhat we often hear when we are proposing new legislation is we‚Äôre turning law-abiding citizens into criminals,‚Äù Neronha said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what this legislation does and it‚Äôs not what any previous legislation has done.‚Äù

A spokesperson for R.I. House Speaker Joe Shekarchi said the speaker is keeping an open mind on the issue. After the bill is introduced, it will be assigned to a committee and the public will have the opportunity to testify.

‚ÄúLike all legislation that comes before the Senate, this proposal will receive an extensive review through the committee process,‚Äù Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said.

In 2022, McKee signed three high-profile gun control measures into law, including the ban on high-capacity magazines containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition and raising the age to buy a gun or ammunition from 18 to 21.",1675209635

"productivity","t5_2qh1k","I am sorry to hear about your rough year. I totally get how that devolved into a bad mental state.

Getting depressed impacts your hippocampus, makes it harder for you to remember things, and impacts your focus. It also impacts your motivation, which normally would help your focus. Depression makes you tired which compromises your cognition. All of these things contribute to brain fog and can last a while after your mood starts to recover.

Some suggestions: 

1) make sure you go to bed at a reasonable hour and when you go to bed, put your electronics elsewhere and try to sleep properly, since the effects of sleep deprivation look a lot like mild cognitive impairment. (A lot of depressed people have difficulty sleeping so they get into the bad habit of being on electronics in the night, which makes things worse).

2) try to make yourself get out of the house and exercise (ideally in a social situation, like a class). Being with people and exercising both fight depression.

If you can't do those things, then as a last resort you could try antidepressants for a few months. I say as a last resort because they can be hard to get off of, and side effects, sleep problems, and depression, when you try to, but if you literally cannot make yourself do what you need to do, then the boost they could provide might be what you need to jump start a move in the right direction.

If your problem currently is more brain fog than depression, then another option would be methylphenidate, which could allow you to focus and clear that fuzzy-headed feeling. Definitely not here to push drugs, just trying to list reasonable options, Your ultimate goal has to be good habits (sleep, exercise, being off electronics) but those can be difficult to establish without help.",1675209636

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","Bub was 3 months old when we had to move- one neighbour had a business that involves large trucks rumbling by our bedroom window and music being blared from their shed all day long. The other side had kids that love to party every holiday and one was given a kiddie motorbike that gets driven round everyday in their yard. We were renting and had the option to move‚Ä¶ hunting a new rental with an infant in tow, rental applications plus packing up was just so stressful. Bub hated the sound of tape being rolled out too and cried like crazy- so we couldn‚Äôt pack when he was awake either and sleep was sacred since noisy neighbours can disrupt it easily. Had to resort to pre making the boxes while hubby went out with bub for a walk. 

Can I suggest asking for help when you need to unpack? Can hubby go out with bub or some friends/relatives can stay with bub? 

My priority when moving in was for beds to be set up (bubs crib etc too) food ready on the day or some easy takeout so you don‚Äôt have to cook. Toiletries for the bathroom packed/handy so you can have a quick shower at the end of the day and plonk on the bed‚Ä¶",1675209636

"AskACobbler","t5_2x3bs","Thanks. I actually got to see a pair of boots from this company in person which cemented my decision to buy them. I asked around extensively. Unfortunately there are a lot more people that can answer questions about World War II stuff than anything prior to 1920.

Since it was about 9 months after the purchase that the boots finally arrived my credit card was unable to do anything. I have dropped my bank after receiving (or not) two other items that they were unwilling to accept as the fault of the vendor. Once with a leather jacket that was actually made out of thin cotton twill, and another time with a vendor who was able to prove that he shipped my item twice to the wrong address, almost a thousand miles away.

Looks like I'm back to buying custom boots on a one to two year waiting list. Unfortunately I'm trying to replace items that were lost in a fire, and unfortunately on some purchases I've also been burned in my need to rejoin my reenacting community in full uniform.

Because promises to do shit do not mean shit, and when they blow up in your face you need the cash to pay to replace them with professional help, and to compensate for the rest of the nightmare like lost career advancement, lower retirement savings, physical issue recovery, etc. etc.

However, it is possible if you are using dd-wrt firmware or Asus Merlin firmware or Asus-wrt firmware with AX model with wireguard client by excluding that device not to go through wireguard tunnel (which also means that your vpn server traffic will go through your ISP but you can use Quad9 DNS with no logging IP addresses). 

If this is what you are looking for you need to open one port number on your ISP router which would be the router address (assuming your server is behind the personal router) and same port number you need to forward on your personal router as well.

All you need is IP address (private IP) of the vpn server and port number it is running on. If you are running dd-wrt firmware let me know I can help you with screenshots.

I am sure you are aware port forwarding is little risky but you can tight your firewall rules on your vpn server plus making a list of allowed IP's. It is a bit of work but once it is done, you will appreciate your smart work :)",1675209637

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","0.7% is not that large of a margin of error. It's only interesting in this case because the point estimate is so close to 0, so the error bar crosses 0. But in the grand scheme of the distribution of likely outcomes, it gives you a meaningful idea of where you might end up. Will the UK grow by 10% next year? Almost certainly not. Will it grow by 0.4%? Could be. Will it shrink by 0.8%? Also could be. That's not useless information. It's only people who are not comfortable talking in probabilities who seem to struggle with this consistently.

Econometrics and regressions rely not only on good data but on a data-generating process in reality that doesn't have an error component and that's not how the world works. So a model takes a functional form, applies the data you have, and tells you your estimate and your uncertainty around it. That's extremely useful. The IMF doesn't know exactly where the UK's growth will land but is reasonably confident that it will be lower than, say, China's. It's not simply flipping a coin between equally likely outcomes.",1675209637

"Hilton","t5_30g76","I honestly have very little experience with the restaurants but can shed some light on the different room products. There are so many good choices in and around Waikiki though, so I wouldn't let on-property restaurants sway your decision much.

Rainbow Tower is the iconic tower with the rainbow mural, but probably the most dated rooms (I believe 2011). Speaking of romance, I proposed to my now-wife on the balcony of a 31st floor Rainbow Tower oceanfront room after the Friday night fireworks.

Ali'i Tower (Hawaiian for ""chief"") is the most premium tower with exclusive pool and amenities including yukata robes. If it was its own hotel it would probably be a Conrad. I think it was last renovated in 2013.

Tapa Tower leans into to a more native aesthetic based on old Hawaiian tapa cloth which is made from pounded tree bark. These rooms are the most recently renovated (2019) and second in ""premiumness"" to Ali'i.

Kalia Tower and Diamond Head Tower are the ""basic"" towers and they are the run of house rooms. When booking online if the room doesn't name one of the three towers above, it's likely in one of these two based on availability.",1675209638

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was drinking every single day after work. My mom died and I just didn‚Äôt feel like doing anything. Literally parked my truck on the on ramp and sat on the tailgate with a case of beer drinking and smashing the bottles on the road, picking up the glass and slicing my arm in front of stopped cars, completely fucking stupid and out of line for me since I‚Äôve never even thought of hurting myself but for some reason that night I was just fed up. Antagonizing truck drivers trying to get on the interstate hoping someone would call the cops cause I wanted to do something stupid. Somehow no one called, usually there‚Äôs 2 sheriff cars parked at the bank and this night there wasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt even know how I got home but I woke up in my driveway. A couple weeks later went to a friends house and got hammered, drank a whole bottle of Jameson in the middle of January and decided I was riding my bike home. Didn‚Äôt let off the throttle at all until I got to my exit, pulled in my driveway and just fell over, I couldn‚Äôt even hold the bike up. Just laid there in the driveway for a couple hours, woke up freezing and went inside to let my dog out. I realized I was crazy lucky and I stopped pushing my luck and actually quit for a while.  Then a couple months later I backslid and I did it again, left a local MC clubhouse that I used to be associated with and flipped my truck on the interstate on the way home. My fianc√©e just happened to be leaving her friends house and getting on the interstate the exact time I flipped my truck because we were gonna meet back up at home, she saw the whole thing happen. When I crawled out of my upside down truck and walked up the bank back to the interstate I saw a car parked on the shoulder with the hazards on and wondered how someone stopped so fast and realized it was her. The look in her eyes made me feel like a piece of shit. No seat belt on, no license, had a gun in the truck and it flew out the window over a fence into the golf course. The state trooper that showed up said if they found the gun then I‚Äôd be getting felony charges for handling a fire arm while intoxicated. Thankfully the golf course wouldn‚Äôt let them on the property since it didn‚Äôt happen on property. A whole shit storm because I thought it would be okay the drive home. Haven‚Äôt drank since and I went to some court ordered classes, planning on going to a counselor just don‚Äôt want to dump my shit on someone who only talks to me because they‚Äôre paid to. Many more stories to go along with that, like going to bars and fighting and getting kicked out, pulling a gun on someone in the middle of a crowded bar, but the drinking on the on ramp and flipping my truck is what really opened my eyes. Still want to drink everyday but I don‚Äôt, no friends anymore cause they all want to go out. Pretty shitty life if you ask me, not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt want to stop and get beer on my way home from work. That‚Äôs a lot of baggage for a 25 year old. Shits looking up though, I see a light at the end of the tunnel.",1675209638

The issue I have is that it‚Äôs a game and if you were able to get the best content in the game for 500 or a 1000 then that would be a lot but acceptable to many people. EA are just ripping the ring and literally want people to spend tens of thousands on a game which they drop like a ton of bricks every August. There are people that spend literally hundreds of thousands on this game. Obviously they have the money, but it has made it acceptable for EA to try and suck every cent from people. I think their business practices are disgusting and they are not held to the same account as casinos and so on, and it really is just gambling for the most part.

 The nurses repeatedly told me they would rather I come in and find nothing than have me sit at home worrying. 

The lady I was next to had presented with pain three times only to be sent home, but she persisted. The last time they decided to do serial blood tests and found out she had a non-typical presentation of HELLP and could have died. She had a c-section the next day at 36w and I'm still thinking about her, hoping it all went okay.

I liked the dress, but didn't like the man; that's because I'm a trans woman. 

Now, whether you think you'll look good* might have a bearing on whether you transition. You don't HAVE to transition. But that doesn't mean you're not trans.

Similarly, the best deterrents for the bully cat are ones that'd deter Nala too, like a sprinkler or spraying some kind of anti-cat substance on your part of the yard.

If you own the property and have some cheddar, you could look into fencing your part of the yard. I'm not familiar with what types of fences keep cats in/out, but there are ways of learning.",1675209640

So right before Christmas I stumbled upon Caps Authentic home blanks on the Adidas site for like $90 each (shoutout to the homie u/aramdom from r/Caps for the heads up).  I ordered three with the intention of having them customized for myself, my father and brother-in-law.  None of them are MiCs.  I barely know what that means and they definitely don't.  But I do know they're gonna freak out when they see the customization, knowing that it was made by the same people who do the work for the team.  It will be worth the time/money just for their excitement and the little story now attached to it.  Sometimes the total is greater than the sum of it's parts.

This SS sweater was an unplanned fluke.  I was already sending the home jerseys in to EPS, literally boxed up beside my desk just needing to submit the order.  I didn't even know the SS jerseys were dropping.  Then the fact that I could only find a blank just reinforced the decision, so in the box it goes with the rest.

I do appreciate the comment though all the same.  I am just beginning my time here so there will be plenty of time to seek out other talented shops!  Cheers!",1675209640

"cats","t5_2qhta","Blue buffalo recalls? I can only find stories from years ago about a voluntary dog food recall. I mostly feed my 8 kitties (ages 6 months(5), 1, 12, and 13 years) blue buffalo and tiki cat. They don't all always like what they get, but it's always good food that I feel good about giving them. If they skip one meal, they usually eat at the next. I do 2 wet food meals a day and free feed blue buffalo wilderness for all except my chonker. Don't worry about pleasing all your kitties. It's never going to happen. Find a good brand and try to to stick within that one and try different flavors. I've had good luck avoid tummy upset with that approach. I also like the weruva brand, but they don't have a ton of kitten foods. 

Depends on which ones you're using, but Iams seems to have a lot of corn, which can cause allergy issues in cats. I tend to go for grain free, but that's not totally necessary. Avoiding corn should be a priority, though. I've never liked hill's because so many of their foods have corn. I don't trust the brand. And I try to avoid Purina (which seems to own half the cat food aisle), too.. 

Other than blue buffalo, I like natural balance, but I don't think they have a kitten food. Also had a vet recommend farmina to my very sick cat last year, and I like that brand, too. Fromm was pretty good for my IBD kitty, too.

Learn to read ingredient labels. Learn about the protein percentages and such, and the differences for wet and dry foods. And don't be too afraid to experiment. If their tummy gets upset, they'll recover in a day or two. It's a long term project to find the right foods for so many cats. If all are healthy, it should be pretty straightforward.",1675209640

As long as you have a valid Aussie passport, and that passport does not expire for at least 6 months after the end &amp; return of your journey, then you‚Äôre good to go.  You can arrive in &amp; travel to Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland etc all those European countries for Shengen Visa, without having to get any visa before-hand.  Heck, most of those border crossings by train / bus they don‚Äôt even stop &amp; check anyone (unless they think you are smuggling illegal aliens or guns/drugs or whatever).

Make sure your ATM card has a Visa or MasterCard logo on the back so you can access money over there.  GO INTO YOUR BANK (any branch) and at the counter tell them you‚Äôre going overseas otherwise when the computers detect an unsual activity they‚Äôll shut your card off, suspecting scammers.

Was also S+ in Splatoon 1, also mostly with jet squelcher. I'm not as good as I used to be, but I'm also getting older.

My current abilities are:

Tenacity, for spamming ink vac more frequently. Unsure if special charge up would be better. Tenacity depends on you being alive while your teammates are dying, so if you have a good team, you don't benefit, but then you wouldn't really need the extra benefit on a good team. Special charge up requires consistent turfing, but your turfing rate can plummet while you move between anchor points or when you're just providing suppressing fire to keep opponents from advancing, as opposed to inking huge swathes of turf like at the start of a match.

Ink saver main (1 main slot), helps a lot when acting as an anchor, allows you keep inking a zone, shooting a rainmaker barrier, or maintaining suppressing fire. This is a no-brainer ability for this weapon. I tried going without it for a while and couldn't stand playing without it.

Object shredder. I recently started using this and I think it's probably helpful for taking out crabs and rainmaker barriers. Most other objects don't see a huge difference. I did once manage to just barely take out a booyah bomb user in midair, but I wouldn't say it's worth it to try most of the time.

Sub resistance up (3 sub slots). Anchors are frequently targeted with bombs and this helps with escape.

Ink resistance up (3 sub slots). Goes well with sub resist, helps escape from flankers, also speeds movement through enemy ink in order to use ink vac more offensively.

Ink saver sub (3 sub slots). Allows me to throw two consecutive angle shooters. Angle shooters are extremely good when spammed from good vantage points, especially with how frequently people seem to use ninja squid in this game compared to 2. The angle shooter can also be used to snipe opponents from across the map, splatting them if they are low on HP. I get 1-2 splats per match just from angle shooter.

This last point I want to emphasize. I don't see anyone else using angle shooter like this, and it's probably because, like me, they assumed the sub was trash and decided to just never use it. But after a month or so of that I decided to challenge myself to use it more frequently, so I put ink saver sub in some slots to see if I could notice the difference, and yes, I could. The angle shooter helps teammates take out flankers, it lets you splat distant damaged opponents, it's damage is a good opener against flankers or as a flanker, and it's also a good way to just annoy, intimidate, and generally throw off the other team. It's an especially good way to annoy long range chargers, as you can hit them from well outside their range and they will often attempt to reposition or at least hesitate while trying to determine if they were hit by a nearby flanker.

Thermal ink is a terrible choice for jet squelcher, the range needed for it to activate is way too short and it only tracks the enemy for you, not your teammates. It's also completely redundant since you already have the angle shooter.

Most of the tips on ink vac I agree with, except that I would recommend getting good at accurately aiming it at distant opponents, or anticipating where opponents will be in the couple seconds after you fire it. I often take out at least one anchor per match with a direct hit from the ink vac. It's a special that requires a fair amount of skill to use effectively, more than reefslider or big bubbler, but maybe not as much as zipcaster or crab (truly skilled crab users can trap a whole team at their base).

Another tip for ink vac is to fire directly at the rainmaker barrier to instantly burst it (if opponents haven't inked it), good for quick advances. It's also good to whip out the ink vac when you know you're going to get a lot of ink, e.g. in response to booyah bomb, trizooka, or triple inkstrike. Activate it at the right time and stand in the right place (close but not too close to booyah bombs or inkstrikes) and you'll pretty much instantly charge up 1/4 to 1/2 of the gauge. I also will sometimes fire at the ground underneath booyah bomb users who are still in the air, since by the time the missile hits and explodes, they'll have thrown their bomb and lost their ink armor.

I find that clam blitz is my strongest mode, or maybe second strongest. Since clam blitz requires players to roam around the map picking up clams, the jet squelcher's turfing efficiency makes a huge difference. You can also use the ink vac near the enemy clam basket to make an offensive push, advancing while sucking in ink, allowing teammates to come up from behind. A well placed missile from the ink vac can clear out a contested clam basket.

Rainmaker is another strong mode. With my long range and consistent fire, I can ink a path for the rainmaker carrier all the way to the checkpoint from well behind him. I try to signal this by mashing ""this way."" Sometimes he understands, stops firing defensively, and makes a beeline down my path to the checkpoint; very satisfying when this happens. Right after this I trigger my ink vac. If the enemy bursts the rainmaker barrier, I suck up a huge amount of it and charge up quickly, often allowing me to take out the new opposing rainmaker carrier, or his teammates. If my team manages to burst the barrier again, I take out stragglers, aim at the enemy base, or aim in such a way that the missile will ink a path for the rainmaker as it travels.

I almost never carry the rainmaker or a super clam myself, though. It's always better for a frontliner to do this so I can cover them.

Tower control is meh. Ink vac can be a very useful defense on the tower, but overall tower control is the mode most determined by how well your team can flank. I usually ride the tower and snipe and ink turf from it. I can't use my angle shooter as effectively though, the tower just isn't in very good spots for that for long. Ink vac is relatively useless against a tower claimed by an opponent. Sucking up their ink doesn't do much, and the missile is difficult to aim at the tower and is easily avoided by hiding behind the mast.

Splat zones is my weakest mode. I still do fine but it's just not very exciting and I don't feel like I'm contributing as much. Play is much more static, though this allows me to get a ton of angle shooter hits as usually the other team is also moving around less while focusing on inking the zone.

Turf wars. Eh, don't play it except during splatfests. Ink vac gets used a lot, especially aimed at the enemy base.

All in all, jet squelcher is a lot better this time around. I really didn't like being stuck permanently at the backline spamming tentamissiles and just hoping I'm being helpful. In 3 the jet squelcher is a lot more mobile and can take on more roles, it just can't do any of them as effectively as specialists. It's important to figure out which roles need to be filled and when. Sometimes this is easy. If I have a long range charger or splatling on my team, I move up to a more mid-range role most of the match. Other times you need to switch on the fly, like after wiping out the enemy team, now you need to move up real close and attempt to flank or at least distract.

Anyway, that's my experience. Hope this helps someone enjoy this weapon as much as I do.",1675209640

Is this what you think of teachers?

This is about childrens education that has been seriously disrupted over Covid years, truancy increasing and youth crime raising.

This isn't about ""babysitting"", getting kids to school is actually highly important.  Closing schools that aren't under any stresses disrupts routine, kids education and solidifies opinions from kids that going to school isn't actually that important.

"realityshifting","t5_4zf3c7","Juergen Ziewe does astral projecting and in his book, he talked about this place he went to where everyone knew him and he knew them too, even though he didn‚Äôt know them in this current reality. It was a project he was working on, and they hadn‚Äôt seen him for a long time. They told him he doesn‚Äôt show up often. He went back to the place again and again to do work. He thought it was an AP at first but realized it was his consciousness experiencing a parallel life. He didn‚Äôt use the word shifting because it wasn‚Äôt known at the time of his writing.

I am wondering if a lot of astral projecting is reality shifting. I think one of my APs might have been. I did not know about shifting at the time but looking back, it might have been a spontaneous one. I went to bed and woke up in a place I‚Äôd never been. Usually astral travel involves going from A to B. I didn‚Äôt experience any travel at all. It was not a dream as my dreams are always a bit fuzzy and make no sense. I know a redditor who goes to sleep every night to live another life. There he has a job and rents a place. He goes to sleep there and wakes up here. Back and forth. Like that episode in Amazon Prime‚Äôs Electric Dreams. The world he goes to is made of all kinds of creatures. He couldn‚Äôt tell me more because he said he would get into trouble. He says he astral projects but to me, it might be shifting. There might be a difference, but there might not be‚Ä¶

Also, some shifters experience years, even decades in their desired reality before returning. Lucid dreams don‚Äôt experience that length of time. They wake up shortly. This is another telltale difference.",1675209641

TLDR:  In the 1920s as automobiles made their appearance across the US, civilians were frequently hit (and killed) by this new technology.  It was shocking at the time, which caused attempts to either limit the speed of automobiles or ban them altogether.

It was the automobile industry that actually invented ""Jaywalking"" laws, in order to try and ""redefine"" the purpose of a street, which prior to vehicles were just kinda a public space (horses, people, cyclist all wandering around on them).

It was essentially the automobile industry lobbying for the law in order to protect its reputation and decrease civilian deaths.  The law stuck around, but isn't really enforced.

[Nota Original](https://verificado.com.mx/circula-imagen-falsa-movilidad-taxis/) | Reducido en un 31.32%

*****

&gt; En redes sociales se ha difundido una imagen supuestamente publicada por la Secretar√≠a de Movilidad y Planeaci√≥n Urbana de Nuevo Le√≥n que informa a todos los taxistas que no pueden rechazar carreras cortas, ni cobrar tarifas m√≠nimas, pero esto es falso.   

&gt; Las y los usuarios han detectado diversas irregularidades como el rechazo de los taxistas a las carreras largas pues algunos √∫nicamente aceptan carreras cortas que cobran entre 35 y 40 pesos.   

&gt; De acuerdo con un ejercicio realizado por El Norte, un taxi de TPA cobr√≥ 700 pesos a los periodistas que viajaron desde la Terminal A, en Apodaca, hasta G√≥mez Mor√≠n y Alfonso Reyes, en la Colonia Jer√≥nimo Siller, en San Pedro.   

&gt; Otro viaje que realizaron fue desde el Aeropuerto hasta Paseo de los Leones y Pedro Infante, en la Colonia Cumbres Las Palmas Residencial, en Monterrey.   

&gt; El n√∫mero para realizar un reporte que aparece en la imagen difundida en redes tambi√©n es incorrecto, por lo que para levantar cualquier queja sobre alguna anomal√≠a, desperfecto y mal manejo vehicular del servicio que ofrece el transporte p√∫blico de Nuevo Le√≥n, como¬† son camiones urbanos, transportes escolares y taxis son los siguientes:   Por Liliana El√≥seguiUn mensaje distribuido a trav√©s de WhatsApp alertaba a usuarios sobre un supuesto ""hackeo"" en el portal del Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria...   Por Leslie OrozcoEn Twitter, se populariz√≥ una fotograf√≠a que supuestamente muestra a un grupo de mujeres encapuchadas fuera de las instalaciones del Partido Revolucionario...

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","At least you are recognizing it when its the pain talking and not your mom. The voice may be the same, but the pain is in control.

Its a hard thing to explain this sort of pain to somebody without it. Its torture, a never ending hell on earth, and those are the good days. The worst part is you never get a break from it. That can make you old well before your time and want release more than anything else, even if its going to hurt those that you care about dearly.

She should be in some kind of psychological counseling for pain. With something like spina bifida she has probably been through something for coping since its long term without any real resolving. But not all counselors are worth a damn or even really understand pain, and treat us like regular cases, when the psychology of pain is incredibly complex. Bad therapy can put a patient off of counseling completely, doing more harm than good. But it would help if the right type of  treatment is provided by the right provider. You could also sit in on these appointments, it does help to have someone there who is seeing things on the outside. This is part of pain treatment so if your mom is seeing a pain specialist, they should be able to hook her up with somebody appropriate. If that doesnt pan out, you can try the Pain Connection (.org) page of the US Pain Foundation's website. Pain Connection has been doing this sort of thing for decades, finding people in pain the right counseling. I'd avoid any suggestion of a psychiatrist, its not really the right sort of medicine for this. Its not a chemical imbalance (more than likely) its overpowering and justified fatigue and frustration. 

One of the 1st things I'd bring up if you sit in is how you feel when you dont hear from your mom. I totally understand this concern, but its not always possible or practical (or desirable at times) to pick up the cellphone and you'd probably be feeling the same thing (maybe to a lesser extent) if your mom was in better health. That's something you need to address for yourself. We all get that phone call we dread eventually, hopefully it will be a lot of years between now and then but you need to consider the phone may not be charged first rather than it being something bad. You can drive yourself crazy worrying about that every time there's lack of a phone call.

I hope your mom starts feeling better about things soon. It can be one hell of a climb out of the rut of depression. I almost forgot to ask about the big thing, whats her pain relief like? Does she get adequate pain control? That is something that has been harder and harder to get over the last few years.With something like spina bifida and 36 surgeries that is a very big deal. If you find out her docs have been cutting back (or cutting off) any pain medication, its a pattern, but its so wrong every medical source agrees that its wrong. Its only the DEA, which has all physicians on a leash, and terrorist intimidation tactics that stand in the way of common sense pain management. If that's been happening, get in touch, I can provide you some medical information from those actual medical and government organizations that show how wrong they are. That would only change the mind of a doctor that cares about their patients, though. Some are not that way unfortunately. The so called opioid crisis has really damaged pain care and its amazing how many people either dont know or dont care what its done to legitimate pain patients like your mom. Its caused tens of thousands of pain suicides when doctors cut back or cut off pain relief, so your concern is warranted, but the only one here that knows how serious the depression is you. Find out if its a possibility before you go braking glass in case of emergency. Doctors get successfully sued for this as malpractice now, but the DEA is doing an incredible amount of direct and public intimidation. They are less afraid of a $7M settlement covered by sky high malpractice insurance than having their prescribing license revoked. Im saying this not to alarm you about your moms current mental state, but if you werent aware this was going on and many people arent, you should know. Changing doctors could make a world of difference. Best of luck to you both.",1675209643

So if we are thinking of alien maths, it's quite possible a central idea in our maths only appears in a couple of obscure alien papers. And likewise, the central ideas of their maths only appear in a few of our obscure papers. 

I would expect the aliens to have some important object that structurally resembled the reals in that it contained pi and root(2) and supported addition and multiplication. But there are many structures like this. The computable numbers. The surreals. The reals can be a countable union of countable sets if you remove the axiom of choice. There are many  many structures that agree on all the obvious numbers. Structures in which calculus can be made to work with at most a few minor technical changes. In that sense, our choice of the reals, out of all the similar structures, as the one to focus on, is somewhat arbitrary.",1675209643

I'll also do a self-care/cleansing ritual tomorrow for myself.

I've set up an altar in my favorite space.

We are having symbolic foods all week, or as close as I can get, to honor the holiday and Brigid.  Since I'm VERY much a kitchen witch, this is probably the most exciting for me :)

I've been taking extra note of the signs of spring and holding them in head and heart as I meditate.

My partner, left with mobility issues, speech impediments, memory loss, chronic fatigue, chronic migraines, aggressive mood swings and more after suffering 5 seizures and horrendous brain damage, did not qualify for disability because he wasn't disabled enough. 

He cannot leave the house unattended. He wakes in terror some mornings because he doesn't recognise me or the kids. He had a breakdown a few weeks ago, calling himself stupid and useless, because he couldn't remember how to tie his shoelaces. 
He cannot work. His career in security is over, he cannot risk any thumps to the head or it could kill him. 

Because there is a possibility of recovery, they denied him, despite the projected recovery time being upwards of 5 years. 

Five years to hopefully have him somewhat back to himself so he can try and feel normal again.

Five years of us fighting to keep him on ""long term illness"" payments that they keep trying to kick him off of. 

Five years for him to come back to us as much as he can.

Deshan thereupon returned to his room.  
Xuefeng told Yantou about this. Yantou said, ""Even the great Deshan doesn't understand the last word.""  
When Deshan heard this reported, he had an attendant call Yantou to him. He asked, ""You don't approve of me?"" Yantou secretly expressed his meaning.  
The next day Deshan gave a talk that was not the same as his usual talk. Yantou clapped and laughed in front of the hall, saying, ""Happily the old fellow in the hall understands the last word! Hereafter no one in the world will be able to oppose him. Even so, he only has three years.""

And while these may be possible to obtain in this universe, in other, decidedly more mundane jumps it may truly be impossible. But now you no longer need to fear such things, instead you have the know-how and ability to gather impossible ingredients for your impossible creation no matter where you are.

Download maps.me. and the map of CR. Free, offline navigation. Even has hiking trails on it. Works very good. People recommand Waze. I have them both. Maps.me works great. If u have data‚Ä¶Waze is also decent.  

Pay in Colones. Usually cheaper then the same item in dollars.  

Eat in Soda‚Äôs. Local restaurants. They are good. 

Def do a night tour with a guide. Most frogs u want to spot are nocturnal. 

Manuel Antonio u have to buy your entry ticket online in advance. 

Usually 13% tax and 10% tip comes on the bill in restaurants. The 10% tip is mandatory by law by the way. So check the menu. It will say if tax is already added or not. Sometimes tax is already added but the 10% tip not. 

U can drink water form the tap in 99% of the places. 

Always be ready for rain. Take a rainjacket on your travels.

"nextjs","t5_3h7yi","I don't think you're clear on what async/await is, because your questions kinda miss the mark. Or you're confusing async with asynchronous.

**Is asynchronous and async/await the same thing?**

\- No. Async/await is one of 3 ways to achieve asynchronous behavior (callbacks, promises with .then being the other 2).

I can't tell if you're asking if it has to be asynchronous , or if it has to be async/await? In either case, the answer is no.

**Does it have to be asynchronous?**

\- No, it doesn't have to be. For example if you're returning some dummy data which you can obtain synchronously.

\- But practically speaking, in a typical use case, it's going to be asynchronous. But that has nothing to do with SSR or anything else you're asking. It has to do with fetching of the data being asynchronous.

**Does it have to be async/await?**\- No, not at all. If you don't need to use the await keyword within the code, you can remove the async keyword. You can just use .then. For example you can use

    apiFetch(url)
      .then((res) =&gt; {
         return { props: res }
      })

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The components required data fetching so I understand why they use async/await but if they are server rendered then wouldn't the data already be fetched meaning it isn't really required?

What??

Okay, I thought about what you said, and I have a guess as to what's confusing you.

You're probably assuming that

    export const getServerSideProps = async () =&gt; {
      // stuff
    }

is getting called on the client, because that's where the code lives.

But it is not. getServerSideProps (or any of the others) are not getting called on the client. This is just a simple convention from Next that allows you to write the code together, but Next is not call it client side.",1675209645

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Because we all know that people in the UK do not have a mind of their own. Because we know that everybody in the UK was always pro EU, but Russia managed to brainwash them all somehow. None of British Media was ever opposed to the EU, they all love it. But somehow Russia pays them to write anti-EU news, if not for that, they'd never say anything bad about the EU, but they totally depend on Russian money, because clearly, there is no money in the UK itself. Ruper Murdoch is obviously a Russian in disguise. British people aren't rightwingers, absolutely none of them is, it's unthinkable that a British person could be a rightwinger. That goes against everything that is British. Everybody in the UK wants to be more leftwing and vote for leftwing parties, but somehow, Russia votes in their stead. It's not British people who voted for Brexit, it was the Russians. The UK is obviously infiltrated with millions of Russian sleeper agents. No other way to explain Brexit. Personal responsibility isn't a British attribute after all. They do what they are told, but somehow only when it is rightwing talking points.

So you can't blame the British, it's not their fault that they are absolutely stupid brain dead morons with no mind of their own, easy to brainwash and attracted to rightwing talking points. 

Ah isn't it wonderful to be able to put the entire blame on others. Why take personal responsibility. We aren't responsible. no way.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks to guests during a campaign stop on January 11, 2020 in Newton, Iowa.

""Virtually all Democrats talk about the need for campaign finance reform,"" wrote Sanders. ""Talk is easy. Now it's time to walk the walk.""

Ahead of the Democratic National Committee's annual Winter Meeting in Philadelphia, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called on the party to end super PAC spending in primary races, saying the Democrats should take the event as an opportunity to show their commitment to protecting democracy.

Twelve years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Vermont Independent senator wrote, the last election cycle illustrated how the ""disastrous"" decision is ""undermining American democracy,"" as super PACs spent roughly $1.3 billion on campaigning‚Äîincluding more than $460 million spent by Democratic groups.

Millions of dollars were spent by billionaires ""against progressive candidates in competitive primaries,"" Sanders wrote, with super PACs funding ""outrageous and dishonest attack ads.""

""When we talk about billionaires buying elections, this is exactly what we are talking about.""

Notably, a super PAC created by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent millions of dollars in competitive races in North Carolina, Texas, and Pennsylvania last year, running attack ads against progressives who are critical of the United States' support for Israel's violent anti-Palestinian policies. One ad accused Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) of being disloyal to the Democratic Party.

""When we talk about billionaires buying elections, this is exactly what we are talking about,"" wrote Sanders, who caucuses with Senate Democrats.

The 2010 Citizens United ruling allowed corporations and special interest groups to create super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations and spend unlimited money on campaigns. The ruling has been condemned for years by Democratic lawmakers including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who earlier this month introduced legislation to overturn Citizens United.",1675209647

"WarshipPorn","t5_2tg3p","&gt; I've read that you can actually own a working tank

It varies by state with federal law also playing a role, operational historical military vehicles can be registered in some states and operate on public roads, in other states it can be more difficult.  The weapons are another issue, as full-automatic machine guns require a lot of paperwork and background checks and so on.  The main gun is problematic as it and the ammunition qualify as a destructive device which triggers another layer of federal regulation.  Many collectors settle for vehicles with weapons that have been permanently deactivated to avoid legal issues.  I've known folks who've owned small pieces of artillery, but they operate on black powder and are historical reproductions.

Using the same car (with upgrades) will get you through all 9 SE GP's for a reward of 50gc and win each Tuning Setup.

It takes two GP SE's to get enough points to fully upgrade the Principal of one car which becomes the car you use for all other GP's to obtain the remaining free cars and Tuning Setups.       You do not need to upgrade the Principal on the remaining cars (saving gold).

He's pretty much a magic-powered information fusion center. The only limitation is that he's sort of subconsciously pulling this all in but can only be aware of so many things simultaneously.

Currently as Lillia, you want to always rush Demonic Embrace as your first item. Why? It has the damage of Liandrys and tankiness of Riftmaker combined.

After your first item, you have plenty of options. Liandries and Jak'Sho are the highest winrate items, but Riftmaker is acceptable too. Radiant Virtue is probably overtuned right now and a very good option for Lillia, but there is not enough data to prove that it is indeed broken on her.

After your mythic, get situational items. Cosmic Drive, Rylais, Rabadons, Antiheal, FoN, Frozen Heart, Zhonyas... Whatever you might need. Every item has their uses and situations they are good in, but it takes a lot to truly understand which items to go for.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I don't generally concern myself too much with it when I see others do it, although I am not a fan of bringing food and drink into the church, except when needed for small children or medical reasons.

To me, these things are minor worldly distractions, and more overtly, the distinction of treating them as items that don't belong in church helps reinforce to me the sacred nature of the space, consecrated for worship of God and the sacrifice of the Mass. This also gives me a sense of continuity with our Old Testament heritage.

So there's my opinion. It's not an absolute, but I believe it has merit.

Furthermore, not infrequently, parishes will provide guidelines for etiquette at Mass, and they will usually include no food. For example, from a random search hit:

They are primarily offsetting dilutions from operations and have projected 1.625B shares for 2023 (actually up from the Q1 estimate of 1.612B) so probably plan on less buybacks this year.

Yeah, I suspect that's the real reason for the buybacks as opposed to a dividend. It's just to offset dilution and the discretion to do it whenever. If client had not nose-dived and they had an extra $1B in operating margin a year to play with, it might've been different but then we probably would be at $105. ;-)",1675209651

Their timing is horrible though. They were supposed to do it back in 2008 but pushed it back because of the crash but here we are in the opposite of a crash and all the council people see/people who set the rate is money signs lol.

Regarding the changing from low to high fantasy, it's quite hard to do when you have already developed characters from another genre. The world should really be the thing that dictates what the characters will be like, not the other way around. That being said, you can still fix it. You will just need to get REALLY creative if you want to have a punk rocker in high fantasy. Time travel, prophetic visions of the future etc might work, but it will be hard to do. I suggest keeping your low fantasy book and creating a new high fantasy one. There will be more work, but it will be more coherent and believable.",1675209653

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","From comments its clear you dont know enough about taxes to understand what people are talking about so I am going to take the time to start from the beginning.

The federal government taxes your income. Some states do and some do not.  The taxes you pay on income are bracketed by income level which is known as a progressive tax. Taxes are the same for everyone.

When you get a job where you are officially employed then you fill out a W-4. The W-4 is to state your total income so that taxes can be withheld from your paycheck each paycheck and paid to the IRS. A change in your job may result in a request for you to fill out a new W4.

At the end of the year you file your taxes. This is to show how much taxable income you made after any adjustments (which again is taxed the same way for everyone) as well as how much was witheld from your paychecks.  The amount you owe is compared to the amount that was withheld.  If they are exactly equal you owe nothing after you file your return. If your witholding is less than the taxes you owe it means your paychecks were larger than they should have been and you owe the difference. If your witholding is more than the taxes you owe then you got less pay each paycheck than you should have and as a result you are issued a refund. In all of these scenarios the amount of taxes you owed is exactly the same...the only difference is your witholding which is based on how you filled out your W4.

If you check your filed taxes for 2021 and 2022 both your taxable income and your witholding are on those forms and you can look them up. If you do that it will answer your question.

Do you understand?",1675209653

2. Silly comparison because people *absolutely* die during training due to negligence. You were safe because the Army (or whatever branch you were in) followed the rules and the rules generally work.

And the nice thing about LLCs and LLPs is you can have different levels, so you could mimic something like a law firm's structure where you have full partners (i.e. hosts of established shows with a certain level of listenership), senior associates (i.e. hosts of newer shows that aren't quite at a partnership level, but may get there), junior associates (i.e. brand new hosts), and then ""of counsel"" (i.e. people doing a one off, or even guest appearances).",1675209654

The best way to learn, is to pay attention when you're on shift. Listen to rounds, even when it's not your patient. Write down things you want to learn more about, and look them up later. Ask questions. Ask the bedside nurse how the patient is doing, what do they need. Ask the visiting family how they think the patient is doing. Make sure you keep all relevant parties (nursing, patient, attending, any consulting services) updated on the plan or on patient status, as relevant. Call your consults early in the day.

Never stop learning. That's the key to getting better on the job.",1675209654

Denver is an amazing place to live for wealthy people compared to most other cities. Also, the fans are unbelievably passionate. I lived in Denver for 6 years - the fans bleed orange and the geographical reach of the fanbase literally goes from the Montana to New Mexico.  If Payton even gets this team to .500, he will be revered by broncos fans and be the most beloved man on the front range. Compare that to the Texans job, for example, where the team‚Äôs influence permeates the culture there significantly less. I think Payton likes the spotlight and that‚Äôs probably part of the reason he wanted to be in Denver. Who tf knows though I‚Äôm just some Reddit dickhead",1675209655

[Original Source](https://verificado.com.mx/circula-imagen-falsa-movilidad-taxis/)

*****

 &gt; An image supposedly published by the Secretary of Mobility and Urban Planning of Nuevo Le√≥n has been disseminated on social networks informing all taxi drivers that they cannot refuse short trips or charge minimum fares, but this is false.

&gt; Users have detected various irregularities such as taxi drivers rejecting long rides, since some only accept short rides that charge between 35 and 40 pesos.

&gt; According to an exercise carried out by El Norte, a TPA taxi charged 700 pesos to journalists who traveled from Terminal A, in Apodaca, to G√≥mez Mor√≠n and Alfonso Reyes, in Colonia Jer√≥nimo Siller, in San Pedro.

&gt; Another trip they made was from the airport to Paseo de los Leones and Pedro Infante, in the Cumbres Las Palmas Residencial neighborhood, in Monterrey.

&gt; The number to make a report that appears in the image broadcast on the networks is also incorrect, so to file any complaint about any anomaly, damage and mishandling of the service offered by public transport in Nuevo Le√≥n, such as urban trucks , school buses and taxis are as follows: By Liliana El√≥seguiA message distributed through WhatsApp alerted users to an alleged ""hack"" on the Tax Administration Service portal...

1. Mainstream American culture tends to convey the idea that working on one's fitness is more important than anything else.  More important than working on one's personality or relationships.  Ultimately ""in shape"" is probably one of the least important things a person can be and yet its prioritized way beyond being respectful or open minded which are just as much if not more work. 

2. America kind of has a one sized fits all approach to ""fat."" As if everyone's ideal shape is skinny or super cut. The average joe has much stronger opinions on weight than their understanding of human physiology would justify.    


That said going to the gym exclusively to have a better body is probably pretty narcissistic. Telling *other* people they gotta match your level of narcissism or they are like ""a bad influence on their children"" or ""irresponsible"" is probably something like fat phobic.",1675209657

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","Oh boy I have a lot to unpack here as for the last two years I have become very interested in Imperials. Imperials are above average in all categories. Not the best in any of them though, but I believe this makes it relatively easy for them to become great at anything. You can see this reflect in both gameplay and lore. One of the greatest warriors to ever live said so by the celestial mage itself is Titus Valerius he was so skilled he was able to defeat shehai wielding Ansei. When looking at great mages you see names like Abnur Tharn who is said to be one of the most powerful mages in Tamriel, and more than likely Zurin Arctus. Great leaders like Reman Cyrodiil who was essentially an incredibly powerful god king and  Titus Meade I who was able to conquer the imperial city with less than 1,000 men. One of the greatest thieves being the Grey Fox who was a Colovian. 

Imperials are also split into two cultural groups, The Nibeneans and the Colovians. Nibeneans are what most people think of when they hear imperial. They are fantastic diplomats and traders and are very multicultural, accepting of all races and their cultures. Within Nibenay there are more Cults to Obscure deities than you can count. Nibeneans are known to be garish and colorful often covering their bodies in intricate tattoos with bright and colorful flowing clothing. They are also quite skilled with magic and are known as the center for imperial battlemages. Nibeneans are  known to be corrupt and conniving often trying to undermine each other through intrigue and deception. They also have massive influence from the Akaviri specifically the Tsaesci. I like to think of them as a mix of Japan and traditional East Asian Cultures like Vietnam and Ancient China mixed with the Byzantine empire and Renaissance Italy.

On the other hand you have Colovians They are known to be great Fighters and Incredibly religious. Known to hardy and self sufficient, They make up the vast Majority of the legion and are model soldiers. Colovians are known to solve problems through force  whether that be duels between disgruntled nobles Or through bloody warfare between mighty warlords vying for any degree of power. They respect martial ability and strength. They have some similarities to Nords due to the fact that Colovia was first settled by Nordic and Nedic mercenaries that migrated west after Alessia‚Äôs rebellion. Despite their more warlike nature they are still cosmopolitan and Carry an aura of Civilization. They are not as Multicultural as Nibeneans and are distrustful of magic. I see Colovians as the Spartans of the elder scrolls universe. They are the Ideal Soldiers skilled fighters yet disciplined and loyal. Colovians are also heavily based on, in my opinion, the republican era of Rome when it‚Äôs culture was at it‚Äôs martial peak with elements of Slavic and German culture as well.

Now why did I list off the differences? Mainly just to show how hard it can be to describe imperials as a race, because within the umbrella of this race are two drastically different Cultures. But if I had to  say what makes them special? Adaptability. As I and many others have said Imperials are the jack of all trades. No matter what the situation calls for Imperials will usually be able to adapt to it and get the job done.",1675209658

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks to guests during a campaign stop on January 11, 2020 in Newton, Iowa.

""Virtually all Democrats talk about the need for campaign finance reform,"" wrote Sanders. ""Talk is easy. Now it's time to walk the walk.""

Ahead of the Democratic National Committee's annual Winter Meeting in Philadelphia, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called on the party to end super PAC spending in primary races, saying the Democrats should take the event as an opportunity to show their commitment to protecting democracy.

Twelve years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Vermont Independent senator wrote, the last election cycle illustrated how the ""disastrous"" decision is ""undermining American democracy,"" as super PACs spent roughly $1.3 billion on campaigning‚Äîincluding more than $460 million spent by Democratic groups.

Millions of dollars were spent by billionaires ""against progressive candidates in competitive primaries,"" Sanders wrote, with super PACs funding ""outrageous and dishonest attack ads.""

""When we talk about billionaires buying elections, this is exactly what we are talking about.""

Notably, a super PAC created by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent millions of dollars in competitive races in North Carolina, Texas, and Pennsylvania last year, running attack ads against progressives who are critical of the United States' support for Israel's violent anti-Palestinian policies. One ad accused Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) of being disloyal to the Democratic Party.

""When we talk about billionaires buying elections, this is exactly what we are talking about,"" wrote Sanders, who caucuses with Senate Democrats.

The 2010 Citizens United ruling allowed corporations and special interest groups to create super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations and spend unlimited money on campaigns. The ruling has been condemned for years by Democratic lawmakers including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who earlier this month introduced legislation to overturn Citizens United.",1675209658

"tennis","t5_2qiq1","Disagree and for obvious reasons. If you don‚Äôt want to look at stats, that‚Äôs fine. Something simple - take out the big 3 and how many slams does the rest of the tour have? Murray has ~15 and Wawrinka 5-8 with cilic 3, Ferrer 1-2, Berdych 1-2, Tsonga 1-3, delpo 2-4, etc.

Now looking at stats: Murray already in 2009 eclipsed everything Wawrinka had done in a single year except a slam win. That‚Äôs before Murray came into his prime. Murray had won 2 m1000s, reached world #2 and had an 85%+ season. His prime just so happened to coincide with Nadal and djokovic‚Äôs. He still made many finals and won 10+ m1000+ trophies in this era. Even in an ‚Äúoff year‚Äù from 2009-2016, he was far more consistent at making deep runs than in wawrinka‚Äôs best year 

Now comparing their best years: 

Murray has reached a 90% season in 2016, reached world #1 and was top 10 in many all-time lists by 2016, as high as top 5 in others, alongside the big 3, Sampras, agassi, mcenroe, borg, etc. 

Wawrinka reached 75% winrate in 2015, reached world #3 and was losing to random top 50-100 players constantly outside of slams. 

HC stats: Murray - 75%, Wawrinka 63%

Clay stats: Murray - 70%, Wawrinka 66%

Grass: Murray - 83%, Wawrinka 49%

If you are a slams means everything guy, sure, they‚Äôre comparable. But if you want to look at their whole careers, Murray has accomplished many things that Wawrinka never came close to. Murray, at his best was feet away from the big 3 and miles away from the rest of the tour. This graph shows it as well but I guess a handful of great performances from Stan discounts a near decade of performance by muzzah",1675209658

"REBubble","t5_3lflvh","I bought my home in January of 2021 after this sub was created when people said to wait and not buy at inflated prices. Got a 2.99 interest rate which brought the payment of a 600k+ home to 3,500 PITI after PMI. 

That‚Äôs about 40% of my NET income (or ~26% gross income, thanks California). That leaves over 5,000 in post tax income to put towards retirement, disposable income, savings, etc. And that‚Äôs just my income, im not even including my partners income, and I don‚Äôt have any kids.

The FB1 dot only utility is that it gives burnout procs, with a 1 lvl leaping flame that you will never use on a bigger pack than 3T anyway, so that doesn't matter outside of 1-2T fights and some boss fights.

"chilliwack","t5_2tglv","Chicken farms (and a few dairy farms) occupy most of the land in Greendale, Atchelitz, South Sumas. They produce a powerful and nauseating stench which can burn your nostrils and make your eyes tear up in certain seasons, especially when hot dry weather follows cold wet weather or the wind blows nasty things around. And there's always wind on those roads because all the surrounding landscape is flat and open.

You may have noticed a lot of agricultural land in every direction around every major road. The farmers will drive special tractors around which spray/mist liquid manure onto the fields a few times each year. They start as early as they can, the moment winter ends - sometimes they're out there even before the snow has all melted - so they can get richer crops. But I think January is still too early for this smelly activity.

There's a meat slaughterhouse on the hill near the entry road to Promontory. The trucks delivering fresh animals usually sound and smell unforgettably ugly because they're packed full and the animals already know where they're going. But these trucks usually run in the still hours before morning so you usually won't hear or smell them unless you're too close and have your windows open.

These are all ""natural"" smells. But they're so concentrated and intense that it's easy to mistake them for chemicals.",1675209659

I wish this had been an option for my child. She lost all of her friends when I had to change her (kindergarten) class. But, in her case, it was the teacher who was bullying her. The principal would do nothing and didn‚Äôt even want to move my child. I still wish that the teacher had been fired, my daughter is in 6th grade now and still hasn‚Äôt recovered from having to put up with the emotional and mental abuse from this teacher. She alienated her from all the friends she had made the second she found out my daughter was being moved from her class.

You made the right move, removing the bully instead of your daughter. It also reinforces that she did NOTHING to deserve this and is being protected, not punished.

Very much, NTA",1675209659

3.) Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you are ready to fire.

4.) Keep your weapon on safe until you intend to fire.

These were drilled into my head 25 years ago in the Marine Corps, and I remember them almost verbatim to this day.  These rules are incredibly simple, and if taught and adhered to would probably save more than a handful of lives every year.  I've been around guns my entire life, and the only time I felt afraid was during a weapons familiarization with a bunch of contractors who probably had only seen guns on television, right before we went to Afghanistan.  Thank god no one died that day, because those people weren't taught anything about handling a firearm.",1675209660

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","I tend to go back to the Greatest Commandments - to love God and your neighbor as you love yourself.  (I don't think Jesus is commanding us to love ourselves, but I think we need the reminder, and besides, it's not a sin to love yourself as God loves you.)

So in those commandments we see three relationships - that with God, with each other, and with ourselves.  It stands to reason then that that which is good for those relationships is virtuous, and that which is bad for those relationships is sinful.  Thus, sin becomes something less like solely a crime to be punished, and more like an addiction that needs healing, that may sometimes lead to crime.  God offers forgiveness and healing through Christ, and those that refuse to accept it at any point may ultimately end up isolated from Him, by their own tragic choice.  

However, I would like to think that anyone who does repent, at any time, is free to enter Heaven and be loved and forgiven.",1675209661

"KingOfTheHill","t5_2s6dm","That's my feeling on it as well, but like I said, I'm a guy who isn't part of the community affected here - my feelings on it don't really matter because I have no right to tell a community of people what they shouldn't be bothered by, just as I wouldn't appreciate them doing the same for me.  Likewise, however, I think when a group of people outside a community decide what the community *should* be bothered by, that's a problem as well, and that's the type of thing I was alluding to in my initial post. Some dude who is just as white as me has no right to say ""Kahn is offensive to AAPI people!"" if that's just his take.  

I've seen comments from people on this sub claiming to be Asian who say Kahn never bothered them and that they liked the character, and if that's true and reflective of the general fan community then *that's* legitimate, which is why I think the best thing is to let representatives of these communities be able to look at it and provide their input.

"transgenderau","t5_32viw","Damn, that's strange. I just got the reply from the practice when I asked and they said the practice does not bulk bill. So I guess either it's changed or maybe there's some weird thing where he does, but the practice as a whole doesn't.  
I'll keep them in mind moving forward, but currently unemployed student, so bulk billing is vital.

Thinking the easiest option might just be to go back to my GP loaded up with information about the informed consent model. As there's no special reason I'd have to go to endo, just my GP isn't as up to date I guess. But through informed consent he can prescribe hrt, and ultimately I'd like to stick to him for all medical stuff as he knows family and my history really well. I believe the main reason he said he couldn't prescribe is that he actually just doesn't know he can through informed consent. He mentioned I'm only the 2nd patient he's ever had that is trans and the last one was ages ago (I'm guessing before informed consent) so he just hasn't been on top of the new information and stuff. It can't hurt to go see him, information printouts in hand, and try, and may still take less time than finding an endo near me.",1675209662

"movies","t5_2qh3s","***TL, DR: Inception's characters have no personalities outside of Cobb, two of the climactic conflicts are resolved through egregious cop-outs and the dilemma of the final twist is stupid since it would mean literally anything in the movie occurring outside of a dream took place entirely off-screen.***

It may be your favorite and I love the film, warts and all, but come on, from an objective analysis, there are glaring flaws that prevent it from being anything even close to the best.

There are two brazen examples of not only deus ex machina but breaking two of the central rules created by the film itself in order to resolve the climax itself with a pair of cheap cop-outs.

First off, why are Cobb and Saito able to get out of limbo by shooting themselves even though they specifically state that they‚Äôre under a sedative and can‚Äôt wake up by doing that?

Secondly, they‚Äôre able to inexplicably resuscitate Fischer with a defibrillator even though he gets shot and they say that if you get killed in the dream, there's no coming back from limbo, where you'll be for the equivalent of hundreds of years and you‚Äôll basically be a vegetable (Cobb and Saito would also share this fate)

Breaking your own rules is one thing, but doing so to bring the finale to a resolution invalidates the central stakes of the movie, especially when Nolan was able to consistently execute a complex plot with precision just four years prior with the Prestige.

Regarding the main characters is that virtually none of the crew outside of Cobb have any discernible personality traits. Who is Eaves? Who's Arthur? It's easy to like them because they're sharply dressed versions of JGL and Tom Hardy, but... who are they outside of that? They don't like each other, but... why? The internet had to invent a gay backstory to make them interesting. Ariadne is nothing more than an audience surrogate. Yusuf is a blank slate with no traits whatsoever. Michael Caine is the same version of Michael Caine from every Nolan movie.

The film is driven by its multifaceted plot so it‚Äôs a little understandable that we get less character development but considering Bond and Mission Impossible are its closest counterparts, the entries released contemporarily to Inception all had a fairly colorful cast around their somewhat cipher-like protagonists.

Cobb may be a fairly compelling central figure with a tragic backstory, but let's face it, he's a recycled version of all of Nolan's protagonists. A haunted, isolated man with a dead wife.

Nolan reuses this trope to fuel his obsession with complex plot structures, which is defensible, but it makes the dumb aforementioned plot mechanics that much more infuriating.

Speaking more subjectively, the film‚Äôs dream state is fairly unimaginative when compared to, say, Nightmare on Elm Street 1 and 3, Dreamscape (which has almost the exact same premise as Inception, but as a De Palma lover, I'll never fault somebody for a paraphrased remake, intentional or unintentional) or even the mood and tone of a Lynch film.

Nolan gives himself an out by saying they can‚Äôt create too bizarre of a dream in order to not arouse suspicion but considering a dream heist is the central scenario, it‚Äôs pretty strange that virtually everything about these dream dimensions (save for, ahem, time, and an occasional hiccup in gravity due to a flipping van) is largely consistent with the real world.

And finally, the famous twist at the end with the totem. It‚Äôs titillating and fun, but a film establishes its world by showing it to you. We know when Cobb is in a dream and when he isn‚Äôt based on everything we see. And while it‚Äôs possible we‚Äôve been watching Cobb‚Äôs dream the entire movie -- that would mean every last thing we've seen was a dream and anything occurring in reality is entirely offscreen, which would mean the central dilemma of the totem doesn't make any sense.

Despite this long-winded diatribe, I still really like the movie, especially as an allegory about filmmaking and a deconstruction of plot and character as Nolan kind of does in all his films, but from a reasonable standpoint, it‚Äôs inferior to his other films such as Prestige and Memento and certainly not the best film ever made. (Yes I know it‚Äôs all subjective but he said ‚Äòbest‚Äô not ‚Äòfavorite‚Äô and this is r/movies, it‚Äôs made for dumb arguments like this.)",1675209663

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","It's do-able, but I would want to emphasize transition. Sure, a lot would be cosmetic, but I would want to weave it into mechanics. So, it would be cool if the Empire was polytheist and transforming to a monotheist culture. To really pull that off well, I would like to see the mechanics of divine magic change a bit. I really don't like how RPGs do polytheism in general. 

I would also like to see changes in magic. Pathfinder is really good about having slightly different mechanics for different types of casters. I would want those differences to be a bit more era based, with overlap and cultural differences, and not as class based. Some archetypes in Pathfinder have potential to fill this need. 

Finally, I think Pathfinder would need to change their armor system. Different cultures use different armors for different reasons. I think if there was a way to assign armor to specific body parts, it would be easier to demonstrate the differences of armor from era to era and culture to culture.",1675209663

Second, Jesus taught the importance for us to strive to be perfect even as God (see Matthew 5:48). Perhaps the bible is not clear on the exact why, but my belief is that sin doesn't bring lasting joy in the first place but instead brings misery (albeit it may bring very fleeting momentarily pleasure). This is why Jesus needed to save us from sin in the first place. If sin brough joy then we wouldn't need saving from it. 

Finally, even if you don't accept my reasoning for why Jesus taught us to be good people I would argue that believing in Jesus means we not only believe in his power to save us but in his teachings. Saying you can sin without any worries, then your belief becomes a selective belief which is not really a belief at all.",1675209663

The theory going around now is that Graham Hancock is actually much, much older than he claims, and that he is really an immortal being descended from the very pre-Ice Age civilization he is writing and talking about. How does he know exactly where to look and what it all means? He was really there and saw it all FIRST HAND. Now that the truth about his own suppression of his own ancient origins is leaking out, Graham Hancock is running scared, not answering these questions or addressing these concerns, but most of all he continues to refuse to take a simple blood test which would confirm his DNA is ancient and that he is in fact an immortal 13,000 year old being.

You mentioned this trip can be done cheaply, so you already have that advantage.

When the student is ready, a teacher will appear, my little sister recently asked me about my weight loss. I told her how I did it and she was very receptive to the idea. She let me know she was on Prilosec, drinking too much alcohol and packing on the pounds as a result of too many out of town guests this year.

I let her know how to get off the Prilosec with ACV and explained my eating habits. Several days later, she let me know that her GERD was gone. She has been taking ACV daily, ever since. She and her husband have both started a LCHF and seem to be doing well.

I usually play 90+30 (Lichess and OTB), and my opponent may do whatever they want with the time they have. Some have had let their clock run for 60 minutes when I had mate in 2.I can imagine them desperately looking for ANY chance to make me make a mistake.

I do agree that it is annoying, but nothing to be furious about. There is just no way to regulate it properly.

The first 5 moves is ridiculous. I've had 20-minute thinks at that point in some of my OTB games. It's not just about finding a good next move, it's also about seeing the direction of how the game might go and making plans.",1675209667

So they take 0.03% of the money you invested each year, to give you the convenience of not having to buy and sell the treasuries yourself.

It absolutely isn't easy when your partner is looking at other women, fantasizing, spending hours binging. Especially with how completely normalised it has become. With how an addiction forces the addict to defend it's existence, it will never be an easy conversation. I denied and fought for many months even after I realised it myself, saying I didn't have as bad as other guys, or flip-flopping between porn use actually being natural and a normal part of life. I see now that that is absolutely not the case.

But as with many other factors in a relationship, you should want to help each other be the best version of each other. That includes physical and mental health. If you think that your partner has an issue with pornography, I would bring it up with some resources that could help. A big thing that helped me was finding real scientific resources that showed me how my brain has been hijacked. Your Brain On Porn by Gary Wilson, Fight The New Drug, JK Emezi's Porn Reboot, subreddits like r/pornfree and even r/nofap. Seeing that you're not alone and that it absolutely is a problem many men face and will face will most likely help soften the blow. But I can't lie, it is a long and enduring process. You must prepare yourself for the likelihood of your partner not accepting this at all. At that point it's up to you whether you can see a life where they will change for the better.",1675209667

Just as an example.  A pretty industry standard for a classroom is using Extron.  Same brand your VGA DA's are.  Educational pricing on a Extron HDMI 2 output DA is $400.  So your budget isn't really reasonable to me. A typical classroom for us, with just one projector, is $5k+ for equipment.

I also work at a local university, and have been doing classrooms for the last decade or so.  We updated to 1080p and HDMI from VGA and 1024x768 almost as long ago.  XGA may look fine and be big enough to read, but its also, to me, sub-standard.  Your students are going to be coming in after being use to HD display in their house (and in their pockets).  Will they notice? I would have when I was going to a college.  I would make the argument, and did when we updated, that as a Tech College, we look bad if we are not somewhat up to date (I don't know if you are a Tech College but I think it holds for any higher education). 

I would bring in a local integrator (maybe a few) for a quote to get an idea of the costs and maybe other options.",1675209667

A person who is self employed remits their own. The money from their clients is used to fulfill this obligation. 

An employer has a budget for compensation. Out of this bucket of money comes wages, health insurance, STD, LTD, D&amp;D,(these taxes),etc,etc. There is no random budget for delicious cake or FICA that employers pay taxes out of. If it were not for sending '50%' of these taxes straight to the government, that money could be gross wages. It's the same already budgeted and allocated money it just doesn't get listed on the pay stub.

From your point of view, if I waved a magic wand and next pay period every employee pays 100% out of their gross (which increased by the missing 50%) what actually functionally changed?

The government gets exactly the same tax revenue, the employee has exactly the same take home pay, and the employer paid exactly the same amount of money.",1675209667

"NotHowGirlsWork","t5_adf18","Ok but if by your standards Leonardo DiCaprio does what you‚Äôre condemning then it shouldn‚Äôt matter whether or not there‚Äôs a clip of him saying he‚Äôs doing it. His actions are proving he‚Äôs doing it. So according to OP, he‚Äôs a pedophile groomer and must be criminalized just like they‚Äôre attempting to do to the Black man in this video. We can‚Äôt have these racially charged double standards.

That‚Äôs not really how the subtleties of modern day white supremacy works. White supremacists often use a single incident of a Black person as a proxy of how all Black people are. I‚Äôm not saying OP is a white supremacist either, only that they are using white supremacist tactics.

But bottom line though he‚Äôs not spewing pedophile rhetoric because pedophile rhetoric involves sexually preying on children, hence the ‚Äúpedo‚Äù. So it‚Äôs extremely disingenuous and dangerous to attempt to label people as pedophiles when they‚Äôre talking about adult women, and OP and other posters understand this. Which is the underlying point, they‚Äôre attempting to criminalize heterosexual Black men for their dating preferences. 

Also it is not weird in any way for men of all ages to be attracted to women in their 20‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a biological reason for this, there are a multitude of cultural reasons to this and it cannot simply be reduced to men wanting to dominate women. But some women over 35 will of course protest to this and rather than compete with women in their 20‚Äôs will instead attempt to bully or in this thread‚Äôs case, criminalize, men who do not want to be in a relationship with them. 

But mentioning pedophilia in relation to anything he‚Äôs said is just out of line. You can‚Äôt groom adult women in their 20‚Äôs, because they are adults and not children.",1675209669

The fact you went to a specialized GF place that ensures no cross-contamination was very safe and thoughtful!

Places that offer both regular and GF options together often cannot account for very trace amounts of ingredients, so people with very severe allergies may still get a reaction if flour dust was in the air at the time of other food prep, for example.

If you explained this as your reason, and they STILL were mad, they are the jerks.

Usually I read crappy posts where a person with a food restriction gets told to bring their own food, and you totally went out of your way to get her something (and a real meal, it sounds like - not just GF sides).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"Yugioh101","t5_30a9p","It's actually closer to the opposite - a bit niche, but still. Face down monsters do not have an effect and are not considered effect monsters, so they *cannot* be negated, and if a monster which is currently negated is flipped face down, it stops being negated. However, it still remembers that it's the same monster.

This means you can activate the effect of a negated monster, chain Book of Moon to flip it face down, and then the effect will resolve after the monster has been flipped face down (in a way that wouldn't work if the monster had left the field while it was still negated, even though the version of the card in the new location wouldn't be negated anymore, as the effect is resolving as the effect of the monster on the field).

So yeah, one of the more esoteric rules, but it's closer to the truth to say that a facedown monster has its effects **un-negated**.",1675209669

Teven worse, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, Iryna Venediktova, who was supposed to launch those investigations against Russia, especially in regard to Bucha, was suspended and instead replaced with Oleksiy Symonenko, who through his wife Olena Symonenko, has a connection to Vyacheslav Peresetkyi, a criminal big shot who goes by the nickname ‚ÄúThe Fascist‚Äù. more directly, Oleksiy is connected to Oleg Tatarov, Zelenskey‚Äôs chief of staff who was charged with bribery but was kept on Zelenksey‚Äôs staff and whose case was blockaded by both Venediktova and Symonenko:

"widowers","t5_2swuk","My heart is breaking for you; I can't even find the words to express how your post makes me feel; I'm so sorry, and so sad, and you are too young to have to know what this feels like. All of you here who are so young and already know this awful, unrelenting pain, I feel so hurt for you. My situation is a little different, as we had been very happily married for almost 44 years when my husband suddenly got sick, a terminal every single time illness, no hope, ever, and he was gone 1 year and 10 days later, gone from me forever. I barely exist, because I just don't know how to be in this world without him. I took care of him at home until the final 8 days, and then hospice, and poof, he is gone. I have to believe that you're too young to be alone forever, and I know you can't imagine that the future holds any joy, but I can only say, be patient with yourself, be gentle with yourself,  and know that there is no right or wrong way to grieve, there is no set length of time; if screaming helps, do that; if crying helps, do that. If people offer to do things for you, let them, because they will all get back to their lives soon enough because they have to. It is amazing to me how life can just go on like nothing has happened, but it does. The world doesn't stop because we are lost in this terrible place, where there is nothing but hurting hearts, literally, and just pain all over. So, if you just can't manage to do anything, that's ok, don't try to grieve someone else's way. People mean well, but they probably don't have a clue what this feels like. When we love someone that much, with everything in us, there is no just moving on. But, given some time, the jagged edges can soften, the sharp pains become a little less so, I have to take sleep meds, or I can't sleep. Sleep is the best time, except for that split second in the morning, when for just a millisecond, I forget that he's gone. I have shirts that have his scent. I talk to his picture every day. Being able to talk about them helps, so talk about them. Even if it's only to yourself. Writing down how I feel brings me some relief, just to get the words out of me and into the universe. Do whatever you need to do, that isn't self destructive. I am an alcoholic but haven't had a drink in 20 years, and I want one, but I know that's just dishonoring his love and patience in loving me to sobriety, so I don't. I am so deeply sad for all of us who know that heartache is a real thing, not a figure of speech. Take good care of yourself, pamper yourself, and come here when you need to. We can help each other through this journey that is so hard to travel at any age. I am truly sorry for all of your broken hearts. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1675209670

The ds and 3ds were mainly pokemon, Mario kart and Mario party systems for me,though I branched out more on the 3ds most of what I played was still pokemon or Mariokart, so for ds and 3ds I would prefer it on the pocket 3 anyway(I know from experience on my phone) and I'm willing to wait for a rp3+ successor for the 3ds games.

For the one level dip into Bard, I would suggest [duettist](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Bard%20Duettist), so you can get a familiar and then use the Escape Route trick to be able to dance all over the battlefield, or using [Choral Support](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/choral-support-teamwork/) to turn any elemental spell into sonic damage (or sonic damage spells into half sonic, half divine).

I don't agree with the people who told you that you had a trash personality or were a narcissist. You have redeeming traits, but you also have some traits that you need to work on.     
   
Dating can be hard for everyone, so I can see why it would be especially hard for someone who is autistic. I can see why you'd be frustrated because you have done therapy, and you do check off some boxes. If you are getting to the second date, you know that you are enough to catch someone's eye. I said this in the past thread, but I would highly recommend ONLY dating neurodivergent women. You might not get the hot popular girl, but you might get the cute girl who is also neurodivergent who understands you more. Also a lot of neurodivergent men I meet can come across rude, and I bet that might be an additional problem you have. I'd additionally recommend etiquette classes or meetups.

Any shitty movie where it has a female cast and you change it to an all male cast I can guarantee that it will still be a shitty movie. It's not the gender, it's the writing that has gone bad like sour milk.

Movies and TV shows used to be written well. Great plot, witty commentary from the characters, funny moments, action packed moments. Then studios started getting invaded by mediocre writers who are hip to the modern times. Apparently those writers aren't that hip otherwise their movies wouldn't being getting blasted on by ""Haters"".

The people who are saying it's due to the female cast have realized something is wrong, they are just not able to put their finger on it and just blame the actresses. Believe me, it's the writing not the actresses. Don't hand me a box of shit and tell me it's chocolates when it's not. Most of the female cast I've seen in the last few years are being wasted on these shit scripts and it's ruining their careers and it's pissing me off.

You want to all be able to attend events for SD, you will never disrespect BM and will absolutely commit to not even interacting with her at these events, but that she needs to also abide by these rules because you definitely want all parents amd students to enjoy this year.

Also...if you can, you should volunteer some in the classroom or in the school because once the school and teachers know you and how you interact with SD they will be less likely to believe BMs lies.

A teacher isn't in charge of anything but their classroom and if a child is crying because SM showed up...even if you did NOTHING inappropriate,  disruptive,  or rude...she needs to ask you to leave so the child isn't upset.  My biggest problem with this teacher is actually how she spoke to your husband...acting like he is in the wrong for supporting you.   For him to stay would have given BM exactly what she wanted and what she convinced SD to do.  The teacher should have been professional and said...i am very sorry, but SD is really upset SM is here, so I have to ask her to leave...dad, you may stay, but I understand if you need to leave with her and I am sorry this is the situation.",1675209674

You need to be on it, and you can't be afraid of coming across as abrasive. You're correcting people, there's no ""nice"" way to do that without making someone feel bad. But that's okay. Be professional, but be stern.   


When I am misgendered, I have built up the muscle of interrupting to correct.  


""Oh just make sure you tell DblHotBlendedMocha that he needs to take--""  


""She.""   


""..oh uh sorry. She needs to take the garbage out.""   


Misgendering is completely against Starbucks policy, and it is not tolerated. You have the policy on your side here to correct people when it comes to your pronouns. Shift Supervisors and Store Managers are also trained to be prepared to have conversations with partners on your behalf when it comes to this issue. Reach out to them if you find the task of enforcing your pronouns overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

If all else fails, you can certainly reach out to Ethics and Compliance to report the behavior, and the partners engaged in that behavior will be held to account.

"fakedisordercringe","t5_30juii","From what I can tell it‚Äôs spreading. I used to spend a lot of my time on Twitter, and I saw it slowly start there. I jumped ship, thinking it was a Twitter thing. 

Then I found nearly the same thing in Trans support groups on FB: kids saying they identify as a demi-god and making flags for ‚Äúdiety genders‚Äù. The final straw was when one must have gone for a hike and came back and started making mountain/tree genders and flags and pronouns ü§£ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From what I can tell, this fake-disorder thing is the same phenomenon as I saw starting on Twitter and then saw growing on FB: all the language is the same, the mentality is the same, the clout-obsession is the same. 

Which leads me to believe that this whole problem can largely be blamed on letting devices raise kids, instead of raising kids to see devices as a tool they have to earn and that can be taken away if they act up.

Wattpad and similar story sites were thriving 10 years ago, as was RPing. You‚Äôd spend your non-screen hours imagining your OCs and the worlds they interacted in, and then you‚Äôd use your screen hours to share those stories and read up on those from others‚Äô and start the creative cycle all over again. 

Now kids have devices on them 24/7. There‚Äôs no downtime for imagination and self-reflection. 

I realize I sound like an old fart saying that, but I‚Äôm not even 30 yet. I love devices, I love that kids are so techno-savvy so young.

I‚Äôm just also terrified at never seeing kids playing make-believe anymore; at never seeing kids have to earn, *anything*; at this ‚Äúinstant gratification‚Äù culture we have created in general.",1675209677

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

I mean no, the reality is Ethan cracked an insensitive joke right after QT posted a very vulnerable video of herself crying about something very serious. Its not a narrative, its what happened. Even Ethan doesn't stand by it, so idk why you think this is a mob thing.

You were coming at me by saying that I can't read the room for some reason. As if me saying Ethan didn't read the room was somehow something you really needed to jump down my throat about.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Yeah you got yourself in a pickle. As it stands, if there is ANY way you can make bus service work, DO THAT. That being said, things could be way worse than they are. It sounds like you figured out that you made some bad decisions early enough to be able to dig yourself back out. This is good! Many people don't manage that.  
  
You gotta sell that 350z. I take it you really like those sporty cars, but that is NOT an option. They require a lot of maintenance, insurance charges more, they aren't as efficient, the whole thing.  
  
If you NEED to have a car, what you want is something old, small, and boring. Think old toyota corolla, prius, or yaris. Honda civic, hyundai elantra. I would avoid american cars like ford because they tend to be less reliable.   
  
Don't get a truck. Unless you're literally like, currently flipping furniture for a living or something, you absolutely don't need to be dealing with a truck.   
""Oh but I might move soon/get some mulch/idk that furniture thing sounds cool"" you may say. You can beg a friend or rent a uhaul. There's no need to pay extra 100% of the time for functionality you use maybe 5% of the time.  
  
Those interest rates are stupid-high, but unfortunately I'm not sure whether you'll be able to really improve that situation much. You don't have much of a credit history, you are carrying a lot of debt compared to your income, and there's no car to hold as collateral for that GT loan. If you can refinance that, consider it a blessing.   
  
TL;DR: As it stands, it's probably best to focus on:  
1. selling the 350z.  
2. paying as little for the (boring,reliable) replacement car as possible. You're probably not going to be able to get a good interest rate, so you really want to minimize any new loan. Again: if you can get away with no car for a while, even better.  
3. paying off the GT loan as fast as humanly possible. Make sure extra payments are being applied to the principle. You might have to call them to make sure (if you pay extra and they move your due date back, your payment probably did not get applied to the principle).  
  
If you can cut costs elsewhere or make more money, that will of course help immensely. Best of luck!",1675209678

No they were not. Their album went Gold. M People's Elegant Slumming went triple Platinum, U2's Zooropa went Platinum as did Jamouriqui's album released that year. 

Maybe the biggest new band, but they were not the biggest band in in '93 in the UK. 

&gt;Suede went for the majestic, whereas what the public wanted was laddish rock n roll, and on the flip side, things like trio hop were becoming big.

&gt;So while suede made this beautiful music, it didn‚Äôt tap into the public consciousness the way that Parklife and Definitely Maybe did, and eventually how Morning Glory did.

&gt;That‚Äôs why they aren‚Äôt massive now.

I disagree with that. Blur were only part of lad culture for 2 album, Park Life and the Great Escape. Even ignoring those albums Blur still have the more well liked, and more varied, discography.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

China for example, does not have have any ability to produce advanced lithography machines for making semiconductors; China produces exactly zero EUV lithography machines; they are only producing older DUV lithography machines, of which the technology is already decades old.

Even then, China is only a small player in the world lithography machines, suggesting that the Chinese are struggling with the technology; [Dutch ASML Holdings controls 90% of the market for lithography machines, with Japan's Canon and Nikon holding the rest of the market share, with mostly older technology products.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/computer-chip-giant-asml-places-big-bets-tiny-future-2022-05-20/)

While China did assemble the bulk of the ball point pens on the market, they did so using components made in Europe, using steel made in either Japan or Germany. The Chinese simply did not have the quality steel, nor the high precision machine tools to fully domestically make a ball point pen, and it wasn't until very recently did the Chinese manage to figure out the fundamentals of the technology; even then, the Chinese are still major importers of the precision components of ball point pens because domestic production isn't where it is at to supplant foreign imports.",1675209679

I truly believe that it's lights out, and your consciousness stops. It's not that we'll experience nothing, we won't experience *anything* at all. 





&gt;2) how much must you be sure of there being no God to be atheist and not agnostic vise versa

I've almost entirely given up on labels. So I don't know nor care about levels of certainty and what labels they earn. I'd much rather just talk about what one believes and why. 

That being said. I have no belief in god and I'm pretty damn sure there isn't one. 
Why?
Because all the evidence that has ever been presented, has a flaw, or a fallacy or an unfalsifiable assertion.  So at at minimum, I'd say that theism is not rationally justified.

There are people out there with no real interest in the game, who have no idea of who Bill was in the game, whose only interest in this show is hatred of gay people.

I'm sure you and the people you know didnt like the 2nd game for it's stray from the original story and lack of payoff. But don't pretend that a lot of the hate that game received was because of the relationships and specific characters in it (I dont want to spoil in case people who havent played it see this comment, but IYKYK).

There's a lot of hate for people like me out there: I've experienced it first hand. Those losers are real, and there's a lot of them, and they do not care about the original story, they don't care about the quips Ellie and Bill had in the game. They don't care about the race swap because they never picked up the game.

"VeganDE","t5_37ruc","Es geht darum, dass die DB Personen, die ein Onlineticket kaufen, nur die M√∂glichkeit gibt zwischen den Anreden ""Herr"" und ""Frau"" zu w√§hlen. Nichtbin√§re Personen werden damit gezwunden sich selbst zu misgendern, wenn sie ein Ticket kaufen m√∂chten. 

Im Oktober 2017 hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht entschieden, dass auch Personen, die sich weder dem m√§nnlichen noch dem weiblichen Geschlecht zuordnen, vor Diskriminierung nach Artikel 3 des Grundgesetzes gesch√ºtzt sind. Dieser Beschluss f√ºhrte zu einer Reform des Personenstandsrechts und seitdem ist es m√∂glich den Personenstand in ‚Äûdivers‚Äú zu √§ndern oder ganz zu streichen. Das Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz verbietet die Benachteiligung aufgrund des Geschlechts im Zugang zu G√ºtern und Dienstleistungen in ¬ß 2 Abs. 1 Nr. 8. Nach der aktuellen Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts liegt auch Diskriminierung aufgrund des Geschlechts vor, wenn Personen, die sich weder dem m√§nnlichen noch dem weiblichen Geschlecht zugeh√∂rig f√ºhlen, betroffen sind. Wie das Gericht in dem oben genannten Beschluss von 2017 explizit darlegte, beginnt diese Diskriminierung bereits, wenn keine andere Kategorie als ‚Äûm√§nnlich‚Äú oder ‚Äûweiblich‚Äú zur Verf√ºgung gestellt wird und diese Personengruppen damit unsichtbar gemacht werden. 

Die DB wurde in diesem Zusammenhang verklagt und weigert sich trotzdem immernoch das umzusetzen. Informationen dazu gibt es z.B. hier: 
https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=44310

Ob auf eine Personengruppe R√ºcksicht genommen werden muss oder nicht sollte im √úbrigen nicht davon abh√§ngen, wie gro√üe diese Personengruppe ist. Nur sehr wenige Menschen haben eine Erdnussallergie. Trotzdem muss ein Hersteller von Lebensmittel immer deklarieren, ob Spuren von Erdnussen enthalten sein k√∂nnen. Die Annahme, dass es nur ca. 600 nichtbin√§re Personen in Deutschland gibt, ist √ºbrigens Unsinn. Das Problem ist, dass die H√ºrden diesen Personenstand zu erhalten sehr gro√ü sind. Ich w√ºrde z.B. gerne meinen amtlichen Geschlechtseintrag streichen lassen. Daf√ºr m√ºsste ich aber ein sehr teures Gerichtsverfahren √ºber mich ergehen lassen in dem unter anderem zwei Gutachten gefordert wurden. Es ist bekannt, dass es bei diesen Gutachten immer wieder dazu gekommen ist, dass Personen unangemessene und unw√ºrdige Fragen gestellt wurden. Daher lehne ich das f√ºr mich ab. Die Anrede auf den Onlinetickets soll im √úbrigen auch nicht das amtlichen Geschlecht einer Person wiederspiegeln, sondern wie eine Person angesprochen werden m√∂chte. 

F√ºr mich ist das relevant, weil es mich selbst betrifft. Mit ""verehrte Fahrg√§ste"" habe ich kein Problem.",1675209682

Boxing classes are quite different than what you imagine after movies or fights on the Telly.
Sparring is usually light - most people rely on their brains and want to keep them sound. Sure it‚Äôs trying to best your opponent but in a way that you can both laugh about it afterwords. It‚Äôs a game of thechniqe rather than brawling. Something‚Äôs not right - you‚Äôre up against someone with personal problems, going to hard? Opt out. 
Hard sparring and fights are optional.

Studied philosophy, did this, did that, am 42 and started boxing last year. Don‚Äôt wanna turn veggie either. Scary, uncomfortable at first, hella humbling, thought I‚Äôd be a rockstar from the start, decent, or at least mediocre, but nada‚Ä¶ I did. however absolve a difficult rewarding and very fun journey. I‚Äôve got moderate bet definite skills and pack a brutal punch. 

In this one year I heard the ringing in my head once - got a central shot to the chin full force while body sparring and goofing off- that was it.

Working out alone will seem stale to you once you‚Äôve tasted boxing (so it was in my case)
Apart from the sheer fun of rivalary in sparring (in my mind it‚Äôs where flow and the analytical side meet) it‚Äôs kinda cool knowing you can break another person in half and take their head off ( that‚Äôs just me not brain trauma speakin). It‚Äôs a passion.

Apart from that a lot of freaks ( in a good sense) attend the gym, people I‚Äôd usually never meet, and they are in part hilarious. 

It‚Äôs super intense and super fun. Go for it.

I know this because I always got into the 10% top bracket in the weekly competitive portal mode, and the ranking I needed to get into that 10% was shrinking every week.  Like, if I was at rank 200 and got into the 10% at that point, I could assume 2,000 players played the portal mode at that point.  By the end, I think it took like, rank 90 to be within the top 10%, indicating only 900 players were playing the portal.  Or.... something like that.  It's been years so my numbers could be waaaaay off but it's true that it was shrinking every week, much to my frustration because it gave me less leeway to get that 10% reward bracket.

&amp;#x200B;

Too bad.  Game was fun but waaaaaaay too hard to grind up new tanks, which was the source of the game's income.  You had to like, manually grind them up for the most part (EXP ""potions"" (those nekos), only accounted for a small portion of the exp needed to grind them up.  You could feed them an established tank of yours to give 66% of that tank's experience to it but then say good bye to that established tank!)

&amp;#x200B;

...also, the grind was exhausting in general.  No skipping whatsoever, you had to do the hardest stages for the best fuel-to-reward ratios, and if you failed a stage, you forfeitted the fuel.  Very stressful.  Lots of RNG involved in the gameplay too (crit hits, the tanks the opponent uses and order and whatever the enemy AI decides to do, etc) which made losing that fuel to an unlucky run even more infuriating.",1675209682

"FilmIndustryLA","t5_2sno0","I am a Veteran. Husband and I have less than humble beginnings which is why we joined the military. We got out in 08 during the crash. Bought a home with the VA Loan that was only $8,000 right outside San Francisco. Rented it out cuz we needed to move to LA. Ten years later, took equity and bought a condo. Lived in it for two years. All while going to AFI and slowly buying film equipment that don't use because I switched positions. With the quarantine, I refinanced and bought a house. My condo is now rented to filmmakers. I don't make passive income on the first two rentals, they are being saved for retirement or if shit hits the fan with my career. Sometimes not having family to fall back on makes you hustle harder. 

I recommend buying a house/condo/etc.  You can always find ways to buy equipment if you really need it. This is also dependent on if you buy a house that doesn't require remodeling and that you know basic construction. If it does require remodeling and neither of you are handy, then forget everything I just said and keep renting.",1675209682

This is precisely the problem with Obamacare: it is a new socialized medical program that is coercive, and it will do nothing to improve or reduce the federal deficit.

The memory itself tends to work better in higher temperatures, its the controller that starts to throttle at 70. 

The majority of users aren't pushing their nvme's to the limit. I occasionally push it on my desktop at home when I transfer a library of files, 50-300GB, to another nvme.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","I thought 12tone's ""rebuttal"" was fine. Seemed like a lot of tongue-in-cheek jabs at Adam until the section where they try to insist that just intonation is some backwards concept and equal temperament is all western musicians do now.

What.

12tone brings up a barbershop quartet, but have they ever been in a choir? What choir director worth their salt would insist on an equal tempered major third (or perfect fifth for that matter, but that's a smaller difference)?

Just intonation is a concept from Pythagoras? And where did he get it from? I don't know, maybe this little thing called the harmonic (overtone) series?!?

That part did set me off. Adam's video was fine and 12tone was right to point out that Adam was being selective with the contexts he used for his arguments, but that last bit arguing against just intonation was terrible.

To be clear, I am not saying that just intonation is the be-all, end-all. However, 12tone comes across as if they are heavily favouring equal temperament as the only way to approach staff notation and I just don't think that's correct. Maybe for piano players, but for any instruments that can modify pitch (basically any that aren't built in a keyboard fashion) equal temperament is certainly the core concept of staff notation, but not the only possibility.",1675209684

Still, it's resistant enough that using it for that purpose here and there will likely not cause any issues, my advice about not using it was more for long term.

I'm not even trying to armchair diagnose, I'm speaking from the experience of someone with Tourettes, the disorder itself can cause impulse control issues and is still in the infancy of us truly figuring out what causes it and what it causes. Tourettes can catch other impulse control disorders under its umbrella causing them to go undiagnosed because the symptoms have already been attributed to multiple co-morbidities, psychologist are not magic people who can see what your brain has going on, if this wasnt brought up its likely it could have been looked over.

When you read all of the matchmaking parts, it's actually very worrying when you realise your performance in a match doesn't effect your matchmaking rating (mmr). So you could do nothing all game, win and get a more positive rating overall.
And the opposite, you could have a really good game but lose to a better team and it was all for nothing, as your performance means squat.
 You remove the reward for improving as a player.

They even admit ""not all players are at the right rating"". So your system doesn't work for every one... so we all run the risk of having unbalanced games.

To cut through the BS and comment on the heart of the matter:

We live in a representative democracy.  When we elect a politician, we are endorsing him to represent us on the matters related to his office.   When we allow our representatives behave poorly in public or pass bills that are aimed at disenfranchising minorities or infringe on privacy rights of its citizens, then we are condoning their actions and their actions are a reflection on us.

this teacher ends up being equally useless, taught us blatant misinformation and straight up ignored another students homophobic and racist rants. then again, out of nowhere, this teacher was fired with no information and the original teacher was back. we basically had to learn everything on our own. i was personally forced to have a full brazilian wax done despite disclosing SA trauma to my teacher with the threat of being failed, while the student who continually made homophobic/racist remarks was allowed to opt out with no penalty to her grade. their attendance policy is also insane, even if you have a valid excuse to be absent you have to meet with the director every time. many of the staff are loudly antivax and sexist, the director is a nice woman but holy hell that place is mismanaged and has a lot of issues. ive heard good things about NIWE academy.",1675209687

"ADHD_partners","t5_ko7d1","I have a sample size of 3 ADHD exes (I also have ADHD) and two of them wanted to stay ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with me after we broke up so they could continue to use me.

Though in general this is a super common thing among the populace in general as I‚Äôve been lead to believe, not just ADHD people. I‚Äôve known tons of people with exes that will dump them and want to keep acting like nothings wrong, and I doubt all of their exes have ADHD.

One of my ADHD exes was more extreme than the other one though. About three months into our relationship he dumped me because he was ‚Äúhaving anxiety about his ability to be a good boyfriend‚Äù but wanted to stay friends. I was hurt but we hadn‚Äôt been dating that long so I got over it. About a month later we decide to hang out and he immediately starts hugging and kissing me out of nowhere and acting like we never even broke up. I brought up later that I was uncomfortable with that and he was like ‚Äúoopsie woopsie, you were just so pretty and my ADHD made me do it ü•∫üëâüëà‚Äù. I should have ran but I also have ADHD and know what it‚Äôs like to be a bit of an impulsive asshole (though not in that way) + a history of severe childhood trauma‚Ä¶so we started dating again.

At one point he even proposed to me. Then three months later he dumped me citing bullshit reasons like I was ‚Äútoo draining‚Äù, ‚Äúboring to talk to‚Äù, ‚Äúhard to communicate with‚Äù, among others. When I mentioned all the numerous promises he had made towards me he did nothing but victim blame me and told me he couldn‚Äôt trust me like. But of course, despite all of that, he still wanted to be friends! Lol. Lmao. 
Actually a while after he went NC with me because I tore him a new asshole while we were still ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, he tracked down my now current boyfriend to try and do this weird people pleasing ‚Äúpwease be fwiends with me‚Äù shit to my now current bf, which resulted in a swift block.

One of my other ADHD exes was similar in that he would tell me that I was too draining and he wasn‚Äôt getting anything from me even though I was basically his live in maid. But oh he wanted to stay friends anyway, of course.

Sometimes I think ADHD should be renamed to ‚ÄúPissbaby Failson Disease‚Äù even though I also have it. But I‚Äôve made strides to manage mine, I‚Äôm pissed that others won‚Äôt.",1675209688

Nothing wrong with older kids helping out at all but it seems like you‚Äôve been expected to grow up far too young - which is extremely sad.

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","When I was pregnant, with my first child, I went off of lithium and Seroquel and started taking Latuda instead. I believe that was where I went wrong. I had the most severe depression of my life. I was suicidal. My midwife actually ended up calling the cops on me. They came to my home and took me to the hospital in their squad car. Pretty humiliating. I was depressed to the point that I thought I had killed my baby and would be brought to jail upon birthing her dead body. I had done nothing that would warrant this‚Äî I was delusional. I was very surprised when she came out alive. I was in two partial hospitalization programs after my inpatient stay was over. About a month after giving birth, I finally started feeling better. This was due to being put back on lithium and Seroquel and dropping the Latuda. 

When I was pregnant with my second child, it was completely different in every way. I went on Lamictal before trying to conceive, and I have stayed on Lamictal ever since. I felt the best I have ever felt while pregnant on Lamictal. I had gained a lot of weight on Seroquel and lithium, and once I started Lamictal instead, I lost it.

I really think it‚Äôs important to collect these stories of bipolar pregnancy. I read that we are at 7x higher risk for a mood episode when pregnant as opposed to not pregnant

My children are still very small, but I cannot imagine life without them. They are brilliant and extremely creative. I would not be surprised at all, if my eldest, especially, ended up having bipolar. But if she does, I am here for her. I will stay on my medication, exercise, eat well, get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, and limit alcohol. I will try to live a low stress life with time for my hobbies. 

But how am I able to do so? I have a fantastic husband who does nighttime and early morning duties. He is committed to my wellness. When I was so depressed I couldn‚Äôt keep track of my medication, he filled my pillcase for me each week and brought them to me each night to take with a glass of water. If I didn‚Äôt have a great coparent, I might be in trouble. But as it is, I am able to be a fantastic mom. It is way more fun than I thought it would be.",1675209689

The early game scramble for essential stuff while missing a bag is only fun when you have an idea what you need, where to get it and how to make do without while you look for it. And if you are new and don't have clue yet - it is just frustrating. So for new players I highly suggest having it on.

Then there is a question of multihit. There is an air of elitism around players playing without it. And technically you can do without it from the starts but it will be significantly harder. Besides starting with it on and then turning it off is a visible point of growth.

Virus transmission/lethality... Default settings are fun if you don't mind creating a new character every so often. Otherwise no shame in playing with full immunity to zombification. There are still plenty ways to die in combat without every scratch being potential one way ticket.

Knockdown and fence lunge - definitely keep them on.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Seems like you're just kinda repeating yourself here without meaningfully responding to what I said. We can't be sure that God isn't deceiving us regardless of whether he's unknowable, and it's not clear to me that an unknowable God is any more likely to be deceptive than a knowable God (perhaps by definition--if we could know God well enough to evaluate the probability he could be deceptive, he wouldn't be completely unknowable). In fact, if we're taking this level of skepticism towards divine revelation, we don't even have any reason to think God is unknowable in the first place--he could just be *pretending* to be unknowable.

What you're talking about is really just pointing to a broader problem with the nature of empiricism, which is that our observations can appear to support a particular idea and that idea can be totally wrong anyway. And that's certainly true and worth keeping in mind, but it isn't justification for total epistemological nihilism. Instead, we trust our observations until we find some good reason to doubt them.

And when our observation is of a person's claims about their own personal characteristics, unless we have some good reason to suspect they're lying, the default position is to believe them. The mere possibility they *could* be lying (which always exists any time anyone tells you *anything* that you haven't had the opportunity to independently verify) is not reason enough to disbelieve.",1675209689

Hi Lexie,

I appreciate you getting back to me and providing such a thorough job description.

Unfortunately, this position falls quite a bit under my current salary and expectations if I

were to consider a move to another company.

At this point in my car√¶r, to consider a move, I would need the following.

‚Ä¢ $70k/yr base salary

‚Ä¢ Team Lead/Manager role with up to 10 reports

‚Ä¢ Remote/Hybrid work environment

‚Ä¢ M-F core hours

‚Ä¢ Paid holidays

‚Ä¢ Sick day allotment

‚Ä¢ 2 weeks vacation, 3+ after 1+ year w/ company

‚Ä¢ Matching 401k (up to 6%)

‚Ä¢ Education assistance toward business related classes

I'd love to hear of any positions that meet my needs.

Regards,

"wow","t5_2qio8","I honestly thought tinker was going to be released already. In BFA, in the island expeditions, theres 2 teams that show up that had classes we cant access. 

The first team was a team of tinkerers- dps spec had turrets, tank spec drove around a little mech, and the healer had these little drones that scooted around to aoe heal.

The second team was... i donno what to call it. Void mage probably? Looked like tank and 2 dps specs. The tank looked like it had a purple bubble around him, and looked like the bubble could be healed. The 1st dps was a melee dps spec that i guess had something like psy-blades. The 2nd dps was a ranged caster that threw purple shit at you.

"Chromecast","t5_2xz02","In my livingroom, my main setup is an 8 speaker Dolby Atmos Home Theater with a 65"" 4K Sony TV.  In a corner, I also have a retro setup with a Sony Trinitron CRT for retro  games and media.  I use it with Wii, Atari 2600, some other consoles and an old MacMini for streaming media playback from a Plex server and internet.  

I have a lot of 80s music videos in 4x3 aspect ratio on my Plex server.  I find watching and listening to old music videos even some old 4:3 TV shows on a CRT to be quite entertaining.  Same goes for retro consoles.  For example, Star Trek Voyager was shot in SD and there is no HD version.  Watching that on an HD screen is not as good as when you watch it on a CRT.  The picture looks very good and even the image fits the CRT aspect perfectly since a 4:3 CRT TV is the period appropriate display for SD shows like that.

I would like to replace my MacMini with a GoogleTV because it is much easier to use and also I can automate/control it from Home Assistant. 

For example I can automate GoogleTV from Home Assistant and say 'Hey google, play 80s MTV' and it would turn on the Trinitron and start random play of the music videos with Plex app on GoogleTV.  Then I can turn everythig off with a voice command again.

I can get a proper 4x3 resolution from MacMini and use it with my Sony Trinitron.  However, I hate having to use mouse and keyboard for media playback.  

So I would like to use a GoogleTV for media playback on my CRT TV.  So naturally I do not want letterboxed 16:9 image on my 4:3 CRT TV especially for playing back 4:3 content.  480p resolution creates an image appropriate for 4:3 SD TVs.",1675209691

"widowers","t5_2swuk","I too lost my husband suddenly four months ago now, time seems to stand still for me. As if the whole world is just spinning in a circle around me but I can't move I am forever stuck in that day he passed away. That Monday we were laughing and goofing off in the garage as he was installing a light. He was fine the next day Tuesday until in the mid of the night he started spitting up blood, he never woke me. When I woke early Wednesday morning, I saw the trash can so much blood we drove straight to the hospital 10 minutes away. After hours in ER and blood transfusions, they weren't sure what was going on with this health man. We were moved to ICU, every test from Covid to influenza was done and all were negative. We thought ok were in the hospital they will do their thing and we will go home. Every day I came down the hall I thought today I will hear his big bombing voice and laughter. The bleeding was coming from his lung, and they couldn't stop because his antibodies reprogramed themselves and turned on his own body and were eating his blood platelets faster than we could give him blood. By that Friday he was in a coma and on a ventilator, I didn't get to say anything to him. By that Sunday afternoon he was gone. Come to find out it was the 2nd Covid booster that was the cause. The antibodies that are in the boost cause his own antibodies to go against his platelets. Our doctor sent me to have a blood count the day after he passed because we both had the booster at the same time 6 weeks before he passed. He was more than friend, lover, protector. He was the only person in the world that know me --knew everything about me my wants, fears, beliefs and choose to love me we were married for 33 years, and it never changed from the first day to the last our love and want for each other and the joy we had being together never changed. I would see him sit down just to put on his shoes and think this beautiful man is married to me. Seems like every time I turn around, I'm losing something, friends the willingness to breathe or even think I find myself just starring off into space not a thought in my head just numb and blank and I just don't care. The other day I actually receive a letter with the word Miss instead of Mrs  I lost it, everything hit me in the chest and took my breath away. If I didn't have neighbors, I would have screamed NO to the top of my lungs. I just filed our taxes for 2022 and had to claim his death and find out next year 2023 I will need to file single instead of joint married. Just goes on and on.",1675209691

Hey all, this is another from my fathers collection. It‚Äôs a 1973 Spaceview. It still works and keeps time. It needs a new battery though. My father was the original owner until he passed, then I inherited it. The battery died last year around November. Otherwise it kept time up until then. I know he had it serviced a few years ago, but I have no paperwork for it, or the box. It also does not have the original band. I know these are more collectors items these days, but figured someone would be interested. The only defects are minor signs of wear on the case, and a small scratch in the crystal by the Accutron logo. SV 300 obo. If you have any questions please message me!",1675209692

"running","t5_2qlit","Interesting thoughts in the first paragraph though I disagree.   


March is when I am starting and I am starting in Florida where it is not cold, by the time I get to the northern part of the country it will be June at the very least and therefore not cold either. I respect the questioning though.   


Yes I have read born to run along with several other books regarding this topic.  

I have not run an ""ultra"" per say but I have run ultra distances on my own many times throughout the years.   


I am aware of the risks of running on the road and have been doing it for 15+ years now.  I am not brand new to running.  The people with me are fully on board and I have support system that will be taking care of me.  I know how to read a map and have plenty of batteries for all the devices that can help me read one too. Yes I have purchased shoes anywhere from 11-12.5 from my normal size of 11.   


There are many questions I have not thought of yet i am sure which is why I am here.  I will tackle them as they come.  I appreciate the vote of confidence though and some good points in here!",1675209693

If you do want to miss out on too many drunk people if you dont fancy that, get to the stadium nice and early and get to your seat. The fans who go week in week out usually get to the stadium close to the game starting and will be chanting and drinking on the street.

"Scams","t5_2qrt0","AutoModerator has been summoned to explain fake cryptocurrency site scams. Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord. In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake. This scam is also known as the pig butchering scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/na8oax/asian_guygirl_from_online_dating_mentors_you_to/. If you are involved in this scam, you can post the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here on r/scams. If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;Russia democratised in the sense that the empire was already overthrown, largely by social democrats.

&gt;The Bolshevik or October revolution overturned that.

This is true.

But the Social Democrats also failed to meet many of their promises to help ordinary people.  They increasingly fell under the sway of the upper middle class: which fueled resentment among the (generally less wealthy) supporters of Bolshevikism.

Russia was a desperately-poor country, thanks in particular to the Tsars artificially extending Feudalism past its natural lifetime and the devastation of World War I.

You can't really blame people for turning on the Social Democrats when they utterly failed to meet their promises, and then refused to gracefully (and peacefully) concede power to other factions.

When you're starving and illiterate (the Social Democrats did little to extend education to the rural poor: something the Bolsheviks **strongly** championed...  By the 1970's, just 50 years later, the USSR's literacy rate was one of the highest in the world- so they walked the walk, they didn't just talk the talk...) a new and weak Republic doesn't really sound all that important to preserve...

**It's easy to apply our own morality to people living in entirely different circumstances.**  Democracy is obviously an important value to people living in wealthy countries today.  **But REAL historical analysis requires putting yourself in the shoes of the people you are trying to understand, and seeing the world with their values and needs in mind...**",1675209694

"cricut","t5_2tkav","&gt; However, I did login using the app on my iPad, close the app, turn off wifi, then open Design Space again successfully with wifi still turned off. All my locally saved stuff was available to work on while not on the internet.

So you can open the app with the ipad great! The desktop version doesn't work that way. But you were already logged into your account before turning off wifi, right? 

What I said was that you cannot whatsoever log into your account WITHOUT wifi connection. You can use design space only AFTER you have logged in, made sure you saved the files. But what if you need to upload new files? You can't upload new files without internet connection. You can't login without internet connection. It's a pain.

I've read the faq and I never said you were 100% incapable of using cricut design space without internet connection. You have to have uploaded and saved the images in both the cloud and device AND have already been logged in BEFORE going offline. A lot of preparation with limitations still.

So my statement still stands: you need internet connection to login to your cricut design space account.

Edit: from the [FAQ](https://help.cricut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034704133-Design-Space-for-Desktop-Offline-Feature-FAQ) supporting my statement

A few tips:

* I've DM'd you a link to submit your round with the correct title.
* Make sure your round can't be solved using Reverse-Image-Search (RIS):
    * Google isn't the only RIS engine! Try using a browser extension like Reveye ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reveye-ris/)) to check multiple engines at once.
    * If you need to, you can apply a mask to your image to trick RIS. Try our online masking tool [here](https://imagemasker.github.io).
* Once you've got the next round up, let us know how you solved this one!

Die SPD hat schon seit der Agenda 2010 keine Ann√§hernd sozialdemokratischen Ziele mehr verfolgt und die Linke hat sich selbst zerfleischt. Mittlerweile hat sich die AFD, die im Endeffekt die NPD mit besserem Marketing ist als nahezu Volkspartei etabliert und CDU und FDP sind immer noch die gleichen Verbrecher die sie immer waren. ""Culture war"" Debatten aus den USA wurden importiert und ""links"" zu sein hei√üt jetzt einfach nur noch nicht offen rassistisch oder Homophob zu sein, etwas was fr√ºher einfach Mal Liberal oder ""normal"" hie√ü.

"Dewalt","t5_2t7wy","A lot of what you've said is opinion, and obviously if it's not the right tool it's not the right tool. That being said:

&gt;Hand vibration. I don't own a battery operated one so don't know how little they vibrate,

In my experience, electric chainsaws have almost zero vibration compared to petrol saws, be they stihl/husqvarna, or be they cheapo ones. Much more pleasant on the hand

&gt;You are using a freaking chain saw, your entire focus should be on it

And yet situational awareness, especially in the wild (or again in dangerous scenarios), on construction sites (if its being cleared for example) and dare I say it, in your back garden, is paramount. Furthermore, people near you have better situational awareness too because there isn't a 100+dB engine howling away.

&gt;Pissing the neighbors off: you use it in the day time

And yet still neighbours will choose to be pissy, especially if they've hung their laundry out and it now smells of two stroke exhaust.

&gt;So I don't see how the carcinogen risk is any higher than sitting in traffic on a motorcycle.

Poorly combusted two stroke mix with heavy hydrocarbons [is substantially more carcinogenic than car fumes](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/dangers-of-twostroke-engines-20090531-brat.html) and even at small quantities, over a long career, its bad for you. Might as well argue you don't need hearing or eye protection IMO. On the subject of sitting in traffic huffing diesel fumes on a bike, [I'm afraid I've got bad news there too ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773213/)


&gt;hot for half a day

I meant hot after half a day of running, my apologies for being unclear

&gt;Again I'll state it, I keep hoping for a real benefit to replacing my Husqvarna with one.

If the above aren't benefits then fair enough, but for me the pros here massively outweigh the cons. I don't want my kids or I inhaling two stroke exhaust if I can avoid it. I don't want any of us getting hearing damage either. Plain as day, I'm happy with that. If I was on a farm and having to lug stacks of batteries around the metric would be vastly different, but for me that isn't the case.",1675209695

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Surgical Neurophysiologist. 

It's difficult in that there are so many aspects to consider such as technical, surgical, physiologic, anesthetic, etc when interpreting data and most frequently you have a matter of seconds to minutes to run through all the possible reasons for changes in data to report to a surgeon. The amount of knowledge you need in the minute details of anatomy and physiology to truly be at the top of the field is incredible. 

It's also very demanding on the body and mind (no food, water, bathroom breaks for the entirety of surgery). 

I've spent 10 years in the field and I am considered an ""expert."" It's taken years of dedication to research and learning on my own time, taking on additional work in other areas of the field, etc to get to level I am now. It can be exhausting but it's truly so rewarding to see good patient outcomes and also to help train and teach new Neurophysiologists.",1675209695

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I agree.  

But still, it makes me wonder who in the company would have time to read such a document.  Does the hiring manager only have free time in their busy schedule between 8pm and 2am?  Is the manager going to share it with junior employees in an effort to look for ideas you‚Äôd normally Implement as a member of staff and then do it themself?

Seems like an exercise in futility for the applicant.  If someone can make two hours time to read and digest a 10 page document, why in the world can‚Äôt they schedule a 30 minute call or meeting in person for an interview?   

I‚Äôd pass as well.  I saw first hand how family prepared a 40-minute presentation for SpaceX, as part of an interview for a job.   They closed the requisition after my family interviewed, and later my family found out SpaceX implemented the suggestions in the presentation.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually loved Extraction. Stupid white savior bullshit aside, it is a really good (western) action movie and I absolutely love the cinematography. It is one of many ""action movies shot by action stars"" that have revolutionized the western world\*

That said? I think I was watching a Corridor Crew video where they showed how The ""Oner"" was filmed and... holy shit everyone is lucky that Sam Hargrave is not dead. He got dangerously close to having his legs crushed in a collision all because they wanted a shot that they were editing anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why I again cite Science Youtube. Don't get me wrong: for as much as I love Safety Third and his channel, William Osman is a god damned moron who definitely takes stupid risks sometimes. But usually, you can see the very clear edits in his videos. He'll joke about how he is standing on top of a track where saw blades are going to fire at him and then there is a very clear cut where he is off to the side when they actually start up. And plenty of youtubers have figured out similar approaches. Get the money shot and then walk away from the camera so you aren't firing bullets and explosives at yourself

&amp;#x200B;

Yet ""hollywood"" directors still insist on having someone right behind the camera because you NEED that shot. And, done correctly, that is more or less safe. But you know what is a whole lot safer?

Getting the angle lined up and then looking at your tablet instead of the viewfinder. That way, if there is a mistake and an actual bullet flies in that direction? you aren't standing there.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello readers, welcome to OCpoetry. This subreddit is a writing workshop community -- a place where poets of all skill levels can share, enjoy, and talk about each other's poetry. Every person who's shared, including the OP above, has given some feedback (those are the links in the post) and hopes to receive some in return (from you, the readers).

If you really enjoyed this poem and just want to drop a quick comment, to show some appreciation or give kudos, things like ""great job!"" or ""made me cry"", or ""loved it"" or ""so relateable"", please do. Everyone loves a compliment. Thanks for taking the time to read and enjoy.

If you want to share your own poem, you'll need to give this writer some detailed feedback. Good feedback explains from your point of view what it was like to read the poem, and then tries to explain how the poem made you feel like that. If you're not sure what that means, check out our [feedback guide](https://new.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques), or look through the comment sections of any other post here, or click the links to the author's feedback above. If you're not sure whether your comments are feedback, or you have any other questions, please send us a modmail.

Whether it's working with a professional, doing therapy, getting clear on your relationship vision, learning how to date, developing self-awareness so you're clear on what you need and want (to ensure you date wisely), etc. So this doesn't always mean something is wrong or that needs to be fixed.

I believe the way Cali and Colorado, is what has helped more the adult use and medical use forward. A lot of non smokers vote for pro adult and medical cannabis.

Jones: ‚Äî of why women think that they can make men change? I do not know.

Crowd: Yeah. Applause.

[shortwave radio transmission continues from time to time in background]

Jones: Or fuck them and somebody else. Or don‚Äôt baby them. Or don‚Äôt take care of their shit and don‚Äôt put up with their dirt. And do‚Äî you do your lion‚Äôs share of the load of the work. Even fucking them isn‚Äôt enough.

Crowd: Right.

Jones: You gotta be fucked over.	

Scattered voices: Right.

Woman: Okay. The reason you think‚Äî

Jones: You didn‚Äôt say many amens to that, but you got to be willing to be fucked over. (Pause) The only good relationships I‚Äôve ever seen around this place, where there wasn‚Äôt really any fucking going on, but a mutual sharing of the work.

(Pause) Ethel Waters‚Äî I mean, not Ethel Waters‚Äî That Lena Horne, most beautiful woman, that man, man broke her heart right there, most beautiful black woman ever coming down the track.

12.23 was the Set 8 release patch on December 6 and it had a B patch on December 14th before Riot went on their holiday break. 13.1 was on January 10th and got a B patch on January 17th but Riot also had the data breach that meant they couldn't push full patches so we got a C patch on the 24th and AFAIK the ETA of patch 13.3 (they're just skipping 13.2 and pushing all of the content into 13.3 to stay on their announced schedule) is February 8th.

Remember that Riot can only really do bugfixes or numbers changes on B-patches we basically spent 5 weeks on patch 12.23 and 4 weeks on patch 13.1 so there have been two opportunities for them to make substantial changes. 

This is admittedly kind of a chicken and the egg thing, they haven't been able to push patches so they feel the need to make drastic adjustments but had they been on the regular 2 week patch cycle with a b-patch if necessary that we're used to, they may have been able to tweak things to not necessitate the drastic adjustment.",1675209697

The all-time favorite though, is to make a powerpoint about whatever we're learning about. It's basically whatever assignment I want them doing anyway, they can just condense it onto slides and play around with the animations and stuff. Some of them have gotten really great it!

But really, I keep moving pretty quickly so there's not a ton of downtime too often. Be careful not to slow down for the slowest learners, you have to keep going and they'll still be learning even if they don't finish and master everything (which is unrealistic for a lot of our kids).

A Beautiful Mind is both a true story and has a twist. 

Classic but fight club if you‚Äôve not seen it.

According to Wikipedia, he mentioned Monotonality as a theoretical concept... Well. I'll let him say it:

""According to this principle, every digression from the tonic is considered to be still within the tonality, whether directly or indirectly, closely or remotely related. In other words, there is only one tonality in a piece, and every segment formerly considered as another tonality is only a region, a harmonic contrast within that tonality...subordinate to the central power of \[its\] tonic. Thus comprehension of the harmonic unity within a piece is achieved.""

Atonality, on the other hand, has no 'key'. As there is no 'mono' found on the atonal page, I'm thinking there is no relationship between the two concepts.

You skipped the ""accessable"" point and I think it's because you underestimate it's importance. Over time the inconveniences of the black market will drive more people to the legal market even if we assume perfectly equal weed. Additionally black market supplies are never as reliable as legal supplies and people do pay a premium for reliable over quality quite often. The legal market prices don't need to come down nearly as much as you imagine it just needs time to stabilize. 

&gt;If doesn't need to take decades, they just need to stop with their ""reefer madness"" bias when it comes to weed. Had they regulated and taxed marijuana the same was as they do alcohol we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

All of the good agents I work with stay out of it completely unless I specifically request their assistance (due to long or complex chains).

"NewMaxx","t5_11y3o7","E16 is even worse...very high TBW (higher than E12) with a higher failure rate and full-drive SLC caching almost across the board (there are a few models I've seen that acted different). Corsair has several ""MP600"" models which makes it confusing to make sense of, I don't use ""Force"" even though they have had that in their lineup forever. Actually, their MP600 XT Pro is one of the ""good"" E18s for caching, and yes I know. Jumble of nonsense but not as bad as Team at least. E16 was a popular choice for caching drives because people looked at the TBW (wrongly), although E12s are mostly good for it - including some IronWolf SSDs.

Endurance and reliability doesn't really translate meaningfully with consumer/retail SSDs. I'd say vertically-integrated ones are better off but Samsung has screwed that lately and other brands have hardware swapped (WD, Crucial). Hynix might be the best one remaining. I'm still a fan of WD's drives, though, SN700 (which is NAS-branded) but also SN850X and I use SN750s still for my own stuff (but that seems to have different flash now).

Gen4 vs Gen3 is an issue due to efficiency and other elements with newer hardware being mostly Gen4 aside from maybe the Gold P31. Caching needs are not in-line with most consumer drives. Etc...",1675209701

   * Real amyr: selitos and his followers trying to confound the chandrian
   * Human Amyr: the Tehlin church's strong right hand until they disbanded them, or the chandrian somehow turned the church against them
* Iax is Encanis, but is Tehlu someone else too? 

&amp;#x200B;

If the chandrian started the human amyr, then it stands to reason that the ""real amyr"" would fight against the ""human amyr""

If Menda Tehlu is just a man being skin-danced, then ""angel Tehlu"" would likely want to fight ""Menda Tehlu""

or is it because guys who normally have more testosterone also tend to:

1. be more healthy
2. have more muscles
3. (and then also have the other mental side effects of having higher T all the time)

you/i/we can inject all we want to try and force #3, but that can only happen so much.  you still need to eat well, sleep, build a healthy body.  you can't just inject 10ml of test per week and win at becoming man.

"PvZGardenWarfare","t5_305ov","There is a case for Party/default/Iron Citron to be the strongest characters in the entire game.  
at least in theory.  
Give a character a titanic amount of general health and frontal protection for himself, a nearly unavoidable self-serving stun, and all-around mobility is second to none - speedghosting/swoocing and hyperball. Oh, and he has a powerful primary from close to mid-range, excellent accuracy.  
this might be a bit long -  
all the s-tier candidates, the strongest in the game, still have some weaknesses in general when considering all game modes.  
Corns are the best class for turf, with continual area denial through butter barrage and shuck shots forcing zombies off points. any mechs trying to stay in a point to contest it are shredded by husk hop, even easier when they're gooped or stunned. it doesn't matter if you die, they can come right back and apply heavy pressure to objectives on offense and defense. this is where his weakness, mobility, doesn't matter. But it is a weakness nonetheless  
soldier has as good of a primary as corn in that he only shoots from his right side and is able to hide his body when shooting, but has much less ammo, and is still an amazing generalist. his weaknesses aren't anything in particular, just that specialized classes are stronger for those roles.  
agent pea is amazing. period. But even though a individual zombie cannot rival his damage output, when health is put into consideration and the fact that you cannot always ambush enemies, he can die as quickly as he shreds zombies. He is phenomenal but his specialty is in surprising people by dealing brutal damage at a relatively closer range (projectile speed is an issue at longer ranges and bunny hopping exists). all-star may have a fat hitbox that's easy to hit, but hockeystar can literally take a agent pea down with it regardless of hyper or not.  
law pea is truly godlike if all shots connect. he only isn't able to sustain a devastating assault over time like corn or even agent pea. not much else. Projectile speed is still a issue at longer range although him being a burst fire character helps. his recoil and bloom is still there, but generally can be a undisputed top 5 best in game with accuracy and clickspeed.   
plasma pea does not have many weaknesses either. perhaps a bit of projectile speed and law/agent and that's it.

astronaut and future are phenomenal and only are lessened by their abilities. mechanic doesn't have a weakness that I can point to.

however ...

Citrons have *everything* that any situation in the game requires of them, except for sniping. the tools to close long open lanes (swoocing/speedghosting), a faster form of jackhammer,, increased speed in general, all the benefits in offense, defense, and whatever else with empeach to save himself in a fight, or a shield to save himself again. There are many situations in which corn's incredible pressure is better, agent pea's close-range ambush is deadlier, or law pea can kill faster. However Citron has more tools than every one of them, and enough that I would say that he is the general strongest in the game with quite a few characters right behind him.",1675209703

But they can also make things so much better. Seroquel literally saved my life. It erased my suicidal thoughts overnight literally. It made me very sleepy though so I switched to Abilify which didn't work for me, and then vraylar which I'm on now. For a while I was experiencing anger issues so we supplemented with Risperdal for a short time until that subsided. I've been on vraylar about 2 years I think and I'm very stable. I sadly have lost my sex drive but I will be discussing this with my psychiatrist when I next see him. I believe reducing my dosage should help resolve my issues. 

All of this to say that while antipsychotics should not be treated lightly, they can help you. It may take a few tries to find the right one for you, but if you are communicative with your doctor and advocate for yourself and how you feel on your medication things should go well for you even if not perfectly.

I had a MMC prior to my current pregnancy (I'm currently 34w6d and everything is going well!). However, I had a ton of anxiety going into this pregnancy. First, I was up front with my OBGYN and told her how anxious I was. She asked me what would help, and we talked about a game plan for appointments. Next, I went back to my therapist who I'd seen for anxiety in the past. I decided not to take anxiety meds while pregnant, but there are some safe options, which I also talked about with my OB. Also, I was encouraged to use the MyChart to contact my OB whenever I had questions, and I talked to my husband a lot. When I wasn't sick or exhausted, I did things that supported my mental health. For example, hiking, walking, swimming, reading, etc. Over time, the anxiety lessened, especially with each milestone that we hit. I hope that will be the same for you!",1675209704

The Chinese junta that occupied Taiwan from 1945 to the 1990s is not the same thing as the Taiwanese government today. Either way, the PRC continues to view any declaration of independence (i.e. renunciation of claims to be China) as a red line.

NATO will not be involved in the Pacific. Such war would indeed lead to drastic effects throughout the entire world, but not militarily.

"canada","t5_2qh68","If the grid is an issue, we should be focused on PHEVs instead of EVs. PHEVs have 1/10th the batteries and require 1/10th the energy and 1/10th the time to charge. They also have 1/10th the EV mode range, typically 50 km, but for 90% of people that will cover over 90% of their daily use. The rest of the time it will switch to HEV mode and still get better fuel economy than an ICEV, and there is no range anxiety.

An EV reduces 1 driver's fuel usage by 100%. With 1/10th the battery per PHEV, we can build 10 PHEVs. 10 PHEV drivers reducing their fuel usage by over 90% means a 900% savings in fuel per kWh of battery.

Why are we all focused on pure EVs when battery supply is lacking and EVs are still an immature product?",1675209706

I played on a fresh server as the only player on the whole server once. Let's say the game felt crisp. Doors in the MSR respond instantly. AI bad guys have perfect aim and actually do use tactics to hunt you in UGFs. So the turrets will likely have zero issues tracking and putting direct shots on targets.

When server meshing is a thing, we can expect to see servers get the kind of love that they need. This will resolve so many technical issues.

As for crime stats... The changes in the ptu do address this to a minor degree. You no longer have to worry about crime stats 1-2 being a serious thing...

I still primarily use SMS and regular mobile voice calls, which can obviously be intercepted by the government.

That's how unimportant I think end-to-end encrypted messaging apps are - when it's free and widely available, I simply can't be arsed with the slightest inconvenience.

Given that electronic communications are extremely important for securing convictions, going back to the ""dark ages"" of 2015 seems like a reasonable trade off to me.

Some parents of children at their school were making huge financial sacrifices, some had help from grandparents, many were 'old' money, some of the children had scholarships and some, like ours, had military parents. Social divides were of no interest. Our kids went to parties in castles and their castle owning friends very happily slummed it at our Army quarter.

What was so obvious was that the very small class sizes and devoted pastoral care meant that your child's particular talent and interests, and those areas where they struggled were quickly identified. They were encouraged to develop their talents and follow their dreams. There was no cookie-cutter element. One of their schoolfriends is now a fashion designer, one an opera singer, one runs a yoga retreat in Greece. They were exposed to really interesting experiences and heavily supported to follow passions and interests.

All of the kids are thriving, emotionally, professionally and financially. Our children were qualified in their chosen professions and on the property ladder in their mid twenties with no help from us (we'd spent all our money on their education!).

I think you can already tell how this is made. A few days after that i am at dinner with my mom, and she says, ""so i found your little contraption in your bathroom closet."" I was honestly thinking that she would be upset because i have decently strict parents, but she didnt think much of it and just simply said, ""its fine every guy does it.""

Edit:
Don't forget - Bachchan quit acting at the height of his career when he was probably bored, tried his hand at other things, lost all his money, attempted a comeback and found the world had moved on in just a few years. 

Then he found a cultural niche as the nation's patriarch and is back with a vengeance. He probably gets a high being around younger people, it keeps him active and mentally young.

[Original Source](https://verificado.com.mx/circula-imagen-falsa-movilidad-taxis/)

*****

 &gt; An image supposedly published by the Secretary of Mobility and Urban Planning of Nuevo Le√≥n has been disseminated on social networks informing all taxi drivers that they cannot refuse short trips or charge minimum fares, but this is false.

&gt; Users have detected various irregularities such as taxi drivers rejecting long rides, since some only accept short rides that charge between 35 and 40 pesos.

&gt; According to an exercise carried out by El Norte, a TPA taxi charged 700 pesos to journalists who traveled from Terminal A, in Apodaca, to G√≥mez Mor√≠n and Alfonso Reyes, in Colonia Jer√≥nimo Siller, in San Pedro.

&gt; Another trip they made was from the airport to Paseo de los Leones and Pedro Infante, in the Cumbres Las Palmas Residencial neighborhood, in Monterrey.

&gt; The number to make a report that appears in the image broadcast on the networks is also incorrect, so to file any complaint about any anomaly, damage and mishandling of the service offered by public transport in Nuevo Le√≥n, such as urban trucks , school buses and taxis are as follows: By Liliana El√≥seguiA message distributed through WhatsApp alerted users to an alleged ""hack"" on the Tax Administration Service portal... By Leslie OrozcoOn Twitter, a photograph that supposedly shows a group of hooded women outside the facilities of the Revolutionary Party...

The rise of modern technology, not any new ideology, revolutionary or otherwise, is the only reason that many are free today.

Where did she talk about this? Makes me think of [this piece](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/second-thoughts-on-james-burnham/) from George Orwell writing about the ideas of James Burnham:

""When Burnham‚Äôs master, Machiavelli, was writing, class divisions were not only unavoidable, but desirable. So long as methods of production were primitive, the great mass of the people were necessarily tied down to dreary, exhausting manual labour: and a few people had to be set free from such labour, otherwise civilization could not maintain itself, let alone make any progress. But since the arrival of the machine the whole pattern has altered. The justification for class distinctions, if there is a justification, is no longer the same, because there is no mechanical reason why the average human being should continue to be a drudge. True, drudgery persists; class distinctions are probably re-establishing themselves in a new form, and individual liberty is on the down-grade: but as these developments are now technically avoidable, they must have some psychological cause which Burnham makes no attempt to discover.""",1675209710

Heavy assaults are so braindead that the moment your elevation switches by more than half a planetman their aim becomes BR 20. With that in mind try Unstable ammo on it. If you don't plan on using it for mid air combat then go with soft point. Eclipse also has smoke launcher if that interests you. If you are an LA main looking to switch faction definitely to NSO.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Thank you AxeManMike for your submission! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

Your post has been removed as it is in violation of Rule 2: Posts must ask for advice.

# 2. Posts must ask for advice.

^According ^to ^Oxford, ^""Advice"" ^is ^defined ^as ^""guidance ^or ^recommendations ^offered ^with ^regard ^to ^prudent ^future ^action"".

* ***Your post MUST have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on.*** 

Posts that are too short, vague, or lacking of important backstory may be removed. The more detail you give us, the better the advice is that we can give you. Help us help you.

* ***""Why does this person do/say this thing?"" is not advice. We are not mind readers, we do not know why the person is doing that thing.***

* ***Rant posts, and anything like ""I just need to vent / need someone to talk to"" belong in r/vent, r/rant, r/offmychest, r/needafriend, r/casualconversation.***

* ***No random, general, or hypothetical questions. For general questions and answers go to r/answers, r/askreddit, r/nostupidquestions.***

* ***No posts seeking advice or ideas on revenge***

* ***Update posts are only allowed if you are asking for additional advice. Plain old updates should be added as an edit to the original post.***

* ***No posts offering general unsolicited advice.*** 

This includes motivational quotes and inspirational stories. Again; your post ***MUST*** have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on. 

* ***No advertising, proselytizing or self promotion allowed in posts or comments.***

Any self-promotion whether obvious or not (like if you feign seeking criticism to subtly try to drive people to your site) will get you banned.

* ***No soliciting money***

You will be banned instantly if you ask for money, donations, or link to a gofundme, paypal, venmo, anything. Try r/Assistance or r/Borrow.

* ***No posts about critiquing appearance or looks.*** 

These would be more appropriate in subs like r/amiugly, r/rateme, and fashion advice subs like r/malefashionadvice and r/femalefashionadvice.

* ***No meta posts.*** 

For questions about reddit itself, or if you are new to reddit, see r/help, or r/NewToReddit. If you don't know where to post, try r/findareddit. If you are asking for help moderating or creating a subreddit, try r/modhelp. No posts asking how to get unbanned from another sub. If you have concerns about this subreddit, message the moderators. 

* ***No asking to be privately messaged.***

Keep the conversation in r/advice. Posts asking for private messages will be removed. **Do not accept advice from unsolicited messages**. These users are likely either banned from the sub for whatever reason or are giving advice that they know is bad and don't want to post where moderators can see it and remove it.

Please [review the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/about/rules), and if you feel as though removal is excessive or in error, feel free to [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Advice).

"Hidradenitis","t5_2sq8b","The best environment for a wound to heal, is a moist environment (contrary to what we're told about 'letting the air get to it'). That's because if a wound is moist, it allows for new tissue to grow quicker, allows dead tissue to breakdown quicker, and decreases pain. A moist wound is supposed to heal 3 times quicker than a dry wound, and believe it or not, reduces infection risk by decreasing oxygen in the wound bed and balancing wound pH.

So it's always a good idea to use some form of dressing that allows for a moist wound environment while also being absorbant enough to remove exudate off of the skin surface. I use Mepilex Border dressings as they do just that, but there are lots of different brands that do the same thing.

If you have a particularly large wound, I also use Flaminal Gel. It's a gel designed to moisten the wound and allow for dead tissue to come away quicker, therefore quicker healing. It is non-sting and you literally fill the wound up with the gel and then stick your bandage on top.

Then remembering to drink plenty of fluids and eat food with plenty of nutrients can help with healing. Fluids again help to keep the wound moist, and allow nutrients and oxygen to be carried to the wound more effectively. A good sleep pattern is also important, our bodies heal better and faster while we're asleep, especially at certain points of the sleep cycle.

I'm not medically trained so do seek a doctors advice if your wounds won't heal, but I am trained in wound management and tissue viability.",1675209711

"bayarea","t5_2qjyy","Decisions are data driven.  But that isn‚Äôt all that happens either.  Marketing is really broad. And sometimes there isn‚Äôt data yet. I think there is an idea that marketer spend all day making pretty content or something - but it is super varied on what needs to get done. How it gets done. And what‚Äôs needed. 

I‚Äôm a marketer and one of my projects this week is to figure out what industries make sense for us to target. So yeah we need to do some data analysis to size the opportunity. And then we are going to need some lists.  This is all pretty good for AI. 

We are also going to need to figure out what channels to do outreach in. Some of that might be research. And a lot of that will end up being project management. And eventually we are going to need a message and content. And a plan to help us figure out the impact and how to measure success. 

And then the ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù will happen in all the channels. And well do the work that creates. Let‚Äôs say it is a Facebook ad and a sales outreach plan. So make the content and post it (I am simplifying- but this created design and copy work. And then just basic stuff like uploading it to ad platform. If we were advertising in the New York Times then they‚Äôd have more people internally to Mansur your process. Facebook is 100%?self serve.  Hypothetically we could even do an in-person event.

Difference is Russia is an ex-superpower and a 2nd rate player to America(and its NATO vassals). With this context it does seem a lot more likely that America was getting Russia to pick its poison: a) lose land that was the last buffer to the exposed critical heartland of Russia or b) significantly destabilise itself economically and destroy its connections and influence with Europe.

I worked 6 years in the same place and I love the crazy ass people I worked with, hanging out after work and so on. Never wanted to be a server though, servers would crush what we make at Amazon yearly but they have to know their shit inside and out and have unreal people skills. I know one server where I worked that made more than AM salaries.

This place was ritsy, away teams from various cities would dine here the night before a big game. News anchors, Don King, the RNC convention was in Cleveland in 2016 and a lot of high profile politicians dined with us. Even without the celebrities it was an absolute riot. Scaaaaaandalous shit.

Enjoying the stability of Amazon though. No slow season that translates into less tips or having to take the cut from certain shifts. Iwas just late every day for a few weeks and no one said anything or guilt tripped me for not being there, no being begged to come in on a day off because x didn't show up. My UPT took a major hit I think I just had the blues tbh but I didn't dig into PTO or vacation and I'm getting my hours back up.

If your aid isn't federal, that wouldn't be something that would block you automatically ‚Äî and since you can't sign up for selective service, you probably don't have federal aid to begin with.

It looks like Trump (of course) halted the MAVNI program, which is how you could have joined the military. I'd honestly keep an eye on seeing if that ever reopens. The military has major, major retention and recruitment issues. I won't be surprised if MAVNI resumes in the next few years. It really comes down to Republicans losing power or the military getting desperate.

Have you considered Europe? They have many MA programs that are free or very cheap, and many are taught in English.

That's a shame you don't meet DACA ‚Äî but then that means you came over a lot older than you let on. Sadly, without DACA, your only option is to head back to wherever your citizenship is. It sucks your parents did this to you, no matter the intentions. Overstaying a tourist visa is pretty negligent w/r/t the impact it'd have on their children. 
The situation for people in your position is sad. I have a lot of sympathy, as my dad was an unaccompanied child refugee when he came to the US at age 10. Many of my relatives were asylum seekers or came to the US illegally when people from their country were still getting preferential treatment from the government for legal residency; I don't like how they got special passes to residency, but many other people in similar cases can no longer receive the same leeway.",1675209711

"SatisfactoryGame","t5_gs464","I use https://u6.satisfactorytools.com/production

I then get something like [this](https://imgur.com/SRiYQhX.png) and I then do one orange block at a time. The same if it is [a bit more complex](https://i.imgur.com/LN8qZ2u.png) or [more machies](https://imgur.com/kHD009Z.png)

Best not use the second and third image for your builds as they are parts of projects that have changed whle building. The first I have [made into a [blueprint](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/blueprints/index/details/id/2433/name/Iron%2C+wire+and+concrete+factory)

But if you mean the layout on the factory floor, I just take my time and only move on if it is acceptable. This includes deleting hours of work if it does not work out. This happens less and less as I know how much space I need. How I did it in the beginning was with graphic paper. Say I need 20 constructors. They are 1x1 in size, so ideal for this example. I first decide if I want 1x20, 4x5, 5x4, 2x10, 10x2 or 3x7 and 1 empty space for e.g. lifts or even 2 floors so 2 times 2x5.

Say I want to go with 4 rows of 5 machines. That is 4x5. I add a foundation in front and one behind it for belts. So that is 12x5. Perhaps I want to walk in between them, so I add a line, making it 13x5. I then want one to walk around, making it 15x7. Then I want to have stairs to other floors, so I add a row. I pick 15x8. Perhaps I want to add lifts. One side for incoming and one for outgoing, making it 17x8. I want to have a middle window, so 17x9, cause uneven makes a middle one. If I want a brutalism design, then most likely I will use full foundations as wall, so we are ar 19x11.

You get the idea. Add things on graphic paper as you want to add things. No need to put in every detail. Just know that a 1x1 structure is actually 3x1. Then start adding things. Most important is to add the place to walk. That makes things more spacious and will look less cluttered, even if you decide not to do under or over flooring.

Know that constructors are just a bit bigger than 1x1. So what I do is use 3x2 per constructor or I use them per two and use 3x3 for 2. The big advantage is that then you can change the look of the floor and add barriers around them.  Makes it look really nice very easy if combined with under or over feeding. By that I mean using a subfloor.

I also often see in my design that I need e.g. 8 constructors of item A, 10 constructors of item B and 10 assamblers. What I then can do is turn the 8 into 10 (Just typ (8/10)x100 as the percentage and copy that. Then I treat the 2 constructors and the assembler as 1 unit. I did that with my Nuclear where the reactor and the water extractors where seen as 1 unit. Saved in water pipes. Or with the plutonium, where I had 2 blenders, a particle accelerator, a constructor and refinery (Well, I used a packager with a mod with the same recipe) as one unit and made 15 of them.

But that latter one is already pretty advanced. Just start with graphic paper and then try out if what you drew on the paper works out in the game and then adjust your paper with what you learned.",1675209712

There is no way to know for sure whether there was a trust clause since they burned our courthouse during the war, but newspaper accounts of the purchase make no mention of it. If the national denomination cannot produce a trust document then they shouldn't be able to claim our property.

The 4Runner is a more serious vehicle with better off-road capabilities and is a larger vehicle. It‚Äôll drink up gas. It comes with a full-size spare in case you pop one. It‚Äôs very customizable and you can make it into an off-road beast. It‚Äôll climb more advanced rock crawls.

So, the question really becomes how much off-roading will you do and how advanced is it? In most cases, the CX-50 is the more economical and practical vehicle for daily living.",1675209713

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","I can't speak for your gender identity because I'm not you, but let me just say that this is the oldest excuse in the book for invalidating transmascs. It's an excuse I even used on myself to say I couldn't be trans, because I was desperate to be cis and was urgently looking for any reason not to accept myself as trans. But it was just that, an excuse. An excuse for why I shouldn't transition despite feeling wrong about my gender all my life.

I didn't actually feel like being a woman was something negative, I was in love with female empowerment and thought being a woman was the best because I could break stereotypes by being strong and badass. It was a point of pride to me to be a masculine woman. The last thing I wanted was to be basic and gender-conforming by being a masculine man, but it turned out that I'm just that, and I couldn't change it no matter how hard I tried.

The logic that ""women"" want to be trans just to escape misogyny isn't very good logic. Sure, there are some women who have had gone that route and ended up detransitioning, but that's not a usual thing at all, and it's pretty simple to tell if that's you or not with a little introspection. 

A lot of women are upset about being mistreated by men or not having adequate rights, but you don't see them rushing to transition. Look at all the feminists. They feel challenged by living life as women, but they still feel very proud to be women. Being exposed to sexism doesn't make them hate having high voices and breasts, it makes them want to fight for their rights.

The running from misogyny logic is especially dumb when you consider how much transphobia we have to deal with. My life is WAY harder as a trans man than it ever was when I pretended to be a cis woman. Being trans doesn't offer me an escape from anything difficult in my life, it only makes stuff more difficult than I could have imagined. I would have a far easier time if I was cis.

But let's ignore the fact that the argument is bullshit. Even if sexism had something to do with you wanting to transition, why would it matter? You don't owe it to anyone to be miserable. If living your life as a guy makes you happier then you should do it. It doesn't matter *why* it makes you happy, you deserve to be happy no matter what the reason is.

You're really the only person who can know your gender, but I'll note that having crippling body dysphoria is not a usual thing for a cis woman. Your identity is up to you to decide, but it should only be what feels right to you, not what anyone guilts you into.

If you're really unsure, here's a question you can ask yourself. If men and women had completely equal rights and there was no societal challenge to being female, would you want to be a woman or would you still want to be a guy?",1675209713

Yet I still pull chicks. Sure, most of them aren't the 10/10 supermodel looking ass types, but that doesn't really matter in the long run. But it's not like they look that bad either. You just have to find the girl that's right for you. Maybe you'll have to lower your standards a bit, but it's better than being alone for the rest of your life. Also, some really cliche advice, but hit the gym. A good looking physique can make up for a lack of face. And if your personality is great too, then you're good to go.

The anime industry is so insular and self-referential, I guess this is the natural result when an anime deviating even slightly from that, from what I'm hearing. That's not really a good thing. *Chainsaw Man* isn't **that** atypical either, that's the worst part.

I grew up in a household that was very tolerant, open minded, and accepting of a lot. My mother always gave me freedom and supported me on religious beliefs, she supported two of my step siblings when they came out as trans, etc. 

And I'm sure if she would have lived long enough to see it, she would have supported me doing the plant based thing as well, even if she ate a decent amount of meat herself. She even used to always buy and make a crap ton of vegetarian stuff for me growing up, whenever she could, cuz she knew I liked it and really wasn't the biggest meat eater.

My point is, growing up like that (despite its bumps and bruises) was fantastic. It allowed her and I to have good conversations, be relatively close to each other, and just have an all around good relationship. Had she forced me into a particular box, I would have grown to hate it and probably never give any of it a second thought. But, now, for better or worse, I am my own person, making my own decisions, trying to do my best. And I think that's all she really could have hoped for. That anyone could hope for, out of their loved ones, imo.

I honestly appreciate your reply. It was lovely to read. Take care!",1675209718

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","Obviously you'll find people who are successful doing either. My personal experience as someone who stayed for his first postdoc at the same institution as my PhD: You will be docked points on ""(international) mobility"" on pretty much any grant proposal that you'll put in. The reasoning is that by staying in the same institution you are not growing your network and not getting different perspectives, experiences, etc. For me, it was a sucky assessment: the institution I worked at was top ranked in the field in my country, literally one of the best (if not best) places for the kind of research I was doing. But grant reviewers don't necessarily know this, or they care more about the checkmarks of a ""successful"" researcher.

A colleague who graduated her PhD cum laude literally got sent away by her supervisor because he felt it would not be good for her career to stay. Did her postdoc elsewhere, got two important grant proposals funded, and is now an associate prof at the institute we started at.

It depends on your country and field if you're dependent on grant money to get considered for tenure-track positions. If you are, you need to strongly consider the optics of your choices and activities. Moving to a different institute for your postdoc is the safest bet in my opinion.",1675209718

Ah yes sorry I should have made it clearer. The first part of my first message is only about the MC's fighting style, regardless of the power system, and the last paragraph is just the power system that I'd like to see. 

&gt; Come to think of it, it is odd that this unique power system you describe is present in nearly every shounen, such as Bleach, One Piece, Fire Force, MHA, etc, but progression fantasies almost always use a singular power system with a less unique fighting style per character.

Yeah it's a bit surprising considering that it's very common in shonen and lots of PF authors seem to have some awareness of these shounen.

Unique powers are seen in stories that deal with superheroes but apart from this setting they seem pretty rare.",1675209718

It's one thing to allow PVP rolls if everyone agrees to it beforehand. That's a choice you can make for your table. I don't love it, but it can probably work out okay if nobody is a dick.

It's another thing to say you should follow the roll. Your character's decision isn't dictated by another character's stats. ""RP metagaming"" is a pretty silly concept that sort of boils down to the Charisma munchkin being butthurt that his low IRL charisma overrides all his munchkining.

If you want to persuade an NPC, you roll persuasion. If you want to persuade a PC, you have to actually persuade them. Rolls don't cut it, you have to convince the player that this is something their character would accept. Now, maybe the player is basically on board but thinks their character would need to be convinced, so a consensual persuasion roll would work. But that only works because the player has already been persuaded. If it happens in the opposite order (roll persuasion first and say the PC has to do the thing) then you're just playing wrong.

If you want to convince a PC to do something, you have to actually be convincing. That's it.",1675209719

"Unexpected","t5_2w67q","&gt; If a man won't tell me his political beliefs, then I just assume he's got some fcked up views on women and minorities and move on.

It's just very uncommon to talk politics with your romantic partners where I live and you'd be considered crazy for making it a sort of priority in the dating phase. But most importantly our right and left aren't as extreme as the right and left in the USA. Like our right isn't anti abortion for instance. So that's why, political orientations in my country aren't going to change one's entire life because of a wrong election.

&gt; I'm sure you're not shallow for not wanting to date women who thinks all men are trash 

I don't take these women seriously tho, people are allowed to be a little frustrated from times to times. It depends of if it persists in the long run and warps their entire life. However, some generalisations are just true most of the time. Understanding that men and women have different incentives and priorities is the first thing you learn when you socially adjust during your puberty.

I have a few FAQ replies.


From what I understand Progesterone  *competes* for the enzyme that converts T into DHT. DHT being the hormone that masculinizes skin and hair follicles. So in men if they take progestrone and have a T dominant system - that means more Free T floating around for it to do than man stuff.

Now for women who already have low T regardless this isn't as significant of an aspect.  More of almost nothing is still almost nothing - specially if you're taking a T-blocker as well.

The problem kids were the bullies, the kids who wouldn't stop asking us questions during quiet time to bait us into answering and getting in trouble, the kids who were constantly being loud and disruptive, and the kids who would follow us around during recess, making our friends too uncomfortable to hang out with us. It doesn't sound like you were that kid. A lot of these kids were sexual harassing us and threatening us with physical violence and the teachers did NOTHING. 8 year old me had no idea how to deal with that. 

I actually became really good friends with one of the kids I was placed by. He taught me how to play basketball and defended me, getting in trouble himself, when the TA who hated me punished me for things I didn't do.

My parents gave me that serious advice in the early 1980s. A decade AFTER my machinist father had been laid off from Boeing with two weeks' notice during a downturn, and had to work at odd jobs for three years. You'd think they would've learned that the company always comes first.

And... in what world does ""company"" equate to ""civil service?""

Not even remotely the same animal, I can say that having worked for both. They're each horrendous in their own way. One is purely focused on mercenary profit for the stockholders and you don't matter at all. The other requires you to follow long-ago-determined procedures, even when said procedures make NO fucking sense, are wasteful and thoughtless. In either case, they will toss you without a care when they decide you don't ""fit.""

And... if you think that TEACHERS have it better, you're wrong on that, too.

One wrong move and they're out the door, with a huge black mark against getting hired by anyone else. Why do you think Florida has classrooms with zero books at the moment? They're terrified of permanently losing their careers over policy (and possibly legal) violations.

That's the whole fucking point. We were being told NOT to jump around to anywhere else, EVER, but to stay and be 100% ""loyal"" to one corporation. Implying that they would, in return, be loyal to us. Which is a big fucking lie.

Anyone can make a career in any field if they ""jump around"" from organization to organization as needed, while following every little rule the currently employing company/service/school/whatever decrees, without opposition.

Throw away your own morals, ethics, and mind, and slavishly OBEY.

Calling Black men 'boys' = Bad because hell, slavery. Then a crapload of systemic racism in society and the workplace for generations, plus generational trauma. 'Boy' has been used to put Black men in their ""place"" for hundreds of years.

And can you also speak to Johnny Manziel, Ryan Mallet, or Kyle Orton? Not to mention the plethora of players who ""retire early"" simply because they don't want to play anymore. If Kaep simply didn't want to play anymore, then we have zero way of knowing.

[Exhibit A](https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2017/07/31/steve-bisciotti-colin-kaepernick-has-made-some-assurances-about-no-further-protests/): 
&gt; ‚ÄúColin‚Äôs made some assurances I think through his intermediaries that there would be no protesting, that he would be standing for the [national anthem]. To quantify hurting the brand, I know that we‚Äôre going to upset some people and I know that we‚Äôre going to make people happy that we stood up for somebody that has the right to do what he did. **Nonviolent protesting is something that we‚Äôve all embraced.** I don‚Äôt like the way he did it. **Personally, I kind of liked it a lot when he went from sitting to kneeling.** I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm Catholic [and] we spend a lot of time kneeling. **When I saw him develop last year and went from sitting to kneeling next to his teammates, I liked that. I just thought, ‚ÄòOK, if it‚Äôs still a silent protest, I don‚Äôt think that the level of disrespect is as strong that way.‚Äô‚Äù**

Then two days later, [his GF](https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/kaepernick-girlfriend/) calls Steve Bisciotti a slave owner, and calls Ray Lewis an Uncle Tom.

To which Ray Lewis [states:](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/baltimore-ravens/ray-lewis-claims-ravens-didnt-sign-colin-kaepernick-after-girlfriends-tweet) 

&gt; **We were talking about giving this kid an opportunity to get back in the National Football League.** Look, this is what I wanted to share with people. I have been fighting for this kid behind the table like nobody has ... I've never been against Colin Kaepernick. But I am against the way he's done it...
**Then, [Kaepernick's girlfriend] goes out and put out this racist gesture and doesn't know we are in the back office about to try to get this guy signed.** Steve Bisciotti has said it himself, 'How can you crucify Ray Lewis when Ray Lewis is the one calling for Colin Kaepernick?'

&gt; When [the Ravens] called me, it was to say, 'Yes or no?' ... **We were going to close the deal to sign him** ... Steve Bisciotti said, 'I want to hear Colin Kaepernick speak to let me know that he wants to play football.' ... **And it never happens because that picture comes up the next day.**

Alternatively... do you have any evidence that Kaepernick was blackballed in a league where everyone else was kneeling? Do you have evidence that Kaepernick was willing to play for Matt Barkley/Trevor Siemen vet minimum money to play on practice squads?",1675209721

~~So. Does photography count as art, and if so, how is it meaningfully different from an artist working with a neural net to expedite and inspire their work?~~

Edit: I did not mean to discredit photographers, and this was phrased poorly. It is true that a lot of work goes into making professional photography. My intent was to state that AI art is similar to photography, in that both can be misconstrued as 'just pushing a button' when a lot more than just that is being done by the artist.

Then from that to 20mph average rides (solo) only a year or two, but it's a fitness level personally where I'm fast on the bike but everything else in my life is a mess

Switched companies to remedy that promotion, but now I am not eligible for maternity leave until at least a year with my new company, which means no second kid for us because my biological clock is ticking.

It was incredibly sweet of you to find a special restaurant to get a meal just for her.

Definitely NTA, they owe you an apology, AND a thank you!!

Edit: just wanted to add it was super shitty of them because the mom's need for drama turned the situation negative for Becca. I'm sure it's hard being around a new step-family and they really missed out on a chance to make her feel special and welcome (""wow, Becca, your aunt really went out of her way to make sure you had a delicious safe meal""), and instead she feels like she wasn't good enough to cook for because of her mom's reaction and will probably be apprehensive about future family get-togethers. If you feel comfortable, I think you should call her and let her know how much you tried to make her feel welcome and would have loved to cook for her but were simply too afraid to make her sick. Not like you need to apologize, but I think it's unfair for her to have a negative perception of your intentions just because her mom is an ass!!",1675209725

Maybe adding a rate limit to pathing calls could avoid hard slowdowns, like when a certain threshold of pathing calls per unit time is reached either throttle entities (entity has to wait some amount of time idle before it can path again, unless in combat or something)

Or the game could alert players if an entity reaches a certain threshold of pathing calls per unit time? Like ‚ÄúUrist seems to be wandering restlessly, unable to find a destination‚Äù or something. Could be off by default and turned on via settings.

Since I haven‚Äôt been active in here the last week or so, here are some of my favorite workouts for the last few days of January!

Sunday my legs were still very sore but I wanted to get my longer ride in for the week, so I hopped on [Bradley‚Äôs 45 min 2010s Pop ride](https://members.onepeloton.com/classes/cycling?utm_source=ios_app&amp;utm_medium=in_app&amp;modal=classDetailsModal&amp;classId=559b6ee1620841ae8bc29e433dc116e3&amp;locale=en-US) which reminded me of my early high school days on a lot of the play list. It was the perfect ride to get in when I wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly strong but wanted something fun to pedal along to without ignoring the callouts. Bradley‚Äôs personality is so ‚Äúcheeky‚Äù and adorable which is a great plus. 

Yesterday I had electricity/internet issues so I had to use my phone and couldn‚Äôt take a bike class, so I finished week 2 of Arms with Tunde. I‚Äôve always disliked upper body workouts (hence why I started this program trying not to neglect my arms) but I love Tunde enough that I am loving this program! I have always had difficulty with ‚Äúactivating‚Äù my triceps so I love that I am able to feel them and am even a bit sore from these classes. I‚Äôve finally mastered a knee Tricep-push-up and went up in weight from the first to second ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù classes. 

I also did this [10 min core with Rebecca](https://members.onepeloton.com/classes/strength?utm_source=ios_app&amp;utm_medium=in_app&amp;modal=classDetailsModal&amp;classId=d01a899cfbd846439168c4ef04376109&amp;locale=en-US) that I really liked! I don‚Äôt typically like her strength classes because I feel very uncoordinated but I have really enjoyed all the core classes I‚Äôve done with her! They give some unique moves which is refreshing. 

Today I did [15m metal barre](https://members.onepeloton.com/classes/strength?utm_source=ios_app&amp;utm_medium=in_app&amp;modal=classDetailsModal&amp;classId=fa436be1feb945e38785d39712049c32&amp;locale=en-US) and [10m pop barre core with Ally Love](https://members.onepeloton.com/classes/strength?utm_source=ios_app&amp;utm_medium=in_app&amp;modal=classDetailsModal&amp;classId=0afe0777ac3f4d48acd5e128aec858ce&amp;locale=en-US). Neither of which were particularly challenging either but were still well programmed and great for getting my muscles firing. 

I‚Äôve not felt great today and have a toothe ache which is just the worst so I wanted something low impact but not necessarily ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and finally tried out the first [20m low impact sweat steady ride with JK](https://members.onepeloton.com/classes/cycling?utm_source=ios_app&amp;utm_medium=in_app&amp;modal=classDetailsModal&amp;classId=3ddf53e58aaf4809a6ce0db2aa70c524&amp;locale=en-US) and really loved it! I tried a regular sweat steady when I first got my bike and didn‚Äôt really like it but I think I may work my way through this series and build up to regular sweat steady classes. I loved her music choices for this class and felt amazing afterwards! Definite mood booster.",1675209727

Both had bad performances generally in their early career against lesser fighters, with many (not I, personally) thinking both Jones and McDermott deserved a decision against them.

I'm accusing you of arguing in bad faith for suggesting efforts to protect nature are some republican issue - by making the border wall a partisan issue without having any understanding of what it does beyond make people go to specific places to cross.

"de","t5_22i0","&gt;Du kannst nicht einen Bev√∂lkerungsteil (Renter) gegen√ºber einer anderem (Berufst√§tigen) besser stellen mit Dividenden aus dem Ausland.

Wenn Geld von einer Volkswirtschaft zur anderen flie√üt (zB als Dividenden auf Auslandsinvestitionen), ist es f√ºr die Verteilung des Wohlstands in der empfangenden Volkswirtschaft v√∂llig egal, an welchen Bev√∂lkerungsteil das Geld zuerst flie√üt, weil sofort alles nach unten durchsickert? Ist es das, was du sagen willst?

&gt;Leistungserbringung und Preisfindung passiert immer innerhalb der Volkswirtschaft.

Leistungserbringung von Dienstleistungen, ja, aber wenn wir G√ºter importieren, importieren wir die Arbeitsleistung, die im Ausland erbracht wurde.

Das hei√üt √ºbrigens in letzter Konsequenz, dass Deutschland kein exportorientiertes Industrieland bleiben kann - was im Ausland hergestellt werden kann, wird es auch, und wird dann (bezahlt mit den Ertr√§gen aus den Aktien) nach Deutschland importiert. Die gesamte deutsche Arbeitskraft wird in Zukunft gebraucht f√ºr Dienstleistungen (uA die Pflege der Alten), die zwingend in Deutschland erbracht werden m√ºssen.

&gt;Renten sind ausschlie√ülich Verteilungsfragen innerhalb einer Volkswirtschaft.

Ja, aber das Ziel der Aktienrente ist es, gleichzeitig so viel Wohlstand aus anderen Volkswirtschaften nach Deutschland zu transferieren, dass eine massive Umverteilung von Jung zu Alt stattfinden kann, ohne dass der tats√§chliche Wohlstand der Jungen dadurch massiv sinkt. Was rechnerisch aufs gleiche rauskommt, wie wenn man den Wohlstand aus dem Ausland direkt an die Alten transferiert.",1675209728

Recent-ish manipluations in Level 3 (the first level of the run) among a couple tiny improvements to the route (such as Tricorder entering Level 6), combined with a ton of execution and some good luck, are key to reaching this goal.

Today, runner [GreenMario](https://www.twitch.tv/greenmario) jumped to the top of the leaderboard with a 3.2 second improvement, obtaining the time of 27:52. This run features a solid run with few mistakes through the early and midgame, followed by an absolutely stellar performance in Level 8 (gold split!) and an excellent Level 9.

Any of these three runners have what it takes to break 27:4X, and GreenMario came very close! I had the privilege of seeing this one live. Exciting times in the Zelda speedrunning community!",1675209728

"lego","t5_2qhm7","Centering stickers has always taken me some time (even with tweezers), so I thought it would be fun to try out modeling a guide.  It will work for sticker placement on any flat surface LEGO. The groove at the bottom will allow tiles to slide under, giving the correct spacing to center a sticker.

I tested with a number of stickers on different sizes of tiles and bricks; there are some small variations in spacing, but overall I found it to work pretty well. Thus far I have only tested on the Atari set; I'm excited to see how it holds up on future builds.

"zen","t5_2qhmf","I'm going to make a first guess because I don't know much about this dharma brother.

First, just a general comment for anybody that doesn't know what a Dharma brother is.  r/zen/wiki/famous/cases Read the one about turtle mountain.  Go find the longer version on terebess.

It's a more serious relationship than many sibling relationships because siblings grow up and leave home, but dharma brothers get old together and they only leave home when they're enlightened.

Guishan had left mazu's house a long time ago.  They had not seen each other these two brothers since Guishan had become enlightened and emerged into the world as a Buddha.  Under Mazu.  Who in some ways was a bigger deal in China than Buddha. But a Zen big deal... Which means you can run over his legs.

So Guishan had become a Buddha and he started teaching and a bunch of people bought him a really nice house and we're feeding him every day and taking care of all of his s*** for him and generally making his life easy so that he could piss them off by telling him things they didn't like.

Then this really weird thing happens, one of Guishan's dharma brothers gets enlightened too.  Guishan wasn't expecting it. It's like somebody you know winning the lottery after you won the lottery one time.  In the zen tradition, after you win the lottery, you go around and visit the other lottery winners from the past.  You rub your ticket in their face. Talk about how you won more.  That kind of thing.

So the Dharma brother goes to guishan's and he puts the robe and bowl in the head monk seat.  Which means he is considering himself *second to Guishan*.  That means his enlightenment is second too.

Why would he say that?  What does that mean for Guishan?

I think it means for Guishan that *his* enlightenment is second to Mazu's.  And so on all the way back to every Zen Masters'# enlightenment is second to Buddha's.  I would assume that they are all secondary because transmission makes them so.

And this is a double edged sword.  First, because we always have to pay our debts but we cannot.  Second, because anybody who gets second hand enlightenment should return it for a refund.

Having said all that he had to say, he went to see the next relative.",1675209729

Magician-P4's Yosuke

Priestess-P4's Yukiko

Empress-P5's Haru

Emperor-First tough one...P5's Yusuke

Hierophant-Another tough one...P5's Sojiro since you don't really get the conclusion to P4's Dojima's until the epilogue.

Lovers-P4's Rise

Chariot-P5's Ryuji

Justice-P4's Nanako

Hermit-If I can count everything needed to do it, P4's Fox.  Actual character interactions? P5's Futaba.

Fortune-P4's Naoto

Strength-P4's Athletes unless I can count the individual outings for the twins...which I said I can't since I'm only counting the actual rank up stuff.

Hanged Man-Yet another tough one.  P4's Naoki

Death-Another one with two great stories.  I'm going P5's Takemi

Temperance-P5's Kawakami

Devil-P5's Ohya

Tower-Not really a fan of either.  P5's Shinya.

Star-P5's Hifumi

Moon-P4's Ai.

Sun-Love both, but I'm going P4's Yumi.

Aeon v Councilor-Super tough overall, but again, going just on the rank up stories, P4's Marie.",1675209730

The world seems to demand productivity and I want exactly the opposite. Psychedelics, drugs, and festivals are what I love but they are so often intertwined with capitalism. I feel my life is wasted sitting behind a desk chasing money but choose it to keep a relationship alive.  Even before I tried psychedelics I had no desire to climb a ladder or have a career. Simply getting to experience life is plenty enough for me. That doesn't seem like an acceptable answer to a lot of people. 

I haven't figured out how to navigate capitalism healthily yet. I just want to turn on, tune in, and drop out but the world seems to be headed the opposite direction. It's tough. I'm hoping spock beams me up and I can just smoke DMT, listen to music, and explore the stars. 

The hardest part of it all is how lonely and isolating it is to go against the grain. The system is setup to distract and isolate us.

As for advice? Keep your expenses low. Focus your efforts on what you love. Figure out how to do the bare minimum for the capitalist machine to survive. Build a community to thrive with. Your time is the most valuable resource you have. Use it wisely.

This subreddit no longer uses reddit image uploads. We encourage uploading to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/r/fakemon), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/), a [Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/) / [Serebii](https://forums.serebii.net/) / [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/fakemon) post, your Twitter/Instagram, or more. You then submit as a ""link"" type post if posting directly to the image or as a ""text"" post if you want to leave an explanation and link it.

Further help can happen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fakemon/wiki/index#wiki_how_to_upload_images_to_r.2Ffakemon

One additional ask is to also not use Discord links as they are temporary and will not stay online for long.

This change was made due to [admin actions on moderators and users of reddit](https://redd.it/mbmthf). Unfortunately reddit image uploading cannot be turned off at submission time without also blocking uploads to third party image sites.

"Republican","t5_2qndt","I have seen that article before, and I still say that I believe that Trump is in the clear wrong. I frankly believe that regardless of what he says, he should know by now that he needs to be far more careful with his wording or else he gets himself into another pointless controversy. Now granted he can't even lift a finger without somebody screeching in disgust, it is still all the more reason to either keep his mouth shut or be much more cautious with how he approaches things.

And I am just tired of hearing about Trump. It's been 3 years since he's lost reelection and he still somehow manages to find a way to the frontline news, even when there are issues far more important at hand. I just want to be done with him so that things can move on, but this constant need to shove him into everything has gotten to the point of his worst self being the most prevalent nowadays. It's always ""Trump said this and it's so shocking"" or ""Trump makes big and bold plans for the future"". There is never a rest and I am sick and tired of it. 

I stay on this sub because there are few spots online where the political dialogue doesn't leave you with daggers in your back for being even the slightest bit conservative or saying something other than ""Trump is the devil"". I don't like to hate him, but I am sick and tired of his general attitude and brand. And no matter whether I want to say that he gets overly hated or overly worshipped, there never seems to be a point in which you can have a different take. And then there's people like you who have to go out and whip at anyone in order to start calling them delusional or bad because they get mad for you whipping at them in the first place.

The cost of living doesn't care about an individual's circumstances. It's enough that it's appropriate for a theoretical average person. If a ""living wage"" is enough to support one person, you then leave it up to that person to decide whether they want to support more than one person on that wage. Do they live more frugally than the assumed cost of living, whatever that might be, or do they look for a job with a higher wage? That's up to them.

Or maybe they live in a culture that has determined that cost of living should assume that a person is supporting x children. Who knows. That's a matter for people and their governments to work out.

Beyond this, though, introducing individual circumstances like a person having multiple children obviously leads to absurdities in the determination of a ""living wage"". What if I own a yacht? What if I'm supporting 5 secret families? What if I have slaves?

That is what it would mean to me if he said that to me because of how much pain I have suffered over my lifetime that was not only caused by him.  The fact that I am still here today is not because he saved me or protected me, it is because I chose to pick myself up again and again and again despite being shat on by the one before him, the one after him and the universe generally.  It was me who set me free from being a victim of circumstance.

I fought like hell to be where I am today and I nearly did not make it here. If he were to claim this as his excuse to not want to learn about me and my journey since we last parted ways, then it minimises the significance of my transformation and determination to work on the parts of myself that was a driving factor in our demise, to better myself because his presence in my life was worth the effort to unlearn behaviours and I believe it is what he deserved for loving me.

If he was unwilling or unable to see that as anything but a positive and had no interest in learning more, then there is simply nothing left for me to know.  To him it is merely a game, an attempt to control or toy with me and that is something I have no interest to take part in.  His chapter will then be placed in the same category as timewaster #1 and timewaster #3 with the realisation that he is no better than they are despite his utter disgust with the capers of timewaster #1. Words are just words and nothing more without action to give them some meaning. I will not cry over him, for I will have lost nothing.  He will have lost my respect and shattered the self-image he portrays of  the decent guy he would like everyone to see him as.

I hold out hope that he is not just another guy promising me a place in their world and then never delivering. I would rather travel the rest of my life alone and happy than spend any more of my years on someone who does not value me or my time or my dedication.  I am in no respects perfect or without the need for further self-improvement.  I will continue to make mistakes throughout life but I do know that I deserve more than that. Nothing I have done deserves being treated like that.

Shenmue has a hardcore fanbase but we want an ending but the creator keeps kicking that can down the road and odds are we will never get an ending.

Just look at Google and see how many crimes against children have occurred at public libraries over the past couple of years. It's shocking. 

I think having places where homeless and struggling people can use computers or do some legal research away from any children is a good start.

Having this obviously sucks when u finally decide to take the game seriously and actually want to play ranked and climb because no matter what u do it seems completely impossible and demotivating to do so when the MMR of all those years is holding u back right now. The only solution to this seems to make a fresh account and start playing there and eventually u are going to find where u now actually belong but now u will have lost all the skins, champions etc. that u always had. So my solution would be the following:

2. ACL management traffic to trusted segments only.
3. Route only what you need for provider(s) signaling and media endpoints
4. ACL only the IPs and Ports needed for those provider(s) (don't allow signaling ports to media only IPs, etc.)
5. Use the trusted address feature to only trusted IPs

What I needed to do was learn to sit with my emotions, not feed them with a thought storm, but just let the one thought that caused the emotion to come and leave and observe my resultant emotions with kindness toward myself because I can become mad at myself for feelings that are so irrational. But be kind to myself and curios about the emotion. It is probably something from your childhood, a time when you were treated in a way you didn‚Äôt like. For me it was how I felt when my older siblings would dismiss and override me and I felt powerless. That is the same feeling I had amidst the RJ, powerless to change the past. And it‚Äôs true I am powerless to change it and no amount of questions or overthinking will make a difference. So I have found I can write my questions down and move on knowing I have no benefit from asking them today. I have the list to kind of tell my subconscious that I can ask another day and that helps me settle down.

In many jurisdictions (example: California) the legal definition of ‚Äúrape‚Äù requires a penis inserted into a vagina without consent. While a woman could be the perpetrator, it‚Äôs admittedly more difficult. And it does mean that the legal term rape is explicitly heterosexual.

However, many (or most) jurisdictions still consider other non-consensual acts to be crimes just as serious as rape. For example in CA there are separate names for assaults involving penis-in-vagina, anal sex, and penetration with something other than genitals (fingers, objects), but they‚Äôre all felonies with the same sentence. Which also means that someone can theoretically be convicted of all three for a single event. All of these acts are included in the colloquial definition of rape, but splitting them into separate legal terms doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre seen as less serious assaults.",1675209734

"conspiracy_commons","t5_fc76s","Why not instead explore the known. You can guess all day at what they've put inside you, but I tell you what I do know , and its that modern medicine is pretty well documented.
Heres a test, write down 20 or more instructions that the voices give you, take them to a mental health professional and ask if they're typical or A-typical of patients suffering similar issues. That would be the biggest indication to me as to whether or not it's medical. Also there are meds you can be prescribed that can counteract psychosis which includes hearing voices but they leave you able to function, my best pal's Mrs has a similar thing, her meds completely fix it. 
Trying that would prove its chemical in nature etc.
Stick with what you can change, and leave all assumptions to one side. 
For example, you seem certain that the military gave you this ability, do you specifically remember them doing so? Or do you suspect they did it in some covert, hidden way? 
Suspicions can be wrong even if they're very strong, and the avenues I've suggested above are relatively easy and non invasive to try. You seem 100% mentally stable and aware, just have an issue of some sort atm - thats literally the best position to be in to try a medical solution.

"kpopthoughts","t5_2730wn","I've been a Once since debut and I think they handled Twice very well. I'm glad that they debuted under JYPE and don't really have any complaints. Year after year of good songs while at the same time allowing the girls to have more input gradually and developing their style to become more mature. Plus freedom to take mental health breaks which were handled much better than any other company has done it. The members also seem very happy as shown by all of them renewing their contracts.

I can't say much about the other groups, but really I couldn't be much happier with how JYPE handled TWICE.

I also find a lot of the Youtube fan ""criticism"" lately quite cringe, it's almost always international fans that know next to nothing about the companies they make videos about and just try to get views with clickbait and fake outrage. For example, most JYPE groups are handled by completely separate management these days, so applying criticism from one group to another rarely makes much sense, as the people responsible aren't the same at all.

Regarding Itzy, I think their downfall is greatly exaggerated. They had like two songs that didn't resonate with international fans as much, but they are still very popular and have gained a lot of interest in S.Korea in recent years. I also know people that prefer newer Itzy stuff over their old songs.

Gurleen is just a bitch.  I hate to say that about her but it‚Äôs so true.  I can‚Äôt pronounce or spell the guys name but he was lovely to her despite her awful attitude.

I do agree that trying to get to know each other while they‚Äôre living with his family can be uncomfortable and intimidating.  However, his parents and his sister bent over backwards to make her feel welcomed.

The way she expressed that she wanted them to move out wasn‚Äôt very pleasant.  She‚Äôs definitely got an issue with communication and her personality is so unpredictable.

When she was cleaning up at the barbecue her behavior was beyond rude and offensive.  So many people explained to her that it was not seen as being helpful or polite, but instead caused extreme discomfort to the owners of the home and the people they employed but she refused to listen.  She was always ready to fly off the handle and fight with everybody.  She didn‚Äôt even say goodbye to him.  She was so mad that the experiment was failing she had a temper tantrum and left without saying a word.  She could have agreed to just be friends but she decided to burn a bridge instead.

The guy in Ireland is a total piece of shit.  Telling Danna that she‚Äôs now a 5 out of 10 and that initially she was a 2.5 is so rude and demeaning.  He‚Äôs definitely not a catch at all.  He‚Äôs not particularly good looking or successful and I‚Äôm certain she can do much better.  It‚Äôs ridiculous that the matchmaker was unaware that age was a dealbreaker for him because he wanted children.  That‚Äôs a pretty significant dealbreaker and useless Arica missed that entirely.

Aaron is looking for a handsome stud like Chris Hemsworth, but he‚Äôs certainly not at that level.  He‚Äôs not attractive, he‚Äôs not charismatic and he really doesn‚Äôt seem like a particularly nice person.  Mael was willing to try and make the relationship work but Aaron wasn‚Äôt.  He didn‚Äôt think Mael was good looking enough for his ugly, rude ass.

Naeem and Chandra.  Ok, Chandra is obviously still suffering from PTSD due to the abusive relationship she was in right before meeting Naeem.  She‚Äôs very easily annoyed by him and doesn‚Äôt appreciate anything about him.  Initially he got on my nerves when he was bragging he was a dog with women because he‚Äôs not handsome at all.  He is however a kind soul who recognized her trauma and tried to help her cope with it.  Despite she was unappreciative and sullen.  I don‚Äôt blame him for finding a date for New Year‚Äôs Eve.  No one wants to ring in the New Year with a negative person that can‚Äôt be bothered to be civil to you.  Arica messed up here too. She wasn‚Äôt aware that Chandra was still struggling with several issues as a result of her past abusive relationship and she wasn‚Äôt ready to move on at all.  

Arica is a useless idiot. She‚Äôs billing herself as a relationship expert and she‚Äôs just as bad at matchmaking as the so called experts on Married At First Sight.  Pulling names out of a hat might have had a better result than the messes Arica created.",1675209738

I  don't find anything that you have said that I would entirely disagree with; certainly Epicurus believed that virtue was merely an instrumental good and that the ""ultimate"" good that human beings pursue for its own sake is pleasure. Virtues are useful inasmuch as they can help us reduce pain and unhappiness and pursue pleasure and happiness (I suppose these are the same thing to an extent) more skillfully.

However, I think that maybe we have differing views on what ""tranquility"" means. For my part, I understand it not to be some neutral, unaffected state between pleasure and pain. I would consider tranquility to be a positive, pleasurable state akin to ""relaxing in good health."" I think your word, ""contentment,"" makes sense as a substitute. I think Epicurus would say that the happy human is one who regularly satisfies her natural and necessary desires, and is content to do so, rather than one who chases after unnecessary or extravagant pleasures that cannot be reliably satisfied without undue risk.

In this sense- maybe one is a ""pleasure maximizer"" if they have a smaller set of natural desires that can be reliably and completely fulfilled, leading to contentment. And a party animal chasing thrills or an internet or drug addict chasing ever higher and higher states of euphoria through their vice of choice is ultimately not maximizing anything due to the unsustainable nature of their pursuit. So the modern hedonist has the same AIM as the Epicurean sage, but just has a lack of wisdom and skill regarding the means to attain pleasure, by entrusting this quest to objects which cannot reliably provide it.

But I think I would re-word my initial post a bit after going through this thought process... perhaps the person with a moderate appetite reliably fulfilled IS in fact in a state of continual maximal pleasure. It is not the most intense pleasure that can be experienced at any one time, but it is the highest degree of pleasure that can be sustained continuously and reliably. I think I need to give this some more thought and study, however.",1675209738

I personally haven't heard of any specific age, but know about differences in young children who live with a full Amritdhari family and are able to follow the Rehat Maryada with their family and take Amrit at a young age, vs young adults who do it on their own accord after gaining some independence from their family that might make it harder for them to do so.

My whole point is that in the grand scheme of things, it's not _that hard_ because it's something that you can either learn yourself (if that's your job, or if you're really dedicated) or hire people to do it. Again, any skilled job is hard if you don't have the relevant skill, but _in the context of building a successful app/software_, the coding part is not the hard part. The hard part is getting a __viable__ idea, and I can't stress enough the word viable: it must either fill or create a need, it must be technically doable, and it must have a clear and concrete plan to acquire users/customers, as well as a clear path to monetization, among many other things. And unlike with developers and to some extent marketers, you can't reliably hire someone to come up with such idea.

And to answer your question, I currently work with PHP and some JS (react), but I've worked with a bunch of other languages like C#, C++, Java and even Pascal (a long time ago). I tried some Erlang too but really didn't enjoy that...",1675209739

Doctor Hylde walked into the lab and stopped past the doorway. He should have known.

‚ÄúI got the test subjects you requested sir!‚Äù Jerry shouted back from across the room, preoccupied as he lifted a wand up to his lips and blew more bubbles into the air.

‚ÄúTEST SUBJECTS?! Jerry these are BABIES!‚Äù Doctor Hylde stood with his mouth agape, although he wasn‚Äôt really surprised. Nothing in the lab surprised him anymore.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you asked for.‚Äù Jerry lifted a spoon of applesauce up to a child‚Äôs lips. It but down happily. The room became brighter as the baby smiled and babbled.

‚ÄúRATS JERRY. BABY. RATS.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶that explains why I had to double the doses‚Ä¶‚Äù Jerry quizzically examined a child on the counter who was changing colors like a chameleon. He poked it with his pen and it turned purple.

‚ÄúYOU WHAT.‚Äù This was it. He was never leaving his coworker alone again. A giggling infant floated past his head, reaching with tiny hands towards a bubble floating towards them, stunting the doctors anger.

His lab assistant did not respond, instead poking with his pen yet another child who shrunk in response.

‚ÄúWhere did you even get all these kids?‚Äù Doctor Hylde was beyond exasperated, almost wasting another pair of gloves just to run a hand down his face. About 30 babies were scattered around the room with boxes of diapers stacked on one wall.  A baby in the corner stared at him intently. Creepy. He wondered what his deal was.

‚ÄúDaycare.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶,‚Äù He really didn‚Äôt wanna ask. He already knew the answer. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ask the parents.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶no? Why would I? It‚Äôs their bodies,‚Äù Jerry replied, like it was obvious. He lifted his hand for the floating baby to grasp his finger so he could spin them around in the air. Hylde didn‚Äôt bother wondering how Jerry had asked the babies.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna get us reported to the ethics board. This is‚Ä¶just beyond.‚Äù The doctor started to think he should have listened to his parents and pursued a different career path. Surely lawyers weren‚Äôt this stupid.

‚ÄúOK, yes, the ethics are a bit dodgy, but look how happy they are with superpowers!‚Äù The babies immediately all giggled in unison as one infant projected a train into the air and sent it around the room. 

‚ÄúYou call injecting infants with untested power serum without  the consent or knowledge of their parents dodgy? Why did I even hire you?‚Äù There was no point in explaining. Jerry wasn‚Äôt listening. Jerry was floating around the room. The babies giggled again.

My point is that sex is not inherently bad or evil and not something one should be punished for, which your view seems to stem from. And that saying ""avoid sex if you don't want to be pregnant"" is like saying ""avoid eating chicken if you don't want salmonella"".

Both of which may be difficult to get if you've never had sex and/or have no desire for it. That's totally understandable, but still doesn't give you the right to expect everyone else also uses sex for reproduction purposes only.",1675209740

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;If you have sex (regardless of protective measures) you are consenting to the possibility of getting pregnant

This is the most ridiculous part of your argument. You're saying that by consenting to sex (activity A) you are also consenting to pregnancy (consequence A).

Let's try this with another activity:

You consent to wearing a slutty outfit (activity A), and you KNOW that one of the possible consequences is that you might be targeted for sexual assault (consequence A). 

Does your consent to wearing a slutty outfit imply your consent to have sex with anyone and everyone?

Maybe not.

Let's try again;

You CHOOSE to drive your car. You KNOW a possibility is getting carjacked. Therefore, if you drive (regardless of protective measures) you are consenting to the possibility of getting your car stolen.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","First of all, you have to figure out what you want. Like if you want a hamburger guess what? You aren't going to to a pizzeria or sushi place to get a hamburger, okay? Am i making sense here or is this analogy too complicated for you? Also, you don't go out to a place and say, hey, I will just show up and whatever the restaurants feels like feeding me, that's what I will get. Who the heck does that? Are you with me so far?

If you want a long term relationship with someone and know exactly what kind of girl you want for that role, it means that you will close the doors to many girls who don't fit the profile. Are you with me? If you want a burger, you ain't going to a pizzeria and you won't entertain eating there? You with me brother?

So if you want an LtR and this chick is not keen on it and she is a pain in the butt and giving you the runaround, then she needs to go and you need to figure out where to find a girl you want. Are you with me? Is this too complicated for you? No? Good!

Now if what you want is a FWB that has casual sex whenever you both feel like it, then this girl is perfect. But if that's what you want, why are you pressuring her to become your girlfriend? Got it? Are you with me?

Now I know you will say ""I am down for whatever, I just want to understand what she wants so we can be on the same page"". Well brother, things just don't work like that. You can't let the restaurant decide what food to feed you. It just doesn't work like this. You are the man, you lead. Period.",1675209742

Most people just see it as ""This person has a medical condition that forces them to take a few more breaks."" I think as long as they know you're not doing it on purpose, they'll understand. I was also surprised to learn how many people can relate when I tell them. A lot of people have friends/relatives that have similar conditions or have one themselves. My boss' son had ulcerative colitis so he completely understands and I don't get any shit for it. And at the end of the day, you're 17 and you won't be working there forever. So if they judge, fuck em and enjoy your periodical bathroom breaks.",1675209742

"japanresidents","t5_2h592b","I eventually got audited after leaving Japan for not paying taxes on stock I sold while in Japan.  I was able to write a check for what was owed plus penalty.  The hard part was refiling my US taxes to get credit for foreign taxes paid. Took more than a year and many phone calls to IRS to get my refund.  In the end it worked out okay because IRS actually paid me a decent interest rate for the refund owed. 

In my case, I owed quite a bit of money and the Japanese tax office was able to contact me later through my company.  If they could not contact me to sort it out, then I am sure coming back to Japan as a tourist would have been a problem.

La manera en que se busca el mejoramiento de esa calidad de vida es no reducir su autoestima o incrementar el estigma de que estan ''enfermos'' o ''locos'' como mucha raza les dice e insulta.  


Y no es cosa de mazapanes o cristales como dices, es simple decencia humana y brindar el apoyo a los padres que quieren que sus hijos puedan salir adelante por lo menos en sus estudios con la esperanza que quiza puedan valerse por si mismo en cierto punto de su vida.

Down is being cut haphazardly with fentanyl and unknown substances, meaning it is impossible for the person using it to know what they‚Äôre taking unless they test it, which is not possible for many people.

I didn‚Äôt know why they were the way they were. Why they acted the way they did. Only that they were successful socially while I was not. So I mimicked. Sometimes I would misjudge. I could tell by the looks on their faces that I had misstepped but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how. These days I am extremely good at pulling on the mask. So good I have trouble taking it off and truly letting people in. I think you should do what is right for you. But don‚Äôt let whatever you find out become an excuse. I have learned to function in this society. My disability is a part of me but it doesn‚Äôt define me. It doesn‚Äôt stop me from being successful.

"shoppingaddiction","t5_33bb0","I've got 2 kids. Very much agree with you that people don't need a lot of baby stuff--and we never even used a crib either...both my kids actually slept right in my bed until each of them were about 2 and a half years old...then we transitioned them to their own beds at that age (they are almost 3 years apart in age so we only ever had one baby in our bed at a time--otherwise I don't think I would have had the same sleeping arrangements that we did). 

My partner and I had a bed that was super low to the ground so baby wouldn't get hurt in case they ever rolled off. We just kept any of our pillows and blankets far away from baby's face and body. Baby just slept in their pjs in the middle of the bed in between my partner and I...bed was quite big so we all had space. Worked great and we all got lots of sleep due to not having to get out of bed to breastfeed or change baby plus less disruptive for baby too...for changing baby at night, we kept a change mat, diapers, wipes and spare baby pjs in our night stand--easy to access without ever having to get up! 

For nap times, I laid baby down somewhere comfy in whatever room I was in so I could still see baby while I did whatever I needed to do. For bath time I just sat in the bath with my baby to wash them. My partner watched baby while I took my showers and if he wasn't home I laid baby down on a clean bath mat while I showered...just left the curtain open a bit so I could supervise baby while I washed up. :) 

Basically the only things I had to buy for my babies were clothes, diapers, wipes, change mat, a few toys, car seat, stroller and baby carrier for walks. Then for toddler age we had to get a gate for the stairs, plastic covers for electrical outlets, toddler toys and single beds/bedding. I remember I just used old soft towels for burp cloths/cleaning up spills and used a regular backpack as a baby/toddler supplies bag. All the money we didn't spend on the stuff we didn't end up needing to buy went toward my kids' college funds instead. Now that my kids are a bit older we mostly just need to spend money on books, Lego, video games and board games for them. I try to buy their clothes, coats and shoes off-season so I can get really good quality ones on sale.",1675209746

If you go the 5600X route you could reinvest that $200 and upgrade to a 850W PSU or even get a better GPU. That socket is end of life essentially though so upgrading in the future will require a new board unless you go to a 5950X later down the line. 

If you‚Äôre not worried about that $200 and don‚Äôt plan on getting a higher end GPU with the difference I‚Äôd probably go with the 7600 build. Just for the sake of having the newer socket and being able to drop a newer CPU down the line.

It didn't work and my sister proceeded to tell my brothers when they got home. After that, she thought it was funny to bring it up at supper, parties and whenever my friends came over. It got old and weird when she still brought it up when I reached my 30's.

My second encounter,

My mom was a computer guru when they first came out and learned how to build them which was a big undertaking compared to today. They were a device you had to read up on and learn extensively since they were new to everybody which she did. How this relates to the OP topic is this meant she knew how to track our history and whereabouts on the web as well as how firewalls and virus's worked. The computer was setup in her room too. Well, we had a foreign exchange student and we would share the computer after school. After already getting in trouble for naughty searches, I learned which sites didn't upload virus's and popups and how to clear my history. Well I guess I missed a something because my mom came home and started yelling at me for looking at porn which I denied as any young kid would. She knew I was lying but she asked the foreign exchange student, who was scared shitless, and he admitted to it! LOL it was dumb luck that he too was looking at porn hahaha! My mom apologized to me and I smiled all the way back to my room. Needless to say though, my mom had that computer on lock for months after that.",1675209746

"n64","t5_2s34r","&gt;I read in the manual of the Pioneer that the video converter only supports 480i video and up, and if I'm not mistaken, 480i is exactly what the N64 is capable of. I am aware that not all games run at this resolution, though, so I also wonder: does the N64 actually also output video at a lower resultion in these games, or is just the render resolution lower while the output resolution is still 480i?

Most 5th Generation consoles and before output 240p some PS1 and N64 games output 480i but it's mostly the exception or 480i menus and 240p gameplay.




&gt;I did have a composite to HDMI converter, but it was of terrible (very dark) video quality (even though it cost me ‚Ç¨60), which is why I'm reluctant to get another one. 

Is it a actual gaming upscaler or is it a video upscaler meant for VCRs and such?

&gt;I was also hoping to get the surround sound working through the receiver as well, which is impossible when using such a converter. 


You would just split or plug the audio cables into your audio equipment instead of the upscaler.

The f14 is ok but you need a dedicated reliable asf 

Honestly the 105 pt viggen is probably one of the best bang for your buck asfs to pair with the f14 if you want

Honestly try bluefor gen pre 80 or 85

You still get alot of the good shit with more flexibility 

The only issue is not having high medium or heavy tanks but you definitely can make up for it with the kurnass and vts m48 combo

Saying Lance is emotionally stunted is like saying the sky is blue. His characterization is centered around him being an asshole because of his failed pitball career and subsequent drinking problem, like?? This is not a man who is even willing to heal! And I don't think that's attractive! That 'woe is me' schtick is only cute for so long. At some point it's like, get some therapy bro üôÑ

Give me one scene with Lance and Darcy that doesn't have some reference to their student/teacher dynamic. That's like their whole thing! And, if you're into it, that's the appeal of the kink! Lance is saying how much of a turn on it is for Darcy to be such a good student, and Darcy is swooning over how geeky Lance is or how hot he looks while being an asshole in class.

Quite a number of years ago was coming back through Los Angeles on my way home with two ladies. They are both Asian/Chinese (one now my wife) and I'm just a regular white guy. They wanted to stop at an Asian restaurant. I agreeed. In a shopping mall was a  nice looking Chinese restaurant, since it was after lunch and before dinner, quiet with only several other patrons.

Got weird vibes as soon as we walked in. The hostess came over, without looking at me, walked over and placed menus on the table.

Well, we were ready to order and nothing happened. Finally one of the ladies asked the hostess in Mandarin for a waitress, who begrudgingly came over and took our order. Again, weirdly, not even looking at us.

We eventually got our order, but had to flag them down multiple times for soy sauce, chopsticks, water, etc. I was starting to get pissed. Again, another prolonged delay to get our bill.

I was done with the rude behavior. The bill was something like $29 and I put 3 $10 bills on the table and we started to exit. The hostess screeched and ran in front of the ladies, yelling at them in Chinese. I asked what was going on? And was told that she was berating us for leaving no tip.

Enough. I stepped between the ladies and the hostess and told her. ""Who the H do you think you are yelling us? Your service was abysmal. You have been rude with horrible staff, and you expect a tip?""

The silence was deafening. The other patrons at the restaurant were staring at us. I had a $5 bill on me which I pulled out of my wallet with a flourish, tore into pieces in front of her and let them fall to the floor. You shoulda seen the Pikachu faces as we left.

Still don't understand really what happened- a guy with two Asian ladies? Were they assuming something? We were dressed nicely, driving a nice  car, both ladies polite.  Whatever, there was absolutely no excuse for their behavior. I hope they had a heck of a time gluing that $5 bill back together.",1675209748

I now own my cars, house, etc. with zero debt. My net worth is well over a million dollars. Looking to potentially sell the company and slow down a bit. 

My point is, you have the right approach. Finish your education. Work hard. Be the best at what you do. Then, when you see the right opportunity, go for it!

"CredibleDefense","t5_2y5ib","My (admittedly ignorant) impression is that the biggest effect these systems are going to have, as we're already seeing with HIMARS, is to push back the RAF supply depots even further, creating a wider line of ""last mile"" truck chains.  
Having to make your entire line ~100 miles thick from depot to the front is a big demand for trucks to fill. It may be that this stretches Russia's supply capacity and ultimately slows things down?  
 
It's not like Russia can't store enough supplies up front to prepare for an offensive, but it takes more time and they can only distribute  across the whole map as best they can.  
  
The GLSDB seems to be another ""escalation"" that only seems to perpetuate this conflict rather than giving Ukraine a decisive edge to win this. I'm really not sure if the strategic objective here of the west is a fast win. The million dollar question is, ""are we trickling these supplies because of diplomatic/political roadblocks, or because there is a more cynical agenda?""",1675209750

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","I can't speak to the game specifically, but Rowling has a pretty long history of writing things that don't take much squinting to see as antisemitic or pro-slavery. 

The goblins are consistently coded as Jewish and are described with the most hateful stereotypes regarding Jewish people...hooked noses, money grubbing, in control of international banking...

And from what I read the game seems to be about putting down a goblin uprising...Which whoo-boy, sounds all kinds of wrong.

The house elves are also a disturbing allegory for slavery where anyone who questions the institution is reassured the elves actually like being enslaved...An actual argument used to support the African Slave trade in the US btw. Hermoine is treated by the text as foolish at best for being concerned her school is using slave labor. And her attempt at abolition or at least improved conditions are treated as ridiculous and just a side effect of being muggle-born. I remember thinking it was a messed up side plot even when I read it as a kid.",1675209750

I know what its like to be in abusive relationship (I was in one for 10 years) and I know how it makes you feel.  They make you feel like if they loved you why would they hurt you like that.  They drive you away from your family and friends and you feel cut off from all of your support networks. The best thing I did after getting out of that relationship was reconnecting with my best friend.  She helped me through so much and always made me feel loved.   The reality is that not every person is for every person and it will take more tries to find the right person.  Try to ask yourself what this person brings to the table. What do I like about them.  It's almost like you have to just start all over by figuring out what  you like and don't like in a person.

"h3h3productions","t5_3345f","It happened on the most recent episode, with Rebecca Black.

After the guest left they continued on with the show, cover the days news.  One of the stories was about a friend QTCinderalla (twitch person) having a tab open for AI QTCinderalla porn.

While the guy was apologizing, crying chat was calling for the Chestnut soundbite to be played.  This continued as the next video played, QT crying while reacting to what happened.  That's when Ethan started to crack, hiding his face while trying not to think about how inappropriate / funny it would be if they played the chestnut drop.

Then Zach hit the button, right at the exact worst moment, while QT was peak tears about what women have to go through online etc.

The crew, including Olivia were seen laughing.  They even cut to Sam to do her traumatized look gag. It was pretty funny, in an awful way, to the point that Hila even struggled to keep a straight face.

They calmed down a bit, Ethan explained what had happened with the soundbite and that they weren't laughing at anything related to QT's situation or her response.  Then he pledged to pay for her legals effort (to sue the creator) and explained how awful he thinks deepfake porn is, explains that in his opinion it shouldn't even be legal to host.

It was hilarious, but in a way that's hard to explain without understanding the surrounding context and absurdity. I would compare it to when someone tells a random inappropriate joke at a funeral service.",1675209751

"TheWho","t5_2tjqb","Exactly this. I want to add that I don't think this album is overlooked by the fan base.


Typically Who fans rank Quad and Who's Next as 1 &amp; 2 (in either order) as the best albums than rank as 3-5 in no consensus order Sell Out, Tommy, and By Numbers. Quad and Who's Next are like the holy grail albums with those other three typically considered only very slightly behind them. All 5 of those albums are part of the period where the band was considered ""peak who/the greatest live act in rock"".


IMO the only thing that holds back vanilla Sell Out is the amount of material that was cut (which was a natural consequence of limited vinyl space and the industry demanding bands release short pop songs fit for radio play - never mind concept albums).


Fortunately we have around 50+ songs and jingles released from this area over the years. 


Imagine if the band was given the freedom and budget to produce the full album. Now in addition to what has been released we have all the cut content on the album including their classic staples Pictures of Lilly and Summer Time Blues. We also would of potentially had the full 25-30 minute version of Rael recorded by the band, more John Entwistle songs that were cut (when he was still writing his most whitty dark humor songs), and more instrumentals like mountain king and sodding about from their sessions. 


I bet it would have rivaled Quadrophenia and Who's next in pure ambition. 


That being said if it wasn't for these limitations, I don't know if they would have conceived Tommy and everything that came after. The band was pushed so creatively in studio and on the road in 67 that they were able to develop the musical maturity and knowlegde needed to compose everything after.",1675209751

"DCSpoilers","t5_435w33","Hard reboot with soft edges- the Flash movie is resetting everything, as we knew (though I'm sure they've re-edited it to tie in with the current slate), and TSS/Peacemaker and Blue Beetle are both fully canon, but everything else is completely rebooted with mostly new actors. 

The first Aquaman movie is probably canon, because it didn't have many major ties to the DCEU aside from the actors. Same reason TSS and Peacemaker are staying canon. You can probably set aside Suicide Squad (2016), because ever since Birds of Prey everyone's tried to ignore it. TSS kinda sorta ignored BOP, but that movie is basically standalone so it really doesn't matter.

Jason Momoa is staying as Aquaman (and probably also playing Lobo eventually), and Blue Beetle seems to be pretty much unchanged from the original plans, but everyone else is getting new actors. (Pattison is still staying as Batman, and Phoenix is still staying as Joker, but like before those are two completely separate canons that take place outside of either the DCEU or the DCU)

**TL;DR**: old canon confusing, just ignore it. The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker, and Aquaman are the only things they're bringing forward. From now on, you can expect a far less confusing slate.",1675209752

"kratom","t5_2qx0h","Hydrocodone has a half life of about 4 hours with effects lasting 6-8 hours. Starting kratom after that window or more will usually work. I would not combine the two and if kratom doesn‚Äôt work you may find that switching back to hydrocodone in 6-8 hours doesn‚Äôt work as well because it is longer acting (despite primary pain relieving effects lasting 4-6 hours).

Dose is a bigger consideration. The effects change around 2.5g-3.5g and shift into pain relief and sedation with lower doses being more stimulating or energizing. That said, some people with little or no tolerance can experience some degree of pain relief with less, and some people can‚Äôt handle &gt;2.5g at first.

Having been taking hydrocodone there likely is some degree of tolerance, but it would be minimal given the length of use and time since use.

I‚Äôm dealing with the same issue. I had surgery a yesterday and the Norco 5/325 they sent me home with isn‚Äôt cutting it, so I‚Äôm debating switching back to kratom or combining some of the Norco doses until it runs out since I have higher tolerance and know from a procedure several years ago I can safely use more.

Like another said, I‚Äôm also concerned about the issues with dry socket and taking a powdered plant material of any sort. Capsules or filtered tea would reduce this risk. If making tea the basic approach which should work is to let it steep for about 10 minutes and pour hot though a basket type coffee filter or French press or let it settle and then gently pour until you start to see the green plant material in the stream‚Äîthen toss the rest in the trash. It is a bit wasteful but reasonable.

I do filtered tea because it is gentler on my stomach.",1675209752

The reason you keep seeing them in the same places is because you keep going back to those locations to look for them. Creatures only spawn within a certain distance from the player, so you're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: you go to a place looking for an abomination, your presence is required for it to spawn, it spawns, you think ""wow look there's a spawn point!""

In Dec of 2021, she seemed to be in a lot of pain, was refusing to eat, etc‚Ä¶ Vet recommended dental &amp; I agreed. The day of the dental, I get a call that the vet &amp; one of the other vets did their best to get a look in her mouth &amp; both agreed that she had a tumor in the back of her jaw that was raw &amp; bloody, said she was in excruciating pain, &amp; recommended euthanasia. I said, No. Do the dental. Vet still disagreed. Waited like an hour, called me back again &amp; wanted to be sure I hadn‚Äôt changed my mind. Now, I was getting angry. She‚Äôs been at the vet for 5 hours already. I stuck to my guns. ‚ÄúDo the dental.‚Äù Vet called back in about an hour. She was wrong. I was right. She had a badly broken molar in the back that broke at the gumline &amp; left sharp tooth fragments, like shards, which were ripping her tongue &amp; the gums above. A biopsy was done &amp; came back clear. And my girl had been great ever since then. 
Go with your gut feeling. My feeling was, get in her mouth &amp; really look, which is something that couldn‚Äôt be done with her awake. If there‚Äôd have been a tumor, I would then have had to make a decision. But I sure would have HATED to have euthanized &amp; then found out it was all over a bad tooth.",1675209752

An example of that is we're required to take honors classes for normal bachelors of science students.

I can definitely understand this post from my recent break up. 

His reason was because he ‚Äúfell out of love‚Äù with me. 
Even though we talked about marriage, starting an family, eventually moving to his dream state Colorado. I was willing to accommodate my life, so he can pursue his law enforcement career &amp; and be successful in his military career.  
I was blindsided when he wanted to end things with me. Last month I found out he was already talking another girl. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was emotionally cheating on me towards the end of our relationship. It did hurt me, because I he told me didn‚Äôt want to date anyone for an while. Because this ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù hurt him alot. Well I guess people change. 
It definitely shows I am being treated currently, but I am doing better actually and really proud of myself for motivating myself to going back to school. Plus I found an new job, passing my classes.

So I‚Äôm trying to see what a licensed teacher would want to make for a 20hour/4 day work week so I can figure out what I would need to make base line so I can find my break even spot.

I know not everyone has the opportunity to seek out alternatives to public education, and I also know that not everyone can afford to spend one of two incomes on education for their kid. I‚Äôm just trying to do the best I can.",1675209754

I played Kled like a full blown assassin, sat in bushes waiting for rotations and caught squishy enemies. You can also do bruiser ofc, playstyle changes. I prefer mid because I'm a midlaner but you can do top. Some champions are better than others, Kled is fine ofcourse but you'll have to work harder to win than you would on other champions. 

Now I'm in a bruiser gore BC titanic phase and I really like it. Basically you try to win lane, take your lead to other lanes and acquire a lot of gold for yourself and your team so that you can take objectives, and that'll give you a big enough advantage to be able to end the game. 

Try bruiser Kled, try full assassin, heck you can even try tank Kled. They all play differently, try mid try top, find your playstyle and stick to it and trust in it. Don't be result focused.",1675209754

Hello /u/ambitionp596,

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10qeskl/scared_to_repeat_same_mistakes/) was removed for the following reason(s):

**Your title did not include at least two ages/genders or was not formatted correctly**

Posts must: 

1. include details about the involved parties including ages, genders, and length of relationship, and

2. request advice in real situations involving two or more people

The ages and genders can go anywhere in your title, but have to be in one of the following formats:

`44M` `35 F` `23-NB` or `M44` `F 35` `NB-23`

The automod rule can process the genders M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, and MTF but more can be added.

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

We don't have that context.

But from a management side this is 100 percent something you do in employment screening. Because the people who fall for this will always fall for it. Randomly doing it when you feel like as a blind penetration test is cruel and will cause your employee to reevaluate their position. If your remind them the carrot is fake all they remember is the pain of the stick.

Training is supposed to be mutually beneficial. If an employee has enough privileges that falling for a phishing scam is detrimental to production then the company has bigger problems. If the company has to do Phishing training without alerting the employee, they have bigger problems.

If the goal is to train your employees, then losing employees is the opposite of that goal. People don't quit jobs they quit managers.  


Phishing training is done with the employee not against them.",1675209755

"powerrangers","t5_2s49e","Yeah I think having Johnny Yong Bosch in SPD rather than coming back as a ranger is a clear signal that they're positioning him to have a larger role in the story. In the Soul of the Dragon comic, SPD is a major agency that Tommy and other rangers have worked with periodically, and his son JJ is a member of SPD. 

My theory here is that they're drawing inspiration from that and are setting up SPD to be a common thread that they can use to have stronger continuity between all of the series. We know that the series SPD takes place in 2025. I'm thinking the 30th anniversary special will probably show SPD in it's infancy and set Adam up to be a founding/high-ranking member of SPD. 

I'm thinking that Adam is going to have a unique form, like the Kat Ranger or like Krueger. That way they can have him drop in on other ranger teams periodically in a non-ranger or auxiliary ranger capacity on ""SPD business.""  

It's also noteworthy that this coincides with a space-themed PR series, so Adam/SPD (as an institution, not the ranger team) may appear in that series a few times.",1675209756

&gt; they're kinda endophobic

Have you considered that it might be your friends' attitudes which are making you feel like you haven't earned the ""right"" to exist as plural/that you need to ""prove"" your plurality to begin with?

If so: do you think telling them will actually ease your distress? What if it does initially, but down the line, you get anxious about letting them think you're traumagenic, like Murph is right now? Do you want them to know you're plural, or do you want them to accept you for everything that you are? 

Now, I'm not telling you to up and drop your friends - I get that friendship is complicated and that there's reasons to be friends with people even if there are things that you disagree with. That being said, try thinking of this situation in terms of, say, being nonbinary and nondysphoric with friends who believe that only binary dysphoric trans people exist. Would letting those friends believe that you're a binary dysphoric trans person put you any more at ease? 

Obviously, being trans and plural aren't the same and all that, but my point is, you might want to start off with people who will accept you as you are, and won't make you feel like you need to prove yourself. They do exist - I promise! Barring that, think carefully about where the feelings are coming from, especially if they don't get better or get worse after telling them. And above all else, be careful that you all don't box yourself in a different way, trying to conform to what they think is legitimate.",1675209756

"law","t5_2qh9k","OK, maybe I've got it figured out.  Please tell me if I'm wrong...

The $250 million bail is simply the amount he would have to pay if he violates his bail agreement.  It bears no relationship to what he needed to do to stay out of prison while awaiting trial

The prosecutors &amp; judge struck another deal setting the conditions he would need to meet in order to stay out of prison.  Specifically, his parents would need to offer their house as collateral and cosign the bail agreement.

If he violates the bail agreement, his parents will lose their house and they along with Bankman-Fried would be on the hook to pay $250 million - an amount neither has any chance of paying.

As a lay person I thought bail was a dollar amount... the amount you would have to post in order to be released pending trial and what would be forfeited if you violated your bail provisions.  Now it seems to me that ""bail"" is not a dollar amount but is actually an agreement.  Bail (the agreement) can specify  amounts and conditions for being released pending trial that are different than the amount forfeited if the bail agreement is violated. I never knew that.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","The main issue for me is that you can‚Äôt edit your main characters or force players to change theirs (perhaps to a secondary deck, for instance). Because of this, when you start a weekly challenge or PvP, skill and shuffles being equal, you are statistically at a disadvantage in many match-ups.

Then there‚Äôs the fact that, for a card game, there is a substantially narrow amount of match-ups to counter the net decks, which isn‚Äôt really a huge issue because you can use decks like Maguu/Jean/Fischl and clear absolutely everything since you have 3 elements, resonance, healing and forced swap; you don‚Äôt even need to be good with that team or be lucky with shuffles. But it‚Äôs still pretty lacklustre. 

I really enjoyed it when it started, but it needs to evolve and add more interesting mechanics for me to want to play it more outside of what‚Äôs required for challenges.",1675209757

The DPD website includes a video of what looks like the photographed individual walking around the Dallas Zoo near the Tamarind exhibit. It is worth noting that the area in the recording is an immensely popular area of the zoo. I find it odd that the two individuals who were recorded are the ONLY ones in that area during the recording. Seems likely that this was after hours.

I also did not install mine on a stud, I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt believe the instructions said it needed a stud.

"FemalePhysicians","t5_5zlklz","Here‚Äôs my low-ball answer: go outside, grab a coin and assign heads to anesthesia and tails to pediatrics, flip the coin really high in the air and toss it far (so that it spends a lot of time in the air lol). Whichever side (heads or tails) you are hoping it lands on, is your #1 specialty. Sometimes your gut instinct is correct and will lead you down the right path. Trust the process !

Here is my more thoughtful response: I think it depends! You only have one anesthesiology interview so this really changes things. Idk where you are from or what your entire family situation is or where this one program is that gave you an interview, but consider location! I know a lot of people over on the residency subreddit will always say ‚Äúlocation location location‚Äù as the one deciding factor for rank lists so maybe that will sway your decision. Do you want to be close to family? Do you want to move to another city? Are you willing to move? Etc. Again, idk where this one anesthesiology program is or where the peds programs are but take this into consideration!

Regarding finances, $500K in debt is rough. And you‚Äôre right, money shouldn‚Äôt be everything but as a realistic adult, you can‚Äôt ignore it‚Äôs importance. I think it‚Äôs possible to make great money in peds, but you probably/most definitely have to do a fellowship and probably be at an academic center and other extra stuff. And assuming you want future kids, place strong consideration on what kind of life you want and which career will afford you all of the things you want. 

Based on what wrote, to me it sounds like you should rank anesthesia first. I think doing a fellowship in some kind of peds specialty might award you the double satisfaction so that‚Äôs something to look forward too. I wouldn‚Äôt worry so much about the whole CRNA thing because you will have a job and it‚Äôs not like the residency itself is going to be abolished.",1675209758

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","You know when as the child you end up victimized by the parents actions and it repeats with no regard to how it‚Äôs caused the child to end up blaming themselves or worse defending their abusers which is common. They won‚Äôt take accountability for the mistake, instead they throw others under the bus, project, make excuses, or the usual you become the scapegoat for them to avoid or minimize accountability of their misconduct or mistake. Narcs don‚Äôt view their children as a child, they view them as objects to manipulate and feed their egos and over inflated self image and to push the narcs agenda at the expense of the child‚Äôs well-being and best interests for their personal gain and gratification. Narcs are not able to consider or grasp another‚Äôs well-being in the first place and their their own children are no exception. 

Children‚Äôs  brains are underdeveloped and part of the vulnerable population that needs the most protection due to that and a narc preys on that and uses it to their advantage basically at all times especially when they screw up. There‚Äôs a difference between a genuine mistake, and choices or actions being the cause of ‚Äúmistake‚Äù and how narcs don‚Äôt have the ability to correct or even own the behavior causing the mistake as they don‚Äôt see anything they do as wrong, it‚Äôs the world that‚Äôs wrong and against them. Normal parents grow from their mistakes as a narc repeats them thus a cycle of abuse is formed. 

Narcs are not able to form relationships that have equal and mutual give and take. If they are ‚Äúgiving‚Äù it‚Äôs just a form of currency to use later for their gain and can‚Äôt just ‚Äúgive‚Äù there‚Äôs always motive behind it for their personal gain or agenda, narrative, whatever. Healthy people see opportunity towards growth by making a mistake and owning it and truly showing empathy in the affect the mistake had to those around them or involved. Narcs feel there is no more room for growth and are content with who they are with zero actual self awareness. 

In healthy parent child dynamics there is a desire to not cause harm to their child so there is a willingness to collaborate with the child and communicate to not repeat something that caused them harm as opposed to narcs unable to perceive anything they do as harmful or are met with gaslighting, manipulation, emotional extortion and other psychological manipulations causing further damage and harm and is why narcissists are child abusers not a human making a mistake towards their children.",1675209758

The difference between a human taking inspiration and AI copying artwork is that while the human mind expands on the artwork and adds something to it that it didn‚Äôt have before, AI just smooshes a couple of works together (oft copying over even the watermark of an artist) and calls it a day.

"l5r","t5_2skzf","Hello, coincidentally I am running a similar game set during the coup but 3.5 edition. My players are all part of a new minor clan based out of the village of Mimura which is based near Dragons gate city. (North east of rokugan, between Phoenix territory and Otosan Uchi)

They are in the imperial city to receive the emperors blessing when the coup happens. I‚Äôve based most of this from the 2nd Ed Scorpion clan coup book but here‚Äôs the potential changes I‚Äôve added, maybe some might work for you?

Shiba Tsukune escapes the city early on and the players can assist if necessary, if Tsukune dies there is no one to stop Isawa Tadaka going fulll tainted so on the day of thunder he is killed by Shiba Ujimitsu and Isawa Kaede becomes the thunder. The soul of Shiba passes to Shiba Tetsu or a random unnamed Shiba npc to give complete freedom. 

A group of Unicorn attack the city and make it through the scorpion defences but get cut off and separated. I just decided they‚Äôre led by Shinjo Yasamura, the champion‚Äôs son. The scorpion try to get an envoy out to discuss peace with the scorpion and if they do it‚Äôs revealed to be an assassin who kills either Yasamura, which means no marrying Hida O-Ushi and no Hida Kuon or Hida Kuroda. Or the assassin kills Shinjo Yokatsu which leaves the clan without a champion and a massive power void with the kolat too. 

The scorpion put a bunch of captured lion on a funeral pyre in an attempt to draw out Toturi. If Toturi stays to rescue them he will be badly injured leaving him unable to challenge Shoju. He can lead the armies from the rear line still but someone else needs to duel Shoju, so who better than his good friend Doji Hoturi? This means Hoturi kills Shoju and claims the throne leading to him being made ronin along with the Doji family. The army of the black crane replaces Toturi‚Äôs legion down the line. 

If Hoturi is duelling Shoju (Kharmic considering what he‚Äôs been up to with Shoju‚Äôs wife) this means someone else needs to duel Hoturi‚Äôs son Dani and he replaced by the egg of pan ku by a grieving Kachiko. I chose Toturi, as I like the idea of the False Toturi going mad and attacking the Crane and Lion during the Clan War but other ideas I had were. Otaku Kamoko, Bayushi Yujiro the junshin or Shiba Tsukune if she lived previously. 

There‚Äôs an assassin who again tries to off the unicorn champion. If Yokatsu is already dead, then Yasamura dies who is left to take over? 

With your example of Hida Kisada on the throne and vying to keep it, he‚Äôs going to have the other clans United against him so could he ally with the shadowlands to build up numbers? Perhaps he agrees to acknowledge Yoritomo as a true heir of Osano Wo and the Yoritomo becoming a family of the crab with Yoritomo as clan champion serving Emperor Kisada?",1675209760

&gt;  
&gt;Catching Covid is inevitable.

because infection is a [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean) variable??  Wearing the mask reduces exposure.  Reduced exposure means reduced infection or no infection at all.  Wearing a mask properly at all times is a huge ask.  But wearing one only halfway right, half the time **is still better** than not at all.  Do you even know what **MITIGATION** means for fuck's sake?

let me help:

mitigate - mƒ≠t‚Ä≤ƒ≠-gƒÅt‚Ä≥

transitive verb

\-To make less severe or intense; moderate or alleviate. synonym: relieve.

\-To make less severe, intense, harsh, rigorous, painful, etc.; to soften; to meliorate; to alleviate; to diminish; to lessen

Seriously, if you really think the *only two options* are ""sick"" or ""not sick,"" you are ABSOLUTELY UNQUALIFIED to even be having a discussion about medicine.  THERE ARE NO SILVER BULLETS IN MEDICINE.  The N95 mask gets its name from the fact that it is 95% effective at what it was designed for.  Not 100%.  Not 0%.  It literally tells you on the fucking box that it *isn't infallible*!  So, why would you give it a 1-star review for *not being infallible*?  Do you also send back your steak because it doesn't taste like shrimp scampi?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the scientific evidence that masks reduce the spread of Covid in the real world is not good.

You're being asked to help find the missing person. You're given personal/private information about this person in order to help them be found. You don't have any right to this information and only know it because the family/friends chose to share it.

Once the person is found, your help is no longer needed. The reason personal/private information was being shared no longer exists. You still don't have any right to this information and it remains up to the family/friends/person to choose to share it.

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods &amp; Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

"Construction","t5_2qiuc","Pressure treating has a service life. After some years the pressure treating chemicals are no longer providing protection and anywhere wood sits on top of something else or in close contact with something it can trap moisture and that's where it's going to fail first.

Basically, depends on whether you think this deck needs to last longer than the 30-40 or so years it will take for the pressure treatment to wear off.

To me, it's a maintenance task. If your deck is still good after 40-years then a spray applied coating can be used to extend its life or simply just replace the damaged members. The only time I personally ever worry about pressure treatment lifespan is for structural elements that cannot be easily replaced or repaired. Inaccessible members, timbers that support the majority of the building structure, wooden bridge elements, etc. Basically, nothing on a residential project but for wooden bridges and major commercial buildings it's definitely a consideration.",1675209763

"uwaterloo","t5_2rb5s","1) WUSA's current governance model is an adapted version of the Carver (or Policy) Governance model. Basically, Board sets the strategic direction and end goals, but the specifics of how we get there are delegated to the CEO (a permanent full-time staff) and the staff that work underneath them (60+ permanent full-time staff, contract staff, co-op, and part-time employees that work here).

Board's role is to provide ensure the organization is both progressing towards its goals (by receiving regular updates) and is in compliance with its policies. 

***Example:*** *Board might point out that WUSA is not in compliance of a hypothetical policy that states ""WUSA shall provide a clear, timely, and survivor-centric way for students to report instances of sexual harassment/assault in spaces overseen by WUSA or its sub-entities"". The org would then need to address the issue, and demonstrate to Board how this requirement has been fulfilled.*

The priorities that Board sets for the organization are meant to be informed by consultation at-Large. A President/VP/Director might come in with a vision for improving XYZ, but it's considered bad practice to set that direction for the org without confirmation from the larger population.

Broadly, it's a good system for streamlining work and ensuring accountability. But I am still skeptical (and you know my feelings on this u/matthewschwarze) of its ability to meaningfully empower student leaders and leverage their innate passion, knowledge, and understanding of what would help students.

Many of WUSA's current Directors have come in with well-thought out ideas of initiatives, policies, events, etc. that (imo) would genuinely help the student population. (We can see the same with many of the ideas candidates have brought forth in this Subreddit). Despite this, the Carver Model would say that Board really isn't the place for specific solutions/proposals. Board handles the ends, not the means. The Carver Model says that ""professional staff know best"". Now, I agree that professional staff are crucial in student associations; they provide student leaders with historical context, mentorship, the occasional reality check, and ultimately ensure continuity within the org. That said, I don't think they can (or should) replace students in being the ideators, do-ers, and problem-solvers.

**TDLR;** This is how it works, but I'd caution against uncritical adoption of it in its purest form without other pathways/mechanisms in place to meaningfully empower students and places for students to prototype/build their own solutions",1675209763

Most logos, the Sens one included, look like they came out of a specific period in time. That's not unique of modern logos. People loving this iteration we're using because of nostalgia, more then anything else. In a decade or two the 3D logo will suddenly be cool.

The Kachina logo is a good example of that. Was hated early on, but grew in popularity as the years passed. Even the OG Raptors and Grizzlies logos from the 90s weren't nearly as loved back then as they are today.",1675209764

https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=18  
""Kobolds most commonly share the coloration and some physical resemblance to chromatic and metallic dragons, but others closely match different sets of true dragons‚Äînotably esoteric, imperial, planar, and primal dragons. In Tian Xia, kobolds with an imperial dragon appearance are nearly as common as those with chromatic and metallic features, and often take roles as advisors and spellcasters. Planar and primal kobolds sometimes hatch when a settlement is in great danger or exposed to planar energies, and are often considered to be destined for greatness. Esoteric kobolds are rare anywhere, though they appear more regularly in places with strange energies (such as the Impossible Lands), and are often feared and mistrusted by their clutchmates.""",1675209765

I have tried many air fresheners, but that mixes with the food smell and creates more mess. The better way is the Arabic style. Lighting up bakhoor for some time freshen ups the mood as well as it mixes with the air and filters the environment easily.
These are some tips I do to save myself sometimes. 

1.I always try to open windows when i am cooking so it eliminates strong odor. 
2.Cover the lid of the wok/pan. Keep a burning scented candle next to the stove - it absorbs some of the smell.",1675209765

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; His job is to be expert at acting not firearms

That's my pov as well. Baldwin is no George Santos; he never misrepresented himself as a firearms expert or indeed anyone who knew fuck-all about firearms. His expertise is in acting, and even his ""assistant producer"" or whatever the title was, had very little if any actual supervisory significance. Meanwhile, the ACTUAL, PAID ""firearms expert"" (the armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed) was apparently not on the set immediately prior to the tragic incident. 

People saying ""well he should have checked the chamber before the scene"" are ridiculous. Why would anyone assume he even knew how to do such a thing?

The real problem comes back to the obsession with ""realism"" in film. True, using fake prop guns with recorded gunshot sounds isn't as ""real"", but it doesn't result in dead cinematographers either.",1675209766

I know a lot of people say they shouldn't even talk about Tate because it gives him more power, but I don't see that. I think them making fun of Tate and pointing out how fucking stupid and evil he is, is helpful. There are a LOT of men out there that are still following Tate's teachings and I think it's important to constantly be pointing out his flaws and what makes him evil. As for the Bradley stuff, I did not like him before he went on the podcast, however, he did show signs of change. He most likely is surrounding himself with evil dumb assholes and its hard to see what's outside of your circle. I don't see anything wrong with Ethan and Hassan talking to Bradley and just telling him the truth. He showed signs of understanding and change, and if someone like him can change then the others might follow!

&amp;#x200B;

Not to take away from the rest of your points, but this one is more speculation than anything. The silhouette of Clem (and what you assume to be her shoe marks) do not necessarily mean she was intended to sleep in this room... or do anything in it, really. You're looking way too deep into what would've been early stage concept art from before they even started *building* any of the in-game assets and environments, let alone finalized the story beats.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just an early concept sketch of what they intended Sarah's room in the cabin to look like, with a silhouette of Clementine for scale/reference when it came time for the artists to build it. I'm all for looking deeper in to things (I've been doing all sorts of datamining shit for years after all), but sometimes, as Freud famously said, a cigar is just a cigar.",1675209767

Meghan's strings end in single, round stones.

Maxwell's earrings have 5 strings of gems.

Meghan's earrings are 3 strings of gems.

But if you do this thing where you lay on your stomach on the ground with your hands and legs up off the ground like a ‚Äúsuperman‚Äù you will feel that muscle. Then its a matter of maintaining that throughout the lift. And eventually you dont want to exaggerate it so much as that can also cause back problems.

All on Ubuntu Server. One day I'll save up enough for a Pulse Eight CEC adapter and slap it on too.

Boot times are great, noise is minimal, heat is no concern, and the extra power gives it tons more use cases.

To avoid excessive writes to my SSD and really squeeze all the read/write speed possible I drove myself an extra mile into insanity and mount the bulk of my databases and logs to a RAM disk via symlinks where possible.

A note to watch out for with Ubuntu in general would be to ensure your setup is properly spinning down and idling any external HDDs you may use to prevent excessive wear.

For the smart hardware the ZWave 5, 7, and 8 series are all solid as well as the ConBee II and the GoControl adapter, however if thread or matter interest you for future proof cases the HA SkyConnect may be the way to go.

I don't know if that was when he first started training and the testosterone kicked in or what. I was like, 'Oh man, somebody look in my bag and see if there is an iPad in there.' Because it kind of made me hot. I didn't think he addressed the situation quite the right way. That's all it was.""

"canon","t5_2qi07","I just changed my 250d for a fuji X-S10. 
Canon 250d was my first camera that I bought new, and what got me into photography a few years ago. At first, I was very excited because it was a whole new world for me, and I also wanted something that was small but functional enough for starting off. As I learned more and more about photography and post-production, I felt like it was time for me to move on to something that fit my needs a bit better.
For the past year and a half, I've basically shot only film and really liked the look of it (no need for post-processing as well).
For me, a few things really stand out between those two cameras right now:
 Firstly, the amount of focus points Fuji has compared to 250d (425 vs 9)+ eye tracking option. And it's a lot faster compared to the 250d.
Secondly, IBIS in the X-S10 is amazing. 250d didn't have that, and I had to invest in IS lenses, which still worked a bit weaker imo.
Thirdly, the film stimulations. I love them, and you can also find new recipes for stims on FujiXWeekly.
There's a lot more why I'd choose fuji over the 250d, but these are the main highlights for me.",1675209771

I thought that perhaps the bottom two on are you okay would be Fries and Eraser, but now Eraser has this established thing of messing with other teams instead of directly helping his team. Cary also mentioned that in his TPOT 3 reaction, which may prove that point even more. That may make voters more likely to save him.

People say that TV will be eliminated first, but I have seen a lot of support for him, perhaps influenced by those predictions saying he would be out first. People may want to prove others wrong, or they may feel bad for him.

Some of these reasons can include, but are not limited to:

- Not enough moderator experience for a large and active subreddit

- Not enough nsfw moderator experience
- Not modding current subs that you‚Äôre already a moderator of
- Collecting subreddits
- On the mod team of an excessive number of subreddits

- Not being very active on Reddit.

"GardeningUK","t5_31s8w","There are cerainly fashions in gardening, they're just slower than other fashions.  For a century or so the fashion has been for rose shape to be like the roses you buy as cut flowers - if you look at it from the side, a bulb where the petals join the flower, slimmer towards the top of the rose, then flairing back out again.  Flowers should be taller than they are wide and for a long time they were bred to be as large as possible.  Bred from the 'tea roses' that arrived on tea routes from China.  Breeders used to breed for the best quality individual roses with the best colours, meant really for cutting rather than being attractive in the garden.  When you breed for some qualities, you lose other qualities like scent and good looking plants.

David Austin did something different.  He took what were then considered very old-fashioned looking roses, and bred them to be good garden plants that could share space with other shrubs and perennials.  Which means breeding for healthy foliage and attractively shaped bushes, and also he bred for scent.  The then-unfashionable roses he used for breeding - flowers wider then they are long, with lots of petals which often form patterns within the flower - make them quite distinctive.",1675209774

One thing I didn‚Äôt mention is I developed seizures last year. Neurologists can‚Äôt say for certain why but an MRI showed what could be a burst vessel in my hippocampus. Which they don‚Äôt know for sure but seems to be a common denominator in people who develop seizures later. 
I‚Äôve been taking anti seizure medicine for about a year now and it affected everything. Personal, mental and spiritual well being. 

The weed only made everything worse but because I‚Äôd been using it as a crutch for so long I simply failed to leave it. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is‚Ä¶ you got this. Whatever excuse you have to not do what you KNOW needs to be done is valid as long as you make it so. 

I am speaking to myself as much as I am saying it to you.

"PSSD","t5_33wkt","I don‚Äôt really like the term positive thinking. I think it‚Äôs weird. It can be used very incorrectly. But yes, in a way, you need to be the opposite of what you are now. You need to be thinking I can do this, this fucking sucks, but it‚Äôs going to get better, and I‚Äôm gonna find a way to make it better. As opposed to just resigning yourself to it. So you do need a more positive attitude, that doesn‚Äôt mean everything‚Äòs fucking sunshine and rainbows, but it means that you were gonna fight like hell and that you know you‚Äôre going to get out of it or you are operating on the assumption that you were going to get out of it. You do need a mindset shift. That‚Äôs what some thing like Gupta or DNRS can help with, but also, we have so many bodily causes to address. If you look through my comment history you will see about a lot of them. This is auto immune, this is gut Microbiome, this is caused by the way the fucking pills attack our system and for most of us we already had underlying stuff so it‚Äôs about fixing root causes so that your body is allowed to heal. We all have brain inflammation, we all have gut Microbiome dysfunction and dysfunction of the lining, some of us have mold, some of us having heavy metals, some of us have Lyme disease, it depends on what you started with but also what the till did to you. And I think that also the pill makes us feel very very very negative as well as some of us who have trauma to begin with. Also, trauma, causes autoimmune disease and changes to your gut Microbiome. So there‚Äôs a lot here that you can do and you need to have that can-do attitude even though nobody should go through this for even fucking five seconds. So you can download me all you want, but I‚Äôm actually giving you some valuable information for yourself. And I will tell you that when people at first told me that my negative thinking would keep me sick, I said fuck you with your spiritual gaslighting bullshit, this is a in physical injury. But both things can be true because the mind has an extreme power over the body.",1675209774

The problem is that doing it right requires purchasing more material and most homeowners would not know this. Amazon is not checking for safe install. The seller would never be held responsible for a house that burned down. So, pay $20 extra to make sure that your lights will not destroy your home.

There was never any real power given to the people in charge. And so somebody could always go over their head and do whatever they wanted. And, you know, we had the DCEU, which then became the Joss Whedon Justice League, but it also became the Snyderverse, which became this. And we have Wonder Woman and we have Wonder Woman [1984], which doesn‚Äôt even match what happened in Wonder Woman one.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 &gt; Visiting my mothers home, my uncle drops off some kids with mental disabilities that I have never met before. My mother locks herself in her room and refuses to help me look after them. To keep the kids occupied, I let them use hundreds of dollars of her cosmetics to play makeover. They say I‚Äôm an asshole for using their things without their consent even though they left me to look after these kids by myself . Am I?

But he grew fearful he would be the first forgotten, so he went to the old lair of a dead dracolich and found a cursed set of plate armor and a greatsword, holding the soul of an ancient king who found himself in a similar circumstance. The armor grants him immortality and magics beyond his wildest dreams, and the greatsword whispers secrets to him, slowly corrupting him. He is my bbeg, and I feel I only did an ok job with him. The sword has green flames engulf it when it swings, and the green runes along it's side seem to be the same color as his new eye color

We had a little exchange before. Someone asked about Thandiwe Newton before she was ""verified"" as SG. You mentioned how she reminds you of Leslie Mann . At the time I had watched The Other Woman, which also stars FN Cameron Diaz and possible FN Kate Upton, and was thinking of her character in contrast to them.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

There is no hard evidence of a god, nor is there proof there ever was. It's why we have belief, people believe these things.

But these people wanna dictate how others live according to their book. And are often or not the most resistant to the opposite being set against them. 

As shown in said article, where they want the right to get involved in others lives, take their freedoms to satiate their crappy worldview according to a book they themselves change in their own head. 

Because they need to interpret the book for a modern audience. Since, actively murdering non believers or sexually assaulting slaves, sleeping with family members and children isn't very... popular anymore...

There's also the dmr options like maxon, anytone, and hyterra but it seems hive mind is generally around the p25 standard. P25 and dmr are two common digital standards but they can't work together, p25 is more used in public safety and dmr had more civilian support. If you want to encrypt legally, you need to form a llc and buy a business lisence, usually vhf. Top of the line options probably here would be the multiband handhelds like the Motorola apx8000/7000, new offerings from Tait and ef Johnson. The Harris unity radios are popular in this space as well. 

If you want to use atak that's a whole other can of worms, I'd recommend reading up on civtak and see what's in the Tak discord. There's meshtastic, gotenna, and the higher end manet options like silvus, persistent systems, etc.

Ham radio is primarily designed around disaster relief, so there's a lot of good information and development but their needs are usually in opposition to larper goals (ie no encryption).

Is it maybe an option to play around with what sort of stuff you eat before working out, something light, but perhaps more filling (I'm thinking peanut butter instead of yoghurt with the banana). Alternatively, maybe have a small snack before the workout and a protein drink (or a smoothie?) when you get hungry during the workout?

Also, just wanted to say, changing workout routines to accommodate your life circumstances is nothing to be ashamed of, it's the only long-term reasonable thing and good planning. If something isn't working for you, why keep pushing yourself, if you can find something that fits your situation better!

The F-150, well the reputation precedes it.  There is a reason in the the #1 selling truck of all time.  

As far as the Tacoma and Ranger, it is a matter of how much weight you need to haul or trailer.  Both will be less than the RAM or F-150.  The Tacomas are super popular and reliable.  Because of that they will be more expensive.  If you can find one for the same money as a Ranger I would take the Tacoma, but that would be a miracle.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","If Russia or really anyone can just start annexing territory it starts to cause big problems that can spin out of control into nazi level problems. Nazi level problems are bad for the whole world and the US being a country that can do something about it is doing something about it. Don't get it twisted. This is a cold war style attack on NATO for Ukraine wanting to join the EU and NATO. It's a threat. And if it's tolerated, like the Crimea annexation was tolerated, its' only going to be followed by more aggression, like the Crimea attack was followed by even more aggression.  

So the choice the US has here. Help them out as the good guys preventing the rising threat to global security or wait for it to get seriously bad 'n stay out of it, like the US did vs the nazis back in the day, and then end up nearly losing a world war that spun totally out of control? Help it is cuz it's way less costly than dealing with a psychopath who can expand his country/resources with a quick invasion here and there as it develops it's war machine.
