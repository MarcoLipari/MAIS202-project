"politics","t5_2cneq","No he hasn‚Äôt told 20k lies and the article plainly states that it also counts misleading information as well and There‚Äôs a difference. You saying that this Trump has lied 20k times is a lie. Trump giving his opinion that Obama did or didn‚Äôt want to do something is not a lie at worst it‚Äôs misleading but nobody know what Obama wanted or didn‚Äôt want to do. If Trump is a con-man and he‚Äôs been doing it his whole life and that‚Äôs the only reason he is where he is today do you really think that he would be such a bad one? Every politician is a con-Man/Woman

What other person? Again I‚Äôm confused by your logic if Trump is a con man would he not want to do what people wanted him to do? Would he not do everything in his power to save face in the public eye to win re-election? So England is the roughly the same position as us (actually worse) but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Trump might be average it‚Äôs just because everyone else is also terrible? 

Yep you‚Äôve got me I can‚Äôt explain away that the US is 4% of the population to be exact 4.25% why would I try to explain that away?

Well you are wrong about this one there are possible reasons that it could be explained. 1( I know people who have been tested once and got sent two positive test results. And 2( remember all those developing countries? How many of them are able to get the same amount of testing that we have in America? 

I agree but that‚Äôs not Trumps fault. If a sports team is doing bad is the blame solely on the manager? No it‚Äôs usually on the entire team. I know that Trump handled it poorly but I also think that most other countries handled it poorly and it‚Äôs stupid to act like Trump is the only reason that a GLOBAL PANDEMIC is killing people

Agreed nothing Biden has done makes anything that Trump has done Right or Wrong but I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt think Biden would have handled it better although even if he did handle it worse everyone would still be worshiping him because it‚Äôs just a trend now to hate Trump 

If you want to say that Trump will go down in history as the president with the worst response to a Global pandemic than that‚Äôs your opinion I guess even if there is probably plenty of worse options but that‚Äôs not what you said you said he was the worst President in US history and that‚Äôs just not true",1609459204

One thing I've noticed about natalism is it is actually way more eugenics then antinatalism could ever be. To procreate, you are actively stating that your genes are the best and deserve to be passed on, and that links can only be made with people who are ""like you"" (bc otherwise why not just adopt).

**Witness Says Drug Lord Told of Contra Arms**

A prosecution witness in the Enrique Camarena murder trial testified Friday in Los Angeles federal court that Mexican drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo told him that he believed his narcotics trafficking operation was safe because he was supplying arms to the Nicaraguan Contras.

**Informant Puts CIA at Ranch of Agent‚Äôs Killer**

The Central Intelligence Agency trained Guatemalan guerrillas in the early 1980s at a ranch near Veracruz, Mexico, owned by drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the murderers of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration report made public in Los Angeles.

**On Feb. 9, according to the report, Harrison told DEA agents Hector Berrellez and Wayne Schmidt that the CIA used Mexico's Federal Security Directorate, or DFS, ""as a cover, in the event any questions were raised as to who was running the training operation.""**

**Harrison also said that ""representatives of the DFS, which was the front for the training camp, were in fact acting in consort with major drug overlords to ensure a flow of narcotics through Mexico into the United States.""**

**At some point between 1981 and 1984, Harrison said, ""members of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrived at the ranch while on a separate narcotics investigation and were confronted by the guerrillas. As a result of the confrontation, 19 {Mexican police} agents were killed. Many of the bodies showed signs of torture; the bodies had been drawn and quartered.""**

In a separate interview last Sept. 11, Harrison told the same two DEA agents that CIA operations personnel had stayed at the home of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, one of Mexico's other major drug kingpins and an ally of Caro Quintero. The report does not specify a date on which this occurred.

**TRIAL IN CAMARENA CASE SHOWS DEA ANGER AT CIA**

**By** [**William Branigin**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/william-branigin/)**July 16, 1990**

MEXICO CITY, JULY 15 -- The trial in Los Angeles of four men accused of involvement in the 1985 murder of a U.S. narcotics agent has brought to the surface years of resentment by Drug Enforcement Administration officials of the Central Intelligence Agency's long collaboration with a former Mexican secret police unit that was heavily involved in drug trafficking.

According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sources and documents, the Mexican drug-trafficking cartel that kidnapped, tortured and murdered DEA agent Enrique Camarena in the central city of Guadalajara in February 1985 operated until then with virtual impunity -- not only because it was in league with Mexico's powerful Federal Security Directorate (DFS), but because it believed its activities were secretly sanctioned by the CIA.

Whether or not this was the case, DEA and Mexican officials interviewed for this article said that at a minimum, the CIA had turned a blind eye to a burgeoning drug trade in cultivating its relationship with the DFS and pursuing what it regarded as other U.S. national security interests in Mexico and Central America.

(.....)

CIA protectiveness of the DFS surfaced publicly in 1981, when the chief of the Mexican agency at that time, Miguel Nazar Haro, was indicted in San Diego on charges of involvement in a massive cross-border car-theft ring. The FBI office at the U.S. Embassy here cabled strong protests, calling Nazar Haro an ""essential contact for CIA station Mexico City.""

San Diego U.S. Attorney William Kennedy disclosed in 1982 that the CIA was trying to block the case against Nazar Haro on grounds that he was a vital intelligence source in Mexico and Central America. Kennedy was subsequently fired by President Reagan. At the time, Nazar Haro also was heavily involved in drug trafficking, witnesses in two U.S. trials have testified.

By the early 1980s, the DFS also had gained a reputation as practically a full-time partner of the Mexican drug lords. In 1985, after the Camarena murder, the government disbanded it in an effort to root out corruption and repair Mexico's image. But many former DFS agents remain active, especially in the Mexico City police department.

I feel like if this game was just about logistics and really leaned into more into being ""The Postman"", which is also about a post apocalyptic America thats basically run by a roving bandit clan. But by being the guy who sends people their mail, you are kinda rebuilding America and peoples faith in a government that doesnt actually exist...yet. IF he could have tapped into that idea more and had his ~~TOTALLY NOT SCOTLAND~~ America get better as you sent more packages and had actual explorable buildings and decayed cities to give you a sense of what was lost in his version of America, I think the game would be an ACTUAL GAME.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","&gt; Realists have argued that the prevalence of anarchy in the state system requires individual states to be ruthlessly self-seeking. Because there is no suprastate actor capable of enforcing international law, each state must provide for its own security. Thus, a structural anarchy is also inevitably a self-help regime: every government reserves the right to decide what is just or necessary for itself and to take up arms to pursue or enforce that decision. Because the best way to achieve security under anarchy is to be powerful (both militarily and economically), self-help leads naturally to power-maximizing behaviour. In an anarchic state-system, **power-maximizing behaviour is therefore the normal behaviour of all states.**

"MVIS","t5_3fgj0","Adkkilla, I'm not advocating that you or anyone else should sell at $3, I certainly wouldn't. In fact I would mortgage my house to raise funds to buy more at that level. 

OceanTomo, then please, stop reading my comments. And I'm not ""Bashing"" either the stock or the Company. 

Bridgetofar, it wouldn't have any impact on the negotiations, in my opinion. They aren't trying to sell a Market Cap. They are selling the company's IP. That isn't affected by the company's Market Cap.

Alphacpa, I sincerely hope you are right. It would be a precipitous drop to the $3 Range. I'm not trying to convince to anyone that it WILL go that low. But I think it could. And the longer we go before Microvision themselves say something the easier it will be for it to get there.

Look, I am NOT saying it WILL go to the $3 Range. What I am saying is that it certainly WOULDN'T surprise me if it did and if it did I would be a buyer. 

I still absolutely believe that they will sell the company for a huge multiple of todays share price and I still believe they will sell it in the next four or five or six months. No one seemed to question it when it hit $10 share on no news and no one should be surprised if it hits $3 a share on no news. Hope, fear and opportunity is what is driving the share price at the moment. Hundreds of Millions of Dollars were made (on paper) as the shares went to $10. Hundreds million more has been made (on a different piece of paper) while the share price has dropped to todays close. If Microvision makes an announcement on Monday Billions will be made on the way up again. If they don't Hundreds of Millions could still be made going the other way. Traders will take the opportunity EITHER way. All I'm saying is don't be surprised when they do.",1609459208

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","My parents refused to accept the my lifelong disability was a disability (migraines)...They pushed me hard to go to college, even though I did not have my disability under any sort of control whatsoever. I failed multiple times and kept getting pushed to go back to college. They made it literally the only option available. I wasn't able to graduate. I then proceeded to get fired from all my jobs because I kept missing days due to my disability, and they still insisted I just wasn't trying hard enough, when literally all I did was try my absolute best to pretend I was normal because they had drilled it into me that I was just not trying hard enough. 

Turns out missing 7 out of 30 days a month to debilitating pain and therefore missing school and work days does not make it easy to function as an adult. I went through some tough times where I believed it was all my fault, and they still won't admit that my migraines are a significant detriment to my life. To put it in perspective, I missed on average 12 weeks to pain per year, that's 3ish months. Obviously no employer could keep an employee like that. And because my parents never saw it as a disability, I didn't even have the government protection against being fired because I wasn't classed as ""disabled"" even though I was diagnosed before the age of 7.

I've only managed to get it under control this past year with a lot of help from my partner, who is patient, kind and understanding. I still get migraines, but I've managed to start a small business a few months ago and I can't get fired from my own venture!",1609459209

The issue here is that he isn‚Äôt doing the same thing, and trust me he knows it on some level. He gets away with it by turning it around and then, because he knows you‚Äôll listen to him with empathy, he projects onto you and tells him that it‚Äôs actually YOU that is ‚Äúbad.‚Äù

He does it because he is selfish, he doesn‚Äôt actually care whether he hurts you, and this method works. I mean look at this, how many hours have you now spent searching for what you did wrong, making excuses for him, desperately searching for some crumb of logic to explain away how much he is hurting you? Do you really think he does that for you? 

Unless he takes the time to dig DEEP and make some serious shifts on his own, he isn‚Äôt going to change. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs an evil person, but it does mean he will keep twisting your head up to get what he wants, to avoid ever really owning his shit. Love without manipulation is one of the most beautiful things we can ever experience and he is missing it, and you‚Äôre letting him rob you of it too.

Not only that, but they cut staff, so it would have been only one doctor/one nurse except that it was early in the morning and the night shift nurse agreed to stay a couple hours after her 12-hour overnight shift. There was no nursery nurse, and one of the twins was sideways. The hospital was VERY lucky on that one.

We encourage you to resubmit your post though!  Just resubmit and add [Image], [Gif], [Album] or [Video] at the beginning of the title.  We know....we're a bunch of rules Nazi's.  We don't like it either.  The tags just keep things organized, let us set flair automatically, allows for filtering and It also stops bots from posting in this majorly [OC Content] sub, which I think we all agree is a good thing! 

Thank You for posting to our sub!

I've noticed when I use the EML with max upgrades (one shot, one kill baby!) the score per-kill is a nice round, consistent, satisfyingly high number. But with any sort of missile, it seems to differ wildly based on criteria I don't fully grasp. I know the score increases if your target has ""stars"" for being on a hot streak, and the type/cost of the bird you take down seems to be important as well. There's definitely something else though, and I haven't figured it out yet. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe the missile flight time/velocity on impact is factored in multiplicatively? It's all very confusing, but I feel like if can get to the bottom of exactly how this calculation works, I could really optimize my scoring.

"SelfHarmScars","t5_3dbxi","hi, yes they count. I'm sorry that you're in pain and that you've felt the need to hurt yourself. 

maybe try talking to a therapist or counsellor if you can? Sometimes it might be helpful to talk it out with someone who's professionally trained. It might cost money where you are, though there are often organizations that offer therapy for free (particularly if you live in a big city). If it's not an option, there are many free help/hotlines that are especially for youth. For example, Canada has Kids Help Phone but I'm sure you could look up your country and also ""youth helpline"" and you will probably get some results. It may help to talk it out. I'm sorry you're struggling. Just a suggestion of course.

Also, ignore the 3 mean/vile/gross comments below. I am SO sorry about that. :( you are NOT pathetic, you're not ""attention-seeking"" and I'm so so sorry that they said something like that. It's not true.",1609459212

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a cybersecurity guy for hire, and have done a lot of work that was pretty messy, but this is one of the more immoral/messed up ones.

A few years back I did some work with the Kurdish peshmerga in Iraq as a favor for an old friend who grew up there. Around when I was working, ISIS had stepped up their counterintelligence &amp; intelligence game (with the thanks of the Turkish government's helping hands) and began to take the smartphones off of killed friendly combatants. I wasn't made aware of this until a month before I went back home. Some easily made countermeasures were put in place, and the fighting carried on as per usual, albeit more demoralizing with having to verify everyone you talked to that wasn't face to face.

After that stint I resumed mostly normal life, when a dude hit me up from back then about a year later.
I ran into him a couple times while I was doing my favor for said friend, and he was a very nice dude and a damn good poet, so we got to chatting a bit to see how he was. He was really curious to what everyone else was up to, of which I didn't really know, or didn't bother to go into any detail of those who I did know about.

A few weeks later I had a call with said old friend, and brought up the dude.

My friend got pretty quiet and through the call relayed how the dude was killed and his body went missing after they tried to recover him once the fight was over.

Apparently they used his body's biometrics to unlock the phone, and  were messaging anyone related to the peshmerga in the hopes of getting an information leak.

It was unnerving at the time to realize that, and I still think about it from time to time.

TLDR. ISIS tried to catfish me using a dead dude",1609459214

"MtF","t5_2ub9j","It's technically illegal, but it effectively can still happen. What happens is that your rates become so prohibitively expensive that you aren't able to afford coverage. Also, with the current attacks on the ACA, and efforts by Republicans to remove coverage for pre-existing conditions, the future of my healthcare is very much up in the air. 

People with PKD-1 tend to start developing cysts around adolescence and start having adverse side effects in their early to mid-'30s. This is often debilitating, and my mom had to stop teaching because of it. Some days it is so painful or exhausting that she's unable to do much other than get out of bed to use the bathroom, and she'll sleep for most of those days. Cysts can pop due to physical movement or falling or getting hit in just the wrong way, or due to stress, or just at random. When this happens its about as painful as a kidney stone, and you can't pee like a UTI. It happens at least once a month for mom, and more when it's acting up. She only just turned 43. 

Because of this, unless your employer is super accommodating you will lose your job in your mid-30's. People with it tend to go into stage 5 kidney failure in their mid to late-40's and without a transplant, the life expectancy is 53 years. These numbers improve for those with PKD-2, but our family has type 1, which is early-onset. If you're someone in my shoes, then getting tested is about the worst thing you could do. 

Considering the state of healthcare in America, I might be screwed if I test positive. There is a very real possibility of losing my job, losing my healthcare, and dying without insurance because I can't pay out of pocket. That would leave my partner and children with almost no safety net, and that's unacceptable to me. 

What I do is drink a lot of water and cut back on sodium. If I do have it, this can push back the onset of the disease by as much as 5 years, and even if I don't I will be healthier for it. Considering that most Testosterone blockers are processed through the kidneys, I need to be on them for as short a time as possible or pay more for GnRH blockers. I'm planning on taking blockers for less than 5 years before having an orchiectomy or GRS. Thankfully, Estrogen is processed through mainly the liver (but also the kidneys), so I don't have to worry about it as much.",1609459216

\---------------

The Bell Towers of Notre Dame stretched higher than any building surrounding them, high into the night sky, their steeples so close to the clouds that some said they scratched the firmament of the heavens itself. At the very top of one of these magnificent towers, two stone statues sat side by side, gazing out at the flickering lights of Paris.

‚ÄúHey Victor.‚Äù

*‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù*

‚ÄúSuck my marble wings, Victor. There‚Äôs someone coming in.‚Äù

‚ÄúHugo, how many times do I have to tell you not to disturb me during my midnight nap?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *giiirrrllll.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt -wait what? Where?‚Äù

Two distorted stone faces peered over the edge of the parapet, looking down into the night at the hooded figure running desperately through the snow-covered courtyard. Behind her, an imposing man atop a pure-black horse bore down on the young woman, his arm reaching out to grab a bundle clutched desperately in her arms.

‚ÄúThe judge.‚Äù Hugo‚Äôs voice spat pure venom as he glared down at the figure below. ‚ÄúDisgusting piece of filth.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet no corrupt communication proceed out of thy mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying,‚Äù Victor responded. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ yes, yes he is.‚Äù

A sudden yank at the bundle and the woman flew back from the force of the tug, her head ringing with an audible *crack* as it collided with the stone steps below her.

‚ÄúDID HE JUST-‚Äù Hugo stared down in horror at the now-unmoving body sprawled on the courtyard.

‚ÄúOh, the poor thing,‚Äù Victor murmured, covering his mouth with his claws.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he ‚Äì that‚Äôs a boy he‚Äôs holding! No. The well! DON‚ÄôT YOU DARE!‚Äù

‚ÄúHALT!‚Äù A third voice rang out in the night, causing both gargoyle and man to turn towards the owner of the voice.

‚ÄúAw yeah Gabe, you tell him! Beat his ass, beat his ass!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know Hugo, normally I would never condone violence‚Ä¶ but in the case of the judge, BRUTALIZE HIS POSTERIOR, GABRIEL!‚Äù

Gabe and the judge had a heated conversation below the two stone gargoyles, their words lost in a sudden wind that whipped through the alley. Shouting rose up in the night, spiraling up to the monument the gargoyles looked over but dissipating just before it reached them.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that stank-ass judge going now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe he‚Äôs walking to‚Ä¶ oh dear, he‚Äôs coming to our bell tower!‚Äù

As fast as two stone effigies could move, which was rather frustratingly slow, Victor and Hugo dashed back to their normal positions on the opposite ledge. The door opened just as Hugo vaulted back onto his pedestal, a long shadow heralding the entrance of the judge.

‚ÄúThis meddlesome holy man‚Ä¶ how dare he interfere with justice!‚Äù he grumbled, carrying a squirming bundle to the table. He unceremoniously dumped the baby boy on the surface, gazing down at its face in disgust.

‚ÄúWhat a monster. I shall call you‚Ä¶ Quasimodo.‚Äù 

Looking around, he gathered a few scraps of cloth and made a rough bed, placing the child inside. ‚ÄúTry not to die. It‚Äôs a long drop down the belltower.‚Äù With a dry laugh, he flung his cloak around and stormed out.

‚ÄúIs it safe, Victor?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

The two gargoyles slowly crept towards the wriggling mass on the makeshift bed and peered over the blankets at the creature laying within.

Victor breathed in sharply. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ *beautiful.*‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at its eyes, Victor!‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ like infinity made imaginable.‚Äù Victor brushed one stone claw gently along the child‚Äôs face, causing him to giggle in delight and reach up in an attempt to grasp the gargoyle‚Äôs finger.

Hugo smiled reassuringly and tucked in the baby‚Äôs blanket. 

‚ÄúWelcome to your new home, Quasimodo.‚Äù

https://www.classicalguitarshed.com/

Another approach that covers right hand mechanics in excruciating detail is Jamie Andreas' Guitar Principles https://www.guitarprinciples.com/

Neither is cheap, but they'll offer you depth that you just won't get from free resources. 

But you might get the greatest benefit out of studying with a teacher for a bit, as has been suggested to you. I started on classical guitar and those lessons have stayed with me for almost 30 years.",1609459218

It‚Äôs always better for me when I have an emotional connection with someone. Perhaps you might find that too. 

What I suggest you do is sit your girlfriend down, let her know how much you love and care for her. Say to her that whilst it‚Äôs something that you‚Äôre not fully comfortable with right now, it is something you want to try in the future. Explain that you‚Äôd like to work up to it and perhaps play about with some toys first whilst you get over the mental hurdle of the idea of sex. Let her know after each ‚Äúsession‚Äù of whatever you do, where you are mentally with the idea of sex. Keep open and honest communication. Let her know how sexy you think she is and how much you are attracted to her. Play about with oral so she has some physical connection with you (if you‚Äôre ok with this). Work your way up to it. I do encourage you to try it at least once. Keep talking throughout so you can ensure you‚Äôre both happy, let her know how you‚Äôre feeling &amp; open up to her.

There are many reasons why the Court might not vote in favor of certiorari,  and a denial cannot be considered approval of a lower court decision.

The effect of the denial is that the holding in Boise v. Martin in the 9th Circuit stays in place and is precedent for any court in the 9th Circuit. Because Indiana falls under the 7th Circuit, we are not bound to follow the opinion of the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit has a reputation in the legal community as one of the most liberal of the federal circuits, and the decision was not unanimous. The 7th Circuit, which trends a bit more conservative than the 9th, may come down differently.",1609459220

You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports.

As a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. 

You will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.

"teachinginkorea","t5_33pt1","I'm not a English teacher but I know quite a bit about teaching in Korea.

1. You don't need to know any Korean but you should attempt to learn while you're there/before
2. As long as you have a degree I don't think it matters
3. You will have to check with the school if you're allowed to bring your pets as you will be likely staying in the apartment that they provide.
4. Some recruiters say you can't talk to others, but of course you can. You should get someone to review your contract.
5.  pretty sure you're not expected to drink with coworkers and you can say you don't drink.
6. Depends on the effort you put in, if you put an effort to talk to people in Korean I'm sure you'll be able to make friends
7. Foreign English teachers get paid more than Korean teachers, you are paid pretty well compared to them. It's illegal to work second jobs or stuff depending on your visa

"Christians","t5_2qk5n","Not sure which reference to giants you were referencing, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Just because one has a bit of a doubt as to something doesn‚Äôt mean they believe.  One of my favorite scriptures is Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.

As It says in Isaiah 1:18a ‚ÄúCome now, let us reason together, says the LORD:

When one goes into a magic show, one knows that certain things are not as they seem, yet one holds a little belief of the things presented might be as seen.  When one looks at legal actions, conclusions are drawn to certain standards, more likely than not, beyond a reasonable doubt and probably occurred.  Even in medicine and science, where burdened are large on new ideas and treatments, they are accepted with a river IOU‚Äôs showing that the desired conclusion is only 5% likely not true.  For someone with agoraphobia, stepping on a clear glass panel, high up in a building has at least some degree of discomfort, despite the panel holding much more weight a moment ago.

Faith is knowing that there is some creditable argument against the belief, but having assurance that the belief is true, despite the argument or some doubt.

As it is said Habakkuk 2:4b the righteous shall live by his faith.  The same idea is referenced in Romans 1:17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, ‚ÄúThe righteous shall live by faith.‚Äù

If things were beyond reasonable doubt, there would be no room for the faith by which the righteous shall live.

I‚Äôm reminded of a young believer who had her teacher tell her that the Bible doesn‚Äôt say that Moses and the Israelites crossed the Red See, it says sea of reeds.  The teacher then said this was just a muddy stream.  The girl was shaken and went to talk to another who agreed the precise words are sea of reeds.  The other then said something like, ‚ÄúIf your teacher was right and the sea of reeds was just a muddy stream than the miracle was even greater, because whatever it was, the great army of Egypt drowned in the sea, after the women, children and flocks passed.‚Äù

One mustn‚Äôt believe God needs our help to defend him and his word.  We will find faith to believe in his son and himself, no matter what happens.

Sometimes, one may be prone to say something like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to explain this, but I know (have faith) this did or didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù  A manager might be shown video evidence a certain employee was stealing from him and not believe that could be true even if the manager can‚Äôt explain what the evidence shows, just yet.

I suggest you don‚Äôt feel you stopped believing even if you don‚Äôt fully agree some of the religious beliefs are correct.  Many Christians have dramatically different beliefs on certain things and many wars and horrible things were triggered by these differences.  Let‚Äôs not allow the opponents of Christians gain another win by emphasizing the reach of this small doubt.

Can you entertain the idea that, perhaps with more evidence, you could still accept this idea which has caused you so much trouble?  If so, I don‚Äôt think you have topped believing, you are just in the process of what was lauded in Acts 17:11-12 Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.

I note all were more Nobel and examined the truth of what they heard an only some reached belief at the time the scripture referenced.

It seems you are past that point having believed and continuing to be more noble, continuing to examine and question.  Well done.  Don‚Äôt ever give up the inquiring mind on these critic things, but also don‚Äôt feel that 100% believing is required to be a Christian.

I hope these brief words help with your struggle.",1609459222

I‚Äôm not sure what would happen in this case since they‚Äôre both applying at $20 currently when they shouldn‚Äôt be. So not sure if only one will apply or if both will.

While you want to aim for good strum width, this allows it to have some variation without sounding unwanted strings. 

Try getting used to this idea but strumming multiple strings, but only aiming to have one note sound, then increase the amount of strings to get used to this",1609459224

I've played with a dm kiiinda like that. Not so much for race and class, but for strict rules.

Like, I was playing a sorc illusionist, there was an NPC generic caravan guard.

 I passed a stealth check, then a stealth casting check and cast an image of a big mean orc in the woods behind him and made it walk towards the wagon where the guard was.

As soon as the guard saw the orc, he rolled for initiative and has the guards all move straight for my hidden character because ""when he saw your magic, he knew you were there.""

This was my first time back at DnD proper after about 5 years playing PBTA games and Paranoia.

Dnd by the rules just isn't my game anymore. Dnd with an excellent dm is the best of both worlds.",1609459224

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","When I play against the gr.1 in my f4e it‚Äôs pretty much free kills. I use sparrows and stay far out of their range. The srram ends all dog fighting. The 9j‚Äôs and r60‚Äôs are excellent missiles and more useful in a wider range of applications, but the srram is special. It leaves the plane at like 60¬∞ angles some times making it a free kill to any plane that tried to dog fight. The other two missiles have high overloads as well, but they need to fly straight even for a fraction of a second first making them not super useful in a true dogfight. 

Imo the srrams at 9.3 were cruel because everything there should really still be dog fighting, 10.7 you should expect to adapt. The harriers (gr.1 and av8a only) don‚Äôt have a rwr so they get a sparrow shoved in their face.

"politics","t5_2cneq","At Trump making a habit of selectively declassifying tiny bits of cherry picked information while lying about the overwhelming majority that leads all credible current and former intel officials to a completely different conclusion.

There's been plenty.  Like dozens of intel officials making public statements for the first time in their lives to stop him plenty.

In fact, he's such a bumbling cartoon criminal that he's repeatedly implicated himself or his administration by mistake by sharing cherry picked intel he failed to comprehend or by simply sharing Russian disinformation directly that STILL HAS THE  RUSSIAN STATE TV WATERMARK ON IT.

But yes.  Some people are stupid enough to take the table scraps he throws out while ignoring that every current and former intelligence officer who's not an appointed stooge all say the exact same thing which he simply ignores.

Just like they're stupid enough to ignore that Trump's campaign manager, several of his campaign advisers, Torshin, Butina, and the whole cast of characters that put him in power are literally the same exact people who toppled the governments in at least 4 other countries at Putin's behest... and on his payroll.

Just like anyone who has bought into this gaslit narrative Russia's actions are no more of a threat to the U.S than other country has their head in the sand.  No wonder they keep targeting these fools for a never ending grift.  They can be convinced of anything.

Thank you for reminding us all that Trump while acting as the president of the United States lied to the U.S. citizens about bounties and still continues to choose what scraps of information he does share only for naked political gain with no regard for national security.",1609459227

"movies","t5_2qh3s","In my school, the engineering disciplines offered were focused on ""*hi-tech*"" so to speak. So computer engineering, electronics engineering, biomedical engineering, engineering physics, mechatronics engineering, and systems engineering. They're all very quite math centric. And they are still overwhelmingly male, 15% women is hardly a majority. The majority of those women are actually in computer or electronics engineering for my school. Those two are also the most popular disciplines amongst male students for us as well.

As someone who experienced that subtle conditioning, and has spoken to hundreds of other individuals who relayed their own experiences, and who was involved with elementary/highschool outreach to other girls to discuss my experiences as an engineering student, you can bet my arse representation had a large factor to play. You are correct it is currently simply anecdotal evidence,  but it would still be amiss to dismiss the hypothesis especially when considering the possible correlation between an increase of female engineering students and representation/outreach of female engineers/engineering students.

I was the VP Academic for the engineering student society in my school, and one of the things I had the privilege of looking into was demographic trends within my school. Looking at the numbers, and at the increased outreach work done by our wonderful clubs such as Women In Engineering (WiE), I could see a correlation between the increased female engineering student population and the outreach programs. Of course that is only the case with one engineering school, so it's hardly conclusive evidence. Regardless, I don't think it's worth dismissing off the bat.

Lastly, you have a *very* outdated notion of what engineers are like hahaha. You need to be sociable, teamwork is essential. Nobody's choosing their careers based on prom dates, I imagine. We have our oddballs sure, but it's nothing to the extent that media likes to portray. Perhaps that was the case decades ago, but it isn't really anymore.",1609459227
"NewToEMS","t5_3ofm1","Try to get into a habit of scanning through chapters for vital info. This can mean many things to different people but essentially try not to read every sentence verbatim, but pull key words to get the general idea.

Chapter summaries give you the key ideas that are intended to be a focus of the topic. Look at bolded words for your main definitions to learn. Side notes along the borders may also provide snippets of key information that should be noted. Graphs are usually the best summaries you'll find within a chapter. 

Depending on the type of textbook, some may have application questions or case studies within a chapter, those can not only provide context but give a justification and allow a rounded idea of what the writer intends for you to pick up.

After that its cramming. Eat well, drink water, and for the love of fuck take breaks. If you exhaust your mind you won't pick up anything. Then once you get a full day of studying take a break for the evening - e.g. up at 9, study until 4/5/6pm and then just relax, give you mind a chance to wind down. And please get proper rest. Sleep allows your brain to solidify information, just be sure to get enough rest.",1609459227

"FixedGearBicycle","t5_2qo7a","I have a 6 quart slow cooker and a tea pot. That's all that's required after the initial removal of all grease/lube (which is the big, tedious hurdle). You'll also want a small paintbrush to dust your frame between rides of any small pieces of wax that the chain sheds in use. It's not a lot, but if you wipe wax off the frame with your hand it smudges. 

I pop off the chain and put it on a coat hanger, then pour boiling water over it from the kettle. That's all it takes to remove the old wax and any contaminants. Let it dry completely as the Crock-Pot liquidizes the wax, then drop it in. Keep it submerged until all bubbles stop and I agitate with a bamboo chopstick occasionally. While it sits, I install the already waxed 2nd chain. Remove the chain from the cooker and hang it to dry and cool, break the links afterwards and it's ready for its next use.

Swapping chains and reapplying wax takes me about the same amount of time I used to spend doing my OCD cleaning, degreasing, and lube routine.  The 1st time takes a long time, so don't worry if you feel like you've made a horrible life choices mistake midway through the degreasing process. Reapplication is super easy and quick.",1609459229

https://github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper/blob/master/DDR4%20OC%20Guide.md

You could see maybe 300 fps with an extremely good tuned kit + OCed 10900k compared to like 240fps with your current ram. 

You can get some big improvements if you learn how to properly overclock your whole pc. Ram, ring clock, core clock and gpu.

Oustide of Plano: Get a state parks pass and download the app.

Our favorite is Cooper Lake State Park (1 hour) They have cabins right on the lake. The main trail is a decent length and shaded.

Tyler State Park (2 hours)

Dainerfield State Park (2 hours) Small but they have cabins with toilets if that‚Äôs your thing.

Cedar Ridge Preserve (1 hour) Cedar Hill State Park is also nearby. The Preserve gets very crowded but it‚Äôs likely the steepest elevation change you‚Äôll experience in the DFW area.

Horshoe Trail at Grapevine Lake

Dinosaur Valley State Park (2 hours)

Eagle Mountain Lake/Lake Worth (1.5 hours)

Mineral Wells State Park (1.5 hours-probably the most dramatic terrain change considering it isn‚Äôt all that far away)

Eisenhower State Park (1 hour)

Caddo Lake State Park (3 hours)

Hot Springs National Park/DeGray Lake Resort (4 hours)

Broken Bow/various Oklahoma state parks/Talimena Scenic Drive (3-4 hours) 

Enchanted Rock (4 hours)

Guadalupe River State Park (5 hours)

Bit further out, but on our list to try as we have heard good things: Garner State Park, Big Bend area, Monahans Sandhills State Park, Lost Maples State Park, Palo Duro Canyon State Park,  and Old Tunnel State Park. Have also heard good things about Turner Falls in Oklahoma and Devil‚Äôs Den in Arkansas.

Also highly recommend making a donation to the Bracken Cave Preserve to become a member and going down to the New Braunfels area to see the bats. It‚Äôs the largest bat colony in the world and it‚Äôs fucking amazing.

There‚Äôs tons to do outside, once you accept that we are not anywhere near the ocean or the Rockies and it‚Äôs hot a lot. Just enjoy the cool weather when it comes around and get in the water the rest of the time :) I‚Äôve honestly come to love the East Texas piney woods and clear water in our limestone-bottomed rivers and lakes as much as the PNW.",1609459231

ad 1) after posting my previous message I realized immediately that it must be something of that sort and that I really need to read a little more about etherum blockchain tech stuff. it's a shame how little I know still, especially given that I'm working as softwarre developer in my day job. anyways, thank you! that was the information I was after.

ad 2) these are invaluable insights to me! In a rush of motivation I went ahead and minted two works as singles and decides to receive bids instead of setting a fixed price. (they are currently still in the process. very exciting! I'll post them once the minting process has finished.) as far as I understand it I can still alter the pricing once I made up my mind about a pricing strategy. also, I'm still working on a portfolio website... it only came to me recently that I should market my art online, so it's all very new!

once I have a little portfolio up and running I will investigate more on the prospect of reaching out to find a collector / buyer who might be interested in supporting this venture, as you mentioned. my concern here is that I might appear as a ""hobby-"" or ""one-time-artist"". I'm still working on ideas to surpass that phase.. it's an exciting way ahead.

At the outset, not against that as a concept. Where I live though,  100% of the providers - of which there isn't a lot of - are faith based. Salvation Army, Anglican Church and Catholic Church.

There were other secular charities who were involved, think animal rescues, etc, who all pulled out en masse due to governmental reporting requirements becoming a cost impost upon that charity.

I've avoided it by getting some part time work but every time my time comes up, I'm required to attend the location and sign an induction that says I support the aims of the Church.

No, I don't.

Research shows that they key conditions for making close friendships are 1. Proximity, 2. Repeated, unplanned interactions, and 3. A setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other. That's why it's so easy to make friends in school; you just end up befriending whoever's in your class. As an adult that can happen with coworkers if you're lucky, but oftentimes it doesn't. It's hard to find those conditions right now during quarantine, but maybe you could find a virtual networking group, or socially distanced volunteer activity?

&gt; Ecatepec.- Desde una ‚Äúchatarrer√≠a‚Äù presuntamente succionaban ductos de Pemex para extraer hidrocarburos y rellenar bidones para la venta ilegal de combustible en la colonia San Isidro Atlautenco, sitio que fue inspeccionado por personal de Petr√≥leos Mexicanos y qued√≥ bajo resguardo de polic√≠as de la Secretar√≠a de Seguridad del Estado de M√©xico, informaron autoridades mexiquenses.   

&gt; Personal de Pemex detect√≥ a trav√©s de su sistema la p√©rdida de presi√≥n en un ducto de gasolina y ubic√≥ un negocio de compra y venta de desperdicios industriales, en la calle Frijol esquina Avenida de Las Bombas, colonia San Isidro Atlautenco, donde al parecer hab√≠a una toma clandestina.   

&gt; Con el apoyo de polic√≠as estatales y de elementos¬†de la Direcci√≥n General de Combate al Robo de Veh√≠culos y Transporte (DGCRVyT),¬† se trasladaron al lugar junto con elementos de la Secretar√≠a de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena), para iniciar¬† indagatorias.   

&gt; Al inspeccionar los alrededores de la ""chatarrer√≠a"" detectaron orificios en los que sal√≠a al menos una manguera de color negro con v√°lvulas y un garraf√≥n con l√≠quido similar al de la¬† gasolina.   

&gt; El sitio fue custodiado por polic√≠as y personal de la Sedena, en tanto Personal de Pemex¬† realiz√≥ denuncia de hechos ante la Fiscal√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (FGR), con el objetivo de obtener la orden de cateo para continuar con las indagatorias y definir su situaci√≥n legal.

I tried solo, it was a cake walk. So I definitely can not agree about the solo part.
And I had to play it on my stupid phone, which sucks balls and still managed to do everything.

My team was Diluc, Bennet, Fischl and Xianling. Although Xianling basically just put down Guobba once at the start and that was it.

I can give you some tips though:
- After starting the fight, stay outside of the area until the first explosions are done.
- Then teleport in and kill the 3 mobs quickly. I did this with Bennet+Festering Desire in 15 seconds or so. 
- break the shield, dmg dmg dmg (for me it was Guobba+Diluc fire combo+one hit with Bennet, followed by Ultimate)
- I did 2 rotations of hiding in the bubble and then killed it. If you need longer, AOE starts happening again. So try to beat that.

All in all, this whole Event (for me) was a success. No Resin, no stress, Free stuff. Can‚Äôt complain.",1609459233

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it.**

They're only annoying if they come with something else. On their own they can make noises at my tank for a bit and then fall over. 

I generally don't bring archers vs chosen but if I do they shoot stuff that isn't the chosen so it wouldn't help there either. Well, and there's usually so many chosen that debuffing one wouldn't be that impactful, even if I was shooting him. 

Can't really think of something that is so beefy and yet so dangerous that I would want to debuff it. Maybe Schrats or Lindwurms.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it.**

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Most of that stuff isn't exclusive to a M1 Macbook though. High end Windows ultrabooks like the X1 Carbon I use for work wakes up in less than a second with the login screen up by time I get the screen fully open (seriously, I'm pretty sure my 2010? Macbook running Snow Leopard or Leopard in college woke up instantly), it's got an NVME ssd and everything opens basically instantly, I've never heard the fans come on because nothing I do on it can push it hard enough to need them, it's got 16GB of RAM which means you can have as much open for as long as you'd like completely unhindered basically, and I've only felt it get a little warm during Windows updates. I've also used the M1 Macbook Air for a few hours, I bought one for my parents for Christmas so go to play after it was opened and yeah it's great. Typical high end Apple quality as I'd expect but nothing about it is crazy better than a X1 from a casual perspective.

The X1 big weakness is 8-10 hours of battery life but that isn't exactly bad battery life and the Intel processor I'm sure would get stomped in a head head to with the M1 but we are so far beyond the processing power required to open Outlook and Chrome instantly that this doesn't matter for most users. Now obviously a content creator isn't going to want the X1, it's going to take hours to do an export with no dedicated GPU, outdated Intel UHD graphics and a quad core U series Intel chip buuut if you're NOT a content creator which was my original point the difference between the two is not substantial enough to create a sudden rush to Macbook Air's for average people just looking for a basic machine for very basic tasks, heck Chromebooks will probably see faster adoption overall.

None of this it the M1 mac's fault. The M1 Macbook's are great, they raise the bar, but the bar is already so high it's like comparing competing super cars while most consumers are going to buy a Chevy Cruze anyways and those in the market for a super car are going to choose based on the operating system preference far before the actual processor performance (again unless you're in a niche like content creation, gaming, etc) because they both will perform 95% of business / laptop tasks virtually identically.",1609459235

"CombiSteamOvenCooking","t5_2ccvef","Well, it's pretty clear most conventional ovens ""fluctuate wildly between the 100-205 range"" (most can't even cover most of that temperatue range, mine can't be set below 170¬∞F), so if they can maintain an accurate and consistent temperature in this range, they can certainly do bagged sous vide in (apparently) dry air.

I haven't measured the temp swings for my GE oven in that temp range, but I have measured it at 375¬∞F and was actually pretty impressed that it only had 31¬∞F swings.  Someone recently posted about their Viking range having 100¬∞F swings!

You are worthy of having better days and you are capable of achieving them.

Yes, this sub will attract people who will like to ridicule the backward practices in their religion (so Hinduism as they're mostly hindus) and allow practices of the people of other religion (in the name of communal harmony).

I know the external world get changes by ""expectation"". A very common one for me is seeing people in darkness, it's always accompanied with ""oh no, a human is coming"" and it literally starts looking like a human, like you can tell where each body parts is etc. Except it's just a trash can or something. 

Once I was outside high, it's dark and there are trees on the sides of the road. Looking at them I see very clearly branches with needles and pine-cones on them, like the outline of each cone, even needle. But during the day it is obvious those are just leaves and the ""cones"" are denser clumps of them. So clearly there was a decision on what that must be and that thing was drawn there.

Next type the value of your health/money * 2 into the search box labeled ""Value""). Underneath it says ""value type"", select ""4 bytes"" then do a first scan. Then play and do something like get attacked/buy something. When the value changes IN GAME, type the next value into the search bar and click next scan. Do this until you have only a few (best is obviously 1 result but sometimes a few will appear) values. Double click them and change the values at the bottom. money is the easiest one to test since you can just go to any shop to change the value. I recommend doing this with the money value first as the health values will also be in the same processes memory. 

EDIT: DO NOT LOCK the values (active checkbox) as You will need to do this during every battle not just once. The memory region does not stay the same

Urgent help for all the needy

Cheap and practical solutions

To the growing world‚Äôs pollutions

Cures for ailments big and small

Truth and justice for us all

An end to corporate corruption 

Fairness without interruption 

Answers to the reasons bees

Are disappearing, if you please

Plentiful and cleaner oceans

All these hopes be more than notions 

Peace on Earth? Is that too much?

A worldwide truce, a loving touch,

An end to factions, wars and strife

No ‚Äúothering‚Äù or devalued life

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","The question is whether your conduct can fall within the exception to what is obviously harassment, which is:

&gt; (3)Subsection (1) [F4or (1A)] does not apply to a course of conduct if the person who pursued it shows‚Äî

&gt; (a)that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime,

&gt; (b)that it was pursued under any enactment or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under any enactment, or

&gt; (c)that in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable.

No one thinks the course of conduct here is reasonable, so the question is, was it done for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime?

That is a mainly subjective test - but the principle is limited by the concept of ""rationality"" (in the legal sense). This was the subject of [Hayes v Willoughby [2013] UKSC 17](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/17.html) where the limiting principle's rationale was identified.

In that case Willoughby was one of these tedious obsessives - clearly educated, a software engineer, but with a sense of grievance that had developed into narcissism, combined with toxic *ackchually* syndrome.

He made hundreds of baseless reports to various authorities alleging things such a tax evasion and fraud, essentially because he fell out with the claimant.

Lord Sumption JSC:

&gt; **Section 1(3)(a), although it was no doubt drafted mainly with an eye to the prevention or detection of crime by public authorities, applies equally to private persons who take it upon themselves to enforce the criminal law. Within broad limits, the law recognises the right of private persons to do this, but vigilantism can easily and imperceptibly merge into unlawful harassment.**

&gt; Cases such as the present one, where the harassment is said to consist in repeated and oppressive attempts to detect crime are quite likely to involve conduct falling within the sub-category of harassment defined as ""stalking"" by section 2A (added by section 111(1) of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012). **This includes not just sexual stalking, but any persistent course of harassment that consists in** repeatedly following a person, contacting or attempting to contact them, **publishing material about them**, monitoring their use of the internet, loitering in any place, or watching or spying on them: see section 2A(3). Conduct said to be directed to preventing crime is likely to be an even more significant category than conduct said to be directed to its detection. **Recent cases before the courts illustrate the propensity of obsessives to engage in conduct which is oppressive enough to constitute harassment, in the genuine belief that they are preventing crime.** These ranging from the more extreme wings of the animal rights movement to the lone schizophrenic vigilante whom Mr Wolman (appearing for Mr Willoughby) submitted would be protected by section 1(3)(a)

The governing principle therefore is:

&gt; **Before an alleged harasser can be said to have had the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, he must have sufficiently applied his mind to the matter. He must have thought rationally about the material suggesting the possibility of criminality and formed the view that the conduct said to constitute harassment was appropriate for the purpose of preventing or detecting it. If he has done these things, then he has the relevant purpose.** The court will not test his conclusions by reference to the view which a hypothetical reasonable man in his position would have formed.

&gt; **If, on the other hand, he has not engaged in these minimum mental processes necessary to acquire the relevant state of mind, but proceeds anyway on the footing that he is acting to prevent or detect crime, then he acts irrationally.** In that case, two consequences will follow. The first is that the law will not regard him as having had the relevant purpose at all. He has simply not taken the necessary steps to form one. The second is that the causal connection which section 1(3)(a) posits between the purpose of the alleged harasser and the conduct constituting the harassment, will not exist

So, have you put your mind to the matter sufficiently that doing this is appropriate? You'd need some serious evidence on that given the fact that no one thinks this is appropriate behaviour.

You may also face claims of:

* defamation (well this is $$$)
* misuse of private information

Whilst it might not be criminal unless it's harassment - what you may find is a vindictive partner (whom you know is abusive), suing you for $$$$$.",1609459240

"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","I've been playing this game since 2005, so here are some random facts some of u probably didn't know :): 

\- There is a short sword players called ""denravi sword"" which could be crafted at the Henge of Denravi and got the +5 energy mod. It was the only martial weapon to have that bonus back in the day and was removed from the NPC shortly after release. So the ones remaining were traded for great amounts of gold. About 50k+ iirc.

\- There were a couple of unlocked chests in the southern shiverpeaks iirc which could drop weapons with a permanent +10-15% damage mod *without* any penalty like -5e or -10 armor. The chests were removed within weeks after release and there are only about 10 such weapons which are among the rarest and most expensive weapons in the game. 

\- Enemies used to focus aggro on players holding a bundle. So tanking in sorrow's furnace or fissure of woe was very easy. All you had to do was holding a Master Gear (sf) or Unholy Text (fow). This was changed shortly before Factions because of Ritualists.

\- Chest loot was predetermined. So groups did /roll to choose the player who had to open the chest to check if it was yielding purple or golden weapons / armor.

\-  Redistributing attribute points was done by spending attribute refunds. Spending one refund allowed you to lower one attribute by one rank even during missions and in explorable areas. You gained 1 refund per 250 xp but you could only have a maximum of 24 attribute refunds at any time. This was changed to the current system in the sorrow's furnace update.

\- There were no rare material traders for the first 2 months. So people who got some ectoplasm and didnt know about obsidian armor sold it to merchants... for 100g each.

\- Random Arenas was called Competition Arenas and was located south of Lion's Arch. Amoon Arena, Fort Koga and D'Alessio Arena used to be outposts. 

\- There were no Balthazar faction. So if you wanted to unlock new skills, runes and mods you had to capture or identify them in pve.

\- There were no Rune traders.

\- Capturing skills wasnt that easy. Instead of using signet of capture near a bosses' corpse, signet of capture had to be activated at the same time the targeted boss activated the desired skill. And yeah, that was annyoing.",1609459240

"Seaofthieves","t5_38oz1","Because (and this is obviously just my opinion), the sniper is the best overall weapon in the game. It is usable and effective in just about every combat situation, it is easily usable at close quarters if you have good aim, and an almost essential weapon in many other circumstances.

I *always* have the sniper equipped and then swap around my secondary depending on the situation. For example: Swimming long distances for a surprise attack, or boarding at too close a range to use the cannons? Sniper/sword. Fighting on islands/ in the water? Sniper/pistol. Boarding enemy ships or defending my own? Sniper/blunder.

Its just the overall best weapon imo, its the only true ranged weapon in the game and usable in basically every situation.",1609459241

The Welterweight Gran Prix had Rory MacDonald committed from April to October in 2019.  I expect that a similar amount of time would be needed for any other Gran Prix (unless Horiguchi loses in an earlier round).

I am sure that Rizin and Bellator had some kind of arrangement to allow them to share Horiguchi, but I am not sure if it allowed for one company to tie him up for that long without a title defence.

"fakedisordercringe","t5_30juii","It's a great process that has worked for r/illnessfakers and r/munchsnark. A user can curate a timeline, submit it to the mods, and then they can choose to let the community as a whole decide if the person really belongs here or not. On those subs I mentioned, approved subjects are given a post flair with their name and pronouns (for most people). We already require posts to have a flair if I recall correctly. So that would effectively be all the policing we needed. 

On r/munchsnark the mods more readily approve new subjects for deliberation whereas on r/illnessfakers the mods are more restrictive. So the line in the sand is as fine or bold as the mods allow it to be. 

I'm not really proposing replacing the automod, but something that can be used along side of it.

If they weren't jacking off to her, she wouldn't be in skimpy clothes at a damn playground dancing in front of a phone. If there was nothing sexual about the situation, do you think her audience is there to marvel at her dancing talent? Give me a break. 

I personally don't have a problem with what she's doing, because it's not illegal and doesn't hurt anyone, but let's not sit there and pretend that the people who *do* have a problem with what she's doing are all deluded head-cases for simply understanding that there's an inherent sexual element to what she's doing.

It is actually a miracle that the whole thing doesn't collapse in on itself. Also funnily enough they still get the generic development decisions like ""Institute Poverty Relief Programs"" even though that makes no sense in that context, honestly they should probably be at like 80% poverty by 1972 (which would fit with the challenge of their run, which revolves around horrible tech levels).

Then again, OMCK is still pretty awful, its just that they don't actively try to ruin Russia, its more that they are perfectly happy to do so as a necessary cost to achieving their goal, because [they see no moral value in making a Russian life better, only in making a German life worse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TNOmod/comments/khqt5m/why_so_much_hatemocking_towards_omsk/ggmvd40/?context=3)",1609459243

"wizardry8","t5_2zu01","Contrary to /u/Chairchucker I would recommend sticking with bows for your Gadgeteer instead of sticking with the Omnigun. The Omnigun is easily the worst weapon in the game until your Gadgeteer gains levels (the item automatically upgrades itself as your Gadgeteer levels up), and it doesn't start attacking additional times until your Gadgeteer reaches level 13, it can't use arrows or quarrels until your Gadgeteer reaches level 16 (quarrels and arrows are considerably better than stones, darts, and most throwable weapons), and the Omnigun won't start consistently applying effects other than blind until your Gadgeteer reaches level 26 (you'll probably finish the game before your party hits level 26 unless your party is 4 people or less for most of the game).

On top of those other problems, the random blinding effect of the Omnigun typically results in causing blinded enemies to run away from your group, which I find is often annoying at extending combat and isn't really helpful since the blind isn't dependable enough to rely on for defenses anyway. Possibly more importantly, modern weapons don't gain any damage scaling from strength, meaning shots from your Omnigun will do less damage than bows or crossbows will for virtually the entire game. Lastly, being able to combine light crossbows into doubleshot and tripleshot crossbows is arguably the best thing about including a gadgeteer in your party, so it makes sense to give doubleshot/tripleshot crossbows to anyone in your party who can equip them (Gadgeteer included).

As an extra aside, the party formation options make it difficult to protect more than 3 ranged units and you'll generally do more damage in melee range than you will at range, so I'd recommend focusing your Gadgeteer as a melee fighter in your team composition and only use a crossbow as a backup weapon when there are no enemies in melee range.

As far as spell usage and mana goes, I recommend at least casting a level 1 version of a spell (any spell that could have an effect) every turn during combat. As long as the spell successfully casts and has an effect, it'll provide a decent chance of leveling up that element's magical skill and whatever school of magic you used to cast it (divinity for your priest, wizardry for your mage). Just continuing to level your spells is important, as you won't be able to select better spells later or use them effectively if you aren't leveling up your elements and your magical school by casting regularly.",1609459243

I know that there are still some parts of the world that are not yet in the new year but it has just ticked over to the first of January 2021 for me so I must say a massive happy new year to everyone!

This year is going to be a long one, there will still be some hard moments, but if we all stick together as a world and help those that need it around us then I know that we can overcome everything!

I live in England and have the dream of one day living in Japan, but every day I make sure I can help or give advice to those around me and I hope that we can continue that as a human race throughout 2021.

2020 has tested us to the absolute limits and despite carrying some pressure over to 2021 we will adapt and we will strive to be the best that we can.

Here‚Äôs to a fantastic 2021 and a change in everything from now, and to those that are yet to tick over into the new year. I look forward to seeing you all on the other side! 

p.s. I labelled this as Day 007 just like my New Year‚Äôs Eve post because I have posted it directly at midnight and thought that I would treat it as a sort of part 2 to my new year posts. There will be a Day 008 later throughout the 1st of January!

Tu n'as aucun m√©rite, rien dont tu peux √™tre fier; Kirby-54 √† cot√© de toi vit une vie de r√™ve pendant que toi tu cr√©er des topics avec un titre aguicheur et juste apr√®s tu √©cris Post ou Cancer, c'est un peu ta fa√ßon √† toi de te sentir exister, d'avoir cette popularit√© que tu n'avais pas eu dans tes ann√©es lyc√©e et coll√®ge, et quand tu vois enfin que √ßa y est, ton topic est rouge, pour toi c'est l'apog√©e de tes jouissances, pour la premi√®re fois ta voisine d√©couvre qu'elle n'est pas seule dans ce HLM miteux, pourris de l'int√©rieur avec en bas de chez toi les m√™mes qui te crachaient au visage pendant ta scolarit√©, d'ailleurs m√™me un jour tu as fait un topic o√π tu cherchais √† les provoquer, et alors que tu prenais tes jambes √† ton cou pour essayer de sauver ce qui te sert de corps, tes g√®nes d√©gueulasse ne te permettent m√™me pas d'avoir l'√©quilibre pour courir correctement et tes genoux s'entrechoquent. Tu te retrouves donc √† l'hopital, te faisant soigner par la s√©cu, en soit mon argent, mon argent que j'ai honorablement gagner apr√®s mes 8ans d'√©tudes, de travail acharn√© et je cotise pour la France. Alors que l'infirmi√®re est sortie te chercher √† manger apr√®s que tu lui aies jet√© la premi√®re ration au visage, tu fais un topic sur elle et juste apr√®s, tu te masturbes en cachette, et tu te dis que de toute fa√ßon √ßa ne sera gu√®re long. Une fois rentr√© chez toi toujours en pauvre merde que tu es, n'ayant jamais visiter plus loin que ta cour d'immeuble, tu vas d√©battre g√©o-politique sur des topics de kheys s√©rieux avec 5 ans d'√©tudes derri√®re eux. Et tu continuera √† vomir ton ramassis de merde jusqu'√† que le destin te rattrape et tu meurs en t'√©touffant dans ton vomis apr√®s avoir voulu battre le record de 9 bi√®res. Au final, personne n'aura retenu ton nom, les vers viendront goulument bouffer ton insignifiante carcasse jusqu'√† que 5 semaines plus tard une bande de jeune √† la recherche d'un squat abandonn√© tombent sur les quelques ossements qui gisent sur le sol, et bien que l'odeur de ton corps en putr√©faction ai emplie la pi√®ce c'est d'abord l'odeur de ta d√©plorable hygi√®ne qu'ils vont d'abord remarquer. Apr√®s qu'ils aient r√©ussi √† passer la premi√®re pi√®ce de ton 11m¬≤ les voila qui arrivent dans ta chambre et ils √©clatent de rire voyant tes posters et figurines japonaises par centaines*",1609459244

He has said that will take 1000 starships launching from earth orbit during every synod, possibly as early as the next few decades. Add in all the fuel tanker trips, and I can see a real advantage to branching out to other countries for launch sites. Indonesia is perfect due to: 1) They really want SpaceX there. This is no small advantage. And SpaceX (or Elon) knows how to be a good corporate citizen with such things as donations to museums and other civic projects, so they should be able to build upon that initial good will. 2)  Indonesia is lobbying to have them move there. This gives SpaceX (or Elon) some leverage to negotiate some good terms, such as tax breaks and other things. 3) Indonesia has vast supplies of nickel, needed for Tesla batteries. Perhaps a deal could be made. 4) And of course as mentioned by others, it has ideally located islands to build launch facilities. 

Another benefit unrelated to SpaceX but for the benefit of all developed countries, Indonesia has the highest population of any Muslim nation - and yet only a tiny footprint in terrorist circles. It is beneficial to raise the standard of living here to ensure this doesn't change.",1609459244

"GuardianTales","t5_2gj2tg","Beth is good for Arena, but she is countered by Future Princess and Eugene. Based on my experience for Arena (hovering at Diamond 2), you'll see more Future Princesses than Eugene. Most players have FP in the front, so as long as you put Beth as second or third you should be fine, and adjust your team order if needed depending on your tier.

I think you should hold off of limit breaking Marina until you find another hero that you either really like or help cover your weakness for other content like ranged shields. Beth might be a good option and can help you start working on a melee based team.

As for who to mileage, I would wait until you open the magic metal box tomorrow and see what you get. Assuming you don't get anything new, really depends on what you feel you want more. Is your team dying often? You might want to consider Miya for her healing, who can keep you alive even in the high orbital lift floors. Are ranged shields a nuisance? Beth is a good hero to consider as your melee hero.

Can't say much about Rue since I don't know much about her, and don't want to provide a bad answer. But I feel like she's not as good as an investment compared to what you have because of her party buffs and how mediocre her 5* passive ability is.",1609459244

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt;There are non disabled gamers that don't want challenge in there games and people that are intimidated by the Souls like genre and I worry that these people are dominating a discussion and using accessibility to promote their argument.

I mean, is this something you've actually seen people argue for in the wild, or just a gut feeling you have? Also, what exactly is the problem with people wanting easy games? For single-player games I honestly don't care - how other people enjoy their games doesn't have any impact on how I enjoy mine. 

Honestly, I feel like Soulslikes are a bit of a red herring in this discussion - they advertise their difficulty VERY well so people are unlikely to pick it up without knowing what they're in for. I feel the genre could be more accessible, but whatever. But this idea bleeds into other games and genres (see also: Cyberpunk 2077's epilepsy debacle) and results in people being resistant to accessibility features that, frankly, wouldn't affect them at all. Accessibility should be the default state, not an extra add-on, unless you've got a good reason. 

(And yes, I know it's impossible to make a 100% accessible game given the number of different things you might have to correct for - but you better have a good reason not to at least shoot for 95%).",1609459246

"1022","t5_2v7cn","One thing I would say, also. As some one with a deep six.

I really dig the chassis, and enoch industries are really cool.

I got the chassis hoping to use the fs1913 brace like in the picture you linked.

As you have discovered it puts us under the minimum requiremed length.

So I have been using a 1913 to buffer tube adapter (thordsen custom)

The adapter is a bit big for the chassis. It definitely works, but it's not as aesthetically pleasing.

My advice, is to get a chassis that just accepts buffer tubes, and avoid going the adapter route.

The only reason to get a 1913 chassis is to be able to use a 1913 brace, or stock, and all the 1913 braces/stocks I have seen are folding, and thus not legal for our build.

You'll get a better fit, and it will look better, in my opinion at least.

Pmaca makes some good chassis, but me personally, I want either the crazy Ivan, or the Midwest industries chassis. I think there was one other one that looked nice, can't recall it off the top of my head though.",1609459246

*****

&gt; Ecatepec.-¬† Cheler√≠as, pulquer√≠as, una creper√≠a y un gimnasio que burlaban el sem√°foro epidemiol√≥gico rojo, fueron cerrados por autoridades municipales de Ecatepec quienes detectaron que operaban ocultando el ingreso de clientes y empleados.   

&gt; La ‚ÄúC√©lula Covid‚Äù de Ecatepec, integrada por personal de Desarrollo Econ√≥mico, Protecci√≥n Civil, Contralor√≠a Interna y Gobierno, que inspecciona el cumplimiento de medidas sanitarias en el Sem√°foro Rojo, detect√≥ en el pueblo de Guadalupe Victoria un gimnasio, cuyos administradores intentaron burlar las recomendaciones ¬†y realizaban actividades encubiertas,   El ingreso al gimnasio lo realizaban por una puerta trasera y en la fachada simulaban estar cerrados; en el lugar detectaron m√°s de 20 personas haciendo ejercicio en un sitio cerrado, sin cubrebocas y sin gel, por lo que era un punto de alto riesgo para la propagaci√≥n de contagios de coronavirus.

&gt; Empleados de Desarrollo Econ√≥mico solicitaron a los encargados del gimnasio las licencias para funcionar, pero no contaban con ning√∫n documento, por lo que colocaron sellos de suspensi√≥n en la entrada trasera del inmueble, con el objetivo evitar el ingreso de usuarios y trabajadores.   

&gt; Adem√°s realizaron recorridos en bazares navide√±os para evitar venta de alcohol y apego a las medidas sanitarias, adem√°s de invitar a locatarios, responsables de puestos ambulantes y dem√°s comerciantes a seguir las medidas sanitarias debido al regreso al Sem√°foro Rojo de la emergencia sanitaria.   

&gt; En el Bazar de Las Fuentes la ‚ÄúC√©lula Covid‚Äù, cerr√≥ y asegur√≥ dos puestos de bebidas alcoh√≥licas que ofrec√≠an productos preparados y artesanales, pulques y curados; tambi√©n fue suspendida una tienda de abarrotes donde vend√≠an bebidas alcoh√≥licas a j√≥venes y permit√≠an su consumo al interior del local, por lo que personal de Protecci√≥n Civil y Desarrollo Econ√≥mico colocaron sellos de suspensi√≥n en el negocio.

Therefore, you either fail basic logic (for failing to find the immorality of taxation based on arguments #2 and 3) or you are actually immoral. Which is it?

"nycCoronavirus","t5_2gwibo","With the rate we are going it will literally take 10 years to vaccinate everyone. You need to build to set-up facilities that would be operating 7 days a week for huge portions of the day. We need to be doing this at a national level. The federal government needs help to organize on such a scale and it just doesn‚Äôt care.

This vaccine isn‚Äôt 1 and done, it‚Äôs it 2 shots over time. How many people will be dumb enough to not get the 2nd shot or just forget entirely and assume they are fine. Because people will not be forced to get it many will not do it at all.

The vaccine also doesn‚Äôt make you immune to getting COVID, you can still become infected it‚Äôs just more likely it won‚Äôt be fatal. It‚Äôs already been said that mask wearing will still need to be followed especially when being in close proximity to others and you‚Äôre going to have tons of people who just outright refuse to get the vaccine. 

I see so many people thinking everything is fine now because a vaccine has been given to a fraction of the population. People stopped being safe even before the vaccine as real. There is a higher chance that you will be infected than there is that you‚Äôll get the shot any time soon.

I mean where are people going to go to get vaccinated? At a hospital, one that‚Äôs currently being completely overwhelmed with people sick with COVID? It‚Äôs such an unnecessary strain and we should be making it as conveniently possible to get one.

You want people to still socially distance, but still be able get the vaccine out in huge numbers, how is this happening in real life? I know doctors who are betting most people won‚Äôt even have a chance to get their first dose until 2022! That‚Äôs fucking terrifying to imagine. How are jobs or the economy bouncing back if we aren‚Äôt putting every available resource on getting this vaccine out to people?

"HistoryMemes","t5_2v2cd","&gt;Do you realize that communism is the public control of the means of production and the Soviet had the state control the means of production? And Marx specifically warned against using the state as a vehicle to socialism!

Okay, so how are you going to actually enforce that? You do realize that man is naturally greedy? If you leave it up to the people, unless you get state enforcement, people are going to take advantage of the situation.

&gt; Do you know that most marxists believed that the capitalism was a necessary step to get to socialism and that‚Äôs why a lot of European communists didn‚Äôt support a revolution in the barely post-fuedal Russia? Communism was never tried in an industrialized country, which according to most socialist thinkers, is the only places it could work. These are also things to keep in mind.

This is not the 17th century, this is the 20th century, by then Russia had adopted capitalism and was industrializing at a fairly rapid pace. Of course, it was still a quasi-feudal society, but that is the only place where Communism can rise.

Communism is predicated on the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, i.e the upper class and the lower/working class. However, this discards the existence of the middle class, who are technically bourgeoisie but didn't feel like it and thus prevented any communist takeover with their massive influence. Communism does best in quasi-feudal countries where the middle class is practically non-existent and where the upper class are **THE** dominant force in society and oppress the lower classes. This is in contrast to industrial societies where there is the existence of the middle class. This is also why communism has almost always been adopted in primarily agrarian societies.",1609459251

"LowSodiumCyberpunk","t5_3jhabn","I'd encourage you to seek out and read a few beginner's guides [like this one](https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cyberpunk-2077-beginners-guide). If you're unfamiliar with rpgs, there can be a lot going on under the hood you might not be totally aware of. 

Make sure to check out the legend on your map. It'll explain what all the icons mean, and once you're able to recognize them, it will show you where you can find ripperdocs, gun merchants, and other vendors. 

Completing the Konpeki Plaza mission concludes the prologue. At this point, you'll have a few main missions you can start doing, they're listed at the top of your journal. 

It's probably for the best to start off with doing a bunch of side content around V's apartment-- most of the jobs, opportunities and the like will be a lot easier to manage in this opening area. Just open up your map, find a point marked with an exclamation mark or question, and head in that direction. When you get near, a fixer will call you with details about what's going on.

How much you want to do is up to you. I'd suggest doing a few hours of side stuff around v's apartment and north of it. Get a lay of the land around you, level up a few times, then maybe tackle one of the main missions.",1609459251

I had top surgery and am happy to talk about my experience. While I did consider the idea of a reduction, or more so a particular surgery method that might've left me with extra tissue but also nipple sensation, I decided against it. my reasons were: not a lot of surgeons were doing this surgery (buttonhole+DI, fishmouth, etc) and the results I did see I typically didn't like. Or I would be paying 10+ thousand dollars, vs the under 2k I paid using insurance and a local surgeon, which made surgery significantly more accessible. If I couldn't wear open shirts, had to censor my nipples, or felt any jiggle in my chest post surgery I knew that would make me dysphoric. So traditional top surgery seemed like the best option for me, though I did opt for straight incisions and tiny nipples so I could tattoo them into hearts lol.",1609459252

A woman dating him will not give him a fulfilling social life.

&gt;This is the problem. It's not a revenge fantasy, it's a realistic worst case scenario that will eventually play out somehow.

The men who have checked out to play video games and avoid life cannot be transformed with the offer of pussy.  There are plenty of lazy married men who do nothing for their wives or society too. And if their wives try to get those men to get a job or improve themselves...  those women get called bitches and nags.  Even the unproductive lonely men themselves don‚Äôt want a woman to try to make them productive!  They just want a woman to serve their needs and desires without contributing or appreciating her in return.

It is not *women‚Äôs* fault when a man chooses not to do anything with his life‚Äî nobody else can motivate a person but the person themselves.  Kinda like how you cant force a heroin addict to quit by dragging them to rehab: if they don‚Äôt want to quit themselves, they won‚Äôt do it.  A woman who offers herself up as a sexual sacrifice to this kind of man in the hopes he‚Äôll change for the better will most likely get used and burned.  

Disgruntled antisocial men are just not a problem that women have the power to fix on the whole. Access to pussy just isn‚Äôt the magical social fix you guys think it is.",1609459252

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Yea getting wet doesn't really affect it, but there are other details like proper foundation venting and moisture barriers, but it's used for basement walls np if done correctly.  There's a few houses around here in northern Michigan that are holding up well and we have a 25 year old addition with a wood foundation sitting on crushed stone 4' underground that's perfectly fine.  It is wrapped in ice and water shield which helps a ton.

Concrete isn't usually part of a permanent wood foundation, so that code is probably referring to normal pine base plates or womanized lumber. Concrete is also like a sponge, so a permanent structure would need a moisture barrier to separate the walls from the block.  Usually a layer of closed cell foam.

Also byleth doesnt really get much off of dragdowns. Dd upair and nair only lead into standing grab and jab. If you see someone doing dragdown upair-upsmash, its not true, just a mixup thats often difficult to react to. You may be talking about nairquake though. Many people mistake byleths landing nair for a dragdown, but they are distinctly different. Landing nair (aka nairquake which is the landing hitbox) sends people a bit infront of you or sometimes behind. You have to dash forward to combo, and can combo into a lot of things. Dragdown nair leaves them right infront of you in standinf grab range. Dashattack does not combo here.",1609459253

I'm trying to get set up to start my advanced degree in online school.  Today has been stressful trying to do 8 hours of orientation and trying to get my computer stuff ordered. I wasted half my day trying to get things to flow with him. I find it hard to believe that he doesn't read my texts and realize I'm needing him to connect back with me since I asked him for what I needed. Him to text me without just short replies that actually sounded like he was somewhat interested since he says he wants us to work out and be like we used to be. We used to not have to make things so difficult. LOL So tonight he ordered my computer stuff for me for school.  Which was nice. And I thanked him for it. He DOES THINGS for me, but what I NEED is some reassurance that he wants us and me and to let things flow between us.

I love budget PCs and so I tried to do get everything as cheap as possible. I bought everything used. I kind of surprised myself and I was able to build this for around $330 if I remember correctly. Has RGB and everything!

I don't know the specific name of model for this case. I think it is generic case that multiple PC builders in the late 90's and early 2000s used. It has a Totally Awesome Computers badge on the front, which was a computer store in Utah that went out of business. I swear I remember hearing commercials for the store on the radio as a Kid and then years later I found this PC at a thrift store. As soon as I saw that it was an ATX case I knew this would be perfect for me.

Oh, I also made a little build video and put it on YouTube. Here's a link if interested (don't take the title too serious) :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_cIz9ioaBbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cIz9ioaBbY)

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

You collect your premium, SPY goes up, so your profit goes up on your LEAP. Then as expiration nears on the short option, you buy it to close, roll it forward, and collect another premium.

2. Put in the stream title ""removing toxicity from chat"", with an automated bot message also saying it.  
  
3. If chat is still too fast for the mods to deal with, 1 minute slow mode  
  
4. Have 2 or 3 mods that aren't reading the chat in real time, but scrolling through chat in a VOD to get anything that wasn't caught in real time.  
  
5. Get other streamers to get their mods to make a list of viewers that enter other chats to be toxic, so they can be banned on pvc chat. This list can also be in some kind of Google doc (Pick a card any card, the two of wives? excellent choice) for other streamers to add to and pre-emptively ban.  
  
6. If Twitch is actually serious about getting rid of harassment and not just virtue signalling, or having a reason to ban someone with little cause, this list could be sent to Twitch for someone to investigate and then that person can be banned from Twitch as a whole. While it's not hard to make a new account, there are draw backs to having to constantly make new ones, like no streamer ever knowing who you are, or switching between a main account and a troll account, that you need to have separate IP's for otherwise Twitch will just ban both, which is probably way too complicated for the average pvc viewers.

###[Basic Phenibut Withdrawal Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/wiki/phenibutwithdrawal)

Unaided, cold turkey withdrawal, from a state of dependence, [even low dose dependence, commonly causes severe and potentially dangerous side effects](https://i.imgur.com/cGHxnIR.png). Don't rush the process when you don't need to.

**Rules reminder:**    
Don't promote reckless behavior. 
If someone is dependent on phenibut don't tell them to do an unaided cold turkey withdrawal.    
Don't needlessly tell people to do a fast taper.    

**Further reminder:** 
You will feel low or worthless or stupid while going through withdrawal, especially rapid withdrawal. Don't take these thoughts too seriously. Continue on day by day, things will get better.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Some Joy-Con have a tendency to let their analog stick drift ever so slightly out of center and send unwanted controller input to the Switch. This is known as ""Joy-Con drift"". This is commonly the cause of a character very slowly moving on their own or a camera panning around ever so slightly even when you aren't holding the controller or using gyro controls. In some instances, you may be able to resolve this yourself with a little bit of cleaning. Other times you may simply want to send your Joy-Con into Nintendo for warranty repair.

"AnalogCommunity","t5_3k1ng","One thing that people haven't mentioned yet is that analog-era prime lenses tend to be much smaller and lighter than modern prime lenses. Newer prime lenses tend to be targeted at either pro portrait photographers (loads of unnecessary glass for bokeh) or brick wall enthusiasts (15 elements in a 50mm for perfect performance). You can easily load a fanny pack with 3 extra vintage primes, to keep things light in today's times you're forced to use a 24-105mm zoom or similar.

How much sharper are modern lenses? [Really not much](https://i0.wp.com/lens.ws//wp-content/uploads/2018/01/md_cz_35_all_vs_all_center1.jpg?ssl=1). Vintage primes usually match modern zooms.

The child is of the same age and looks similar to Igor. This destroys Ivar and this is made far worse once the boys brother discovers him with the body. Ivar refuses to kill him and flees the building.

edit: To u/iamheero that commented the following and then deleted it before I could submit my reply...

&gt; So about 3 or 4 more years than most flagship android phones would last.

I was going to say:

&gt;I have no idea, man. I‚Äôve always had an iPhone. I‚Äôm just saying that they are designed to be relatively defunct after about five years. Whether or not that‚Äôs a fair amount of time is up to the buyer to choose, but it‚Äôs good information to have. 

&gt;I personally have not used one that long without getting a newer model, and five years is also about what I expect to get out of a laptop.

It is absolute fact that MM did tank *three* voting security bills.  I read up on them awhile back, and while I could see possibly acceptable reasons for tanking one, maybe two of them, the third flat seemed like a ""let's keep this from being able to be looked into"".  It is fact that KY has had voting machines from ES&amp;S since I believe 2005, and iirc the head of ES&amp;S is staunch republican, maybe even ran for office at one point?  Could be misremembering that bit, though.  But having voting machines with no paper record is idiotic no matter what.

And it *may* be true that the KY machines were some of the ones that had online access potential, don't remember on that one, but I know that some, nationally, did, which made them unconscionably vulnerable to hackers - including ones who could have altered the tallying immediately prior to the election, *and changed it back* immediately after.  But I don't know which counties/states had those machines and which didn't.

ETA: Maine at least (I have been told) has paper backups of every vote locked up somewhere.  So if true that state, at least, would be much more risky to cheat in... but the election was decisive enough that there won't be any recounts or checks done.",1609459259

"IsItBullshit","t5_2yhlm","Well... here's the thing. Holding a filibuster doesn't guarantee that the other side will cave, and if they make an ass of themselves in front of the Georgia's voters, the swing vote could end up going to the less crazy seeming Republicans. Both sides are walking on thin ice trying to keep people from voting emotionally against them. Not filibustering doesn't necessarily mean surrender, just that they plan to win it in open discussion... which ALMOST everyone is on board with except the freaky hand-eye monster from pan's labyrinth who is still trying to force people to believe in election fraud despite not having a legitimate basis or pool of evidence to prove such (if they did, the lawsuits wouldn't have gotten shot down by a Republican supreme court). Basically it's the dems deciding not to stand around screaming at the top of their lungs until the GOP stops throwing its temper tantrum, but instead proceed with their job responsibilities like responsible adults in hopes that the GOP will decide that it can't afford to make itself look like a bunch of toddlers and act as adults as well... of course, they aren't responsible adults, none of them are, but I'm willing to let them act as such if they are willing to try. You are right that it means the dems will not be bargaining/ arguing from a strong of a position, but frankly they believe that the bill will get passed faster this way if they let mitch make a fool of himself yet again and Georgia's votes settle on a democratic representation in the Senate and house, shifting more power towards the dems in there long run.

It seems like they are giving up, but it's actually just a change of tactics. It's a whole hell of a lot easier to lose people's respect than to gain it, and filibusters are not exactly highly dignified strategies for negotiations. Everyone seeing that the reason the bill didn't pass immediately knows exactly who was responsible, her had now been given enough rope to hang himself with.",1609459259

Probably the most typical, wrong answer you get from a youtube comment about the war. So much for superior ""education"". 

The british stopped trade between the US (neutral) and france (enemy) That's a casus beli for war. You don't tell a neutral nation who they can and cannot trade with unless you plan to fight said nation. Not to mention impressment, and arming enemies of the US.

Democracy devolves into an effective plutocracy where the very top of the wealth pyramid can steer the nation instead of our democratically-elected leaders. Perpetual wealth allows a few idle rich to make decisions they should have no business making.

A good old progressive estate tax prevents this. The best tax is a tax that doesn't cost anyone alive, and this is it. The deceased is not in any position to suffer from it. The inheritors have not worked to earn this money so they aren't the ones paying the tax either. Everyone should work to earn their keep and nobody should be banking on someone else's death for their own income. The more estate tax is collected, the less income tax needs to be for everyone.

As many people in this very thread have informed you, it's not the majority. The reverse is true. Often times you'll have a male protagonist joined by a practically useless damsel who worries about the hero and who they're rewarded with upon saving. It's called a sexy lamp.

Even things that attempt to be subversive: Kingsman and Deadpool 1 &amp; 2.

"KGBTR","t5_12t6sw","Gwen saatine bakti. Saat 5 olmustu. Dersler bitmisti. Felix de simdiye kadar uyanmistir diye dusundu. Onun hayalini kurarken bilge dus odasindan cikti. 

Bilge:(Sen de girecek misin?) 

Gwen havlusunu alip bilgenin yaninda sessizce gecti. Olumlu yaniti anlayan bilge kendi isine koyuldu. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Felix gozlerini acti. Basinin agrisi buyuk olcude gecmisti. Yastiginin ne kadar rahat oldugunu anlayinca geri kivirildi. Ancak saati merak ediyordu. Gwene haber vermesi gerekiyordu. Butun bunlari dusunmekten kafasini tirmalayan sorumluluklarini susturmaya calisirken saatine bakti. Saat 5'ti. 

Felix: daha gun bitmemis. 

Felix dogruldu. Terliklerini giyip kendini banyoya atti. Bok cuvali gibi hissediyordu. Ayrica gwenin karsisina boyle cikmak istemezdi. Kiz her yanina geldiginde cicek gibi kokuyordu. Ona haksizlik yapmis olurdu. Bilmiyordu belki de o oyle oldugunu saniyordu. Kafasi bu kadar ayrintili dusunmeyi kaldiramiyordu henuz. Aynaya bakarken aynanin kapakli oldugunu gordu. Kapagi actiginda icinde kisisel bakim malzemelerini farketti. Iyi bunlar ise yarar diye dusundu. Karistirirken iclerinde permatik(jilet) buldu. Permatigi eline aldi ve inceledi. Sonra donunu kaldirip kucuk bir kontrolden sonra: 

Felix: (Her ne olursa olsun hazirlikli olmakta yarar var.) 

Dusa girdi ve 15 dakika icinde √ßikti. Havluyu beline sardi. Aynaya bakti. Agizindaki sevimsiz tadi farkedince dislerini fircaladi. Kisisel bakim malzemelerinin icinde kucuk bir de pilli tiras makinesi vardi. Makineyi aldi ve yuzundeki tuyleri aldi. Onlarin kil olmak icin almasi gereken baya yol vardi. Isini bitirince yuzune suyu atip. Geri aynaya bakti. Tam yuzunu havluyla kuruluyordu ki kapisinin caldigini duydu. 

Hemen bir kosu gidip kafasina bir havlu gecirdi. Uzerine de kaskini takip kapiyi acti. Karsisindaki insan gununu guzellestirmisti. 

Gwen: Naber!...de bu hal ne? 

Felix kapidan sadece kafasini cikarmisti. Gwen ona salak salak siritirken oyuna katilmaya karar verdi. 

Felix: cikarayim o halde nasil olsa biz bizeyiz. Gelsene sana haber vermem gerek. 

Felix kapiyi oldugu gibi birakip iceri gitti. Gwen ise kapiyi aralayip iceri girmesiyle kapiyi geri kapatmasi bir oldu. 

Gwen: Eeee felix senin te.......st nasil....di? 

Gwen karsisinda sevdigi cocugu sadece banyo havlusuyla gorunce ≈üok oldu desek yeridir. Kizin burnundan kan gelmisti. 

Felix:Gwen burnun! 

Gwen gozlerini felix'ten ayrimayi basarip burnunu tuttu. Felix hemen basindaki havluyu √ßikartip gwenim burnunu sildi. 

Felix: Ben giyinip geliyorum du.... 

Gwen felix'i durdurup geri onune cekti. 

Gwen: (Tamam gerek yok yani bu sekilde de idare edebilirim.) 

Gwen duygularina sahip cikmaj icin cok buyul caba sarf ediyordu. Felix gweni bos bulup zihnine daldi. Gwenin dusunduklerini bir bir okuyunca ergenliginin basina actigi belanin git gide yukseldigini hissetti ve hemen banyoya kacti. 

Felix: (uzerime bir seyler alacagim hemen donerim!) 

Gwen kafasindan dusuncelerini uzaklastirip felix'in yatagina oturdu ve beklemeye basladi. 

Felix uzerinde gercek kiyafetlerle disari cikti. Gwene yaklasirken bir yandan da havluyla basini √ßitiliyordu. Yataga gwenin yanina oturdu. O anda gwenin elini kendi elinin uzerinde hissetti. 

Gwen: (Ben yapayim mi?) 

Felix bundan zerre rahatsiz degildi. Hatta sorduguna ne kadar sevindigini soylese yetersizdi tereddut etmeden yanitladi. 

Felix: Olurrr 

Felix arkasini dondu. Gwen felix'in basini havlu ile kavrayip yavas yavad kafasini citilemeye basladi. Felix gwenden uzundu. Bu yuzden gwen dizlerinin uzerine cikmak zorunda kalmisti.",1609459260

While this situation isn‚Äôt your BF‚Äôs fault, he‚Äôs made the decision to become a guardian without your input, and that has life-changing consequences. It‚Äôs probably the best thing for his nephews, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to be a good thing for your relationship or your happiness. It‚Äôs not selfish to acknowledge that.

My fianc√© and I also do not want children, so I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. He has much younger sisters than us, so we did have a conversation about what we would do if they were in a situation like this. Ultimately, I think I would have at least given guardianship a shot, with plenty of agreements in place. If you think you‚Äôd like to try, here are some of the conversations I suggest you have:

1. Is this a permanent guardianship? Temporary? How long?

2. What are the large expectations for this guardianship? Does he expect the boys to see him as a sort of father, eventually? Does he expect you to act as a mother figure? What level of involvement does this entail? Do you need to move to a different house? A different location? Does this guardianship prevent you from moving?

3. Who will be the ‚Äúgo-to guardian‚Äù - i.e. the one responsible for taking off work to pick up a sick kid? Perhaps you have a more flexible work schedule and it genuinely wouldn‚Äôt be a problem for you to fulfill this role, or maybe this would jeopardize your career. Maybe you ‚Äúcould‚Äù do it but don‚Äôt want to, which is also valid. If that‚Äôs the case, you need to have an agreement in place because I think there would be some expectations of you lending a hand in this area and you don‚Äôt want him to assume you‚Äôll be cool with this day-to-day responsibility.

4. What‚Äôs the plan if, god forbid, your boyfriend dies? Who will take the children?

I would be very honest with him about the level of involvement you‚Äôd be prepared to have, if any. Unfortunately I think a lot of women are just kind of expected to have this maternal instinct and be willing to give up all their plans for children, which just isn‚Äôt true or fair. So be honest with him, and if you don‚Äôt think you can do it, don‚Äôt get down on yourself. The boys will probably need therapy and lots of time to adjust, so this won‚Äôt be an easy road.",1609459262

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","&gt; One piece I heard from Black Dragon Gaming was to apply Dual Classes to all the PCs. Would this help? Both in Balance and to address Taking20's concerns? Or would something like this be overkill?

One thing to consider is that the way Taking20 described the character setup in the second video, this wouldn't help at all. The main problem in that case was that the character refused to take anything that wasn't solely dedicated to archery, so the equivalent with Dual Classing would be Ranger/Fighter, taking all the archery feats. I'd argue that in some ways this actually applies the whole ""illusion of choice"" thing, because now you're getting double the bow specialization - the increased hit/crit and archery feats of fighter, and the hunted edge bonus of ranger that usually compensates for not having pure fighter numbers.

Where normal PF2 is that doing that focus makes you 10% better 70% of the time, Dual Classing increases that to more like 25%. The section for Dual Classing even warns about that:

&gt; Dual-classing in two similar martial classes to double up on their advantages can result in characters who, instead of increasing their flexibility, become drastically more powerful in one focus. For instance, a fighter/ranger with the flurry hunter‚Äôs edge gains access to incredibly accurate press actions, and a barbarian/fighter has the barbarian‚Äôs high damage plus the fighter‚Äôs high accuracy. One way around this is to simply disallow combinations that double down on a narrow ability, and instead encourage dual-class characters that open up narrative options and increase the character‚Äôs flexibility.",1609459263

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","This is a great paper. I would say a few things that I think are missing from a lot of ML papers:

First of all, these results are very different from what we usually see. We usually use Bayesian methods and we see that ML algorithms are very greedy and they can never find something in the data distribution that is not there. In our paper, the objective is to find a new distribution in the data. So, ML algorithms have to be greedy and learn to look for the data distribution that is not present.

Second, my question is: why are some of the metrics (model complexity, error rate) only computed under the assumption that the model is wrong? Why is it so hard to compute a model complexity if the model is wrong? We should compute all this metrics in the case that the model is correct.

Finally, I think a lot of these metrics can be computed faster by using some kind of statistical model, so we can use some kind of statistical model to compute some metrics, but I think this is not the best way to do it. In the case of ML, we have to use the statistical model. So I think the best way to compute some metrics (such as error rate) is to use the statistical model.",1609459264

"sleeptrain","t5_3f3ch","1. Yes. Get down with the sound machine in your room. Also you may decide that the baby needs to move out before six months. This is fine and normal. 

2. Any sounds like that are fine. Babies don‚Äôt really care. The idea is that they are stressed by silence when they are tiny, and eventually the sound becomes sort of a cue to their brains that it‚Äôs sleepy time.  

3. This is up to your family and needs. I put my baby to nap in the bassinet the first nap of the day and then sometimes would take her in the stroller for the second or wear her. If we were chilling at home and she was amenable I put her in the bassinet with sound and relative darkness. If she was not having it we did a cuddle nap or whatever while I listened to podcasts. The sound machine never left the room with the bassinet. My baby is 8 months now and sleeps all her naps in the crib with sound and darkness, but that was a gradual transition as her naps got more predictable and consolidated. The sound machine is great because it masks all the household noise and she has the association that it means sleep.

ETA I mentioned this post to my husband and he reminded me that you probably want the sound machine while you are room sharing because babies are insanely loud sleepers!!!",1609459266

"oneplus","t5_30qnb","Definitely go for the 7T pro, if you want a very consistent camera, the slight extra focusing ability, really helps indoors and in darker environments, which is the cause for that blob/smeary look on occasions, which is due to onepluses processing when a photo is not in focus, it messes it up, and makes it looks even worse, they need to fix that. You'll get pictures very similar to the pixel, with gcam. Personally i dont use gcam, but im thinking about doing it.

I find gcam to have better colors, and possibly better hdr, within the gcam im pretty sure?, which makes pictures look better, as ive done extensive testing between the 7 Pro, 8 Pro and pixel 4 XL cameras, and some of the time, the picture is actually brighter, and clearer on the OnePluses, but OnePluses color balance can at times make a photo, look more orangy, or saturated, and in low light, kind of washed out? I heard oneplus uses like a slight automatic filter, which makes the photo look a bit more cartoony and soft,at the cost to reduce noise,but makes the overall photo a blandish/blobby or soft color in darker environments even though its details nearly match the Pixel. For animals, and cars, and buildings, that color profile looks better, and actually gives off a devcieving sharper look, but on other things, when in low light it can make things and colors appear softer. 

There are a few factors which i believe people prefer gcam, gcam darkens shadows, which in turn hides/reduces noise slightly, which gives an illusion of a cleaner photo, hdr processing is a bit better i think? Dont remember. And the color balance is a bit more accurate, and at times duller looking/less saturated. And gcam doesnt have those wierd processing artifacts, like you said, when certain times photo look ""blobbish"", which is due to the stock oneplus apps processing, if it cant get the focus right, it makes things even softer, and the processing doesnt play right with that.

If you rather the 7T over the 7 Pro, the 7T still has a very good camera, a few times ive actually taken better low light photos with it, over the pixel 4 XL, usually isnt the case though, but just shows that the 7T is capable of taken the better shot in rare conditions, which goes to show the 7Ts camera isnt hugely far off from the Pixel 4 XL, and is probably better than the 4a in snapchat, due to google not being able to use there AI processing,which makes a huge difference in aiding its 3 year old camera hardware",1609459267

Thank you for your mail. In  our current  experiments we test the efficacy of PJ34 in human tumors developed in immuno-compromised mice (xenografts). This is a pre-clinical stage of the research.  We must complete all the required experiments before applying for the FDA permission to start clinical trials. This work may take us about 2 years. We also have to do some experiments before being able to use PJ34 safely in compassionate treatments. I hope that the current treatments help your family member.

To enforce the will of one group over another, we must have grounds to do so. Democratic action is that grounds.

"GenZedong","t5_1vnbn1","Ask for a source. Firstly, it‚Äôs authenticity must first be proven. Is it real and if it is, is it purposely framed to impose a specific view? The quality of the video should indicate this.

And are you sure that the information on the video is accurate? As in, are you sure that you aren‚Äôt misunderstanding what is actually happening? This is especially easy to occur because of the language barrier.

If all of that is confidently valid, is the policeman working for the PRC? It is possible that they could instead be working for the Nationalist Party. 

If this police officer truly is working for the PRC, and is being unlawfully violent against a civilian, this would just be a case of police brutality/misconduct. There will always be misconduct in any workforce. Given the proletarian nature of the PRC, and resultingly the Chinese police, this specific policeman‚Äôs actions would be purely individual, and not indicative of the broader workings of Chinese society and governance.

TLDR: Are you sure that all of the video‚Äôs information is accurate? If so, then it‚Äôs just an unfortunate case of police brutality.",1609459268

I regret that choice during the first years because it was really hard, costy and there was not that much I enjoyed about the studies. I think that mechanical engineering needs a revamp, they just try to combine all possible fields which doesn't work in such a complex world anymore. While it pays off for me now, I lost a few years of my life right there.

Then during the MSc I could focus on those topics that I really cared about and due to this it felt way more comfortable and I could also catch a nice job along my studies, which was absolutley not possible during the BSc.

Guy is stating online etc. that he‚Äôs down for a revolution and is looking for recruits. He has guns that he‚Äôs prohibited from having because of a criminal record. That last part is called ‚Äúa crime.‚Äù 

Cops use questionable tactics to get a no-knock warrant and shoot him in his bed, or at the least his bedroom, through the window. Of course, there is no body cam footage. This was a guy that needed to have his guns removed, but not get blown away. 

My conclusion: everyone stinks in this one. But you can only punish the living, so the cops should have a whole lot of explaining to do. And no one on the jury should believe a thing they say that can‚Äôt be corroborated, e.g. with video or non- LEO testimony.",1609459273

&gt; It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft&amp;#039;s source code repositories the hackers were able to access, but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.

&gt; Modifying source code - which Microsoft said the hackers did not do - could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products, which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system.

&gt; Microsoft has a huge range of products, from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway.Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft&amp;#039;s source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive.

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/Outside-Run-6107! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

"Marriage","t5_2reak","I honestly do not think we are supposed to get along with our MIL. If there is a problem with my mother I handle it and if there is a problem with Wifey's mother she handles it. I can honestly say neither of us really care for our MIL. However......from what you said your husband fucked up royally. By his mother kicking you out he should have put a stop to that.

Did he continue to live with his mom for the year when you lived with your parents??? If yes....you should have left his ass. Like people said before you, hubby and baby are a family and you MIL is extended. Your husband has to cut his cord (attached to his mom) and be with you and the baby from the beginning of this. 

If he lived with you for the year and not at his moms then that's good. There is no real way to fix this issue if you do not attend gatherings. You need to show up and be seen and known. His family may like you or may not ever like you..who is to say. But if you are not ever around his family they will only believe the MIL.

I too got kicked out of the inlaws house for 3 months in the beginning of my relationship (not married) with Wifey. I continued to show up and not go inside their house to see wifey. Eventually they realized I was not going anywhere and I ultimately lived with them for 7 years. 

My suggestion is to talk to your hubby and get him to tell the MIL you all need to talk and if she doesn't give you the time of day then fuck her. You tried and she cannot blame you for causing trouble when you tried to fix it. This is not something that can be fixed overnight and will take time....just my opinion",1609459274

Back when I first subscribed in I think 2014 it was still called Hulu Plus too.

&gt; Abstract: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning relies on machine learning algorithms, which are well understood, yet, it is hard to gain a grasp on machine learning algorithms or machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we study machine learning algorithm, especially machine learning algorithm based on deep learning. The objective of machine learning algorithm is to find the most optimal solution to the optimization problem, or to find the algorithm which works well. Machine learning algorithm is applied in data science, which is the systematic approach to data gathering and analysis. We provide the theoretical background of machine learning algorithm, and discuss the applications of machine learning algorithm in data science.

You use a quest token at locations in the game, like a Village Inn. 

Running the crafting task at a correct location will allow picking (spending the token) on one of the optional 'tasks""/quests. The item you gain from the task is placed in your valuables. Hitting F1 on the item will display the task/story/problem that person had for the 'line item' you picked.

The current linked version has only the initial 6 quests which each rewards the player with a unique item.

Once all 6 basic quests are done, the 6 rewards can be spent to gain an Adv. questing token, which will open other locations/tales/quests/tasks.

That's the basics, thanks for looking

My general understanding is most brands (including the expensive ones, and the other ones) are getting their chamois from Elastic Interface (\[examples of their brands include Assos/Rapha/Eliel/Specialized/...\]([https://www.elasticinterface.com/brands/](https://www.elasticinterface.com/brands/))). It seems that everyone labels the red one as the long distance / endurance pad. I say that from their websites and having tried them. The different brands attach them differently, and have differently fitting lycra, but the pads seem to be the same.

My personal experience is the long / endurance / red pad always gives me saddle sores. I do much better in the green one, which is usually the ""mid-distance"". That's true whether it's short rides or long ones.",1609459277

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Look man. It has always bothered me when people made assumptions without having one shred of evidence.

No, I dont have to respect anyone here, regardless of who they are. For me all it matters is what they write, and if what they write is an opinion similar to tabloid headlines, that post deserves no respect. Someone wrote that the Ceo of Revolut might be supported by the Russian mafia... which might be true... but the poster provided 0 evidence apart from the fact that the Ceo is Russian.

I made it a part of my personality to not want to publicly work out issues with people and it doesn't work in my favour. I tend to have a private moment with them, and generally most of the shit you hear floating around the social conjecture network has no basis in fact or reality. 

It's also impossible to address. With or without clarification they will spend so much more time marketing your actions than you put into thinking about them. 

But I have learned this also identifies certain types of people clearly.

If you have a weak part of your personality don't hide it, you have an easy way of testing people. Good ones don't use things like ammunition, will try to help you with your problems, but accept you for the place you are at with them. 

Bad people will just build ammunition and a personal army to control your appearance in the public, and they typically gravitate towards each other. 

It's just easier to identify them and not engage with them. 

But when your government operates on similar methods of social manipulation it's infuriating to know it's not a minor problem or one that's going to go away anytime soon.",1609459279

I went from being married for 14 years and jumping through hoops for my pat on the head (sex) and all the attitude and drama that comes with being with something that‚Äôs negative and borderline narcissistic.  Everything was a slight at her expense, everyone was talking about her or not talking to her enough.  It was literally hiding at work because I didn‚Äôt want to come home.  I thought all wives were like that.  I thought every sit com was based on reality.  Mom knows best, dad is an idiot, kids are entitled blah blah blah

I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong.  That was MY reality because I didn‚Äôt have any back bone.   I am not confrontational and always considered the fight that would ensue if I spoke up.  

Then I met someone.  Sex is on the regular.  I went from once a every two weeks or even once a month to several times a week.  She builds me up.  She‚Äôs my biggest fan.  I pay 35% of my wage in child support and alimony.  I by the numbers haven‚Äôt made this little since I was 20.  But I‚Äôm happy.  I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm home.  I‚Äôve gone on 6 vacations in 5 years because guess what, she works too.  We both work and both pull in the same direction.  I am no longer overwhelmed by the burden to shoulder the financial aspect of the family.

"PowerTV","t5_322kj","It's the same setup. Difference is, Monet doesn't want it for Dru, but Lorenzo does because he can see how he's naturally good at it.

Everyone of the kids are lacking and Tariq has the full package

\- Cane takes initiative and has the aggression + presence to back it up, but lacks composure, creativity and ingenuity that Tariq brings.

\- Dru will lie to protect family, do almost anything when demanded to and without blinking an eye as we see him getting rid of the body. He lacks the motivation to be apart of it like Tariq. His heart isn't in it and he lacks initiative.

\- Diana is smart, but she is too naive and lacks overall street sensibility. At times, it's like she doesn't know what she wants in life. She just knows she cares for the family.  Tariq has street sensibility. He uses the laws of power too well. 

This is why 1 of the few times she showed approval was when Tariq impressed her. He constantly shows that he's everything Monet would want from her kids. She is aware that he can't be trusted tho.

**I bring this up because of the Michael comparison. The dynamic becomes more complicated when Michael (Dru) has competition in Tariq and that balances out Dru not wanting any of this. His lack of motivation. Someone that might be detrimental to the family can easily become motivation down the road**",1609459280

I'm not conflating. This is the true definition of Corporation. Otherwise, provide a better one.

&gt;mid-15c., *corporacioun*, ""**persons united in a body for some purpose**,"" from such use in Anglo-Latin, from Late Latin *corporationem* (nominative *corporatio*) ""**assumption of a body**"" (used of the incarnation of Christ), noun of action from past-participle stem of Latin *corporare* ""embody, make or fashion into a body,"" from *corpus* (genitive *corporis*) ""body, dead body, animal body,"" also ""a whole composed of united parts, a structure, system,community, corporation, political body, a guild"" (from PIE root \*kwrep- ""body, form, appearance"").  
&gt;  
&gt;Meaning ""legally authorized entity, artificial person created by law from a group or succession of persons"" (such as municipal governments and modern business companies) is from 1610s.

Strawman, misrepresentation:

&gt;The fact you think a corporation like Amazon is on par with a democracy is absolutely ludicrous.

1. Would like to emphasize the math proficiency point, but don‚Äôt have anything specifically to add

2. Join a project team or another organization you feel passionate about. I‚Äôm in my second year, and it has helped me in so many ways. Firstly, it‚Äôs given me the privilege to be in the constant presence of people who study different things than me, though need to work together on a big project like you‚Äôll find in industry. Learning their tools (or at the very least gaining a base understanding), allows for much more productive conversations, and unifies the group as ‚Äúengineers‚Äù rather than just defining certain people to do/understand certain tasks, and nothing else. Secondly, project teams, especially large ones, are an amazing gateway to special access to recruiters/engineers that come to campus and talk to project teams directly before the career days. This is what ultimately helped land an internship at an amazing company, one I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get without the knowledge I gained on my project team, and the support the team brings.

3. Whether or not you end up deciding to join a project team, I recommend practicing your craft regularly outside of the classroom. This could be small arruino projects, model rockets, advanced simulations, fancy CAD models, anything to demonstrate that AE is your vocation rather than something that‚Äôll just pay the bills. They‚Äôre also great things to place on your resume, especially if it feels dry your first year with a lack of engineering content, as my resume did.


Lastly, I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôve got a fellow teammate who I believe has just turned 30, and he‚Äôs been an absolute joy. He brings life experiences, advice, and a passion for learning that‚Äôs bar none. I‚Äôm really excited to see you do the same at your future university, and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre making such a big leap! Go you!",1609459284

"TheBlackList","t5_2whmr","Tessa you do a great job on this as always but the locations you are suggesting do not make sense. I feel it is a stretch to suggest so unless the whole episode/trip was an opiate dream from the get-go, only then could you be correct in your observations, and you may well be, but I just don't see it.

*In Red's hallucination in Cape May, Katarina is at a hotel because that is where Red was. BUT the scenes could really be anywhere, even a residence, closed for the Winter.* 

That is one of the stretches, as I do not think indoors and outdoors scenes were ever intended to be separate locations. The interior/exterior of the Inn/Resort is consistent architecture all the way from Red getting out of the cabbies car he paid for (exterior of resort), to getting the beach chair, the Reception desk and police officer that got included in the hallucination/dream Red was having. So to me it was a beach resort all the way through from deck chairs to boat house.

*This place had to be secure, and somewhat isolated. The Rehoboth Beach house checked all the boxes.*

That is true *if* there was no fire there, but there was and there was nothing left but a foundation, long after. So where could there anyplace be to hide if it was burned to the ground?

*The house she is in, seems to be on the water, for we see sand outside.*

Well it was not a house, it was a resort named *Sea Breakers Inne* and established with a shot of the sign and front of building. Definitely not a house. It was surrounded by sand and a far larger lot and structural foundation than the Rehoboth Beach lot. The remaining foundation at Rehoboth Beach looks the size of a cottage, which was surrounded by other residences and streets close to the shore. Could there have been development since the *fire*? Sure, but the Inn/Resort was the place in present-show-time Red parked his newly acquired car. His hallucination/dream occurred only with Kat in them, in the restaurant and Inn/Resort and surroundings, and not in the Rehoboth Beach house.",1609459284

Why? Because I know it doesn't take a lot for a creepy man to think he has consent and I know as a woman that when it comes down to it I'm a lot less capable of defending myself against a man so I have to be extra careful with what I say and how I act.

First, I think you are right in saying that this is not the usual way of doing machine learning, but instead it is a new approach that is not widely used. Most machine learning algorithms are based on a Bayesian approach, and there are a lot of applications for using statistics to learn machine learning algorithms. 

As you pointed out, we tried to use statistical models to compute some measures, such as error rate, model complexity, etc. These are the measures that we feel are most important to measure machine learning algorithms in a scientific sense. However, our analysis shows that these are not the most important metrics to measure machine learning algorithms (error rate and model complexity and so on are quite important).

In our opinion, machine learning algorithms have to be able to find patterns in the data distribution with a high degree of confidence, but it is always possible for machine learning algorithms to find patterns that are not there. In order to measure machine learning algorithms in a scientific sense, we want these patterns to be there so that machine learning algorithms can be able to find them.

Also, our analysis showed that machine learning algorithms could be better when they had more samples (which is the case for our paper). Our paper is not about measuring performance of machine learning algorithms in a ""scientific"" sense, but rather it is about measuring performance of machine learning algorithms in a ""scientific"" sense, without the use of machine learning algorithms.",1609459285

I think that part of the difference is that in data science you are trying to fit an objective function, while in machine learning you are trying to fit a model. In data science, the objective function is to obtain a useful result. With machine learning, the objective function is to find a model that can make predictions.

So you are not measuring the performance on a test set anymore, but the performance on the test set is an objective function, just like the error rate is an objective function. This is a big difference that is often overlooked.",1609459288

The only time there is an issue really is when components fail and there are broken or third party parts in the phone. So say your  phone had the no cell phone reception issue and was still under warranty.  If the phone had a third party screen, You would have to pay to replace the screen with a first party screen before we could exchange the bad device with another unit, even though its a waste of a screen, and its obviously not going to fix the issue. if there is a 3rd party or physically damaged component on the device, the warranty is pretty much in limbo until the part gets fixed/replaced.",1609459288

They leave the international operation expertise to the Company since most great ones that dominate their sector are typically operating internationally already. By investing in the Company, they will gain the exposure to the international markets.",1609459289

I would like to share some of my experiences in my life with you because trust me what you go through is something similar to what I have gone through.

When I was in elementary school, I was made fun of for my height daily. I have been called midget and shortstack, and I watched as everyone else around me got taller and wondered what I did wrong, why I was different. 

I'm not thin either, though I've played sports my entire life and have tried to lose weight. I just gain muscle easier than I lose fat. So I am considered heavy by average standards. And because I'm so short, I'm expected to weigh close to 100 lbs, this is unrealistic and in fact its unhealthy for me to be so. Because of my height, I have been permanently labeled as fat because the standard set for my weight is unrealistic and unattainable. 

Oh my lord, when you talked about clothes, I wanted to cry with you. I understand you. For me, it's not big and tall, its having the humiliation of having to shop in the girls or boys section because I'm too small for the women's. I don't even count as a woman apparently because I can't wear the clothes. Any jeans i have have to be cuffed multiple times just to look decent,, and i don't even bother with jackets, hoodies are the only way to go. And heels? Oh I love heels, and I'd love to wear them to make myself seem taller, but my feet are too small and I can't wear them. 

I have hated myself and my height for most of my life, it's limited me. I'm not taken seriously and employers have admitted that my height ""isn't professional"". I am judged on my physique, assumed to he physically weak, and it has hindered my life. 

I know you mentioned nicknames, in some cases I'm sure that's true. In my case I've been called a marshmallow and objectified for my height. I've walked in on conversations about how I must be easy to throw around in unsavory circumstances. I do live in fear, I am scared in most social situations. I don't trust easy knowing about that. I am scared that when the time comes I won't be able to defend myself. 

Trust me, everyone of amy extreme has serious problems fitting in or feeling normal. Society only caters to the perfectly average, and its tough because almost no one fits that box. 

But I do think you have unrealistic expectations, I've lived the life you want, it has not been kind to me. And I hope you learn to love yourself, I'm still trying. And short girls may have a giant world (so huge, I can't even reach the top shelf in the fridge) but I love tall girls, there's so much more to love and plus you never get lost in crowds, it happens quite often to me.

Also, I know you talked about people kneeling down to talk to shorter girls and in a different voice than they would to others. I know a few girls like me who are very short, we all think this to be demeaning and extremely rude. I've kicked a few men in the shins for being assholes, I am a woman, not a doll speak to me like a human being.

I hope this helped to show you the other side of the fence. It's not all roses, it's also a lot of pain, and I'd be happy to answer any more questions you may have. If it's not already 2021 for you, then happy new year's eve!",1609459290

Hell, there was even some post about the Nashville bombing the other day on reddit that essentially called them cousin-fuckers in the title. I wish I could remember exactly what the link was to, but the title was like ""probably were cousins"" or some shit.

The South is one of the last groups that people feel safe to make fun of because the ""woke"" crowd won't stick up for us like they will for other groups. Which I get in some ways, the South hasn't exactly been great for a lot of them. But for people like you and me it's home, and we know that there are a lot of good, honest, decent people down there.

This is not the case. ML algorithms are not built with the goal to calculate the metric that is closest to the actual distribution. ML algorithms are built with the goal of finding new distributions in the data.",1609459291

"librarians","t5_2qpf2","Academic librarian here who's been on several hiring committees. Please don't count on your conservatory's reputation to make you stand out to a hiring team. Librarians come from a wide range of undergrad backgrounds --- English, computer science, math, history ... you name it, it's represented in our field. As such, the odds are probably slim that we'll look at your conservatory's name and think, ""Ooh, that'll probably make them a great librarian."" (An obvious exception would be if you were applying to a music-related library job, like at a conservatory or symphony.)

So what *will* help you stand out?

First, library work experience. I was working three library jobs by the time I graduated from library school --- at a radiology library, a symphony library, and a cataloging office. Many of my classmates only had the experience they'd gained in the for-credit practicum course.

Second, following directions. If a hiring team says, ""Be ready to lead a 10-minute presentation on X,"" I recommend preparing to lead a 10-minute presentation on X. Not 30 minutes. Not 2 minutes. Not rambling on about A, B, and Q before touching briefly on X and segueing to P. 

Third, soft skills. Do you come across as a pleasant person to work with? Can you communicate your skills and experience clearly, humbly, and succinctly? Do you know how to dress for an interview?

Finally, flexibility. It's going to help you a lot if you're willing to move for work.

Hope that helps!",1609459291

At 9:27 PM last evening (30th) A series of explosion with large fleshes and sound were caught by my cameras. The sound took 16 seconds to arrive at the camera setting the distance at 3.4 miles (+-) .  The center of the flash was over a house across the street giving a very clear direct angle to the center of the flash. Drawing a circle around me with a radius of 3.4 miles and intersecting a straight line to the center of the flashes it places them at just North of Bollinger and Lawrence with maybe a quarter mile circumference matching what other had reported. It was hard to tell if they were air bursts or on the ground but appear to be in the air ( hard to say but could be as high as 1/4-1/2 mile given the angle and distance.. ) If that were so these were ""commercial"" fireworks. ON the other hand reflections of the flashes can be tricky..  But, if this was on the ground there would have been broken windows somewhere :)  .

"fireemblemcasual","t5_342g7","I've never been more self-conscious about not knowing how to write hiragana than when I tried to write furigana.

I'm going to shift my focus in my studies. Instead of being drip fed whatever these apps feel like teaching me, it's necessary that I stop right here and work almost exclusively on kanji. It's a reinforced brick wall that has all but halted my progress. It's incredibly daunting, but you can't read shit in Japanese without kanji, and I'm sick of memorizing them by what they sorta look like when there are (literally in some cases) hundreds of others that look just like it. I'll still review what I've learned, of course, but I need to either put more time into this or just quit now.

That all said, I've put quite a bit of time into the Kanji Study app I've mentioned before, where I learned that tomorrow will be ‰∏ÄÊó• (ichi nichi), which can mean the first day of the month. I also finally picked up the kanji book I got for Christmas. It isn't going how I thought it would, but I'm keeping an open mind. So far that's only taught numbers though, which are about the only kanji I could tell you a single thing about.

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","Hey no problem. I had many questions to when I first came to Faith.
And also you need to take into account that God is all-powerful and he can reach anybody with the gospel even into the farthest parts of the world. So in other words if they respond to letter A (let's say just acknowledgement by creation the fact that God exists.) He can then bring them to letter B, if they respond to letter B he'll bring them to letter C. And so forth. Until they come to the letter z which is complete faith.

And really nobody is completely wholesome and righteous all the time. We all have the same nature we were born with. It's like an inherited disease.  And remember even a so called righteous person would be happy to live in this world only. They may not get to inherit everlasting life but they will be happy to live here.

 In short, a frame is not considered a firearm in MA, and is therefore not subject to the roster.  See prior weekly legal advice threads for details.   You simply purchase the frame and slide separately and once assembled you file a FA10 for firearm registration.  Fully above board, and with the right FFL, you'll avoid the MA premium. 

We cannot discuss which FFL's  are known to facilitate such things, but there are more than a handful around.

I still haven't figured out the salads at home thing. If you could give me some more advice on salads specifically, that would be awesome.

This happened a while ago (probably a few years) and it's rattled around my brain ever since then. 

So I was home from college one spring and I needed to go to Walmart (honestly couldn't tell you what I needed to get).   I asked my sister if she could drive me since I didn't have my license at the time.  She said yes and told me she wanted to watch another episode of her show and do some laundry so we could go in about an hour, maybe an hour and fifteen minutes. I said that would be great and thanked her.

With the time frame she gave me I decided to start playing a video game (league of legends) because an hour should be enough time for one game.  20 minutes later she comes to me and tells me she's ready to go.  I ask what she means since we were going to go in about 40 ish minutes.  She says ""I decided to just do laundry and not watch my show so I'm ready now.""

I told her I really can't leave my game (if you don't know, you can't pause league of legends because you're playing with 9 other random people. You also can get penalized for leaving a game before it's finished) and asked her if she can wait another 20 or so minutes.  She said no, that she's doing me a favor and she can either bring me now or not at all.  With that ultimatum I reluctantly closed my game and left with her while arguing that she gave me a time line and it's annoying that she just changed it like that. 

My brother was on her side, saying that  I was on her time since she was nice enough to bring me to walmart. AITA?

"digitalnomad","t5_2r9w0","I do know that for a fact. Travel spreads disease.

I will not risk the *luxury* of travel if it has a chance of killing someone. 

I'm talking about a luxury I'm willing to forego for a year or two if it means less death. 

How is that hard to grasp. Why do you insist that if I choose not to travel during a pandemic due the risk involved, I should also not, for instance, drive because of the risk of *it* involves. They're just not comparable things. 

I think what you're getting at is that the question of ""where the line is for what's acceptable during a pandemic"" is not up to some randos on Reddit. I think it is. It's a calculation each of indivually make that, in aggegrate, impacts the spread of COVID.

We're not talking about rhetorical things here. These choices have concequences. People are dead. Others are dying alone, indubated in a packed ICU. The last thing they'll see *if they're lucky* is a hurried facetime with family members facilitated by an overworked stressed out nurse who sees death day in and day out. 

That's what we're talking about here. That's why I'm so frustrated that you insist on these meaningless rhetorical dead ends. People are dying and we have the power to make it happen less. 

Travel is a luxury we all can forego if it means saving lives. You're right, getting into the economics of halting our lives entirely is another, more nuanced conversation. But when it comes to this case -- traveling internatinally during a pandemic -- we should not do it.",1609459294

Since Adidas' online system took the order with my PO Box as the delivery address, I figured no problem (Nike's system will reject it because they do not deliver to PO boxes). FedEx get the package and change the delivery address to my old home address. I get text notices and see this. So I call FedEx and try to correct my address to my new home.  They tell me they can't because I am only allowed one address change and the address has already been changed from the PO box to a residential address.  I tell them they changed it, not me.  They tell me they know that they changed it, but them's the rules. I say, you know if you deliver the package it will go to whoever lives at that house and not me since I moved.  They tell me to contact the shipper and the shipper can change the address.  So I call Adidas and explain to them.  Adidas calls FedEx and FedEx tells them they cannot change the address because it has already been changed, EVEN THOUGH ADIDAS IS THE SHIPPER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT ONLY THE SHIPPER CAN MAKE THE ADDRESS CHANGE!

Luckily, Adidas called me back with this and while I was on the phone with a really nice CS person, she was in their shipping system and realized that she could change the address herself.  She did it and I got my shoes.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","You heard this come up a lot, so let me ask you this. Do you really think that making six figures is what makes senators rich? Remember, they travel a lot, and often retain housing in DC and in their home state, which is expensive since their housing is typically in expensive markets in their state and in DC. Sure, they aren't paupers, but acting like they're living like kings is wrong too.

Senators get rich by either already being rich and using that to attain their seat, or by exploiting their role to make more money. Usually, its a combination of both. So if you reduced those peoples wages, it wouldn't affect them much, their wages were never their big moneymaker. However, it would actively discourage smaller less wealthy senators from running.",1609459294

Gwen: Eeeee nasilsin? Nasil gecti anlatmayacak misin? 

Felix ilk once gwenin kollarindan kurtulup yatagin basligina uzandi. Gwen de yanina yaslandi. Istese felixe de yaslanabilirdi ama rahatsizlik cikarmak istemedi. 

Felix arkasina gururlu bir bi√ßimde yaslandi. Kollarini boynunun arkasina kenetledi. 

Felix: ( 25 civari ampul patlattim.) 

Gwen: (wooooow) 

Felix test sirasinda basindan gecenleri gwene anlatti. 

Felix: (Ve iste sonra uyandim dus falan aldim o kadar.) 

Gwen: (Ne guzel. Iyi misin suan?) 

Felix: (Iyiyim sorun yok. Bir dus bi uyku bana iyi geldi. A bu arada sana bir soylemem lazim.) 

Gwen:(?) 

Felix: (Hector benden sana da haber vermemi istedi. Ya simdi ben hani sucluyum ya? O yuzden gorunuslerimizi degistirmemiz gerekiyormus. Cunku fotograflarimiz medyada ve eger biri bizi disarda gorurse anlarsin ya.) OMMAYGAT BU ONLAR! 

Gwen felix'in yaptigi paniklemis kadin taklidine normalde gulmezdi. Ancak gulmesi gerektigini hissediyordu. Sahte de olsa felix'in icin kikirdadi. 

Gwen: (Yani? Ne dedi ki sana?) 

Felix: (Bu tur bir hadisenin yasanmamasi icin saclarimizi boyatmaliymisiz.) 

Gwen: (VAAAAAAAAY. √áok iyi be!) 

Felix: (Dimi?! Kafamin agrisindan bunu dusunmeye gucum yoktu ama simdi bir dusununce gercekten muazzam olabilir.) 

Gwen: (Offffff √ßok fazla secenek √ßok fazla model. Hey beni nasil hayal ediyorsundur ruyalarinda?) 

Gwenin bakislari normal degildi. Bu bakista kesinlikle erotik bir seyler sezen felix oyuna dahil olmaya karar verdi. 

Felix: (Aslinda o elma kafan zumrut gozlerin herzaman guzel bir ikili olmuslardi amaaaaaaaaaaa dur bi bakayim.) 

Felix parmaklarini kamera tutarmis gibi cerceve haline getirdi ve arkasindan bakarak gwene dogrultu. Gwen ise felix'e bakarken kafasini geriye egdi ve bir eliyle saclarini arkadan kavrayip kabartirken diger elini de beline koydu. Felix gwen'in bu cesur sacmaliklarina sasirmamisti. Aksine sevdigu kizin bu kadar rahat sacmalayabilmesine seviniyordu. Oyunu bir sonraki levele cikarip sanki gay bir moda tasarimcisiymis gibi yorum yapmaya basladi. 

Felix: (Wow Victoria Secret. Verdigin poz gercekten ilham patlatici duzeyde) 

Felix alayci ve a≈üagilayici bir tavirla sesini inceltmesine gwen bu sefer gercekten gulmustu. 3 saniye sonra felix de kikirdayarak ona katildi. 

Felix:....(saka bi yana saclarin gozlerinle kesinlikle uyumlu olmali. O yesil pirlantalarin yarattigi buyuyu kesinlikle kullanmaliyiz.) 

Gwen sacini ucundan tutup gozunun onune getirdi. 

Gwen: (Hmm hakli olabilirsin aslinda. Sence ne renge boyatmaliyim veya nasil boyatmaliyim?) 

Felix iki elinin de avuclarini bir asagi bir yukari bakacak sekilde salladi. 

Felix: (Yani ben de onu dusunuyorum amaaaa senceee siyah nasil olur? Bir de k√ºt birakabilirsin? Hm?)",1609459294

Having a good support system is important so when you feel comfortable let those around you in on how you are feeling and let them help you.

Background on Mexican Federal Police Commander Guillermo Calderoni

[https://np.reddit.com/r/narcos/comments/gltj0h/guillermo\_calderoni\_was\_a\_mexican\_cop\_a\_killer\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/narcos/comments/gltj0h/guillermo_calderoni_was_a_mexican_cop_a_killer_a/)

[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/calderoni.html](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/calderoni.html)

Calderoni was murdered in Mc Allen, Texas in 2003. He was brought to the U.S. as a protected witness by DEA agent Hector Berrellez. He was allowed to bring millions of dollars into the United States with him as part of his status as a protected witness. He told of protecting Contra drug shipments and told DEA Agent Berrellez that ""Your country killed Camarena"" ""Get out of this and do not pursue this case"" Calderoni informed DEA agent Berrellez that he would soon be transferred. Berrellez said that a month later he was assigned to a Washington DC desk job with nothing to do, After going to the movies for a year, he resigned in 1996. Calderoni's murder has never been solved.

Read about Berrellez conversations with his informant Calderoni:

Same with Anthem. I played the hell out of that with my husband our friends and I still jump in to fuck about every few months. It can be so much fun. Yes, content was and still is lacking but omg the flying is so well done, the different combat styles of the suits are really diverse, the lore is actually interesting and the game is just so pretty.

I honestly feel sorry for the people who can't see past non-game breaking bugs, their own entitlement, or people who jump on hate bandwagons and won't give games a chance because IGN or Kotaku said so.

The only actual good friends I found during that time were transient and unconnected to any group and I feel like they were mostly drawn to me because I was hurting so much.

I feel like smaller numbers or maybe even no friends is my new normal. I get along well enough with my step brothers to fill that ""casual friend"" void and I hope I find a partner in the next few years.

I also found that the more people I tried to include in my life, the more of a support system I needed. Now that I'm solo, there's no drama and not as much need for support/encouragement.

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt;It‚Äôs also difficult to say exactly how much more transmissible the new variant may be, because scientists have not yet done the kind of lab experiments that are required. Most of the conclusions have been drawn from epidemiological observations, and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs so many possible biases in all the available data,‚Äù cautioned Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government.

&gt;Scientists initially estimated that the new variant was 70 percent more transmissible, but a recent modeling study pegged that number at 56 percent. Once researchers sift through all the data, it‚Äôs possible that the variant will turn out to be just 10 to 20 percent more transmissible, said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.

Today, I woke up from bed at 3:58pm, yes 3:58pm, on a fucking Thursday.

Now I will just waste hours and hours watching unnecessary YouTube videos, that I will reject and don't even reallly like. I have already decided to waste the whole day, or whats left of it. It's just misery.

I PMOd at 11:12pm. It just felt stupid and empty. It's such a waste. I am trying to get my last nuts out before the new year, I guess.

I PMOd at 11:45am. It was horrible. It always ends in disgust and shame. I hate pmo so much. I hope I never do it again.

So fucking sad, I kept going and went past midnight. Meaning that I will not have a pmo free year. I am am idiot. I couldn't stop. I just had to keep going.

I PMOd at 12:15am on new years day. I hated it. This is just all so wrong. There are no words for this. I am in hell. I am miserable living like this.

As others were ringing in the new year, I was doing the same old habit of PMOing. It's sad really. 

Now I am back to watching unnecessary and poisonous YouTube videos. I will do it for hours and hours and waste more of my life.

This is way worse than even last year. At least then I stopped pmoing a minute before bew years, abd then I was able to be clean for a week or two. This just goes to show that it will never end until I actually try, until I actually change. As you can see there is nithing nagical about the bew year. Saying tomorrow or later never works, because nothing has changed inside. I wasted so much time, it's crazy. Nothing has changed, things only got worse. My life is a lot worse. I am much more miserable. It's all my fault.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Quick background: I've lost 50 lbs twice in my life.Lost it, gained it back, and lost it again. The first time was not the healthiest way and the second was extremely healthy and I am currently happy with my body. 

You're leaving out a lot of information. People will date a person who is overweight. The more accurate thing to say is that certain people won't date you because you're overweight. But, some people won't date you even when your a normal healthy weight. Some people want you to be underweight. Example, go check out the standards for women in South Korea. Honestly, you could just check the standards placed on women in general around the world. The word weight, includes organs, bones, muscles and everything. We should be more careful with this word because there are people that take losing weight to an extreme, anorexia. You're probably referring to when a person has more fat on their body then they want. 

This is for someone looking for some help;

I think a good goal to strive for is to be healthy and comfortable in your body. Don't worry about losing weight, think about wether you are comfortable being naked or are you comfortable in your clothes. When I say healthy, I mean you should go to the doctor and  hear them say you're in good health. I think if you feel good about yourself and the doctor says you're doing good then who cares what other people think. 

(Pro tip for men: Be serious about where you shop. Some stores make clothes for people with no ass, no broad shoulders, and no thighs. You can be a 35inch waist in one store and a 32 in another. Also check the fit)

If you're not comfortable in your body and you want to change your body then don't focus on your weight. You probably want to lose fat. If you focus on your weight, you might gain muscle and think you're not progressing. Just in case you didn't know, you lose fat from all over your body. You can't decide where you lose fat.

How do you start to change your body? Just start walking! 30 mins, an hour, or more. But you need to be consistent. It's just a walk, so why not everyday? The moment things become easy, that's when you need to go farther. You can listen to music or my favorite, listen to audio books. If there is some other activity you really like then do that? But same thing as before, you'll need to increase the intensity once things get easy. I think this is a great start because now you have carved out time in your schedule to do some activity and you're being consistent. You can change the activity anytime you're ready.

You need to eat! Never stop eating to change your body. You need to change WHAT you are eating. Don't go on a diet, this will not work for the majority of us. Change your diet, that means commiting to changing how you eat forever. In my experience, if you want to save money and be healthier. Stop eating out! The sad truth (for US) is that most food at restaurants has too much sodium and too many calories. This part might be hard for some of you. You have to learn how to cook food you like. Make huge meals you can eat over the week. It's really cool not be dependent on restaurants. You don't need to make a beautiful masterpiece for each meal, just make food that tastes good to you. Also, make sure you have veggies in each meal. Athlean-x has a very cool clock diagram for setting up your meals. You can still eat everything in restaurants! You just can't eat it frequently. 

Everyone is different and noone can really tell you how long it will take for you to get to where you want to be. But like the OP said, just keeping doing it. All of this work pays off! When you get old, you will be so happy that you have had years or decades of living a healthy lifestyle.",1609459299

Seriously... He sounds secure. When you say things like he never leaves you on read or giving mixed signals. 

So texting might not be his thing... It's really not mine either. But as you get to know each other, you (anxious type) will get to know and trust him (secure). It's not actually about the frequency of texting, more that you are able to trust that he'll respond when he can. And it sounds like he has!

So really don't think about this as a mistake. In fact, I'll tell you how the book would describe it:

We all have an attachment system. It has to do with our brains and chemistry. People with anxious attachment styles get a hyperactive attachment system. So you find yourself worried a little bit, and you reach out. If your partner responds, you are reassured and you stay within your comfort zone. (It seems to be what happened now.)

If your partner doesn't respond or takes too long to respond, your stress goes up and you enter a danger zone. You start to overthink and overreact. If your partner tries to reassure you at this point, it's going to take a lot more reassurance than it would have if they had met your needs early on. Many people with anxious attachment systems are used to living in this danger zone... A chronically activated attachment system. 

In fact, some people with anxious attachment systems think they must not be in love if they don't feel activated (in the danger zone / overly anxious/emotional rollercoaster). But that's not actually true! This is an unhealthy place to be that literally increases stress hormones and causes significant physical and emotional problems.",1609459300

When using Conducting Area while Electric Terrain is active, the move would just fail and vice versa.

I get that having 2 unique but extremely similar effects will be confusing. However, it does help that Conducting Area would be exclusive to Jolteon, while a lot of Electric-Type Pok√©mon can get Electric Terrain. 

There is no harm is using the Terrain instead of a new effect, however, like I said, unless there is a good reason for a move or Pok√©mon to summon set weather or terrain I don't want a move that can summon them, since there are already moves that ca do that, and usually they are very widely distributed. 

&gt;Thats like inventing a wheel instead of buying one from the store next door.

I am not going to disagree with this. It is indeed unnecessesary and confusing, which is why I am making this move more similar to other moves from other types, aka the other Eeveelutions' moves. It still has a close resemblence to Electric Terrain, sure, but the only real things the have in common is their Type and their Electric-Type move power bonus. All other effects of Electric Terrain are different from the ones from the other ones from Conducting Area.

&gt;As a design philosophy you dont want that the player needs to keep track of too much.

Which is why this move stays exclusive to Jolteon. I don't usually talk about the messages the move would display on the screen when used, but I think I would want Conducting Area to say that Electric-Types get stronger when this move gets used. Similarly, Water Current (Vaporeon's move) would say that Water-Types get faster and Flareon's move would say that Fire-Types get bulkier or something like that.",1609459300

So they were never finished, but they at least started building them. Still a lot better than what they came up with for the heavy line

Edit: I found info on a prototype td called the ka-to that would use a 105mm and built on the Chi-to platform like the Tier 7 Chi-to spg but the Ka-to was more of a glass cannon td.

(My WH didn't do that, it was suspected, discovered, damage control/trickle truth for 9 months.)  You need to get to the root of your whys and that will help not just you but your BH too.  You may think you know your whys but you will discover others that also may be painful.

Realize this, it is heartbreaking for a BS to realize the person they trusted and loved was out starting a whole new relationship with someone else.  He needs reassurance.  His ego and self-esteem have taken a huge hit here.  If he is giving you the gift of reconciliation and you truly love him and want that, treat it as such.

I would also recommend IC for him too, to process his feelings.  You may also want to write out a timeline of the affair for him.  Something my WH did to sometimes distract me from being so emotional was remind me of when we met, fell in love, moments he remembered when we were happy or the milestones.  It helps remembering everything you were before, but reassure him you want to build it better.

My advice is focus on these things:

- control the centre
- develop your pieces (knights, bishops, rooks, queen)
- keep king safe (castle early)

Don't waste time learning specific or niche openings just focus on controlling the centre, develop your pieces, castle early and go from there.

If you want you could find a few opening moves you really like, I play a bishops opening as white most times for instance, because it's easy to remember (e4, bc4, nf3, d4, castle) and can be played against almost anything, and is super flexible (can be aggressive, scholars mate possibilities, transpose into other safer things etc).. but even then the core principles come first, if I can take control of the centre with a d5 as well, I will.. if I have to keep king safer early, I will, if an opportunity to develop another piece presents itself as a good early choice (nc3 or something), I will..

Don't pre-move whatever opening you choose though, definitely think about what you're doing, at your level you and your opponent WILL blunder often and you should be able to climb just by capitalising on that. Principles first!",1609459306

But I think a lot of people default to a sort of squat when they're doing cowgirl in general. 

Instead of doing a squat and bouncing, you'd basically be trying to do a yoga backbend. Most of your weight should be supported with your arms, have your legs just kinda being there and running parallel to his midsection. 

After that...think less bounce and more twerk-y hip rolls/gyrations.

"cataclysmdda","t5_2wktw","&gt;So, have you ever thought about increasing bleeding damage and chance?

Nope, they're where I want them.

&gt; In real life you can kill moose with a single arrow from a weak (probably equivalent to a light longbow) with a single well-placed arrow. Provided you give it time to bleed out. 

While you might be able to take down a large deer with a pretty weak bow doing so is a one in hundred thousand or one in a million shot, not a typical shot and I'm not interested in modeling one in a million or one in a hundred thousand shots.  
It happens so rarely it has no positive impact on the game. The net effect is that roughly once a game you take out an enemy faster than you would have otherwise, and also once a game *you get killed unexpectedly*.
As for the ""eventually"" side of things, yes there's a big difference between a ""will drop eventually"" shot and a, ""will drop immediately"" shot, but it's pretty vacuous, because on the ""eventually"" side of things you either have your target disappearing into the distance in the case of a deer, or continuing to try and chew your face off in the case of a zombie.

&gt;An example of this concept. The video shows an elk, and a compound bow, but it‚Äôs roughly equivalent to wooden broad heads, str 8-9. And probably archery 3ish. 

I don't know where you get 8-9 str from, that arrow was buried to the fletching in the chest of an elk, and that looks like a fairly typical hunting bow, not an extra extra weak one.",1609459307

Most people outside of music often don't care about specific musical achievements or what music courses you took. However, what they do care about are the skills you learned through music: High standards for your work, proven success through awards and achievements, great networking skills, experience with complex audiovisual software, etcetera. Always read the job description and emphasize how the skills you have now meet what the company wants.

The average recruiter spends 7-8 seconds reading a resume. Have someone look at your resume who hasn't seen it before and give them that much time to read it. See if the person gets your main strengths in that much time. 

Like other people have said, making things into bullet points will help. I believe your most marketable skill is your fluency in multiple languages. Highlight it early, but don't list languages as fluent unless you can answer interview questions well in that language.

Here's a hypothetical example of how to list your server experience.

-Worked flexible hours to achieve top results during peak service times.

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","Monks make great prototypical tanks due to their action economy. You can move, Flurry of Blows and then shield block. Im currently playing a STR monk that uses a shield to boost my AC. At level 1 your AC will be 21 each round while still getting off 2 attacks. That is huge as the likely hood of getting crit at that level is very low, outside of the DM rolling 20's. And avoiding crits is vital to tanking in PF2. Also take the stand still feat ASAP so the BBEG cant just walk away from you.

Another thing to consider is that monks typically dont have a lot of use for their skill feats. You can get battle medicine/godless healing and that can really help your ability to stay in the fight. 

If you want to go another way. A dex based monk using a bo staff or whip is a great way to crowd control as you can trip with your finesse attack.",1609459308

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Ambition can be a double edge sword. Ubisoft knows that it is useful to be able to consistently hit the 7 and 8 range, rather than try and always go for a ten.

Think of it this way. In the 5 years between Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk, Ubisoft managed to release 3 massive action rpg games with huge open worlds and tons of progression systems and other things average gamers love. Even if you were to argue that every single aspect of all three of those games is only 75% as good as Witcher 3 (which is pretty arguable in certain areas) they managed to get 3 in the time CDPR made 1.

Think of it this way. For a lot of hardcore gamers, an Ubisoft game probably isn't in their top 10 favorite games. Heck, probably not even the top 20. But top 50? Almost certainly at least 1 is in there. And most can name at least a half dozen they've played in the past 5 years. They are reliably decent to  good, which can arguably be just as hard as getting that 1 10/10 masterpiece.

"hometheater","t5_2rof6","I have a very similar setup to you.  You have a couple of options.

In general, you want to always set your speakers to 'Small'.  'Small' is a terrible name because it's confusing when you have huge, heavy speakers like yours.  What 'Small' really means is ""use the receiver to send bass frequencies to the LFE channel"", whereas Large means ""Don't send any bass to the LFE channel unless it's specifically mastered as LFE (which is only the case on movies)"".  LFE+Main sends the signal to both, and it will get you a little more volume at the cost of making integration a huge headache.

What path you take depends a ton on your current situation and your goals.  Do you have any dips/dead zones in your bass?  If you have something like REW you can measure for them, otherwise you can run bass sweeps at a loud-ish volume and see if you notice any nulls.  When it comes to bass, you're going to spend almost all of your time figuring out placement.  The actual EQ/loudness is super quick once you have the right positioning.  If you have 2 12"" subwoofers, and you are flexible with placement, you can almost certainly get very close to perfect bass response without using the subs in your DefTechs at all.  However if placement is a problem or your room is a weird shape, then having the two additional subwoofers in the DefTechs can help smooth out nulls and valleys.

If you're looking for the absolute best bass possible, leaving nothing on the table, and having the most even response curve, then I think you basically have to get a MiniDSP and use it to send signal to all 4 subs.  With 4 subs, this approach I would say is almost mandatory, as you're just never going to be able to get the timing and distances right with 4 subs without having some way to adjust all 4 of them.  You can tune each sub individually, set crossovers individually, and set delays individually, so you can maximize the bass of your setup.  Your setup is very similar to mine, and this is what I ended up doing.  The MiniDSP lets me integrate my 2 BP9060 subs with my 2 standalone subs (on 15"", one 12"").  I really couldn't see it working in any other way, too many variables that you don't have the ability to change/fix.

If you are flexible with placement, then you can try just using the 2 12"" subs as bass, and then setting your BP2002s to Small and crossing over at 80hz.  The crossover isn't a wall, it's a curve, so frequencies below 80hz still get sent to the BP2002 subs (they're just attenuated).  You'll lose a little volume, but you'll still have excellent bass coverage (assuming you don't sit in an anechoic chamber), and in all reality the 12"" subs are going to be outputting 95% of the volume of your system anyways.  The BP2002 subs will still do *something*, they just won't be outputting their absolute maximum SPL.

I would only recommend setting your fronts to Large and setting LFE+Main if you want the absolute most bass output, without any regard to how it sounds or how it integrates.  It'll be boomy and sound weird, and you'll probably have weird/annoying nulls that are hard to smooth out, but it's 'free'.",1609459308

Landlords can carry a myriad of services, including but not limited to just some of the following:

* Customer service.
* Staffing.
* Maintenance.
* Technology upgrades.
* Lawn care.
* Shoveling/plowing services.
* Marketing.
* Investment.
* Risk.
* Negotiations between vendors.
* Management.

And more. Many property management systems are complex organizations.

What perpetuates low income is two-fold.

1. Authoritarianism control.
2. Low demand and high supply (most workers).

"weezer","t5_2s48r","An... interesting write-up. I feel like the author came to some pretty agreed upon conclusions, and the *stretched* material in order to prove a point. They went over the dead horse that is the problematic parts of Pinkerton, and then when they realized that they were saying what everyone's been saying for a decade *praising*, the album, they made up some odd, contrived argument that White is equivalent to Pinkerton. 

They used the quote ""LA Girls is the new El Scorcho"", which is just... like, what? The themes of those songs are completely different, and follow River's changes as a person over the years. El Scorcho is about the desires which he knows are far-fetched and impossible to fufill, which end up tearing at him and making him hate himself. LA Girls is about him questioning himself for still trying to act young and macho in his 50's. It's not meant to show the 'dark side' of him like in El Scorcho, it's just meant to be a song about his struggles growing older. It's definitely not nearly as powerful or emotional as El Scorcho.

Further, the article is kind of a mess. It goes from ""I've moved on from Weezer and now cringe when I listen to them"" to ""Don't get me wrong, I love the band and Rivers"" every other paragraph. It never even really comes to a solid conclusion on the relationship between Rivers and Asian Women. It restates what we already know about Pinkerton, briefly mentions Myspace and the supposed elements of White that are similar to Pinkerton, and then calls the listeners of the band immature. It really doesn't actually say anything about Rivers or his music which hasn't been done to death.

Im not really a fan of these Anti-Pinkerton write ups I see.


Edit: Hey I noticed that it looks like you, OP, are the author. I don't mean any offense by these criticisms, the article itself is written well, but my points do still stand IMO. It was maybe a mistake posting an article which initiates by insulting the band and its listeners in a subreddit about the band, lol.",1609459309

Because *most games* tend to increase rewards as you go along, so that you can build up lower level characters easily. *Most games* allow the player to spend a little extra time to make up for their errors, so they can learn from their mistakes -- Resin effectively makes that twice as hard (you spend 40 Resin badly, it's gonna take 40 to get back to where you were + 40 to get to where you would have been).  


And I literally commented on there being nothing in-game and you replied 'there's always the subreddit'? *Really*? There's people who don't even know Reddit exist -- but they should just magically know to come here.

^(By: Victor LaValle | 431 pages | Published: 2017 | Popular Shelves: fantasy, horror, fiction, mystery, magical-realism | )[^(Search ""The Changeling"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The Changeling&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;One man‚Äôs thrilling journey through an enchanted world to find his wife, who has disappeared after seemingly committing an unforgiveable act of violence, from the award-winning author of the The Devil in Silver and Big Machine.
&gt;
&gt;Apollo Kagwa has had strange dreams that have haunted him since childhood. An antiquarian book dealer with a business called Improbabilia, he is just beginning to settle into his new life as a committed and involved father, unlike his own father who abandoned him, when his wife Emma begins acting strange. Disconnected and uninterested in their new baby boy, Emma at first seems to be exhibiting all the signs of post-partum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go far beyond that. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act‚Äîbeyond any parent‚Äôs comprehension‚Äîand vanishes, seemingly into thin air. 
&gt;
&gt;Thus begins Apollo‚Äôs odyssey through a world he only thought he understood to find a wife and child who are nothing like he‚Äôd imagined. His quest begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma‚Äôs whereabouts. Apollo then begins a journey that takes him to a forgotten island in the East River of New York City, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest in Queens where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. This dizzying tale is ultimately a story about family and the unfathomable secrets of the people we love.

Your best option is Probably Xiangling , but lvl1 amber aimed shot could solve the problem but its more difficult since with low hp, you can die easily, meanwhile xiangling just need put the guoba and swap.

The game is easy atm, so you can pretty much level any character and you still can beat almost everything.

For me, when I stopped talking to my best friend the first go around, I didn't expect her to ever think of me, and then she told me she was bawling her eyes out, wouldn't come to school, and had to get therapy. Just cause I stopped talking to her. Whenever she saw me at school, I don't think I ever caught her looking at me, so I think that's part of why I never thought she thought of me.

Then the second go around I wasn't around, not on purpose, nothing to do with her, she kept telling me she missed me, my laugh, just she was super extra clingy.

Third go around now that she has a boyfriend all now, new friends, I think it's easier for her to move on, so she probably doesn't. 

In general though she's a passive person. When we were fighting, I feel like the other people influenced her into somebody else just so she could get harsh back at me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Lack of support and funding is certainly a huge part of it.  

I believe however a big part of the mental health strain it has to do with the nature of research.  To earn a PhD your dissertation must add to the body of knowledge or contribute new ideas to a very specialized field of study.  Essentially you are trying to do or figure out something nobody has every done or figured out before.  Since nobody has ever tried to do what you are trying to do, there's absolutely no guarantee of success.  You could work your ass off in the lab or in the field, planned meticulously and despite doing everything right, you just dont get the data or the results you need.

There are some pursuits in which ""you get out what you put in"", but research is absolutely not one of them.  I have seen people put their body, heart and soul into a project for years and are barely able to publish a single paper in a low tier journal.  Meanwhile some of their peers end up doing the bare minimum and have groundbreaking projects and data just fall into their lap.

Specifically, putting stainless steel bolts in an aluminium engine head is a bad idea, because the aluminium will happily give off its electrons to the stainless steel, weakening the aluminium.

"playstation","t5_2qh6b"," I usually read that people have this type of problem with their controllers when they play a lot of FPS/TPS -- or in general they push too hard on their ‚Äúthumb sticks‚Äù when the game makes them nervous or they want ""extra"" speed in racing games. Controllers aren't fragile, but they can be pushed beyond their tolerance levels. 

I recommend re-setting the controller when an issue appears. Also, I recommend gently cleaning around all of the buttons and analog sticks with a Q-tip moistened with isopropyl alcohol for an older or heavily used controller. For analog sticks people here have suggested moving them while blowing around them or even using ""canned air"". I assume this might dislodge anything stuck in there. 

And there are those here who recommend taking the controllers apart. I don't recommend that unless you have some technical/electronic repair experience. But, that's up to you, of course.  

As controllers have a warranty, they can be returned to Sony or to the place of purchase within that period of time for an exchange, if that's necessary.",1609459314

It's ironic that ""Rule 1 etc etc"" is actually a valid piece of advice for attracting people, so to speak.

Rule 1. Be attractive, or, ""Be the best version of yourself"". Confidence is attractive, individuality is attractive. Nobody wants to date or have sex with an insecure, bitter man-child with no self-esteem and a poorly inflated ego.

Don't be unattractive, or, ""Avoid being a shitty person"". People also don't like whiny, cynical, boring, sexist, racist, internet-obsessed bimbos who expect people to just like them without putting in any effort in, like, anything.

It really all just boils down to ""Take care of yourself, love yourself, and be the best version of yourself"".",1609459317

If you really want to go the extra distance to preserve a bottle, once it gets down to half volume or so, you can begin topping it off with an inert gas, like nitrogen or argon. You can buy them in aerosol bottles similar to duster canisters. But honestly unless you know a bottle is going to sit on your shelf for years, and/or it's a special/premium bottle, I don't think that's necessary for home use.

Vermouths do have a much shorter shelf life though, due to the lower alcohol content. They begin oxidizing as soon as you break the seal. Once you open a fresh bottle, you should store it in the fridge and plan to finish it or toss it within about 6-8 weeks.",1609459319

You realize you were proposing a political approach, not the final results of that approach, right?

Your approach was taken.  The utter lack of results should indicate to you how well your plan worked.

&gt; Matryoshka model, she can do anything she wants with her body but the life inside of her has the same rights as she has.

This still strips her of all bodily autonomy.  The fact you don't understand this and try to draw a line that does not exist does not change that.

If they are separate humans, they can exist independent of each other.  That isn't the case.

Also, 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage.  What should we charge those women with?  Is that manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide?  The fetus was her responsibility and it died, so she's legally responsible.

Also, that 25% number is from *known* pregnancies.  We have no idea how many miscarriages happen within the first few weeks of pregnancy, because they appear to be just another period.  What steps do you propose we take to ensure she didn't kill a fetus?",1609459319

"news","t5_2qh3l","It is inherently more dangerous, *in some places* because of social and demographic differences. There are some safe cities, some unsafe parts of otherwise safe cities, safe countryside, unsafe countryside, and like anywhere else, a mix of areas all in between.. But ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù in these instances can be met with deadly force because guns have always been super easy to get here. My brother is super egalitarian and very liberal; almost as much as I. He bought a .45 handgun for Christmas because he lives in Philadelphia and as much as we all love Philly and its beauty and culture, it‚Äôs getting very dangerous over there.

To give you some idea, the majority of Philadelphia is still safe most of the time, but a lot is changing and it‚Äôs happening in very recent memory and it‚Äôs happening very fast. There are some parts of Philly that used to be totally safe and are getting less safe while those previously sketchy areas may now be totally unsafe. Murders are up about 36% and gun violence is up 50% [(stats)](https://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/). Commercial burglary, a primary reason for a private citizen to be approved for a concealed carry permit in the city, is up 156% in Philadelphia. In one part of the city, [Kensington](https://youtu.be/-FD7xxo5ApY), open air drug markets and public gun play is prevalent, which causes folks to carry unlicensed weapons without a permit. This can snag otherwise good people with the law and get them caught up in the system which increases their insecurity and poverty, whereas the business owner with equal fear was permitted to carry. In some parts of America, the issue rich versus poor is blinding.

Growing up where I did, a few towns away from Camden, NJ, my very liberal political views are unable to sway, even a tiny bit, my feelings about gun ownership. I don‚Äôt like guns and I don‚Äôt think they have place in a civil society. I just don‚Äôt believe I live in a civil society. I won‚Äôt ever in a million years vote for a republican (the party of gun rights) even if democrats really did want to take away everyone‚Äôs guns (they don‚Äôt). Let‚Äôs pretend that unrealistic thing happened and they wanted to take all of our guns, I would give them up and be thrilled beyond measure that the future has more hope than us.",1609459320

"Ebay","t5_2qh7g","I see all the positive things and I signed up last night after getting the message from Ebay about it. My last sale, PayPal fees were $15 and change and ebay fees will be just under 13.  (Good for lowering taxes if nothing else.)

But then, in the community, I saw sellers complaining about not getting paid. Some say they haven't been paid since they signed up months ago. They aren't able to get new merchandise or pay bills. A little scary. I haven't seen much from anyone who's doing well with the new system.

If Etsy is using the same platform, what's different that people get their cash quicker? I recently opened a couple of stores there to sell art/photography and wood crafts.

Too, I signed up for the new managed payment thing with our main joint account when I meant to sign up with the one we've decided to use for ebay and the wood craft/art ventures. And there seems to be no way to change that. If someone knows what link gets me there, I'd appreciate it! Although, someone has said he hasn't had luck in changing his bank account over to another one when he tried doing it.

As for Biden, I think he will really help to ameliorate situation in Brazil, as he will make Bolsonaro‚Äôs life tougher. He will not let Bolsonaro‚Äôs ridiculous speech to go without response, as Trump did.

Biden win in US really made me have some hope. But the amount of people that blindly support a complete idiot as Trump and Bolsonaro is huge so  it is also very unsettling .

"RogueCompany","t5_jtstv","First off. You have to play him different than any other rogue. You don't necessarily want to run and gun with him at all.

The mrx is always the better option of gun.  

You want to pick your spot and then use your tools to never be moved from that spot.  Aps system prevents grenades and other things like ronins knife or dima cluster.  Your tear gas prevents the enemy from being accurate with thier shots (this is getting buffed in next patch)  Your barb wire can prevent flanks or direct run ins

A lot of what makes trench good comes from map knowledge and after a few rounds being able to predict the enemy routes.

A perfect example would be my favorite map for Trench. Canales.... set up where the building is on the right... land go behind the road block barrier. Throw your barb in that little hallway on the right side.  Throw a tear gas grenade inside the building. And put an aps beside you

Now in the building, their aim sucks.  They can't exit the door on their left because you've got the barb wire. ( if they do, they are easy pickings. Forced to either wait out the gas or turn around to the other bomb site. 

This can allow 2 people to go to the other bomb site and rotate to you while your gadgets and abilities buy time.

If you're trying to light up the elim and downs leader board.  You're gonna be better off with literally any other rogue. (Which is why people still dont see how good he is and they also play nothing but strikeout where he doesn't really shine.)

"DabuSurvivor","t5_37gtw","I think the story of Koror is the story of a cohesive tribe brutally and mercilessly ostracizing a member one by one. Which is really just Survivor lol but the Palau post-merge is one of the best examples of it. So like from Coby being the inital outcast, to everyone laughing at Janu when she exits the Exile challenge, to Caryn being cut off at the same time on all sides, straight through to Tom getting Ian to jump off the pole the tribe just completely railroads whoever is next to go. And I think Katie's treatment at FTC is an extension of that. Koror eliminating a final member the only way they know how. Good stuff.

Tocantins on the other hand, is Tyson and Coach doing goofs and the season selling us the narrative of JT and Stephen's bromance and then all of a sudden everybody has their knives out and is like ""fuck you stephen you piece of shit!"". It doesn't follow narratively or thematically with the rest of the season and feels totally undeserved for Stephen. (Not that Katie deserved it, but the show acknowledged its own dark nature then and doesn't now or even by the time of Tocantins really).

"Herpes","t5_2r1yp","I have GHSV1. While I've only dated one person since my diagnosis, and we broke up a few months ago, I think the key is normalizing it to yourself and getting rid of that internalized stigma. It's something I'm still working on, especially as my first entrance into the dating sphere since I've gotten it, but being able to have GHSV1 not be a big deal TO YOU is going to make it less of a big deal to other people. If you present it as a big deal, people are going to worry. I got GHSV1 right before my ex and I got back together, and we didn't use condoms, no antivirals, because he didn't think it's a big deal. 

Now I have my status on my Tinder, and some people ask me questions, but I've found that a large number of people really aren't concerned about it. The worst feedback I've gotten was when I thought it was a big deal and presented it as this huge, scary, terrible thing, and people react in kind. Now I just say I have GHSV1 and the responses range from, ""I may ask you some questions if we get physical, if that's okay,"" to ""I really think the stigma for that is overblown, it doesn't bother me.""

Basically, you're going to be okay. I think work on the internalized stigma and becoming more comfortable about talking about it, and you'll be back to fun in no time :)",1609459323

You don't need an excuse to be quiet, but you probably should understand that most humans pick up on social cues such as when a person is speaking less than normal. This is typically a sign that they are uncomfortable, pre-occupied, or otherwise in some state of distress. When a friend asks why you are quiet, they are not attacking your introverted nature, they are expressing concern for what appears to be a friend who is uncomfortable.",1609459323

This is probably a boring AITA post, but this has been bugging me. So I was really hungry today and I haven‚Äôt had pizza in a long time. I didn‚Äôt want to cook so I decided to order a large pepperoni with sausage pizza and I asked them to make it well done and pie cut. I don‚Äôt like pizza without the crust, and to be honest the middle parts without the crust always tastes soggy for some reason so I always end up throwing it out or giving a bit it to my dog as a treat. So I get a call like an hour later from the pizza place saying that they had accidentally cut my pizza square cut instead of pie cut and said, That‚Äôs ok right? Or would you want us to throw it away and make you a brand new one and wait for it so you can get the pie cut?‚Äù I felt like she had brushed it off as no big deal and was going to say it‚Äôs ok, but I‚Äôd just end up throwing it out too either way so I told her that I would prefer it to be pie cut and don‚Äôt like it square cut. She stood silent for a moment and said ok than and I said thanks and we hung up. Was I TA for not accepting the pie cut pizza? I feel bad they had to throw that pizza out. 


TLDR: I ordered a pie cut pizza, they ended up calling saying they cut it square and if I didn‚Äôt want it they‚Äôd end up throwing it out. I said I prefer it pie cut because the middle square parts are always soggy and I end up throwing it out either way. I feel bad they had to throw it out.

"Hatfilms","t5_2uvqu","Or, you know, conversely, when someone doesn't do something for years and years, then suddenly starts doing that thing out of nowhere, plenty of people are going to be curious what prompted that behavior.

Nor is it even necessarily gender-biased - if a woman spent most of her adult life on camera never wearing make-up, and then suddenly started wearing make-up, plenty of people would probably wonder (without malice or judgment) what prompted the change.

It's entirely possible to be a bit *too* oversensitive - which is how a lot of people seem to be interpreting this.  Asking why someone has started doing something isn't necessarily a negative condemnation of their action, or being judgemental, or or otherwise something worthy of shitting on the person asking the question over.

Sometimes curiosity is just curiosity.  And sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

"FFVIIRemake","t5_38p8s","Yet the alternate timeline theory is just as un-falsifiable. You can hand wave away just about anything by saying ""oh that's just in an alternate universe"". You could say Biggs survived in an alternate universe or that the whole Edge of Creation scene was an alternate universe and that's not the same Cloud we play as. We could even go so far as to say that the Jenova tore open space and time to have that battle in the President office actually be taking place in some alternate universe. It's just as un-falsifiable as you're saying the possibility of it being an illusion is. 

So even if there was similar evidence provided that there's a single timeline or that these are just illusions you could equally take that evidence and just say ""that takes place in an alternate universe"".

Maybe there is 4th wall breaking, how could we know? Maybe that's the goal of the remake. Maybe the creators want to play with us in a way that is similar to Bioshock or Metal Gear, it certainly wouldn't be the first time this has happened in gaming. We may find out in one of the later parts of the remake that some of these things are 4th wall breaks and in that moment everything will click for us and make sense. Even FF has always had Gilgamesh as essentially the series Deadpool, so 4th wall humor isn't foreign to FF. 

I'm not presenting a ""good"" alternative to the multiple timelines theory because that isn't my point and ""good"" is subjective. Again, I think that's how things will go. However, I also don't think that we should be so quick to dismiss any other possibilities based on what amounts to one real piece of evidence in the enemy descriptions.",1609459324

Day 1 is ""is that a sore throat?"" or ""is this headache?"" and day 2 is ""okay, this isn't going away - I need to go get a test. As far as testing goes, in VHC and Fraser Health, turnaround time is currently same-day or next-day.

That would mean a typical timeline might be:

* Dec 24: Exposure
* Dec 25-26: No symptoms, no spread.
* Dec 27-28: No symptoms, contagious.
* Dec 29: First symptoms, contagious, no test.
* Dec 30: Symptoms continue, get test.
* Dec 31: Results + contact tracing begins

Obviously in some health regions results still take 1-2 days. Obviously symptom onset can be as many as 14 days. But the majority of people in this province have symptom onset between days 5-7 and &lt;24h turnaround for testing.

That means positive cases reported today are likely mostly the result of exposures between Dec. 23-25.",1609459326

Throwaway for reasons that will become very obvious very soon. 

For background, I've been friends with this girl since we were both in third grade (we're in college now). I feel like we've gotten to know each other really well, and even though we sort of drifted apart during high school, and then even more when moving away to college, we've still maintained solid contact. Well, we're both back in our hometown for the holidays right now, and met up for lunch yesterday. 

That was when she‚ÄìI'll call her Sarah for the purposes of this post‚Äìconfessed something to me that literally caused my jaw to drop. Long story short, she admitted that she has a sort of fetish for riding horses, becomes extremely aroused at the prospect of a horse loving her enough to bond with her and let her take control of it on its back. She also admitted to me that she's asexual‚Äìwhich now makes total sense why she never dated anyone while I was boy crazy in high school‚Äìand although she doesn't experience attraction to people and want to have sex with them, she does experience sexual *arousal,* which I guess is where the whole horse riding thing comes in. 

But anyway, she basically broke down and told me all this as we were in the car driving home, said that she'd been wanting to tell someone for a long time‚Äìapparently she's had this fetish for YEARS and kept it a total secret‚Äìand had been working up the courage to tell me since I think she trusts me the most out of all her friends. I tried to be as understanding as possible, but obviously, this shocked me to my core, and so on instinct I kind of just said the first thought that came to my mind, which was that she should consider seeking therapy for it. 

She kind of started to argue with me at that point, saying that she *likes* this fetish and that it makes her feel good, and she's only in distress over not having the money or resources to actually take up this hobby. I stood my ground and told her it wasn't normal and I was now very concerned for her and that I thought she needed to tell a doctor. This was where she became angry, and when I dropped her off at home she kind of just got out of the car without a word, and hasn't spoken to me since. 

So I'm very conflicted right now and don't know what, if anything I should say to her at this point. Is it my fault? Should I have backed off on the whole therapy thing? I think that offended her.

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","&gt;Isn‚Äôt that every superhero? They stop murders. If they were **to allow it**, it would **make them hypocrites of the highest order**

No, it wouldn't. Killing shouldn't be seen just from a moral standpoint, but also in regards to someone's capabilities. Superheroes, as the name implies possess certain abilities which afford them the possibility to stop a criminal without killing them. Superman can and should stop a criminal without lethal force. A normal cop, for example, doesn't possess the indestructability or strenght Superman has.  
It should not be condemnable for someone(aside from a superhero) to kill the Joker if her/his live is in danger and there is no other choice, especially when dealing with the Joker, arguably one of the most dangerous individuals of DC universe

The problem with Joker and so many other villains who happen to be overused is that this overuse comes at the cost of invalidating any effort made by the superhero or society to stop them without lethality. No prison can hold Joker, No treatment can rehabilitate the Joker.  Hell, even death that isn't desintegration does not stop the Joker at this point. It reaches such a level, where killing the Joker is not about avenging those he brought suffering and death, but as an desperate alternative when no other one works",1609459327

I guess there's some other aspect to it that I just can't see? Or am I genuinely meant to just shut up and work no matter how awful my life gets because of it?",1609459328

Gwen elini √ßenesine goturdu. Dusunceli bir sekilde kalkti ve duvarda asili boy aynasina bakti. Felix de arkasindan kalkti. 

Gwen aynanin karsisina gecip saclarina bakmaya basladi. Felix ise arkasindan yaklasip dirsegini yanlamasina gwenin omzuna koydu ve hafifce gwenin dengesinu etkilemeyecek sekilde yaslandi. 

Gwen: (Yok beeee. Siyah? Bana uymaz ki.) 

Felix aynanin yanina gecip duvara yaslandi gwen ile goz goze gelebilmek icin. 

Felix: (Ben sadece oneri sunarim se√ßmek sana kalmis.) 

Gwen saclarini kaldirip kaldirip indirirken: 

Gwen:(Yaaaaaaa beyaz nasil? Tam tersi hm?) 

Felix sorgulayici bir tavirla kiza bakti. Kafasini egip tek gozunu 2 saniyeligine kapatip acti. Saclarini gozune beyazlastirip hayal ettigi belli oluyordu. 

Felix: (Beyaaaaaaaaz aslina bakacak olursan neden olmasin ya? Soyle bir bakinca gercekten iyi fikir aslinda. Soyle biraz daha gumus rengine calan beyaz. Gercekten √ßok ho≈ü durabilir biliyor musun? Ama saclarini k√ºtle≈ütirmelisin bana sorarsan.) 

Gwen:(Eh ben zaten tatliyim ki.) 

Gwen saclarini tutarken sakaya vurmak icin kafasini egip saclarini kabartti. Dudagini buzup bir bacaginin sadece dizini kiracak sekilde havaya kaldirdi. Sonra yine ciddilesti. 

Felix: (Tabiki oylesin. Ayrica hem gozlerinle de uyumlu olmali. Buldum! Bak bu cok guzel olur.) 

Felix heyecanli bir bicimde gwenin arkasina ge√ßti. Saclarini tutup yariya kiviracak sekilde havaya kaldirdi. Gwen merakli gozlerle onu izliyordu. 

Felix:( Bak buradan k√ºt kestir. Sonra hepsini gumus beyazi yaptir tamam mi? En son da....) 

Aynadan felix'e bakan gwen onun halini yaptigi yemegi oven italyan a≈ücilara benzetiyordu. Sanki gwen bir yemekmis gibi ballandirarak anlatan bir tarzi vardi. Hosuna gitmemis degildi. Aksina komik bile bulmustu.
Felix: (en son da uclarini yesile boyat. Gozlerinle uyum......neye guluyorsun?) 

Gwen bir anda arkasini donup kollarini felix'in omuzlarina koyup felix'e yaslandi. Gozlerindeki erotik bakisi sezen felix hazirliksiz yakalanmisti. Gwen'in gogusleri ona baski uygularken mantikli cumleler kurmasi zorlasiyordu. 

Gwen: (Oyle bir anlattin ki adeta yaptigin yemegi ovuyorsun sanki.) 

Felix: (Bu durumda Isabella teyzeye metiyeler duzmem gerekirdi.) 

Gwen feci cuvallamisti. Felix ise ote yandan o bile bu kadar iyi flort edebilecegini tahmin etmiyordu. Gwen eliyle agzini tutup az once ona gelen sanatsal iltifati sindirmeye calisiyordu. 

Gwen: (Baya iyiydi...offfff) 

Felix kisa bir sekilde gulerek gwenin alnina opucuk kondurdu. Ancak yinede sozun etkisinde kalan gweni gerceklige geri getirememisti. Gwen'in aklinda fikir kivilcimi cakti. Hemen basini kaldirip felixe bakmaya basladi. 

Gwen: (En son bizim eve geldiginde annemin yemeklerini cok begendigini soylemistin. Tadim nasil sence?) 

Bu sefer de felix bunu beklemiyordu. 

Felix: (Tamam bunu hakkettim. Iyi oynadin!) 

Gwen kikirdedi. Felix ise bu bosluktan yaralanip gwenin koynuna yaklasti ve belinden kavradi. 

Felix: (Her ne kadar yemekleri gorunusuyle yadirgasam da ayni zamanda cok basarili bir gurme oldugumu soylemis miydim?) 

Gwen gozlerini devirdi. Her ne kadar bunlar gayet yaratici cumleler olsa da yeterince flort etmislerdi. 

Gwen: (Sadece kes sesini ve √∂p beni lanet mutant.)

Furkan sessiz sedasiz bataklik gibi kokan havuzun tentesi altinda yeterince beklediginr kanaat getirdi. Etrafina bakindi ve disari cikti. Iceri girmek yerine ilk once kapsonunu tuttu ve kafasini kapatti. Sonra cebinden telefonunu √ßikardi. Ancak sadece kilit ekranina bakmakla yetindi. Ne yapacakti ki? 

Furkan dusunurken disindan konusmayi sevmezdi. Telefonunu iki avcunun aradina sikistirip dudaklarinin uzerine koydu. Bos havuz zeminine bakarken dusunuyordu. 

Furkan: ( Ne isabella ne de ben burada daha fazla kalabiliriz. Acilen kacmamiz lazim ama nereye? Nasil?) 

Furkan bunlari dusunurken aklina bir tek kisi geliyordu. Bir anda telefonune geri sarilip kilit ekranindan direk rehbere girdi. Aradigi ismi bulup tikladi. Telefon caliyordu. 

Furkan: Jack!!! JACK! orada misin? 

Jack: Alo? Furkan? Sensin degil mi? 

Furkan: Evet dostum ancak seninle derhal konusmam gerek.
Jack: Telefonda soyleyemez misin?

"UKPersonalFinance","t5_2wkka","Yeah and then it needs to be moved from the factory to the dealership. 

If the factory isn‚Äôt in the UK that means putting it on a specialised ship called a car carrier.  These things are massive. And will probably only sail once full. 

Let‚Äôs imagine that the new car is a VW, factory is in Germany, EU. Nice and close by. Not like say a KIA which may be built in Korea. 

But first the car has to get from the factory to the port, probably by train. So it has to wait until the train is full of other shiny new cars bound for the UK. Probably this is done once a week or perhaps once every two weeks as the factory will have to switch the production to right hand drive cars for a day or two to satisfy our island nations peculiarly (within europe). 
The train is a freight train, these do not move particularly fast, so it takes 12 hours to get to the port. 

Then the cars are driven by humans off the train onto the car carrier ship. These ships are ridiculously large and carry 1000s of cars. Each car driven on by a human and then of course seafastened down so they don‚Äôt crash about into each other getting all scratched and dented when the ship is crossing the North Sea. Say it takes 24 hours to load a car carrier. 

Say it‚Äôs an 18hr sail from Amsterdam to Newcastle or wherever, then the ship needs to unload... each car on that ship driven off by a human.  That takes another 24 hours. 

Now your shiny new car is sitting on a quayside in NE England waiting for someone to put it on a car carrying lorry which happens to be going to the town that your dealership is based in. 

Say your dealership is getting a delivery of 10 cars that week and all the cars it was getting that delivery from were on that one car carrying ship and are now all sitting patiently on the quayside. Huzzah your car has been loaded onto that lorry the day of day after it was unloaded from the ship! Now the lorry will take another day to get to your dealership. 

So even if ALL the cogs in the machine are working PERFECTLY.... no delays at the factory, 
No delays at the port,
Car carrier ship doesnt capsize and sink like one did VERY recently,
Car lorry going to your town on the day your car is unloaded from the ship. 

You are still looking at a MINIMUM of a week from the car leaving the production line to you getting your hands on the keys and a wave from the sales rep as you drive off his forecourt.

"GolfClash","t5_3ioqe","My advice is, don't progress to the next tour once you complete your previous tours. You will probably be mostly outskilled and out clubbed. I am doing this for my 2nd baby account I just opened now. 

Grind out your previous tours, build up your bank and better your clubs. I have unlocked to tour 6, but I only play tour 3 and 4. While I have enough money to play 5 and 6, I don't bother. My main goal is to keep building bank and get my clubs higher level. You don't even to play the next tour to even get the clubs. As I am always unlocking chests, after 8 months playing, I have EM8, Big dawg 8, Goliath 8, most common cards maxed out. 

Also, the other day, the season free chests gave me Thors Hammer and The Amazon and I have never ever played tour 6 games. 

The most important lesson is, max out your common quicker so you can get the Prism chest. E.g. I got the Sniper from a free chest but it sat at level 1 for weeks. I finally got the Prisms chest, got alot of Sniper Cards, to the point, I went from Level 1 to Level 9 in 1 month.",1609459331

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","&gt; Second, my question is: why are some of the metrics (model complexity, error rate) only computed under the assumption that the model is wrong?

In machine learning the error rate is the ""error"" rate, because the error rate is the ratio of the number of incorrect predictions to the number of correct predictions. 

&gt; why is it so hard to compute a model complexity if the model is wrong?

To compute a model complexity is basically to compute a measure that is not equal to the original measure. In machine learning we have measures for accuracy and precision, which are not equal to each other. We have to compute the measure that is not equal to the original measure because a model that is more accurate and precise can have a larger measure of error.

I think that the problem of computing a model complexity is not really that hard, if a machine learning algorithm is wrong. But it is very hard to compute a measure that is not equal to the original measure.",1609459332

Where I grew up, women were often rated as follows:

If 2 women are walking down the street, not even facing you,

1) The light-skinned one automatically scores a 5/10.

2) The medium-to-darker toned one starts at a 0/10.

As far as savory apple recipes go, you could make apple slaw. Tropical Smoothie makes a delicious one. You can also put apples into salads; apples into butternut squash soup; apples into stuffed acorn squash. And there are some surprising savory apple recipes when you google: pizzas, tarts with onions, etc. You could also make apple sauce and freeze it to use for when you do bake something and want to use apple sauce instead of oil OR egg. I wouldn't do both; it might be too heavy. (Add 1/2 teaspoon baking powder if replacing egg.)

I wonder if pears can be used for replacements in recipes as well. Probably. salads again. There are also some delicious pear recipes I see by googling. I'm going to try savory baked pears.

Nowadays if someone is looking for a super basic website they would probably use WIX or a similar service to spin up a quick site.  In order to make money coding front end many places will expect you to know how to work with version control, tooling (git , gulp, NPM, etc,), TypeScript, and frameworks such as REACT or Angular etc.


I am not saying this to deter you from doing Front End Dev work, just trying to set realistic expectations on what employers would expect.  If you know these technologies a consulting firm could charge up to $200 - $380  an hour for your services.  I do this type of work for a living and hope more people get into this line of work.

"disability","t5_2qhe8","I don‚Äôt have your exact condition, but I‚Äôm a neighbor ;). My surgeon described your surgery to me as I have a fair amount of rotation that caused me femoral acetabular impingement. I was in constant pain and limping starting around 26 after I tore both labrums just by stepping off a curb (about 6 months apart, the second one was leaving physical therapy for the first one). 

I ended up having both hip surgeries done about 6 weeks apart. In my case my surgeon chipped bone off the femur and hip to make a little more room for everything. Unfortunately for me this was early days in the surgery and he was very conservative so I only got back about 60% of my preinjury range of motion. No more motorcycling for me, ouch. He‚Äôs offered to go back in and take more off but I have fibromyalgia now and don‚Äôt want to go through that level of stress. 

Good luck in finding your group of fellow spoonies! They are harder to find at your age but we are out there. I‚Äôve been very open about my chronic pain for the past 18 years and there are a lot more people suffering in silence then I ever realized.",1609459335

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","&gt; \[...\] some are Micron but not Crucial.

That's because Micron is the DRAM manufacturer; Crucial is the memory vendor.

There's only three major DRAM manufacturers: Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung (there are others, but only with a really small market share). Crucial gets the DRAM chips from these vendors and uses them to produce their own DIMMs. Depending on which kit you buy, you will end up with DRAM chips from different DRAM manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I read something about dual/quad channel memory \[...\]

What CPU are you using? Some LGA2066 CPUs only have two memory channels, some have four. You'll want as many DIMMs as your CPU has memory channels, or twice that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; At that time would I need to replace all of the 16GB DIMMs with 32GB ones? \[...\]  I heard that it is bad to use sticks from different kits \[...\]

It is indeed not advisable to use DIMMs from different kits. Memory vendors sometimes change ICs at some point during the manufacturing period, which can potentially cause stability/compatibility issues, although this is admittedly really rare.

You also wouldn't necessarily need to replace *all* DIMMs. By expanding to 8x16GB DIMMs you could also get up to 128GB RAM, but this could theoretically, as aforementioned, cause some issues.",1609459335

"Astronomy","t5_2qhor","There are 3 primary concerns when placing an observatory: altitude, humidity, and clear skies. 

You want a telescope at high altitudes to get it above as much atmosphere as possible, as the atmosphere absorbs some of the light astronomers want to observe.

You want a very dry location as water vapor is actually one of the primary atmospheric absorbers mentioned above.

And of course, if there are clouds then you can't see anything.

Chile, and particularly the Atacama Desert, perfectly hits all 3 of these points, something extremely rare on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

74th Infantry Detachment Is a Unit that in which the leaders over time have found the perfect balance between serous Milsim but still hold the fun moments in the video game. You can of course expect a environment where you can settle down and enjoy playing with a good group of people whether it be in operations or in other games.

&amp;#x200B;

We consist of two elements:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Our main force, the 74th Infantry Detachment LRRP/Bravo Company, Consists of 1 platoon with three teams. Members in Bravo Company are responsible for operating independently behind enemy lines performing unconventional special operations, in support of conventional warfare.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Our Air Detachment, Casper Platoon/173rd Airborne Brigade, Consists of a select few of specialized people in the unit who operate the many Rotary and Fixed Wing assets available to us. Members in Casper Platoon can expect to provide the main force with Close Air Support, Transportation, medical evacuation, and logistical support.

&amp;#x200B;

What we offer:

&amp;#x200B;

\-A Dedicated A3 Server and TS3 Server that is up 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Steady operation schedule on Fridays and Sundays at 20:00 EST .

&amp;#x200B;

\-You need to attend at least one operation a week, Exceptions like work and school can and will be made \[Life can be Hard\].

&amp;#x200B;

\-Not only a unit but also a community to chill and play games with.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Custom made/Zeus operations and a Hand picked mod pack.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Staff personnel that keep up to date with Missions, Mod packs, Promotions, and other administrative tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in!

&amp;#x200B;

Our main way of recruiting is through our discord where upon joining we will take any and all questions you want unit related. After that we will just need to go through a basic interview in our TeamSpeak then a Basic Training \[10-20 mins\] to see what you can do and know.

It really doesn't matter if you think men are benefitting from it more, it's still never okay to try to pressure someone into conforming to a stereotype based on their category of gender/race/whatever.

If you think men are strictly beneficiaries of sexism then you are *not* really a feminist, you clearly just resent men for the privileges they have while ignoring the very apparent negatives of male gender stereotypes (e.g. boys are often denigrated for showing normal human emotions), and you are letting your bias show. Same goes for race. You are dragging us into a useless debate about who has it worse that does nothing but divide women and men. Even if women do have it worse on the whole, gender stereotypes are *obviously* not good for anyone, and you are a fool if you deny that.",1609459338

You seem to forget that there is a second package as well and I don't have one of those baby wraps that could fit an 18 x 18 x 18 box.

"Buttcoin","t5_2sngy","I certainly don't think Bitcoin is a currency, since transaction costs are quite high right now and will get higher when more people start using it. Lightning might work in the future, but then you have to send a transaction on the main network if you want to open your own LN channel (otherwise you would just be trusting someone else which goes against the btc principles).

Bitcoin is basically just a secure database with scarce numbers on the internet, so a digital commodity. The common argument here is that numbers are not worth anything because my excel file has numbers too and it's worth jack shit, and scarcity doesn't matter because my shit is scarce too, but it's not worth anything. But that fails to take into consideration the fact that if we all collectively think of something as valuable, then that thing is valuable. Gold is basically a shiny rock, but since everyone thinks it looks cool, it's worth way more than what it would be worth if it were just used industrially. Similarly, bitcoin is just a bunch of numbers in a database, but many people agree that those numbers are worth something so that's why it's valuable. If everyone woke up tomorrow and thought bitcoin is stupid, bitcoin would be worth $50. It would still retain some use, but that use would not justify the current price. Similarly, if everyone woke up tomorrow and thought gold was stupid, it's price might be $50 instead of $2000. You might think it's stupid to value numbers so highly, but then again rich people pay millions for shiny yellow metal bricks and paint splattered on a piece of paper.",1609459339

"blackopscoldwar","t5_2abod4","Yes in the movie War Games (1983), David is using a wardialing program to call every numbers in Sunnyvale to find a Protovision terminal's phone number. But those kind of programs already existed before the movie, they were called: Modem scanners, serial dialers, demon dialer... etc.

After that movie they became very popular, I even remember one actually named War Game Dialer (for the Commodore 64).

Then lots of hacking, phone phreaking utilities started to appear with the 'war' prefix. And although the term 'warez' supposedly comes from 'soft**ware**'. I've always suspected that it was actually because of that.

As for TTone, it has a Bluebox tone generator, we would use those to make long distance calls for free. Very useful when you wanted to exchange games on different BBS located far or in  other countries even over sea, without any trace on Dad's phone bill :)

But to get to the point, I, also thought about trying the detected carriers list from the movie, but none of them works. The 2 first numbers started by 399, 1st was a bank and 2nd was some airline or travel agency for booking flights. Then we don't see witch one in the list he selects to actually connects to NORAD, but I assumed it was the third number: (311) 437-8739. I scanned 311-437-0000 up to 0880 without any positive results...

List from detected carriers in War Games:

(funny fact, I spotted a mistake they made: the results aren't in order as they should)

[https://imgur.com/WgaR3WD](https://imgur.com/WgaR3WD)

I guess that if someone want's to go that way, it would probably be worth a try using the real Sunnyvale area code in the 80's (408) instead of the fake (311)

And by the way here's some original Activision's phone number back in the 1980's:

(1980) 759 E. Evelyn Ave., Sunnyvale:   (408)-245-5421

(1983) 2350 Bayshore Frontage Rd, Mountain View: (415)-960-0410

in 1983 there was also a game hotline:  (800) -633-GAME, and for local calls:  (415) 940-6044/5

other Activision phone numbers from the 80's that I know of:

(415)-327-4112 (Diane Drosnes, public relation)

(800)-227-9757 (Info line about the different Game Clubs)

Finally, today's Activision phone number (2020):  (310)-255-2000

&amp;#x200B;

In the Moscow map there's a bunch of Wanted posters with the phone number:

344-900-5962 (worth the try I guess since its an actual a valid phone number within the game)

&amp;#x200B;

Happy hacking :)

The article on USB-C-only docks [here](https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/) explains it in more detail, but you would need a different dock that supports 4 lanes for video + USB2 (not USB3) to make it work via a single cable (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B0746NKVBN)).

The easiest solution since you already own Lenovo 40AS (and buying another dock with 4 lanes for video + USB2 is wasteful) - connect 2nd monitor via https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-USB-DisplayPort-Adapter/dp/B07F17ZHJY into 2nd USB-C port (or USB-C to DP cable, or HDMI1.4 port on the laptop; if using laptop's HDMI - try both USB-C ports for the dock, one of the ports may lose video signal when the HDMI port is used).",1609459340

Second, I think it is a bit wrong to assume that the ML algorithms are built with the goal to calculate the metric that is closest to the actual distribution. The ML algorithms are designed with the goal of finding new distributions in the data. Because they cannot find them without some help from the data, they will always find the best distribution.

In order to calculate the metric if the data distribution is not there, we can use some statistical model. It doesn't matter what the ML algorithm does, it is only the metric that counts for this.

Keep in mind, the original Tsukihime is...dated. Beyond dated. Not only in terms of art and music production, but even in Nasu's general writing, which has come *a long way* from Tsukihime's more...errr...edgy origins. A big thing people are excited about in terms of Remake is seeing those elements  get refined for a far better experience. If the Remake is good, it should completely replace the original. 

In terms of similarities between Tsukihime and Fate, there are some general character concepts that he reuses, but it's probably more similar to Kara no Kyoukai in terms of tone and worldbuilding, if you've watched that movie series.",1609459342

I know other girls are more comfortable with sending nudes though, so it varies from person to person. As for expecting a nude back, again I think it depends on the person. I've only had one bf and we talk a lot about our expectations with sex, including sexting so he knows I'm fine with not receiving a nude back every time I send one. I think most girls (but again, I'm not sure) would be fine if you just replied with a good compliment. If you want to send one back (which you are in no means obligated to since it's your body and you decide if that's something you're comfortable with) then you can simply ask the girl if she would like one of you.

Also, the ""girls don't like receiving nudes"" thing I'm pretty sure has to do with unsolicited nudes. No girl wants to see an unsolicited dick pic, but if you're sexting it's possible she would enjoy a nude (if she's okay with receiving one. Consent is key)",1609459345

He had profound views on environmental protection and believed in the corporate death penalty for polluters for example. Goldwater also didn't believe liberals and conservatives were enemies and resented the idea that liberals were the enemy, feeling that proper governance needed the 2 counter balances. He also hated the religious right with a passion as great as any liberal, was staunchly pro-choice, and vocally opposed Don't Ask Don't Tell. Near the end, social conservatives loathed him.

They would never recognize me again. It was so hard, and I can/will never forget them. I will always love them. But I didn't cry when either passed. I was already emotionally drained by the whole experience.

It's not your fault, there's nothing to feel guilty about. Everybody grieves in their own way, and even you don't get to make that choice. Don't beat yourself up for not having the 'proper' reaction. You are clearly grieving your loss.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","&gt;He changed the immigration policy stopping Africans from leaving their mismanaged countries for greener pastures. Together with the famous ‚Äòshithole‚Äô comment, triggered the anti-Trump discourse among bloody African thieves disguised as political leaders.
In fact President Trump‚Äôs shithole comment was an understatement of the real African tragedy. Africa is a place where political power is used to promote bigotry, nepotism, tribalism, and corruption. It is also used to cause religious and ethnic wars. Nigeria for example is an abattoir for Christians and Indigenous people in the hands of Fulani powered terror groups. As if it is not enough, Africa is where people die from poverty in the midst of plenty. When basic amenities like electricity and housing are luxury, and infrastructure nonexistent, it is a shithole place. What do we say about thousands that die on the Mediterranean and deserts trying to flee poverty, dictatorships and war?
Our leaders are just interested in staying in office without achieving anything. Look at Uganda‚Äôs three decades dictator, President Yoweri Museveni who has been making headlines all for his brutality against dissent. Given Africa‚Äôs failed politics, government thieving, dictatorship, accepted poverty and brain drain, Trump‚Äôs statement is a wakeup call for idiotic leaders in the continent.


The funny thing that most advocates of open borders don't like talking about is how allowing mass immigration is essentially an explicit endorsement of brutal dictators.",1609459346

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","This is an example of an algorithm that is used in the paper, ""Deep learning in data science""

""Deep learning in data science is an attempt to tackle the problem of machine learning by developing a framework that allows machine learning algorithms to be embedded in a deep learning framework. The idea is that machine learning algorithms can be easily combined, and with the use of these two frameworks, they can be combined with other machine learning algorithms, and the results of these algorithms can be used in data science. This combined model can also be used to develop new algorithms. One example of machine learning algorithm is a deep neural network. The idea of deep learning is similar to the notion of ""deep learning"" in machine learning, where the idea is to combine different machine learning algorithms through the use of deep neural networks. The deep learning framework allows machine learning algorithms not only to interact with each other, but also interact with each other and with the deep learning framework. A machine learning algorithm can be combined with deep learning algorithms, which can then be combined with any machine learning algorithm, and the resulting combination can be used in data science. In deep learning, one can use machine learning algorithms that can be applied to many different problems, which will allow machine learning algorithms to be applied in many different problems. There are many machine learning algorithms that can be applied to various problems, and there are many machine learning algorithms that can be combined with machine learning algorithms, which are called ""deep learning"". The results of deep learning can also be applied in data science. For example, deep learning is used in data science by combining machine learning algorithms which are used to perform machine learning algorithms"".",1609459346

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","Now this could be me, but I highly doubt some tight bands actually restrict blood flow that seems to be poor naming of what is actually happening as I understand it and I maybe incorrect in my understanding.  But my understanding is the BFR is actually 'Blood Flow Constriction' as blood is not actually restricted from moving throughout the muscle belly like a tourniquet kept on to long would and end up with the trainee losing a limb, unless someone can tell me it actually restricts blood flow in reality.  And if that is not the case BFR is simply muscle belly sleeves or muscle belly belts that apply some level of pressure and as such require the muscle to contract harder as the muscle belly needs to pushe against the material and the material applies some amount of slight resistance that must be overcome.  Can someone who sciences clarify?  If that is the case I want a full body suit to work out in, less restrictive than powerlifting gear but something increases user stability by increasing our skin Xmm's larger with stronger contraction.

Also, you completely ignore the huge percentage of people who survive but then have lasting complications. Why is it acceptable to you for millions of people to have organ scarring, brain fog, or any other number of symptoms? Just because they ""survived""? Because you want the imaginary numbers to stay up?

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Yeah I think this scene was a meta commentary on the use of silencers in action movies. The whole point of John Wick is that the gun battles are 'realistic' in the sense that no movie-magic is happening. John constantly has to reload, account for the down-time and scavenge new guns from fallen foes so the bullet-math checks out, which is rarely the case in movies. So for them to get silencers so absurdly wrong is more of a wink to the audience who have got to be in on the joke by now.

350 member worlds, even with an absurdly strict definition of ""member"" that doesn't count long-established offshoot colonies or pre-membership conquests as separate worlds for some horrible reason, is an egregiously tiny drop in the bucket for a galaxy spanning empire. The Milky Way has somewhere between 100,000,000,000 and 400,000,000,000 stars, and the Federation had ~150 member worlds at the turn of the 25th century. Peaking at 350 suggests shockingly slow growth over the next 700 years, covering a minuscule percentage of the Galaxy's habitable worlds.

And if you're using MS SQL then do yourself a favor and buy a SQL Prompt license from redgate. Seriously if my employer didn't pay for mine I would. The snippets alone are worth it but the good intelisense and configurable formatting rules make it a godsend. Need to work on a query? Set up  `tcr` to insert

    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRAN

            $CURSOR$

        ROLLBACK TRAN

Being able to tab-complete table names when writing a SELECT and having it correctly provide good alias names AND allow for tab completion of joins based on the existing FK relationships... honestly the difference between with and without SQL Prompt is like trying to write C# in notpead++ vs in Visual Studio. Sure you _can_ do it, but why would you put yourself through that torture? It's one of the few licensed products I will shamelessly shill to anyone willing to listen.

"196","t5_2v92f","&gt; Oh and to make it clear when I said death attributed to capitalistic premisses, I didn't count work accidents, I wouldn't count those for socialistic ideas so it's only fair.

If we're going to throw the ussr and Maoist china as examples of socialism though we'd need to add modern China (arguably state capitalist) and britain (through deprivation (i.e. taking resources from India), it's been estimated by some that they killed over 1 billion indians) and the usa (40000 preventable deaths a year from preventable medical conditions alone).

It seemed appropriate when talking about lassez faire capitalism to mention regulation as profit motive incentivizes unsafe work practices if they're more efficient.




The shortcoming of the Austrian school were talked about in my textbooks in econ 1 and 2, but the gist is that they don't really use math or statistical analysis.

A search turns up ""The research programs of Austrian economics"" as a good example, I'm able to access it through my university but I'm not sure if you'll find it for free.

I know Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman have both critiqued the Austrian school as well (the former being a very accessible and influential economist and nobel laureate and the latter being arguably one of the most influential opponents of Keynesian economics as well as one of the most often cited by conservatives).



&gt; And also, what caused the change between modern and original Austrian school?

More a lack of change. In the last 50 or so years economics has become a lot more rigorous, incorporating mathematical and statistical modeling into their theories. 

Before that, other theories were just working better and building off of what the Austrian school did right while rejecting what it did wrong


&gt; Also, what kind of things have the Keynesian theory refuted from the Austrian school?

I'm going to oversimplify to a significant degree, but we're talking about over a century of theory. The Austrian school broadly rejects government intervention in the market, to varying degrees it blames this for worsening economic boom and bust cycles. Keynesian economists broadly advocate for certain government interventions, using policy and price controls.

Even more broadly Austrian school economists have been criticized for rejecting macroeconomics almost wholesale while Keynesians deal heavily with macroeconomics.

Modern orthodox economics leans significantly more in favour of Keynesians with broad support of modeling.",1609459351

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","I didn't say you were to the right economically. I said Social Liberalism was a form of capitalism and, not having 100% clear idea of what civil libertarianism is about, I imagine it's somewhat similar but maybe more Libertarian. Capitalism is not inherently far right, and I never accused you of being right of center, although obviously you're more right than me, if that's what you meant.

And that's if you assume that capitalism is not an inherently un-free system (like many would say fascism or feudalism are), then you're correct, but many people would disagree with the 'freedom' that capitalism offers being a false freedom. As I mentioned before the idea that the existence of private property is actually anti-freedom for it limits what the people who don't own that property (aka 99.9%+ of society) and worker exploitation, but I'm not going there right now because I do not have the time or mood for it and it's been discussed ad nauseum in here.

Also, just to clarify, Co-ops are not communism, they're closer to socialism, but the issue with making co-ops in a capitalist system is that competition pushes for the exclusive success of profitable businesses, and as traditional businesses are far more 'ruthless' in their pursuit of profit, compared to worker co-ops who are ran for the betterment of workers, worker co-ops are always outcompeted in terms of making money. So while yes, you can theoretically have a 'socialist business' in a capitalist economy, due to how they are ran it's a very uphill battle for such a business to succeed against traditional businesses.

What I did ask, and you may not have noticed so I'll reiterate, is what system do you *personally* want in *your* society? What system do you want to live under? I've mentioned I'm fine with other societies going by capitalism, even anarcho-capitalism, but I don't want to live in an ancap society. You also clearly don't want to live in an anarcho-communist society, even though you also respect their right to exist. 

So I ask again, what society do *you* want to live on? Is it not a system with private property (non-communist) with privately owned means of production (non-socialists), a free market (non-state-capitalist), where production is ran for profit (non-utopic), there are voluntary transactions between people and (relatively) low state interference in such transactions?",1609459353
"GuardianTales","t5_2gj2tg","I personally have been waiting for one, but none have come out. I think the red one is honestly pretty bad. It's just a re-color, and it takes away the glow from his 5* look. Definitely not worth the price of 1200, so I never bought it and never will.

I was thinking they could do like a reference to ""gamer"" peripherals and how for it to be a ""gaming"" item it need to have RGB; and with this idea make an Neon RGB Oghma. I think this would look pretty sick. Seeing Oghma glowing with the RGB hue in contrast with his black armor.

What's happening is that the actual countdown time is probably getting set to some ridiculous number like 10 minutes. but you see a maximum of 1 minute countdown timer so every time u reset the counter it just goes to its max because you still have like 9 minutes 10 secs left in reality. who knows what the real number is i only use 10 minutes because back when customs was one of the few only maps and there weren't as many extracts this this was causing ppl issues so they made is so that you could not go awol if you were inside an extract and you just had to wait it out sometimes. im not sure if this is still the case because any time i identify a bugged extract now i just boogy on to another. happens most at ruaf, car extract and old gas and really only on customs in my experience.",1609459354

In the worst case, people who *could* enjoy the game on its intended difficulty might turn this mode on to get past a tough fight, cheating them out of a great experience. This is the usual argument against adding such a thing to Dark Souls, for example.

That said... I agree with you, and there are ways to do it better than *just* invincibility. [Celeste does a great job here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NInNVEHj_G4) -- when you turn Assist Mode on for the first time, it says:

&gt; Assist Mode allows you to modify the game's rules to reduce its difficulty. This includes options such as slowing the game speed, granting yourself invincibility or infinite stamina, and skipping chapters entirely.

&gt; Celeste was designed to be a challenging, but accessible game. We believe that its difficulty is essential to the experience. We recommend playing without Assist Mode your first time.

&gt; However, we understand that every player is different. If Celeste is inaccessible to you due to its difficulty, we hope that Assist Mode will allow you to still enjoy it.

*Then* it asks whether you want to turn it on. Perfect: There's no confusion about how the game is intended to be played, but there's no judgment for players who need a little help.

Interestingly, while I hear plenty of Dark Souls fans rail against any possibility of an easy mode, I never hear ever the most hardcore Celeste fans complain that it has an assist mode.",1609459355

Furkan: Sana ne kadar tesekkur etsem az. Orada gorusuruz! 

Furkan telefonu kapattigi gibi akilli cami dizine vurdu. 3 5 defa ters cevirip telefonu 2 ye ayrincaya kadar ugrasti. Sonra telefonu 2 parca halinde cebine geri sokup kosmaya basladi. 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Ikiside kendini tamamen kaptirmisti. Bilin√ßli ≈üekilde hareket ettiklerini soylemek zordu. Ozellikle gwen felix'in uzerinde felix'i agzi ile bogmaya calisirken. Bir anligina gwen garip bir seyler hissetti. Kendisi cogunlukla odadaki elektronik cihazlarin sinyalini hissedebiliyordu. Ancak bir gariplik vardi. Sanki odada sinyal yayan baska bir cihaz daha vardi. Gwen bir anda dudaklarini geri √ßekti. 

Felix saskin gozlerle gwene bakiyordu. Gwen ise ilk once derin bir nefes aldi. Sonra ciddi bir ifadeyle felix'e sorusunu sordu. 

Gwen: ( Telefonun nerde?) 

Felix: (....√áan-tamda.....da niye? Bu ani mi kaydetmek istiyorsun?) 

Gwen: (Ya hayir sadece.) 

Gwen dogruldu. Felix te gwenin dogrulmasiyla beraber dirseklerini yataga dayadi ve kendisini dogrulttu. Gwen kafasi karismis bir sekilde etrafina bakiyordu. Ellerini acti ve saymaya ba≈üladi. 

Gwen: (Benim telefon, felix'inki, felix'in kol saatiiiii sonra baska?) 

Felix etrafina arastirir gozlerle bakti. Ne oldugundan bir haberi yoktu. Gwenin tam olarak aklindan ne gectigini de okumak zordu. Dusunceler birinin aklindan cok hizlu ge√ßerkeb o bilgi seline ayak uydurmak √ßok zor olurdu. 

Felix: (Noldu ya? Sadece saatim ve telefonum var iste.) 

Gwen: (odada ekstra bir cihaz var.) 

Felix: (Ne? Nerde? Nasil?) 

Gwen bu sefer ayaga kalkti. Kendi √ßevresinden birka√ß tur atti. Sonra √ßekmeceye dogru yoneldi. Ellerini kitaplarin arasinda gezindirirken bir anda kafasini yukari √ßevirip kitapligin tepesindeki kaktus saksina dik dik bakmaya basladi. 

Gwen: (Sinyal buradan geliyor felix su sandalyeyi uzatsana) 

Felix heyecanli bir sekilde yataktan firlayip sandalyeyi gwene dogru surukledi. Kiz bacagini uzerine atip dizinden kendini bastirirak ustune cikti. Ve onu buldu. 

Gwen: (Bin...... Ama bu ≈üeyindi?) 

Felix: (Kim? Angelica?!) 

Gwen: (Evet bu on.....un....) 

Gwen kamerayi elinde √ßevirirken bir anda aklindan ge√ßen ku√ßuk sebep sonuc ili≈ükisi onu deliye dondurdu. 

Gwen: BUNUN SENIN ODANDA NE ISI VAR?! 

Felix bu ani tepkiyi beklemiyordu. Hemen avuclarini gwene dogrh cevirip hizli bir sekildr konusmaya basladi. 

Felix: gwen sana yemin ederim elindeki kamerayi ilk defa goruyorum. Inanmiyorsan kendin bak. 

Felix aklini berraklastirdi. Gwen girip baktigindan az onceki olaydan kalmis sapik√ßa fikirlerden ve felix'in ani tepkiden gelistirdigi panikten baska bir sey bulamadi. 

Gwen: (O ka≈üar bunu odana gizlice koymu≈ü. Demi?) 

Felix: (o kamerayi ilk kez goruyorum ve dedigin gibi evet buyuk ihtimal angelica koymus tabi eger kamera onunsa.) 

Gwen ciddiyet ile sivanmi≈ü ofkeli suratini √ßevirip sinirli adimlarla kapiya yurudu. Kapiyi eliyle savurarak a√ßip koridorda seri adimlarla kendi odasina yoneldi. 

Felix: (GWEN DUR BI DAKIKA SAKIN OL!) 

Felix tam gwenin arkasindan kosacakti ki ayak bileginin yonunu aniden degisitirip yatagin kenarindaki kaskini aldi ve ba≈üina gecirdi. Sonra tam gaz kapidan di≈üari cikti. Koridorda kosmaya basladiginda gwen coktan odasinin kapisini a√ßmak icin kolunu uzatmisti. 

Gwen iceri daldi. Elinde kamerayi kiracak kadar sƒ±kƒ± tutarken I√ßerde sadece bilgeyi gordu. Olabildigi kadar duz bir sekilde: 

Gwen: (Angelica nerde?) 

Bilge: (Angelica tuvalette ama napacaksin ki onu?) 

Gwen: (pi≈üman edecegim) 

Gwen tam tuvaletin kapisini a√ßmak i√ßin kola egiliyordu ki angelica kapiyi a√ßti. 

Angelica: (ya ne ol...........) 

Angelica gwenin elindeki kamerayi gorunce surati kire√ß gibi bembeyaz kesildi. 

Angelica: (onu.....b-ben)
Gwen: SEN NE YAPTIGINI SANIYORSUN? FELIX'I MI KULLANACAKSIN O VIDEO KAYDIYLA? AMACIN NE DELIRTME BENI!!!! 

Angelica'nin korkudan bacaklari tirriyordu. 

Angelica: Gwen....b-b-b-b....... 

Felix o anda kapida belirdi. Gweni angelicayi sanki oldurcekmis gibu bakarken buldu. Hemen arkasindan sarilip kendine √ßekti. Sakinlestirmek i√ßin duygularini yatistirmaya karar verdi. 

Gwen felix onu geri √ßekerken hala keskin gozleriyle angelicaya bakiyordu. O anda icine dolan sakinlestirici duyguyu hissetti. Ve a≈üiri rahatsiz oldu. Ofkenin getirdigi adrenalinin bir anda damarlarinda i≈ülevsiz kalmasi kadar havada birakan bir duygu yoktu. Hemen felix'in kollari ittirdi.",1609459356
"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","&gt; You always have the option of giving it right back to the government: https://fiscal.treasury.gov/public/gifts-to-government.html

I've been of the opinion that this option really only exists as a result of a rather-savvy political move by the right in the 1990s (I believe that's when the box was added).  When your opponents argue for higher taxes, you can point to their tax returns and that they *could* pay the higher rates they're asking for without having to actually make law changes for the rest of us to do so.  And frequently they're *not* choosing to pay the amounts they seem to think they should be.",1609459356

They used it in a weaponized way to make those who drank it docile, weak willed, and to decrease overall intelligence. This gave the nazis more control over the population because of how it calmed them. When used in high enough amounts some people were sterilized by the fluoride. 

Today we are told that fluoride in the water is to assist in good oral hygiene... however I would highly recommend anyone interested in their own well-being to research it for yourself to see what the independent (non-pharma) scientists have discovered about fluoride in the water, especially in the past decade.",1609459356

Things you can do:

- Use _stable_ versions of Minecraft with third party performance enhancements available.
- [Use Paper](https://papermc.io/) a drop in replacement for Spigot/Vanilla Minecraft or use [Lithium](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium) for Fabric servers.
- Use [Aikars Flags](https://mcflags.emc.gs/).
- Follow (if applicable) [this settings guide for Paper](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=a2f1c67702ad6d1ca253c24379e2843368b168a7-1591495766-0-Af3MWxefwjMXUJgUHuuFhah_9vf7vHr7GU1AZEdVtlfTwlNCkwyU7nkw6olMNOjs0r6Gly2_pGjZW1xXthZFWyCW_1ITebyJbEXGpXc9wTjmHKUKhnFCqEq3IlVwDuxb8aXE_Dyehi-NjRzrT7bq6trUC2wKYunNmP-UQf2KbRGarp9br8hL-QMnsS4wSDXDFXXuJPS6vmPsQJdkpp87o3D-Bv4Mvqm0HVZSJSPziCF11x6THFxuRWWB-kWnM4seaXm_SiAT6Cvx_1URObqSzSXPS0-lIV7E_MIdrK_n_PPeb1dyeBzUfyWdJPrbtnvPGgkoyQY-pQ9CzXKg7BFhBhk).
- Use the [CPU with the fastest individual cores you can find/afford.](https://disconsented.com/posts/hardware-is-hard/) Which means to avoid old CPUs.
- [Understand that CPU usage is not a accurate metric.](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-05-09/cpu-utilization-is-wrong.html)
- Put the world on an SSD to avoid stalling threads waiting on the world to load/save.
- Pregenerate the world.
- Reduce your view-distance in server.properties and make use of Paper's `no-tick-view-distance` in `paper.yml`.
- Reduce the amount of loaded entities with `per-player-mob-spawns` in `paper.yml`.

In order to help us diagnose the issue please:

- Take a timings report showing the issue:
  - Type `/timings on`.
  - Wait at least 10 minutes.
  - Type `/timings paste` and provide the link here.
- List the CPU model (I.E. Intel 9900k or Ryzen 3950x, not ""Ryzen"", ""Xeon"" or ""i7"").",1609459357

People often mix these up or combine them into one rule. 

For example if you've already had two promos recently on your account, you wouldn't be eligible even if the number you are porting in has been off the at&amp;t network for years. And vice versa if it's a new account you are eligible for promos regardless of the minimum amount of time you were off at&amp;t, all the number have to do is come back to a different network other than at&amp;t (or mvno) when they look it up at time of order, they don't care if it was recently ported away from at&amp;t.

"OurPresident","t5_3hhj5","As a foreigner it seems to be that your healthcare is a giant rort. Free markets should allow for competition and relatively affordable healthcare, most of the cost being labor. We have, here in Australia, what you're proposing and it works well. I make enough money to have private insurance and only do it so I'm not a burden on the system. It costs me about $1200 per year for top cover, about $800usd. Not a huge amount of money and means I get a private room and no wait for operations. However having experienced both, the public system is just as good if not better than the smaller private hospitals. 

The benefit isn't just survival, and if you don't think your neighbour deserves to live for the sake of 1% of your income then you shouldn't participate in society, but also the anxiety around survival. Feeling helpless has a psychological effect. If I was down and out, had a bout of shocking depression and couldn't get my money together, I know that my community is going to at least give me enough to eat and tend to my body if there's an issue, so that when I come good I'll be able to contribute fully as we all generally want to do.",1609459358

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","**edit: To Democrats of reddit, skip directly to the 3rd paragraph to avoid being upset.** I'm not trying to get 1000 downvotes for simply telling you how Washington works.

Hes saying Nancy's $2000 version of the plan only helps the wealthy. While his $2000 version of the plan better helps all americans. Their bills are different, and while Nancy had the leverage advantage for 10months, now the leverage has shifted to favor Mitch. The reality is either they pass his version of our $2000 check, or Joe gets to inherit a government shutdown. So he has them over a barrel, the same way Nancy had them over a barrel for most of the year.

Months ago, the Republicans covid relief had covid relief, plus things republicans liked, like bailout money for the airline industry. While the democrats' bill had covid relief, plus things democrats liked, like unemployment benefits. The republicans faulted the Democrats' bill for incentivizing unemployment, while the democrats faulted the Republicans' bill for giving too much money to corporations. Nancy had more leverage then, because not passing the democrats' version made Trump look bad in an election year because Americans desperately needed the money. Either give the democrats what they want, or everyone suffers. So she rejected the Republican's bill, and held out thinking the republicans would cave and sign her bill. They didn't.

Now, the Republicans covid relief 2k has covid relief, plus things republicans like, like 230 reform. While the democrats' 2k bill has covid relief, plus things democrats like, like 10 million to Pakistan for gender studies. Mitch has more leverage, because not passing the Republican's version means the appropriations bill our relief is tied in to will trigger a government shutdown if it is not signed off on in time for Joe to inherit. Either give the republicans what they want, or everyone suffers. So Mitch rejected the Democrats' 2k bill, and will hold out thinking the democrats will cave and sign his bill. They probably won't, we'll see.

Who's to blame? Depends on your party. If you're a democrat, blame Mitch. If you're a republican, blame Nancy. 

Who's really to blame? Ourselves. We elect staunch politicians and then suffer from their staunchness. We rely on the government, and then suffer when they don't give us things. We give the government power over our lives, then suffer when they go too far.",1609459358

And an active shooter/bomb threat type case?  That's the rare case that you've been training for, where it's your job to know what's going on, where your guys are, get as much info as possible about where the baddy is and any possible victims. It's drummed into dispatch, even, we are the people whose job it is to respond, stop the baddy, and do all we can for the victims.

Hell, when I worked at the Sheriff's office, and a young teen went missing, we had dogs, cell phone pings, and called in a helicopter to take off and come look.  That was a crazy day on 2.  Turned out to just be a kid who took off on foot for whatever reason.  But in the moment you work with the info you have, and if that info says it may be worst case, you treat it as worst case.

I can see why she'd learn more at daycare than K - I think most daycares focus more on life skills and learning skills than rote knowledge like what most kindergartens develop kids for. They get more variety of experience, activities, etc in most daycares in my experience. Especially kids that are above average in terms of learning ability, since with daycare they don't get stuck bored being taught at an average pace with the group of students that learn at the average pace. As a child with above-average learning abilities school becomes less and less rewarding when you're sitting around waiting for everyone else to finish their work 80% of the time, which can end up instilling pretty poor work ethic, low tolerance for frustration and a ""can't do"" state-of-mind in a lot of so-called ""gifted"" kids, starting at an early age. Awfully ironic but seemingly a very common outcome and true in my experiences. Sorry if I went off a bit there - I have ADHD üòÇ If I had to describe that extremely briefly, it's like my mind opens 100 tabs of related information to everything, all the time. I read a sign whilst driving or something and can't not have an entire array of things ""pop up"" laterally from a single word and can take me in a lot of different directions. My mind is like the wind, very quick but changes direction quickly and without warning lol. It's a double-edged sword.",1609459359

The first point is the most salient for your purposes-- proximity increases attraction, so it stands to reason that the longer you spend with someone, the more likely you are to become more attracted to them over time.  

You should 1000% cut things off with the woman you're seeing. Why?  

1. You are likely not over the last woman you dated. What a shame if this woman ""fixed"" herself and you realized you weren't really ready to commit after all.  

2. Finding minor flaws in a partner that prevents you from fully committing to them is a distancing mechanism that [avoidant attachment](https://imgur.com/a/NQTZ6Eu) folks use to protect themselves from relationships. So is idealizing a past partner. I dont know if this applies to you, but I know that both tropes are present in your post. To me, this again suggests that even if she has surgery, you will find a new flaw, a new reason not to commit.  

3. What if the surgery goes wrong and she ends up with a scar, or some other physical deformity? You gonna stick around for that? I didn't think so.  

4. This woman deserves to be with someone who unreservedly appreciates everything that she brings to the table. The fact that she's apparently offered to change whatever is HORRIFYING. I'm not sure what you did to get her to say that.  

5. You ended a serious relationship, started dating very soon after, and your behavior here is... not great. While everyone's timeline from moving on from an old relationship is different, what's happening here as described in your post suggests to me that you would benefit from some time on your own. Take some time to get clarity on what really matters to you. Think about how you treat people. And decide what kind of person you need to be going forward.

* Since the routes are using the auth:sanctum middleware, you can also provide the same routes outside your spa and utilise tokens",1609459361

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I said somewhere up there that you'll have the great team 50% of the time and have a winning streak, which makes you rank up. You can rank up 2 level with them in a week. Usually at least 3 teammates. Sometimes they're so godly I basically ended up walking around doing nothing and build meme items because I have so much gold and free time doing nothing but killing creep. Then 50% of the time it's the worst ones that will give you losing streak that ended up getting the level down again after that. 

These aren't just garbage players, they're not playing at all. Other places have ppl who played badly, these ppl are good IF THEY'RE PLAYING OTHER GAME because they're not playing dota in dota. Imagine thinking dota is the same as FORTNITE.  Lots of time it's either just going across the map to kill, or there's no pushing, fighting or anything, just farming and getting killed playing FARMVILLE. Again it's because they're not playing dota.  At all. 

It's not that I can't win against, I can't win WITH them as teammates. Idk where you getting that I'm playing against them made me lose, it's playing with them. 

THIS is my original grief if anyone bothered to actually read. I ranked up playing with the good ones,  and JUST as I reached herald 5, I get the other ones that doesn't play and ranked down again 11 times in a year. That's SEA matchmaking.

"Survival","t5_2qh7j","I'd consider taking something out so you can put a compass in. Here's why:

There are two types of survival gear - (1) gear that prevents something going wrong (i.e., prevents a survival situation from occurring in the first place); and (2) gear that helps you solve or get out of a survival situation *after* something goes wrong.

The most important gear is type (1) - prevention. Same goes for knowledge and experience - whatever helps you prevent survival situations is more important than whatever helps you survive them.

Examples of gear that helps you avoid things going wrong: a compass and map (stops you getting lost); flashlight (stops you getting lost at night); waterproof clothing (stops you getting wet, which can lead to hypothermia); a water bottle (stops you getting dehydrated); good hiking socks and bandaids (prevents blisters, and an inability to walk at a reasonable speed). Examples of type 1 knowledge and experience: physical fitness, navigation skills, awareness of dangerous wildlife, and knowing how to layer clothing appropriately for different conditions.

Examples of gear that helps you survive things after they go wrong: fire starting kit, emergency blankets, whistles, signal mirrors, first aid.

Both types are important, so try and balance you kit so it has an appropriate mix of both.",1609459362

Drilling pilot holes was super easy, I just flipped it all upside down, lined up the legs and marked the holes then drilled into the block (the wood is soft enough to go in easy with a regular drill bit - just be careful not to go all the way through!). After that I just threw in the screws and tightened them up (just hand tight) and that was all.

Just a word of caution if you do buy the countertop from Home Depot, I had it shipped to the store twice and it showed up damaged both times. Their vendor does not properly package it for transit, a couple corners were chewed up and there was a small dent in 1 side but I ended up negotiating with a manager to get $150 off the price and just hid the worst parts against the wall or corner of the room.",1609459363

the first payment is worth it because even if you do get lucky, you paid less than what you normally would have. the second payment is NOT forced and if you do get lucky, you just paid more than what you normally would have. of course, there are a lot of other factors (ie, did you pull the S final emperor or do you want Subier) but if you are just hunting a single SS, doing the second step is a bad proposition because you are punished if you get lucky.

this is very much in the same way that a 10 multi makes you overpay if you are hunting single SSs almost every time, as it is technically better to do singles in that case so you do not waste jewels. same thing here. you overpay for 10 pulls to get a discount for 20 when you could get what you want on pull 5.",1609459365

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt; What does objective morality say about this?

Generally, systems of objective morality are reasonably unconcerned about how people feel about actions. The French may view it as good, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is, and vice versa for the conquered people. Think of it how most people view claims about the material world- people may have different beliefs about the shape of the planet, for example, but that does not make it a subjective matter.

There are different forms of objective ethics, and they respond to ethical claims a bit differently, but they'd all have that trait in common. An ardent believer in a religion, for example, would often consult their holy texts and respond accordingly. A common form of this belief is [theological voluntarism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/), which the fancy way of saying ""do the things God says"". For a believer in the Ten Commandments, ""Thou Shall Not Commit Adultery"" is an unavoidable moral fact, regardless of your feelings on the matter. 

For a consequentialist (cool way of saying [""do things that have good outcomes""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/)), the goodness of the war depends on what it achieves. Most kinds of consequentialists believe something akin to ""do things that maximize happiness and minimize suffering"", and based on this criteria its hard to see a particularly good justification for a war of pure conquest. Maybe it makes the French a bit more proud and Napoleon a bit more rich, but it also killed and maimed thousands, and sent many families into unthinkable grieving.

There's plenty more ethical views like this, from Kant's kind of hard to explain [categorical imperative](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/) (something like ""do things that would make sense if everyone did them"") to a type of nihilism called [""error theory""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/#ErrThe) (""morals are objectively incorrect, fight me!""), but hopefully you see how they would respond to moral questions like the one you posed.",1609459365

I don't have the article or link anymore but what he was saying is that if anything, teams need a ton more practice, but stage it by intensity. Like start in May, but nothing over 50%. That time would be spent getting guys back into shape, getting rookies up to speed, assessing injury recovery, walkthroughs of the playbook, etc. June, you can ramp things up a bit. Get pads on a few times a week, up the intensity, etc. Rest guys if you need. Then come training camp in July, you go full intensity like any other year.

To answer you, yes.  Sure, they've removed more inner skin on your dorsal side than ventral, but that's a positive.  I'm the reverse and I'm finding getting the inner skin raphe line to grow extremely difficult. 

I would research mm1 and mm2. You don't need to do mm2 erect either.

Mm1 will allow you to focus on the shorter dorsal skin and using mm2, make an ok sign with the thumb and forefinger of both hands and place one on the glans and one below scarline and tension by pulling hands apart. 

You'll find a very helpful getting started guide and other helpful information on r/foreskin_restoration. 

You can deal with the skin bridges as you progress.

"AskLibertarians","t5_2yqo4","First, I would like to examine animal rights from a practical perspective. Unlike with people, there is no reasonable way to live without killing animals. Even if you do not eat meat, innumerable insects and worms died in the process of growing the plants you eat. You will, inevitably, kill to survive.  I think then for our own sanity and moral wellbeing we must not strictly apply NAP to all animals, else we are all mass murderers.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, we must next consider if there are constraints on what actions we may take. In human interaction, murder is generally at the top or near the top of the ""worst things to do to someone"" list, aside from truly heinous acts. Thus, can we logically prohibit *any* actions if killing is acceptable? If you will forgive me for the utilitarianism, I would argue that only actions that yield significant benefit to humans are permissible. In that line of reasoning, killing an animal for sheer pleasure is wrong while killing to sustain yourself is acceptable. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, we must consider if any animals are worthy of additional protections, or having protections lowered. Killing relatively intelligent animals- Chimpanzees, dolphins, etc. seems worse than killing a cockroach, no? Is that fair and justifiable, or do we merely think it's fair because of our human biases? No doubt that the cockroaches would not agree with our assessment. Since protection under the NAP is generally attached to ideas of personhood (I stance that I agree with), I think it is reasonable to give more moral consideration to seemingly intelligent animals as opposed to seemingly unintelligent ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all that in mind, I think that animal testing can be justifiable. Some drugs, particularly veterinary medicine, cannot be tested on humans. Some tests have yielded important results. Not all tests are harmful to the animal- basic research is counted as animal testing, after all. However, technological advancement has given rise to generally more useful and more cost-effective options than testing on live animals, such as by using artificial cells. As such, I think that animal testing is a question that will resolve itself.",1609459367

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it.**

""You don't know how hard it is to work on minimum wage if you're saying that"" 

And whatever else they can throw at him. 

But, if you ask him why he's saying no, his answer is ""because, it would raise taxes. We are already struggling now and paying more taxes to up the minimum wage will just make it worse.

One day I called and I got a really chill guy who gave me his tips and tricks (checking isg number, when to calibrate, how long to wait after a failed calibration, etc) and now it‚Äôs always super close to my actual number, just now I calibrated and was 5 points off. A lot of people hate Medtronic but I‚Äôve never had trouble with them, and they replace each and every sensor that doesn‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt know how people are talking to Medtronic reps (I always read they weren‚Äôt helpful but they are!) but I always get thanked for being patient with them and not yelling and they always go above and beyond for me. Just have patience, if something goes wrong log what your sugars were (steady numbers or fluctuating) and what you were doing, they just want to know if that factors into a cgm being off but if you answer them they always offer to replace every sensor.",1609459370

A feature that some gamers like is the ability to lean back and really recline.  If that's you you'll want to make sure your chair does that.

If you're looking for a good deal on a pre-owned chair, something like Knoll life or Haworth Zody are good chairs, that are good for shorter durations and generally sell much cheaper than the best. There's also a chair called the G20.",1609459371

I‚Äôve been to Paris and London, Venice and Florence, all centuries older, grand, and fabulous. But, for me, NOTHING compares to the BIG APPLE. 

I should probably dispel any notion of having the kind of $$ it takes to travel first class. Shoestring budget here. Every time, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

Yes and I agree. Still if your people are getting killed a response is necessary. Even if only for the change of making the other side stop

2- a huge global demand

3 - US has limited production , the 2nd vaccine just got authorized.

4- US is distributing at the state level 

5- US states prioritize the medical and first responders first 

6- general population will be the last to get the vaccine after first responders , elderly , and likely teachers.

#HAPPY NEW YEAR! 


¬†**Links** to the ships in the photo above are below if anyone is interested. These are a few of the ships I found that kept a special place in my heart.¬†


**T1 Ships**


- [Vector, Long nose fighter in white and green chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/jmlsr3/beautiful_t1_vector_long_nose_fighter_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) this is my golden angel. I mean c'mon, it's white and gold! ü§§ I just need to find this but with purple chrome and a single thruster. If you find it before me be sure to tag me in your post ‚ò∫ 


- [X-wing Hopper Explorer in grey and yellow](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/jqwpeb/epic_spiked_xwing_hopper_explorer_in_greyyellow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)¬†this, in my experience of ship hunting, didn't get the love that it deserved. Finding grey (and I mean grey - not off white or very subtle grey) on an explorer is hard enough on its own. On an X-wing with a secondary colour of yellow is something special and something I've been looking for for a long time. 


- [Starjumper, Rasa fighter - ""Radiant Pillar"" starter ship lookalike - in grey, yellow and blue chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/i72qby/t1_starjumper_rasa_fighter_in_dark/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). This is my personal favourite find of all time (so far), and the ship I've flown since the day I found it. It's grey/yellow colour combo along with a really hard to find 'blue chrome' makes this a really rare ship. The nostalgia it brings with it, the same ship configuration as the one that I started with ('Radiant Pillarand') makes this my perfect ship.¬†


**T2 Ships**


- [Tie-wing, Droid, Rasa fighter in white, red and dark chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/d3tggp/stunning_t2_tiewing_droid_rasa_whitereddark/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) What a little beauty this thing was to find. A ship that a lot of Rasa lovers went to get and that made it extra special for me. 


- [Tie-wing, Droid, Long nose fighter in white and chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/f9axep/as_close_to_black_white_as_youre_gonna_get_t2/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)¬†when I first saw this fly past me my game crashed (because of its beauty of course /s). It took me a few hours to find it again. I'm glad I never gave up. 


- [Spiked Janus, Hopper Explorer in white](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/d1wwlx/stunning_whitewhite_t2_explorer_with_the_spike/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). As far as T2 explorers go, the Janus wings look by far the coolest in my eyes


**T3 Ships**


- [E-wing, Long nose fighter in red and green chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/h8sg4e/t3_ewing_long_nose_fighter_in_two_tone_redgreen/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)¬†Red and gold is a beautiful colour combo. It's just easy on the eyes and you look super cool turning up at the Nexus in this. 


- [E-wing, Stubby nose fighter in white, warm yellow and green chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/d8pdv4/my_new_personal_best_ship_find_imo_t3_ewing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) I was about to leave this system empty handed when I caught a very faint glimpse of this flying into my freighter. I stood out of my chair once I saw it up close. 


- [E-wing, Alpha nose fighter in white, red and dark chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/jzgp73/t3_ewing_alpha_nose_fighter_in_whitereddark/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Another ship that almost slipped through the net. As for T3 alphas, I generally don't get much luck finding them with a nice colour/configuration. This one was a really lucky find. 

**Haulers**

- [T3 Aftershock, Ball hauler in light grey, dark grey and chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/eih6le/amazing_looking_t3_ball_hauler_in_greydark/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Just a beast of a Hauler

- [T3 Ball hauler in dark grey, off white and purple chrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/gx2ghx/badass_looking_t3_ball_hauler_in_dark_greylight/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) My favourite Hauler find. The dark grey on this one makes it look so badass. And the purple chrome trim makes it quite a rare ship find

- [T2 Split shield hauler in greyish blue, yellow](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/fcc2ce/t1_split_shield_hauler_in_dark_greyyellow_euclid/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) I don't know why I loved the look of this one, it just caught my eye I guess. 

**Freighter**

- [This is my favourite freighter find](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/guiu5n/my_best_dreadnought_sentinel_capital_freighter/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) It's dark grey with a yellow trim, max dreadnought. Colours we don't see often compared to the common black base colour of we see on freighters everyday 

**Fleet**

- [My all pink fleet](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/f7ej4f/my_pink_fleet/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) A fleet I enjoyed collecting ready for the 'pink week' community event we had on the sub a while back.

"science","t5_mouw","There‚Äôs something to the idea that dreams are a manifestation of bits of information your sub-conscious collects throughout your life and dumps out in your brain during REM cycles - like a waste basket for filtered senses, images, and thoughts that didn‚Äôt quite make the consciousness cut. Indirectly, there‚Äôs bound to be bits of information your sub-consciousness presents in your dreams that your consciousness didn‚Äôt deem important that could prove useful in decision making. Although I agree that shouldn‚Äôt be the sole basis for making a decision.

Example: When I was in college, I had a dream my SO at the time broke up with me. Three days later he broke up with me. Now, the dream obviously was not prophetic but looking back there were clear signs the relationship was over that I wasn‚Äôt willing to acknowledge at the time. My dream seemed to be based on a collection of memories I chose to ignore, but because I dreamed it I was able to prepare myself for a break up I didn‚Äôt want to believe was imminent.

I‚Äôm not saying this is a solid scientific theory but I do think it‚Äôs worth considering that there are functions of the brain that we don‚Äôt fully understand including how information is processed - or whether dreams are a function of that process. I personally think, in this interpretation, it is a discussion worth having on r/science, but I don‚Äôt know exactly how the study was done or whether there is bias in the conclusion.",1609459375

They could have made the user ID clickable with a copy option.

I thought you might be raising the Loa/Kea observation that Hawaiian volcanoes tend to alternate between two distinct geochemical signatures, which is problematic for this simple model.

My issue started with ignoring that the Pacific has lots of chains of volcanoes... oh well.

"BiggBoss14","t5_34h7yo","Agree wholeheartedly. It is evident that she has learnt alot from life, and her low confidence and hyperactive behaviour at times are all because of deep rooted issues. Yet she is any day more entertaining than anyone in the house and still keeps the positivity quotient high. She showed everyone that for being entertaining, one doesn‚Äôt need to fall to lowest lows, and they can still do it by staying good. It boils my blood when everyone now and then calls her cheap and ghatiya. They are showing their own hypocrisy. I have lost huge faith in Rubina because of her attitude towards Rakhi, she was my favourite, but if she is insensitive then I‚Äôm out.

Following is what I just wrote in another comment, to expand upon what I just said.

&gt;Rakhi is clearly suffering from some mental health issues and there is nothing wrong with it. The wrong is fellow housemates fail to understand that. She technically doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone the way Ali, Jasmean, Rahul and Arshi does, yet she receives more flak for her childish behaviour, which is obviously because of her insecurities.

&gt;The thing is on one side Mahajan sounds so sane, empathetic and sensible to be able to understand Rakhi‚Äôs plight and emotions when she was crying on that Nose incident, and many more times, but at the same time, when Rakhi does something to him, he forgets all that and charges back calling names and what not. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

&gt;Moreover I‚Äôm more disappointed with Rubinav (considering them most sensible and sensitive) for they are being outright jerks like Ali and Jasmean. I mean comeom we are ironically getting sensible behaviour from Eijaz and Sonali, but not them!

&gt;I wish this WKW, Salman tells them that he is also utterly disappointed with them for he expects good from them at least. He should reprimand them for ganging up against Rakhi, and not using their mental discretion.


Salman should also reprimand everyone for calling her cheap and ghatiya. It hurts and its going below the belt.",1609459378

*****
&gt; A Wisconsin hospital employee has been fired and arrested after removing dozens of vials of the coronavirus vaccine from a pharmacy refrigerator, intentionally destroying more than 500 doses, a hospital investigation found.

&gt; Most doses of the vaccine that had been left out of the pharmacy refrigerator had to be discarded, although hospital officials later believed they could salvage some.

&gt; After the hospital administered more than 50 doses of the vaccines that had been thawed, it learned the shots had actually been thawed twice, rendering them ineffective, a hospital official said Thursday at a press conference.

We were not high in our income at all, I worked hard to save money so I could be home. So many women (including my best friend initially) would ask when I was going to get a job or what I did for a living. I was considered either incredibly lucky or lazy by many. Many of these women that shamed me had no choice but to work yet they and others had become conditioned to believe it was just normal and healthy for a woman to have to work full time while raising her kids. Yet 50 years before me my mother would have been shamed for going to work and would have never felt the need to justify her choice to stay home and not put her kids in daycare. And that‚Äôs in my opinion where society sits today. Women have been fooled into accepting a burden and worldview that many before them once found foolish and unhealthy.

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","Hello, your submission is removed because of the following reason(s): 

&gt;##Rule #3. Fanwork-relevant rules 

- All fanwork must link directly to the artist/source in the original post. Linking it in the comments is not valid; you must POST the link to the source as your submission. Only 1 fanwork post per day, per user, is allowed. If you want to post multiple artworks, submit an album instead (using imgur for example) 

- If it's your own creation, please mention it in the title or comments. 

- Mark the post as spoiler if necessary. Spoiler is defined as events that are not adapted in the anime yet. 

- NSFW/lewd fanwork is not allowed. This includes, but not limited to: sexually suggestive poses/clothing/words or innuendos, or anything that makes the character look OOC for the sake of looking lewd. For example, drawing Momo in her Hero costume is fine, but drawing Momo in a suggestive pose while wearing her costume is not. 

- ##Post only completed fanwork. Doodles, sketches, and work-in-progress are not allowed. This includes line art without shading and most cases of whiteboard art. These are considered low-effort art, for they can be spammed in different stages of creation. 

- Redraws of other people‚Äôs fanart are not allowed, but redraws from official artwork (manga, promos, anime) are allowed, provided they're not low-effort art. 

- ##For cosplay, if the character being cosplayed can't be recognized without the post title, it will not be allowed. This is considered low-effort cosplay. 

- All fanwork includes, but are not limited to: fanart, cosplay, edits, amvs, fanfiction

That said, please don't take your advice on your career from anonymous posters on reddit or SDN. The doom-and-gloom mentality is out of hand and the platform just turns into an echo chamber. Most of the time when I've pushed back on some of these types of comments (particularly the really extremely neg views), it turns out it was coming from someone either not in the field or only peripherally aware of what's going on.

For what it's worth, all of my third years (except one, who just hasn't applied yet) have jobs or fellowships lined up for next year. Our ED is seeing hella volume (which is unfortunate for us as residents w 1/4 out sick w COVID, but that's a separate topic for another post...).

In terms of big picture, there's no reason to think that demand for EM physicians will decrease. As another commenter pointed out, the baby boomer generation is about to hit peak ED-utilization years. More and more hospitals are trying to fill slots w board certified physicians. 

Regarding EM PAs, I work at a hospital w PAs. They are great people and very skilled within their scope of practice, but that scope is very narrow. Deal w low acuity cases, allowing attendings to see to the sick patients. You could never just have them ""cover"" an ED. That type of scope creep is not something that I could see happening anytime soon. And unlike primary care, where deleterious outcomes might be years down the road, data would show that pretty quick in this field.

&gt; # [Aborto. Pol√©mica en La Rioja por publicaci√≥n de un sacerdote](https://bucket2.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/45/3557745.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;      Luego de aprobada la IVE el sacerdote riojano Nicol√°s Vilches advirti√≥ en su cuenta de Facebook que ""no se quejen despu√©s de los femicidios""  Cr√©dito: Facebook Nicol√°s Vilches   **La Rioja.- Fuerte repudio y rechazo caus√≥ una violenta y agresiva publicaci√≥n de un sacerdote cat√≥lico de esta provincia, Nicol√°s Vilches**, quien en su cuenta personal de Facebook poste√≥, luego de la aprobaci√≥n en la madrugada de ayer de la Ley de Interrupci√≥n Voluntaria del [Embarazo](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/legalizacion-un-juzgado-federal-salta-habilito-feria-nid2557027), **que ""no se quejen despu√©s de los femicidios"", felicitando tambi√©n, ir√≥nicamente a quienes ""apoyan la muerte de inocentes"".**
&gt; 
&gt;  **""Quien siembra muerte, engendra y cosecha muerte. No se quejen despu√©s de los femicidios. La naturaleza es sabia. Felicitaciones a los que apoyan la muerte de inocentes""**, fue la publicaci√≥n textual y completa del cura en su cuenta de Facebook, a la que luego de la trascendencia que tomara la misma decidi√≥ dar de baja su perfil.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Nicol√°s Vilches es un joven sacerdote, oriundo de Chepes y que administra la Parroquia ""Encarnaci√≥n del Se√±or""**, ubicada en el barrio Shincal de la capital riojana. Su publicaci√≥n, la cual estuvo varias horas, **caus√≥ enorme rechazo y repudio de muchas organizaciones feministas y de DDHH**, pero tambi√©n llego a ser compartida muchas veces y recibi√≥ varios de mensajes de apoyo.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Antonela S√°nchez Maltese, riojana y militante feminista**, tambi√©n uso su cuenta de Facebook para expresar su repudio a los dichos del Padre Vilches y sostuvo que **""el Obispado de La Rioja no puede dejar pasar este hecho grav√≠simo** que, no solo interpela directamente a la iglesia, sino que expone la necesidad de un cambio radical"".
&gt; 
&gt;  **""Las palabras del cura Nicol√°s Vilches no solo denotan odio y desprecio por la vida de las mujeres, sino que hace apolog√≠a de un delito: el asesinato.** ¬øC√≥mo es posible que qui√©n pregona la paz social o la palabra de un dios, maldiga o celebre la ""naturaleza"" de un problema estructural que termina con la vida de las ni√±as y mujeres? ¬øEn qu√© evangelio dice que debemos aceptar esa ""naturaleza"" del mal, ese 'ojo por ojo'?"", afirm√≥ S√°nchez Maltese.
&gt; 
&gt;  Por √∫ltimo, **la joven militante feminista no dudo en afirmar que ""el mensaje es claro: por poder decidir, merecemos la muerte""**, y que ""la contradicci√≥n de las iglesias qued√≥ al descubierto durante todo el debate del aborto, instituciones que hablan del 'bien' ocultando el mal, que miran para arriba buscando a un dios que es selectivo, que no acepta todo, que juzga, que condena, que expulsa. Pero pens√© que ya lo hab√≠amos visto todo"".
&gt; 
&gt;  Hasta el momento y m√°s all√° de la pol√©mica y el rechazo que causo la publicaci√≥n del sacerdote Vilches **no se supo ni trascendi√≥ ning√∫n llamado de atenci√≥n o postura oficial por parte de la c√∫pula de la iglesia riojana.**

On previous experience when DaVinci was crashing on startup, I only needed to keep trying and on the 5th or 6th try it would open.

"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","The very first study accounts for this exact factor in its abstract:

*‚ÄùFinally, analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.‚Äù*

In other words, the study isn‚Äôt ignoring poverty, it‚Äôs accounting for it. And it‚Äôs not claiming causality in police intent, at best it‚Äôs calculating that there is a racial bias at the systemic level. Which would account for poverty, which disproportionately impacts black communities, and is central to the whole point. We have systematic problems, and the assumptions baked in there impact how we debate the isolated cases. 

I‚Äôll also point out that statements of causality are one of the most basic checks that peer reviewers look for when looking at a paper to make sure the conclusions match the premises, and that the premises are either accounted for in the literature cited or in the research model itself.

That said, I‚Äôm encouraged that we agree about poverty as a key driver of violence. The fact that black communities are so disproportionately afflicted by poverty seems like a reasonable point to argue as evidence of systemic injustice, rather than an excuse away. The first article also includes in its abstract the point that poor metropolitan (I.e. not rural) communities with more black residents are hardest hit by police violence. And there‚Äôs plenty of good research in both of these lists and elsewhere that explicitly accounts for the factors you raise, e.g. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/how-structural-racism-is-linked-to-police-violence

Your second point is, I will gently observe, committing the very sin you‚Äôve accused the other studies of doing‚Äîsubstituting your own ideas of causality to explain the issues. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, these factors may be part of a vicious negative feedback loop. I‚Äôd welcome a link to peer-reviewed research or an otherwise credible independent analysis of this. Certainly makes intuitive sense that it would be a factor, and maybe one that isn‚Äôt being suitably addressed by policy makers.

That these incidents are only a fraction of the overall numbers is not really helpful. 5% of all encounters is a huge number of encounters.

"legendofkorra","t5_2t4vd","I believe humanize fits the best. And what can I say? I love humanized characters. The end of ATLA humanized Azula as well, it just did it way too late (The Beach sort of did and Sozin Comet of course). ~~It's almost if people tend to overlook ATLA flaws, who could've gussed?~~

The first time Azula got to be a character and not a villain/Zuko's sister was at the end of 3x15 (i.e. Mai's betrayal. And even that's about Zuko). So her breakdown seemed rushed, because it is. Because we never see Azula as her own character, what her thought process is, her childhood, etc. So by humanizing Azula much earlier than canon (I don't know where to place this on the timeline) you make her character resonate better with the viewers.

If you want more than that, you get into big box store safes. I think they are an improvement, but from my research, the fire rating on them doesn‚Äôt mean much. The construction around the door can be weak. The walls are very thin. A person might be able to pry them open with a just crow bar.

Then something like CSM is a step up from that. I think they are entry level real security and you have to look at the whole picture: door, body, around door build, lock, etc. ideally you bolt it to the floor with the back and one or more sides covered. You do all that, and it keeps an unprepared burglar out. Someone with an angle grinder and an half hour to hour maybe they get in.

"danganronpa","t5_2wcd0","That is accurate to me. Kokichi is an extremely flawed character, to take your example, and acting as though he has no flaws wipes away a lot of what there is to discuss involving his character. This is done with countless characters, and virtually every ship (excepting Naegiri) is headcanon, so it leads directly to ignoring of blatant wrongs done by characters.

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","The extra options don't hurt me, and I'm not compromised by their being present. A few more stray thoughts:

 - The presence of ""cheats"" has never been disruptive for me. In Sonic, I knew the level select and debug modes, but that knowledge didn't necessitate I use it. Game Genies and Game Sharks have long existed and made workarounds in games possible, but that didn't cheapen my experience either. Making the modes more immediate to some players is good for them, but does not affect me.

 - All games are ultimately arbitrary. The magic circle separating *play* from *not play* is a contingent phenomenon, and in many ways a mood or state of mind. Lots of things can affect that mood, including perceptions of fairness. Personally, I'd rather become more open in accepting multiple modes within a single player game than insist that the game be designed for my needs and desires alone. 

 - In general, I don't get much from comparisons or competition between people who play single-player JRPGs. That's not a part of the game for me.",1609459385

Ao **Agora**, eles falaram o que fariam caso ganhassem o pr√™mio.

 Na Lot√©rica Trememb√©, a veterin√°ria Claudia Mayumi de Brito, 50, fez cerca de dez jogos individuais e tr√™s bol√µes feitos por seu marido, que junto com ela tenta acertar os seis n√∫meros da loteria de fim de ano. Ciente de que houve um vencedor da Mega da Virada no mesmo estabelecimento em que foi validar as apostas, ela afirmou pretender ajudar pessoas carentes, caso ganhe. ‚ÄúCriar uma ONG [Organiza√ß√£o N√£o Governamental] para auxiliar quem precisa, est√° entre meus planos‚Äù, disse.

 J√° o comerciante Dennis J√¥ Nishiguchi, 50 anos, que mant√©m um bar a poucos metros da lot√©rica p√©-quente, contou que para a virada deste ano fez dez apostas. ‚ÄùSe eu ganhar, l√≥gico que vou fechar meu bar‚Äù, afirmou, sem dar mais detalhes sobre seus planos para uma eventual vida milion√°ria.

As for the potato chips, have you seen the ritz crisps in the cracker aisle, I‚Äôm not sure how many points they are on blue... but on green, 21 crisps are 4 points. They have them in BBQ, sour cream and chive, salt and vinegar and I think one other flavor. You can look them up in the WW app to see how many points they are on blue. 

I have a 100 calorie snack bag of skinny girl popcorn at night and on green they are 3 points and those are in two flavors, plain and white cheddar. 

As for fries you can try veggie substitutes like cauliflower or squash and try roasting them in the oven or air frying them. It would probably be easier to use squash I would imagine. 

There are a lot of recipe gems in the WW app and you can search by Ingredients or by theme (so to speak). I usually plan out my dinners using WW recipes. Although I‚Äôm on green my points are more but my zero points foods are less. Try going into the recipe section of the app and plugging in squash fries and see what it comes up with. I saw someone post squash rings the other day here on Reddit that were roasted and looked quite appetizing. 

As for alcohol that is going to be a bit challenging because there you are going into more empty calories. Not impossible though there are low points drink recipes for cocktails in the app if that‚Äôs what you fancy. My preferences are different of course. 

But also all things in moderation. Take your potatoes and roast them as oven fries and check the servings. I don‚Äôt know the points values very well on blue. I have on occasion substituted cauliflower tots but a serving is only six. And I do hold myself to only 6. 

I hope that helps.",1609459386

"cats","t5_2qhta","She had a complete personality change a few months after I adopted her and hated being touched, she would swipe at me if I tried. Then we went through an asthma diagnosis, a couple vets noted ‚Äúpain‚Äù but refused to treat it. (Fired them because they also refused to prescribe an inhaler for her asthma, which is the preferred treatment.) Finally got her asthma controlled but she just kept getting worse, she was moody and standofish and had trouble eating. Sometimes her skin would ripple on the rare occasions she would come and lay against me. (Skin ripples/rolling is apparently the BIG RED FLAG for hyperesthesia, totally ignored by some of the previous vets.)

Last spring after the next former vet put her on buprenorphine for a couple weeks she was better, but then that vet said she was ‚Äútoo you for chronic pain‚Äù and refused to prescribe anything else. After another month or so of my girl being miserable, I ended up lying to that vet that Trixie was ‚Äúanxious‚Äù at mealtimes (which, technically she was, because it hurt to eat) because I knew they prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety at that clinic as well as pain. She had some small improvement pretty quick, and has gradually had significant improvement over the past 6 months, to the point I can pet her again, she comes up for snuggles and wants to be held, and she is now ‚Äúsomewhat temperamental‚Äù instead of being a raging bitch (which I never blamed her for, being in that much pain sucks.) Now just her hips and back legs are sensitive, instead of her whole body. She loves to come up now and greet me with nose kisses and head butts because she enjoys being petted (carefully) again. 

When it came time for fall check-ups I just couldn‚Äôt take them back to a vet where I had to lie to get suitable treatment, so I took my boy to yet another new vet as a test to get a second opinion on his issues (spoiler: old vet screwed that up too) and then took Trixie and her sister to the new vet. New vet was AWESOME and we talked about this may be from a previous injury, but when tapering off the Gabapentin made her worse, I took her back for another exam and she got ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù as hyperesthesia. Which is really that ‚Äúit could be all these other things, but previous tests ruled some out and the rest don‚Äôt fit right, so between that and the rolling skin ripples it‚Äôs most likely hyperesthesia.‚Äù

For treatment, she‚Äôll stay on Gabapentin along with getting some ‚Äúlifestyle management‚Äù changes to reduce stress, such as set mealtimes and careful routines. Also regular trips to the groomer to keep her underbelly shaved and mat-free, because she still can‚Äôt be brushed much and she gets horrible mats which make her pain worse. 

I am ‚Äúlucky‚Äù that neither of my girls self-mutilate, it is all itchy or external response with them. I have a suspicion Trixie‚Äôs sister has a more mild case, but sister is already on CBD for her anxiety and that seems to be keeping her level so for now she‚Äôs OK without stronger meds. CBD didn‚Äôt work for Trixie, but she had so much going on that didn‚Äôt really surprise me.",1609459387

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In hindsight, my first adviser never took me seriously as a scientist. This manifested in many ways but the main one was a complete lack of attention or concern that my assigned project (to work with a brand new instrument he had no experience with whatsoever) wasn‚Äôt working well. So I was spinning wheels with not much actual stuff to work on, he would literally not do things he promised for months, and without any advising I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. But at the end of five years of a good relationship and reassurances it was still going well, things began to deteriorate once I called him out on his behavior. His conclusion of course was that the problem was me. There were impossible to meet goals set- I had to write an entire paper and submit it in a month for example- and when I failed to meet them he basically said I was incapable of doing science and withdrew his support. Unfortunately as he was the dept head and also the dean at the time, not much I could do. 

I‚Äôm obviously summarizing a very long and painful situation, and the ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù took about a year with even more twists and turns. I had to walk away from one first author paper I‚Äôd worked on for two years for example- I learned then banned research is not as exciting as it sounds, but it is painful.  Thank goodness though I found people at other institutions who supported me and began working for them, and turns out I‚Äôm good at science when treated with respect and given the resources to do it. I basically wrote my entire PhD thesis in ~2 years, and got accepted to do a postdoc at Harvard where I am today. So yeah, I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and suggest the problem wasn‚Äôt me, but that terrible first adviser!

By the way, I was told my PhD needed ten ‚Äústatements‚Äù I was defending at the defense, which are on the subject matter but get more broad as they go on. My second to last was Mister Rogers‚Äô ‚Äúlook for the helpers.

 Day of payday you can take out cask for only $1. Usually runs out halfway through folks getting payday. That isn't the issue. 

After that, if you use it as a debit card is like $1.38 per transaction. $40 daily cash withdrawal with an atm convenience fee of like $3.85 I think. You get charged that fee whether the machine is empty or not. Now imagine you make $228 from that job that week. No benefits because it's 31 hours. By the way Once that goes on a resume you can get a degree and get shit going through a door for a job. Cheap suit, cheap car, manual labor job. Must be worthless. 

Nobody is hiring hobos. 

Similar practices for temporary manual labor jobs. The, "" if you got a spine they got a dime"" places that pay minimum wage minus administrative fees. Poor. Predominantly Hispanics and Rednecks with pasts. 

As a slap in the face, many places now ""refresh cards"" with under a dollar. Resetting them to zero. Imagine your debit card working like your cellphone minutes.",1609459391

God doesn't participate in any deeper form, he just is the form. A human being is restricted and enabled by his own form. We are able to make rational thought processes. At the same time we will never be as fast as a  horse or as strong as an ice bear. An atom can decay at an particular moment or a different one.

"ketorecipes","t5_2t46o","7 eggs, 3 separated

1 Cup Ground Pork Rinds

1 Oz Prosciutto

3 Tbsp Butter, melted

1 Tsp Lemon Juice

¬º Tsp Baking Powder


Take your 3 egg yolks that you separated and place into a heat safe bowl. Bring a pot of water to a simmer. Place the heat safe bowl over the pot of simmering water and begin to whisk. Do this until the egg yolks have thickened and have lightened in color. Slowly pour in your melted butter until all of it has been incorporated. Pull from the heat and add your lemon juice and season to taste. Set aside.

Place your pork rinds and 2 eggs into a mixing bowl. Mix well using a fork or spoon. Add ¬º Tsp baking powder and mix in. Place a non-stick pan over medium low heat. Add olive oil or butter to the pan. Place a ring mold in the pan and put 2-3 Tbsp of the mixture in the mold. Cook for 5-6 minutes per side or until a springy texture has been achieved.

Bring a pan of water to a simmer. Crack 2 eggs into a separate bowl. Pour these eggs into the simmering water. Cook for 3-4 minutes and flip. Once flipped, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Let drain on a paper towel.

Cut your english muffin in half. Place prosciutto on top. Next add your poached eggs. Finally, drizzle over your hollandaise. Serve hot.",1609459392

And the early outs were pretty strong too - April (served great looks &amp; lipsyncs), Vivacious (iconic), Magnolia (iconic for all the wrong reasons), Kelly (winner of the early outs season).

I think season 6 started out amazing but from the top 7 epispde onwards it suffered from the S7 problem - great bunch of queens (the top 7 was chef's kiss) with bad challenges/setup. The interview challenge was pretty awful, the makeover gave Joslyn the worst partner ever (and the actual brides were... there) and the ball was super meh.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","As I stepped out of the glowing gateway behind me, I took a deep breath. This time would be different. I had worked harder then ever before when I slayed the demon king and my wife needed me. I  would not lose my life to these stories. This would be better, I thought as a angelic lady flew towards me.

""Greetings Chosen One! we need your help! The necroma-"" she began to speak as I listened, loading my Glock from my previous adventure.

""BANG""

Her speech stopped suddenly as a bullet in the skull usually does to most people.

Her heavenly attendants weaped tears of pure gold as I grabbed her staff.

""She was the necromancer"" I yelled over there crying.

""h-How did you-""  they stuttered out.

""It's always the mentor. The author isn't very original. "" as I put the artifact in my growing backpack of useful artifacts.

""What author? You mean The Heavenly Father?"" 

""Sure. "" I grunted, reloading my Glock. ""The Endless Serpent, Azothoth, God, Ymir, The Starfallen Sky, whatever you like. An omnipotent creator that created the universe and everything in it.""

""They created this level of reality but to them it's just a story. The Heavenly Father of your realm is just an author in the one above yours and so on.""

""I'm fiction?"" the angel sobbed.

""Same as everyone else. Got any books on you?""

""Sure? But what does that matter?""

I didn't replay, trying to figure out the plot before I was pulled into a new story. A plague devastating a kingdom? Typical. 

""It's where I'm going next."" I grumbled, writing it down in my notebook.

The angel was still there. Normally, I'd be gone by now. I must be getting closer.

""Why do this? If you can come from higher plains, why be here?""

I heard a new gateway starting to open behind me, growing louder as it started pulling me down into another story.

""My wife is down here, stuck between realities. This is the only way to save her."", I called as I began walking in the portal.

""A quest for love, I see. I will pray for you"". he called as I stepped in the ether.

""Don't pray,"" I called back, as I begin to slip into a new world. ""Write better books.""",1609459392

In John wicks case, in their world, maybe silencers, silence, which leads me to think, perhaps gun manufacturers that the assassins use, specifically design things to operate quieter.  Beyond all that.. just maybe this is such a regular occurrence, that seeing two assassins out themselves and face-off, making sure not to hit you.. is just your usual day. But why? How could that be?  Well we already know the assassins guild is massive and how can it or why would it need to be that massive?  I could be persuaded to believe that people hire them on the regular and therefore expect others to.  Now we're in a world where we know assassins are normal, the depth of their world is hidden, but their numbers are not, their use is not.

Also we don't really know which component of the immune system is the problem (different from person to person, as is the severity of the disease). Still, I think scheduled vaccines are better than infusions. That being said, it doesn't mean it's impossible, mRNA and even plasmid DNA vaccines have been researched, some even for cancers (they have to be personalized).

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Others have written excellent answers here, but I'll add my two cents. Not everyone is born with good looks. Not everyone has a face or a natural body type that matches what Hollywood seems ""attractive'. And that's okay.

What each of us can do, though, is work on ourselves. Work out, get a good pair of shoes, wear decent clothes, get good sleep, eat well, take care of your teeth, your skin, your body and your mind. Doing all of this may not by itself make you the hottest guy around, but what it *will* do is build your self confidence. Take care of yourself, and be yourself. In my view, there's nothing more attractive than a person who's comfortable being in their own skin, irrespective of outward looks.

Although I don't look ugly, I'm not what one would call ""hot"" or ""sexy"", when it comes to appearances, at all. Both of my exes (both of which I've had serious relationships with), on the other hand, have been really attractive (in the traditional sense of the word) women.

I certainly have struggled with the exact same thing as you. I have felt unattractive all my life, and I still do. But the way I've been able to overcome it to a large extent is by working on myself, both inward and outward. It has taken a lot of effort for me, but I am now comfortable in my own skin, I am confident about who I am as an individual, and I believe in my own ability to not only sincerely care for someone, but also to be a considerate and empathetic human being. And I try to accept and handle rejection with grace, dignity and humility.

Not everyone may find this attractive enough, but in my experience, most do. If I can do it, I am certain that so can you. Go get her. :)",1609459394

Favorites:

* Imperial Glory - Hands-down, my favorite 40k novel to date. Rest in peace &gt;!Ducky!&lt;, you were a real one to the end

* Ahriman Series - John French, just take my money. That is all.

* Baneblade/Shadowsword Duology - Second favorite Guard novels. Really hope Haley comes out with a third. Also, I want a whole Savlar series just from what I've read from Haley now

* Macharius Trilogy - Excellent piece on displaying the greatest Crusade lead by a mere human through the eyes of his bodyguard. The ending was a bit short, but otherwise, it was excellent

Duds:

* Rogue Trader Trilogy - Where to start with this one? Weird pacing, weird space combat, just janky in general

* The Beast Arises - A galaxy-spanning conflict that should have been on the same scale as the Heresy shouldn't be condensed to 12 novels. Ullanor should have been a one-and-done conflict for the finale, not three separate invasions. Instead, at least use those novels to portray the general state of the galaxy rather than just focusing on Terra

 Aprovado h√° duas semanas pelo Congresso, a LDO definiu as diretrizes para o Or√ßamento do ano que vem e as normas para sua execu√ß√£o. A nova lei entra em vigor nesta sexta-feira (1¬∫).

 Embora o or√ßamento de 2021 n√£o tenha sido ainda votado por deputados e senadores, a assinatura da LDO autoriza o governo a dar continuidade √† realiza√ß√£o das despesas emergenciais, com base no que foi definido no projeto sancionado pelo presidente.

 A lei estima um crescimento real do PIB para o ano que vem de 3,2%, o IPCA em 3,2%, a taxa Selic em 2,1% e a taxa de c√¢mbio m√©dia de R$ 5,3/US$.

  De acordo com o comunicado do Minist√©rio da Economia, a previs√£o inicial era um d√©ficit prim√°rio nas contas p√∫blicas da ordem de R$ 149,6 bilh√µes.

 Essa previs√£o, afirmou a pasta, teve que ser revista ap√≥s os desdobramentos negativos na economia do pa√≠s com a Covid-19. Com, a LDO agora sancionada prev√™ uma meta de d√©ficit prim√°rio m√°ximo de R$ 247,12 bilh√µes para 2021.

 A LDO estabeleceu projetos priorit√°rios, livres de sofrerem contingenciamento no ano que vem. A lista inclui a√ß√µes de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica, Ci√™ncia e Tecnologia, o Fundeb (fundo de manuten√ß√£o e desenvolvimento da educa√ß√£o b√°sica), a alimenta√ß√£o escolar, o piso de aten√ß√£o b√°sica em sa√∫de e os procedimentos de aten√ß√£o √† sa√∫de de m√©dia e alta complexidade.

 Fazem tamb√©m parte da lista a aquisi√ß√£o dos novos ca√ßas pela Aeron√°utica (projeto FX-2), o projeto de desenvolvimentos de submarinos pela Marinha e o sistema integrado de monitoramento de fronteiras.

 Sobre a medida provis√≥ria que trata do BPC (Benef√≠cio de Presta√ß√£o Continuada), uma lei de 1993 estabeleceu que o benef√≠cio seria concedido √†s fam√≠lias cuja renda mensal per capita seja inferior a um quarto do sal√°rio m√≠nimo.  
   
 Neste ano, frente √†s dificuldades enfrentadas pela popula√ß√£o em decorr√™ncia da pandemia da Covid-19, o Congresso aprovou a amplia√ß√£o deste crit√©rio para renda mensal per capita seja inferior a meio sal√°rio m√≠nimo.

 O Pal√°cio do Planalto vetou a inova√ß√£o legislativa, mas o veto foi derrubado pelos parlamentares, dando origem √† Lei n ¬∫ 13.981. O assunto foi judicializado, e o STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) concedeu liminar para suspender a efic√°cia desse dispositivo legal.

 Uma nova lei foi editada no Congresso, para restabelecer um quarto do sal√°rio m√≠nimo como crit√©rio, mas com vig√™ncia at√© esta quinta-feira (31).

 Em nota, o Minist√©rio da Cidadania afirmou que, por configurar situa√ß√£o de incerteza e de inseguran√ßa jur√≠dica, foi editada a medida provis√≥ria para ‚Äúrestabelecer o crit√©rio objetivo para acesso ao BPC, a partir do ano de 2021, suprimindo o limitador temporal hoje existente‚Äù. ‚Äã",1609459395

"akalimains","t5_38pr2","Coming from someone who has played a lot of Akali but has always been a Zed main, the issue with Akali is that her kit is extremely toxic. She is so insanely forgiving of mistakes that it's laughable.  

She does WAY to much damage with one single item, and as someone mentioned, her Q aa Q aa is just stupid. 

On top of that she can really abuse fleet/demonic/rift unlike anyone else. She also has slows, MS, dashes + the W which kind of makes it impossible to lane against her or even trade with her. 

With her W, the main issue is that she can Q AA you and instantly just disappear again. There is no delay on the invis, it's instant. 

But honestly, it's mainly the AP items that are broken, like every other goddamn season. Especially for AP assassins, cause the items give you HP aswell. Imagine a viable lethality item for zed,kha or talon that gives let's say 300+hp? They would be unstoppable.

"alevelmaths","t5_2z1ot","Okay, I have an idea. You can't evaluate the integral at 0, because the area diverges, but you know that when x=1, y also equals 1, so one section of the area will be that 1x1 square. From there, you can evaluate the integral between 1 and 2, which gives you the area between the graph, the vertical line and the x-axis.

Then (I think you can do this), because you know that y = 1/(x\^2), if you flip x and y, you get the same graph but with flipped axes. So, you get x = 1/(y\^2), and therefore y = sqrt(1/x). Then, you evaluate that integral between 1 and 4, which will give you the same value as the area between the graph, the horizontal line and the y-axis. Sum those all up, and you're good to go.

 Your temps shouldn't give you a problem at all. Those are a good range. I wouldn't worry about them in the winter at all. Make sure there's no funky winds that blow into their enclosures or any drips, and they'll be probably more happy than in the summer.

If you notice them getting cold or shivering, small plastic tubs tipped upside down with a hole cut in them and filled with hay can provide them somewhere warm to hide out.

&gt;There are also issues with these types of barrel nut systems and possible POI shift if the barrel is struck

I have heard you say that before, but I looked and looked and couldn't find any information on that. Do you know where you saw that?

I know this has been documented happening with some quick change barrel systems like BARLOC because they were incapable of generating enough tension to hold the barrel, but, of course, that is very different and totally unrelated to a barrel nut system which generates the same tension as a shouldered barrel.

I also saw a couple threads on SH theorizing this might be possible citing BARLOC, but again, very different issue.

Obviously, barrel nuts on rifles are not new. RPRs have them (though a little more AR style), Savages (including their new PRS production class rifle) have them, and I haven't found information on impact caused POI shift happening on those platforms either.

I tried this myself using a rubber mallet on my Rem/Age a while back (before I put a Grendel barrel on it) and couldn't see any changes, but it wasn't clear how hard the barrel had to be hit for it to happen on BARLOC (like dropping it maybe)?",1609459398

On one hand, the minutes and opportunities are there, but he‚Äôs not producing at a level that fantasy players and the wizards need a starter to produce.  If he doesn‚Äôt figure it out soon, the wizards will have to move him to the bench and give those minutes to somebody else.  

On the other hand, he‚Äôs a rookie coming in from overseas and playing in the NBA.  He simply needs time to adjust to how much more competitive and more athletic NBA players are.  The coaches obviously see something in and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs playing this much.  

Personally, I think he can figure it out.  I‚Äôll wait a couple more weeks to see how he pans out.  Give the wizards sometime to gel and figure their new team out.

"alberta","t5_2qxon","Maternity leave and paternity leave are separate.

Maternity leave is strictly for birth mothers before and after childbirth.  That, I believe, is 15 weeks.

Paternity leave can be shared between the parents.  It‚Äôs between 35 or 61 weeks; depending on whether you want to go the 12 months or 18 months leave.  So say you want to do 12 months leave.  Your wife gets 15 weeks maternity leave for herself. And say she wants to only go for another 20 weeks from paternity leave and leave 15 weeks for you to bond with your baby.  Then that‚Äôs your paternity leave (her 20 weeks, you 15 weeks).

Your wife doesn‚Äôt need to switch between maternity and paternity leave.  It‚Äôs automatic.  You only need to notify them if you plan to use part of the paternity leave as well.

Also, another suggestion is claim for the 12 month leave rather than 18 months.  The 18 months is 12 month pay spread over 18 months.  If, for some reason, your wife decides to return back to work prior to 18 months then she would not receive the remainder of the 18 months.",1609459400

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it.**

"Choices","t5_2rd24","Mine:

First off more GOC books. All of the GOC books we had this year were released in Winter/Spring (I don't count FA as a 2020 book since it was released two days before the beginning of 2021 so it will be more of a 2021 book). Sure the hiatus for OH did help with that dry spell, but there was nothing new coming out that was a GOC book since April when DS released. So more GOC books moving forward, which PB did state that they have some coming in 2021. Looking at the GL books this year, only one can we say had to be genderlocked, and that's Baby Bump 2.

Focus a little less on romance books, and have a little more diverse genres in 2021.

If there are future single LI books then please don't make the single LI like Sam in TNA. More single LIs like Dakota in WEH.

Give the MCs some personality, and don't make them all blank slates, though be a little weary on that as we want the MCs to be likable and not like the Witness MC or the MTFL MC.

Villains who aren't cartoony (looking at Lauren in MTFL and Principal Strickler in RT).

Cut back on books taking place in high school/college. This year we had MTFL and QB. Now we can safely say that at least MTFL isn't entirely about the school, but to my understanding QB was set on a college campus. FA just released and while the first couple of chapters are taking place at a college, it's too early to say if the whole book will take place at the college. Also in addition to the high school/college books we've got this year, we've had in years past had HSS, HSSCA, TFS, TE, ILITW which are all in a high school/college setting. Best leave school for awhile.

While on the high school/college subject, how about some books where the MC is at least 25 or older. I am past high school/college age, so maybe some older MCs would work. We had OH 2 this year where the MC was past college. We also have the lawyer book coming so the MC in that book will likely be older than college age (unless they do something like make the MC an intern at a law firm).

Well those are some of my ideas.",1609459402

  ""Eles pegam os seus jatinhos e os subalternos v√£o de caix√£o para o cemit√©rio"", escreve um internauta.

 Sempre em tom ir√¥nico, as legendas mandam recado √†s pessoas que n√£o seguem as medidas para conter o avan√ßo do novo coronav√≠rus.

 Em outra situa√ß√£o denunciada pelo perfil, desta vez em Barra Grande, no Piau√≠, dezenas de pessoas sem m√°scaras se aglomeram numa embarca√ß√£o.

 ""Mais uma barca furada com m√∫sica ruim e Covid. Gente, que combina√ß√£o!"", diz a legenda.

I use to write down the name of every formula in random order that we were learning about that exam. Then I'd challenge myself to write out the formula(s) that correspond to the correct name.

I started doing that about half way through the semester and it helped me recognize when to use what much faster than before. That list also makes studying for the ACS a bit more convenient.",1609459402

Angelicanin gozunden ya≈ü geliyordu. Cok gecmeden hi√ßkirarak aglamaya ba≈üladi. 

Angelica: Ya ger√ßekten √∂z√ºr dilerim k√∂t√º bir amacim yoktu ye-(hi√ßkirik)-hmin ederim!.. 

Gwen angelicanin agladigini gorunce bir an
geri adim atti. I√ßinden acaba fazla mi ileri gittim diye dusunurken angelica yeniden soze girdi. 

Angelica: niyetim ger√ßekten kotu degildi ben sadece.......sadece felix e anlatabilirim uzgunum. 

Gwen donup felix e bakti. Gwen biraz sakinlesmise benziyordu. Yinede ilk once ofkeli bir sekilde nefesini verdi. Sonra elindeki kamerayi yere firlatti ve kapiyi √ßarpip cikti. Kamera yerde bir 2 defa sekti ve duvara carpip durdu. Aksiyon kamerasi oldugu i√ßin hasar almamisti. 

Odada felix bilge ve angelica birbirine bakiyordu. Felix sakince nefesini verince bilge de ayaga kalkti cikarken angelicanin omzuna dokundu. 

Bilge: (Ben √ßikiyorum) 

Angelica bilge √ßikarken arkasindan gulumsedi. Sonra kafasini felix'e dondurdugunde felix'i kollarini birbirine dolamis bir sekilde kendine bakarken buldu. 

Felix: Pekala ilk once... neden? 

Angelica tek eliyle diger kolunun dirsegini tuttu. Felix'in yuzune bakamiyordu. Yuzunu sag alta √ßevirip o sekilde konusmaya basladi. 

Angelica: Be..ben sadece se...seni cok begendim! O yuzden yani engel olamadim yani nasil desem bilemiyorum felix nolur anlayisla karsila nolur! 

Felix'in akli baya karismisdi. Kiza onu gizlu kamerayla kaydettirecek kadar ne yapmis olabilirdi ki? Hem de tanimadigi bir kiza. 

Felix: Na-nasil yani NE ZAMANDAN BERI?! 

Angelica kafasini yeniden egdi. 

Angelica: Ya dun ben sizi gwen'le takip ettim. Gwen senin odana girmisti. Siz odada ≈üey i≈üte opusurken sizi dinledim. Inan bana nasil oldu bilmiyorum sana √ßok delilercesine a≈ük beslemeye ba≈üladim inan nasil oldu bilmiyorum. 

Felix: Hay anasini satayim ben biliyorum off angelica √ßok uzgunum ya. 

Angelica kafasi karismis bir sekilde yuzuny kaldirio sorgulayici gozlerle felix'e bakti. Sonra felix devam etti. 

Felix: Ben sadece dusunce okumuyorum. Ayni zamanda duygularimi ba≈ükasina da aktarabiliyorum ve bu bazen kontrolden √ßikiyor yaniiii anladin sen kafamdaki de o yuzden iste. Ama sunu bil o hissettiklerin tamamen sahte. Birkac gune yok olacaklar. 

Angelica: Bir saniye cidden mi? 

Felix: Aynen oyle lutfen o hissetiklerini goz ardi et olur mu? Onlar senin oz duygularin degil. Ayrica neden bizi dinledin ki? 

Angelica: Asil o konuda benim ozur dilemem gerek ger√ßekten √ßok salak√ßaydi yani ben nasil desem bilmiyorum ger√ßekten ozur dilerim sadece yani birileri bir yerde bir seyler yasadiginda gidip bakmayi seviyorum bilmiyorum boyle seyler bana ilgin√ß geliyor. 

Felix: Lutfen bir daha baskasini o sekilde gozetleme. Gelmseydim gwen seni atomlarina ayirabilirdi. 

Angelica: yeniden ozur dilerim. 

Felix:Bende

Gwen o gece angelicaya olan sinirinden odasinda uyumak istemedi. Felix'le beraber kalmaya karar verdi. 

Gwen: (Boyle bir sey yaptigina inanmiyorum resmen seni ifsalayip kim bilir o kayitla ne yapacakti!) 

Felix: (Aman bosver anlattim ya iste sana durumu. Benim de sucum var biraz kaski cikarmamam lazimdi.) 

Felix gwenin alnini optu. Gwen kafasi hari√ß vucudu yorganin altindaydi. Felixi tisortunden kavramis bir sekilde sarilmis, kafasini da gogusune yaslamisti. Felix ise kafasini yatagij basligina yaslamisti bir eliyle basinin arkasinu turarken diger eli ile gwene sariliyordu. 

Felix esnerken konustu. 

Felix: (Yarin buyuk gun gwen. Seni bilmem ama ben uykuluyum. Iyi geceler?) 

Gwen hic yuz ifadesunu degistirmeden felix'in dediklerini kabul etti. Felix kafasini yastiga koymak icin egilirken felix'i birakti ve o da uyumak icin diger tarafa dondu. Felix gwenin ona arkasini dondugunu gorunce her ne kadar az biraz kizarsa da o da diger tarafini dondu. Felix duygularini kontrol altinda tutmazsa bu gecenin yeni bireyler i√ßin yari≈ü tabancasinin patlatilma ani olacaginu biliyordu. Bunu goze alamazdi. O da diger tarafa donup uyudu. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Felix sabah uyandiginda gozlerini ilk once a√ßmamak i√ßin israr etti. Dun gece aklina gelince yatakta tek olmadigi gercegi kafasinda √ßakti. Gozlerinu fal ta≈üi gibu acmasina neden oldu. Yava≈ü√ßa dogrulmak istedi. Elleriyle yataktan destek alip ki√ßinin uzerine oturdu. Gozlerini yatagin diger tarafina √ßevirdiginde goz bebekleri %500 oraninda buyudugune yemin edebilirdi. 

Gwenin goguslerinden biri askili atletinden disari sarkiyordu. Gwen hala fosur fosur uyuyordu. Bu yuzden farkina varmamisti. Felix ona dokunma istegine karsi koydu. Onun yerine kizin atletinden tuttu ve gogusunu geri orttu. Bunu yaparken burnunun kanamamis olmasini diliyordu.

Tek bildigi sey felix'in burada kalmasi hem buradakilar i√ßin bir tehlike hem de felix'in kendisi i√ßin bir zaman kaybiydi.

"CompetitiveEDH","t5_2y62p","Cedh Dbz journey: 

1. You first meet a Radditz. He comes into your store and fucks up your shit and your friend's shit. Hes not even good but he's the first guy to show you the first infinite you've ever seen. 
After showing you every baby's first combo (palachron and dead eye navigator) you sit in shock as he walks away with your pack for winning the pod. ""nothing personal kid"" as he walks off.  

2. You then train with your friend and begin to explore ""better"" cards. you guys start playing with easy go to combos but your cmc is still pretty high and you haven't dipped into any expensive cards yet outside of what you own. Radditz comes around every now and again and you do managed to beat him sometimes. The last pod you play with him you beat him soundly.
Sharing your experience with him while talking to him over the card store case he begins to tell you all the expensive cards that are even better that he can't afford. You peer over finally looking at the cards. Things like Vampiric tutor, Demonic tutor, any tutor come across as you begin to realize what power is. He tells you about the other stores in the area and how they play. You are intrigued. 

3. You start playing at other stores. Some of which you become the new Radditz to. Other's you are punked around. You start to run into Vegetas and Nappas. These punks aren't as nice but if you're willing to learn you begin to pick up things on how they play.  You start looking for more things like Untapped mana and you start wondering about what they have in their hands. During this time you also start cutting out more ""bad cards"" in for better cards. You pick up on shocks and even get some fetch lands. Still The two sians have not dragged Dual lands out of you but once again you are shown the power as It makes 3-5 color decks so powerful and easier to manage. During this time you let go of your shitty earth deck you fought Raddits with and begin to browse the higher tier commanders. At this point your friends during the Radditz saga ether grow with you or leave. Yamcha dies to a siaba man. 

4. Radditz at this point is a fading memory. You chuckle as you think about the cards you used to play for fun. You even laugh at the fact you used to watch podcasts talking about edh and other useless media. You really don't play in more casual pods anymore as the thrill of playing for free is boring. Plus you don't wanna come off as a dick.  You now have your full shocks and fetches, top, all the big money tutors, you even picked up a mana drain and force of will from the recent reprints. Vegeta and Nappa at this point are no longer teaching you anything. In fact you beat them more often than they win however its not always a walk in the park. They are your new colleges and probably your new store you hang out at since not many others play at their aggressive pace. 

5. Namik: you hear from a friend of a friend and some other colleagues theres this weird ass store 45 mins away that plays ""for real"" they play for prizes.(not just a 4 dollar pack) It's not much but it is for real money (or rather you pay money to get in and store credit goes to the winner, some how it avoids gambling at the same time being gambling)  Here you first meet Freeza and the Ginyu force. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezrbyf6t9mY 
They aren't that much stronger than you really  they aren't but since you're always under the blade of losing money you feel the pressure to perform. No take backs. If you play a land you can't just pick it up again and say ""my bad"". If you make play mistakes, people let you make them and you live with the consequences. Its not unsportsmanship but since it's for prizes there is an understanding that the real rules (the actual rules) of magic are followed. Judge calls are made regularly. The Ginyu force are a group of guys that play like Spikes but you can also tell many of them are Johnnys at hearts.  What separates them from Freeza is that Freeza is a full on Spike. He plays Top teir commander, Has dual lands on the regular as well as access to most high powered cards. After many more weeeks and months of playing with these guys you managed to get off 1 win. You played everything efficient and smart in the end you trick Freeza with a trick he showed you so many months ago. You finally go Super sain! it's a bitter sweet moment, although its nice to win to get there you have spent real money getting more expensive cards and really grinding to get there. You not only thrown tons of money at the game but you also grow as a player. You now understand the power of cards like Mental mistep, gitaxian probe and Stifle. You begin to also understand good cards from bad cards during spoiler season. You get facebook messages from friends like ""did you see the new 6/6 that comes out for 12cmc?"" and you pretend to be happy for them but really you are just disgusted that people get happy over bad cards. During this time you also aren't  winning regularly with the ginyu force and Freeza. Winning is still a rarity as all players are playing with high end cards and well tuned decks. During the years of playing with them you once again think you are playing at the top however unknown to you another transformation takes place. 

6. Andriod/cell saga:  The last couple of years have been great as you begin to grow in the game. You are pretty dedicated to the format, even to go as far as spending some or all of your stimulus money on the game. As you reach your 30s you and the people around you aren't just getting the best cards anymore. You guys are foiling out your decks and getting masterpieces. You wouldn't be caught dead with a non-foil brainstorm in your deck.  Better yet you've tapped into the meta so closely that you know whats in your opponents hand. You Know what he vamped tutor for because you've seen him/her play the deck so many times. You know the right turn to cast your commander, you even are able to speculate who wins which pods based on just knowing the player and their decks so well. As wins become more common place for you, you begin to realize that many tables you play at cedh or casual you start becoming the Arch enemy at many of the tables you sit at. You are able to keep up with all of your opponents shenanigans all the while managing your board like a pro. Long ago does the banter of ""how was your week?"" goes away and the more monotone ""how many cards in your hand"" takes place as you have hidden most of your emotions at this point as you do not want to give anything away. 
thats right, you are the demons. You become the androids. The other guys are much the same. You're all just a bunch of murder hungry robots as you spend your time killing each other. The games are ether over in 3 turns or 30 turns depending on how petty you all wish to be. Winning a pod of Cedh at this point and getting the Store credit prize is to become Perfect Cell at this point.

"BridgertonNetflix","t5_21t8e4","I don't think the situation is as cut and dry, and I'm far more uneasy about how it was portrayed in the books.

I think the current showerunner said they kept the scene because it was part of Daphne's sexual growth and discovery (I.e. she learns that she has agency, how babies are made, that she's been lied too). I did see that when I watched the show, but also I read it as a survival move on Daphnes part. She needs a child to have a viable future.

In the books the scene is more ambiguous - but I tend to read it as being an inversion of all of the tropes in earlier romances where the woman  gets 'ravished' (read raped) or tricked into sex by the hero. 

The book that springs to mind for me when I think scenes to compare this one to is 'Secret Fire' where the herione is drugged twice with an aphrodisiac so the prince can sleep with her. There's also ""a rose in winter"" where the hero is actually married to the heroine, but she doesn't realise it as he's pretending to be two people. So the herione sleeps with her husband (who she didn't have a choice in marrying and who she's been scared of sleeping with) to try to avoid the temptation of another man - not realising they are in fact the same person.

Scenes like these are a common romance trope, but for some reason Daphne taking advantage of Simon makes people uneasy ( the Duke and I was published a decade after secret fire so we have about 3 decades or more of rapey hero's that society seemed to be just fine with).",1609459406

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Madri e Londres chegaram a um ""princ√≠pio de acordo"" sobre Gibraltar, o que permitir√° manter a liberdade de circula√ß√£o na fronteira entre a Espanha e o enclave brit√¢nico no sul da Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, anunciou a ministra espanhola de Assuntos Exteriores, Arancha Gonz√°lez Laya, nesta quinta-feira (31).

 O pequeno territ√≥rio brit√¢nico ser√° inserido na[ zona Schengen, de livre circula√ß√£o de pessoas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/veja-casos-em-que-brasileiros-podem-entrar-na-uniao-europeia.shtml) ‚Äîformado por 22 pa√≠ses da Uni√£o Europeia mais Noruega, Su√≠√ßa, Isl√¢ndia e Liechtenstein‚Äî, afirmou Gonz√°lez Laya. O Reino Unido nunca fez parte deste espa√ßo.

 O acordo foi alcan√ßado poucas horas antes da entrada em vigor do[ brexit, que come√ßa nesta sexta (1¬∞) ,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/12/saiba-como-o-brexit-afeta-viagens-estudo-e-trabalho.shtml) evitando, assim, que a divisa entre Gibraltar e Espanha se tornasse uma fronteira dura entre Reino Unido e Uni√£o Europeia.

 ""Esse princ√≠pio de acordo servir√° de base a um futuro tratado entre UE e Reino Unido em rela√ß√£o a Gibraltar"", afirmou a ministra. ""Assim, levanta-se o port√£o. Schengen se aplica a Gibraltar com a Espanha.""

 Gonz√°lez Laya se referiu especialmente aos gibraltinos e aos habitantes da zona fronteiri√ßa com a Espanha, ""que temiam os efeitos de um brexit duro"" e que agora ""podem respirar aliviados"".

 ""O pacto nos permitir√° eliminar barreiras e avan√ßar para uma zona de prosperidade compartilhada"", publicou no Twitter o premi√™ espanhol, o socialista Pedro S√°nchez.

  Desde que [o acordo entre Londres e Bruxelas foi alcan√ßado, em 24 de dezembro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/12/reino-unido-e-uniao-europeia-fecham-acordo-e-saga-do-brexit-chega-ao-fim-depois-de-4-anos.shtml)‚Äîo qual n√£o se aplica a Gibraltar‚Äî, Espanha e Reino Unido negociavam, com um prazo apertado, uma regula√ß√£o que impedisse uma fronteira dura na regi√£o, com controles de passaportes e obst√°culos alfandeg√°rios.

 Cerca de 15 mil pessoas, espanh√≥is em sua grande maioria, cruzam a fronteira todos os dias para trabalhar no territ√≥rio brit√¢nico na foz do Mar Mediterr√¢neo.

 Caso as negocia√ß√µes fossem malsucedidas, o governo de Gibraltar criaria um registro para que esses trabalhadores pudessem continuar cruzando a fronteira com seus documentos de identidade, sem complica√ß√µes, limitando o eventual impacto da decis√£o.

 Uma fronteira exigindo passaportes tamb√©m teria afetado o turismo, uma importante fonte de recursos para Gibraltar. As autoridades temiam ainda complica√ß√µes na log√≠stica para a entrada de mercadorias, uma vez que o territ√≥rio importa 100% dos alimentos de seus 34 mil habitantes.",1609459407

"Professors","t5_2svhp","Those alleged abuses are specified in the same document:

&gt;**XII. We demand that the Bi-Co stop its violence against disabled students.** Similarly to BIPOC members at Haverford College: through purported academic rigor, the weaponization of academic forced leave, **a wheelchair unfriendly campus**, inaccessible, white-dominated mental health services, and an under-resourced Office of Access Services, disabled students are continuously pushed out of our community. Many BIPOC students who are disabled, impaired, and/or neurodivergent face violence from professors, administrators, Deborah Alder, and Access Services staff. This can be countered through:  
&gt;  
&gt;A. More transparency between Access Services staff, whose practice is informed by the racial and economic origins of mental illness and the acknowledgment of structural disparities in diagnoses and healing services.  
&gt;  
&gt;B. The establishment of a full-time Access Services coordinator as well as multiple support staff who are able to authorize accommodations. BIPOC disabled students should be involved in the process of hiring these new staff.  
&gt;  
&gt;C. No requirements for verification or documentation from ‚Äúa licensed professional‚Äù for academic and housing accommodations as this is exclusionary to low-income, BIPOC students.   
&gt;  
&gt;D. Consequences for professors who neglect necessary accommodations for students.   
&gt;  
&gt;E. The permanent abolishment of strict mandatory attendance policies.  
&gt;  
&gt;F. The abolition of mandated reporting of mental health details to police, CPS, and/or administrative authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;G. Campus Safety should *never* be called during a mental health crisis, unless the student expressly consented prior.

This is actually a great example of how being specific can backfire--the college doesn't have the authority to rewrite mandatory reporting laws, for instance, and doling out consequences to professors is...always a tricky situation from both an ethical and contractual perspective, and if students had more access to institutional information I doubt they would have suggested it. More general goals would have actually been more actionable. With that being said, there are also some very obviously good points here: wheelchair access is very often neglected on campuses, and it's not shocking in the slightest that the College hasn't made it a priority. Writing everything here off as ""give us better grades and free cash"" isn't really fair; evidently many of the students striking aren't even directly affected and are striking out of solidarity with their wheelchair-using comrades. 

&gt;Can we also empower the students who want to attend classes amid all this? They don‚Äôt seem so empowered here.

It seems unlikely to me that the scabs are genuinely disempowered. They also signed up for Bryn Mawr, which is known for doing this betimes. They'll be fine. If they aren't, maybe they should strike.

&gt;I really don‚Äôt wish to argue with you and I assume your heart is in the right place but ‚Äúif it was important enough to a group of people, it justifies any means‚Äù is a dangerous and arbitrary standard.

Writ-large? Sure. This is an entirely nonviolent coordinated civil disobedience, which is worth amplifying, because if we don't, we'll get violent centralized civil unrest, and eventually revolt. If we don't show students that nonviolence works, nonviolence will stop working, and we will be dealing with worse problems.

It also doesn't really matter what we think, which is why I am generally so dismissive here. The times they are a-changin', and the academic senate has yet to be consulted. These young people are the future of our Earth, and they will surpass us. The wheel keeps on turning, and sometime tomorrow we will wake up and find that these are the people who are deciding what our academic and educational worlds will look like.",1609459407

Especially for [Higu question Arcs- on 2nd thought, better do not read it. It is basically just me rambling in the POV of me watching the anime but maybe it is spoilery. I do not trust myself](/s ""Satoshi. That dude sounded more like an allegory for me in the beginning who was the victim of the magic in this village, the parallel to K1 you point out made me think along the line of narrator intent. Why would K1 and Satoshi be paralleled you know, what do they have in common? Also the whole thing about being sorry and punishment, being followed. What is behind all that and has it even a goal? Is this just for me as the reader/viewer? What also got me thinking, just like you, is the stuff about K1 being the scion of his household, like why mention it in the first place? And then he can apparently cause the deaths of people by wishing for it"")

But it is a rather fair mystery in the end and that is why I have no problem with this very long build up of the question arcs",1609459408

And you can request additional funds in the future if you can show you should have gotten them initially, or perhaps have continuing needs.

Is $1k what you would've been eligible for under the old grant program?  Just a thought - they may have subtracted out $1k from your loan amount, thinking you already got a grant, or, if not, they maybe are expecting you to possibly soon be eligible get that as a grant.  No one is really sure, we're all waiting for the SBA to put out their specific guidelines for who's eligible and how to get the new grant funds.

OP your wife is having twins, which are more likely to be born premie. She should not being doing these kinds of diet/fast things without talking to a doctor. 

OP I am very worried for these babies. You probably are as well. You probably shouldn't have called her a terrible mother (kind of an asshole move) but she is putting them at risk if she is doing exactly what you said.

Then you can just move the 4th R-Layer (so the one where the pieces is located in) and move it to the front layer (you could write that as 4r‚Äò). Next you have to move it away, notice that the important piece was 2 from the front on the U layer, after the 4r‚Äò it will be 2 from the bottom on the F layer. That means now you have to do a 2d (move the second layer from the bottom away, basically again the layer in which our piece is) you could also do a 2d‚Äò here that doesn‚Äôt really change the outcome. After that you simply invert both moves (first do a 4r then 2d(‚Äò)). And that‚Äôs it you have moved a piece in just 4 turns. Thats basically all you need you just have to figure out which piece you Want to move for your mosaic. (Keep in Mind that the above technique will Affect all 6 sides, there‚Äòs another which only affects two sides but that one is a bit more complicated)
You can also change the technique a little by moving 2 or more layers at once to move larger blocks. But you can easily figure that out now.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

"PS5","t5_2s887","&gt;	I really hope more game devs pick up on this since these two features, lock-on targeting and animation locks, are the bane of my existence.

I don't think it makes sense to make a general statement about animation locks being bad. Having it or not having it are very different ""design tools"" for very different types of gameplay experiences. No animation allows button mashing and doesn't require you to be tactical, but just tests your reflexes. 

If you would add Dynasty Warriors combat to Dark Souls it would be the most dull, boring game ever. If you allowed players to cancel all animations in a fighting game like Tekken it would destroy the entire game. Of course also adding Dark Souls combat to Devil May Cry would be a pretty horrendous time. 

I'm not saying you need to like animation locks, but maybe you can appreciate the effects it has on gameplay even if you don't enjoy it personally. Like, I hate playing competitive RTS games, I think they're way too stressful and overwhelming. But I appreciate they exist and I can definitely see why someone would enjoy playing them",1609459409

"Futadomworld","t5_335xe","Caption text:

You were afraid when you were arrested that your punishment for being involved in a fraudulent scam would be severe, but thanks to her, things turned out differently. She was just the officer who picked you up, no special agent or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù enforcement, but she had a reputation ‚Äì not for either cruelty or going easy, but for effectiveness, incorruptibility. She must have seen potential in you ‚Äì a kind of love at first sight.

She hadn‚Äôt planned to settle down with a boi until her time in a police uniform was done, but she changed her mind for you. She was right ‚Äì all you really needed was a firm, guiding hand, a rock to lean on as you serve each other and she protects you. Your instincts took over fast, any shame from kneeling before her and wrapping your lips around her cock quickly forgotten in the rush of pleasure you received from doing so.

With her earnest love came a hint of perversion, too. Though not obsessed to an unhealthy degree, control was her thing, and there were rules to follow ‚Äì what to wear around the house, what to call her‚Ä¶. and how you were to cum, your intense orgasms coming only from her toying with or fucking your ass. She was a woman of few words, yet she always listened if you expressed a desire or concern.

You were tamed as well as conquered, needing fewer spankings for rulebreaking over time to the point where it almost never occurred, and she was elated with you, cherishing you. One day she brought home a little white dress, intent on carrying you down the aisle, never once putting you down during the whole wedding ceremony.

Years later‚Ä¶. Dinner in the oven, you hear your futa-husband unlocking the door, returning from work. She towers above you as she opens the door with a smile ‚Äì you‚Äôre there to greet her. ‚ÄúWelcome home!‚Äù you coo as she begins removing her brown uniform shirt, revealing the tight body armor underneath. ‚ÄúGood boy. Get me a drink,‚Äù she orders as usual, and you obey.

When you come back, her sweat-drenched, muscular body is already lounging in her favorite chair, green eyes looking right at you as her fuckpole stands straight and tall between her legs and her heavy balls hang off the front edge of the chair, good and ready for you. You place her drink on the table and crawl to her, kneeling on your pink pillow, breathing her hot musk in deeply. Your lips are pressed against her cock in seconds, getting noisy with your kissing and lapping at her cocksweat as she plays with your hair.

Her expressions of pleasure are primal, and a bit deep in pitch, but she lets you know when she is ready for more with simple words: ‚ÄúSuck me, babe.‚Äù You blush and whine, bobbing up and down on her thick rod in seconds. After a while, she gently thrusts her hips to tell you it‚Äôs time for some facefucking, and she ruts your lips for a while as you continue to worship her, until she stops, lifting you up to put her on her lap, facing her, that cock teasing your ass.

Fuzzy handcuffs find their way around your wrists, and you spend a long time bouncing, riding, her hand guiding you to suck one of her breasts. You spend an even longer time being French kissed roughly, held by your hips, your ass hammered as you squirm in bliss and dribble little loads onto her abs. Eventually, she removes your handcuffs and lifts you up easily to kneel before her again. ‚ÄúTime for your dinner,‚Äù she huffs as you help her cum all over herself, mixing her big load with your tiny ones. ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Ä¶‚Äù she pants as you lick and lap at her muscular body.",1609459410

In the beginning of this year I lost 25 pounds in 4 months so I‚Äôm confident I know how to do it healthily. What I lack is the ongoing motivation and when quarantine started I cancelled my gym membership and I was using COVID as an excuse like everyone else to stop my progress. I gained the 25 pounds back and more up to this point. I‚Äôd love to keep eachother accountable and message eachother about our progress and motivate eachother if you want. The big difference this year is I‚Äôm not going to be going to the gym (only home workouts) so in that sense it‚Äôs harder to motivate myself. I‚Äôm also not surrounded by the people I used to go to the gym with and who were also trying to lose weight so I could definitely use a support system as well. If you‚Äôre wondering, I plan to be eating a high protein diet, around 1400 calories and doing body weight exercises, some kettle bell or dumbbell excerises,  and maybe some jogging too.

Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear struggle from the fact that we don't know how the framing narrative works. It isn't clear if the story we're reading is actually the story of Kvothe or Qote's interpretation of Kvothe's story. 

I know that might seem like it is obvious, but the hallmark of the unreliable narrator is that the story itself subtle gives away the game. We've seen some things that might end up being that, but we won't know until the final book (books) come out. 
 
Depending on how many of those things turn out, Kvothe is either an interesting Wish Fulfillment/Unreliable Narrator character, or just Rothfuss using his novels as mental masturbation. This is one of the problems with most unfinished works: it's hard to tell from the middle.",1609459411

"tezos","t5_3f53f","Oh boy, here you are again spouting baseless, inaccurate information. Personally, I feel like you need to slow down a little bit because you are inadvertently giving this community a bad look. Im going to correct the factually inaccurate info so you are more informed going forward.

'Key word here is ""idea"" Parachains are not operational yet.'

**Fact:** you've got this right. What you fail to mention is that the first parachains are slated to launch in Q1. There have been successful interchain asset transfers completed on testnet, which is the first time that two different chains have been able to communicate with each other that Im aware of.

'Tezos is not a copy paste Ethereum chain (unlike Polka, Near, Tron, Neo and on and on).' 

**Fact:** Polkadot and Neo are not copy paste clones, this is blatantly false. They were both built from the ground up, NEO was written in C# and Polkadot in Rust. Can you show me any evidence that they copy pasted given that they were written in completely different languages? Ill give you tron, I know nothing about NEAR.

'Tezos is much more accomplished and capable than many of the chains that are mooning.'

**Fact:** the markets seem to disagree with this and Im willing to wager to collective markets are smarter than you and I. I think Tezos will have its day in the sun, but right now the markets are talking and seem to be excited by newer projects than older ones.

'What that means is that all you really need is Ethereum and Tezos -- everything else is redundant.'

**Fact:** Bitcoin is not redundant. There are many blockchains doing interesting things, claiming redundancy with everything is very close minded.

'The competition is between Tezos and Ethereum and Bitcoin (but people mistakenly think we are in competition with Polka, Tron, Neo, Near and so on).'

**Fact:** the competition is between centralized services/institutions and blockchain, every innovation is important to the ecosystem succeeding and different attempts at similar concepts will be important to parse out the best ideas from the weaker ideas. If decentralization fails, then everyone loses.

'Polkadot has been close to scaling Ethereum for years! years!'

**Fact:** Polkadot launched its mainnet in May of 2020. Not sure how an unoperational blockchain was claiming that they were close to scaling Ethereum for years...

'And in the meantime Ethereum now has layer 2. Polka is not needed.'

**Fact:**Ethereum wont be scalable for at least 2 more years. They have completed phase 0 which has no scaling properties. A scaling solution that maintains the security of a L1 network is a vast improvement on many of the clunky layer 2 scaling solutions (many of which are less secure).

I appreciate the effort of you trying to figure out how to help the ecosystem, I really do. But please stop spreading incorrect information and making it about an us vs them game. Ill repeat what I said to you last time, were all in this together.",1609459412

"ADHD_partners","t5_ko7d1","sophia333, I said in a reply above something I believe you need to hear. I'll quote it:

 

&gt;""you taking the lead on everything""  
&gt;  
&gt;It's crappy, but unfortunately true. Most DX guys are too stressed out, too bummed out, too caught up in their own mess of a head to really take the lead on ANYTHING. I know from experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to! - don't get me wrong, but, the stress of everything is overwhelming and it's difficult to break free of that web of stress to be open to anything else other than your responsibilities.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also have to say this - and I'm sure other DX guys would agree - that having your NT woman take the lead on some things is such a god damn turn on when you're used to doing all the first moves. It's also really refreshing and it really **highlights** just how much you care about us. So much so, that we would *probably even take the lead more often* knowing that you are ready and willing to.

I know this sucks! I know you want your relationship with your DX guy to be gender-typical, but, unfortunately, due to the overwhelming demand they face in their own head, they find this difficult. I know. It really sucks. I feel for you, just like I feel for my partner. I want to show them that I can plan a date, but a lot of times my thought pattern cannot deviate past my daily duties to allow me to plan anything.

And, if you know anything about us DX guys, it's **we aren't going to do anything we won't 100% succeed in.** So if we don't know our plan is going to be the best, we won't even attempt it above our already overwhelming (to us) daily responsibilities.

Let me ask you something, does your man plan dates (man-dates, obviously) with other guys? This might tell you a lot.",1609459414

"Permaculture","t5_2qkib","Definitely agree there are certain advantages to grain. Variety is good and I'm by no way implying that we should just grow an acre of sweet potato and nothing else.

All I'm saying is that saying ""gardeners don't grow grain"" so ""permaculture can't produce enough on an acre to feed enough people"" is debateable.

I'm just trying to point out that it IS possible to feed several families WITH variety off one acre.

Also a lot of the issues that we've had historically are no longer quite so relevant (of course they still are, just not as much).E.g we certainly have now have the power to easily ship things across the world in a few days in an relatively economical fashion. We also know the perfect temperature and manner to store food. We also have access to many different types of foods previously not available to our historical ancestors (i.e most modern ""Fruit"" didn't exist a few hundred years ago or was at least not available).

Also I don't know about you but I have absolutely no problems storing potatoes, pumpkins etc for close to half a year, at least long enough to tide me over winter/autumn.

Just saying ""growing grain"" isn't a standard to measure ""how well you can feed a population"".",1609459414

"askcarsales","t5_2vhkv","TLDR: MID 2000s Volvo tech locked me into the car on a 90+ degree summer day.

I had a Volvo of all vehicles that had a MAJOR safety flaw your wife could relate to. 

It's summer and about 95 degrees F outside sun blazing. 2007 volvo with laser key. Get in the car, close the door, turn the key to ignition, doors auto lock, engine turns over then goes dead. Ugh I think wth could this be? Try taking key out but it's locked in place (will go to acc but not further). Perhaps the immobilizer i think, maybe a fuse?. Come to open the door and its locked. Push the unlock and its digital, won't unlock, there is no manual/analog unlock its all digital. Can't take off the door panel either while it's closed.


It's getting pretty hot now and I can't take out the key, can't roll down the windows, can't unlock or open the door, Can't drop the rear seat and crawl out that trunk and the car is completely dead. (For a good minute I was in denial that Volvo wouldn't have a fail safe for this) I think okay, I'll give it another 10 mins max then calling rescue to break out the window. I've read 20 mins+ in a hot car in 95+f temps can make a person pass out and figure I'll need 10 min buffer at least for emergency services...


So I sit there and think ""why would the engine turn over strongly then whole car dies?"" Then it clicks, the battery terminal must be lose!!! The engine shake when starting dislodged it.. No problem I'll just put it back.. Oh right locked in the car... So then I decide I'll  bounc up and down while hitting the unlock. Maybe I'll get lucky and shake it back into contact just long enough to unlock the door... 2 mins of this and it finally works!!! I'm free, pop the hood tighten the connector and it starts right up.

Ordered a window breaker for $10 on Amazon that night and kept it in the car after this. So your wife's fears are not completely unfounded.",1609459415

Pick out clothes now that you don't mind getting muddy, chewed on, peed on, puked on, fur on, etc. Multiple outfits, because for a while you will not be safe to wear ""nice"" clothes around your puppy (even to bed because you'll be taking it outside in the middle of the night!). I'm talking months. Your pup will have puppy nipping and jumping first, then once you can take your pup outside it'll get mud or dirt all over you, it'll step in its potty and step on your socked foot, etc etc. Just decide now what is safe to get dirty and put your other clothes far away so your pup doesn't accidentally get in them haha.",1609459415

2nd. I don't really know if there was like, a word agreement on you two being a couple, but if you allowed him to look for other girls, what happened is something you should've expected.

3rd. I don't think the relationship is really healthy for you, because, even if there was an actual solid relationship of bf and gf, with the description you gave me of him, he would've cheated anyways, bit that's not information I have, and I don't I'll ever have it, take this as just an assumption, not a definitive truth.

But you are capped at how much work you personally can do.

You may make more money instead emulating your boss (hiring people and capping their commission).

You may hate your boss and think he's an a-hole for not paying you more, but he's probably making the smart entrepreneur move. Companies have to re-shuffle employees and will experience turnover as they grow and their compensation models change. 

Did you quit to become a freelancer, or an entrepreneur like the boss you dislike (but should probably learn from and start out by emulating if he's reasonably successful)?",1609459415

Two months is early. Masks generally start to come off around month 3, and you *really* know who you‚Äôre dealing with at month 6.

You do more drugs. You sleep less. You socialize less. Anything. All these bad habits means that your gas tank (for lack of a better term) slowly shrinks. A good day will wear you the absolute fuck out because your body literally cannot handle so much physical or mental energy being put into these positive habits. It simply isn't used to it anymore. You used up that gas tank throughout the good day. Go home, eat some food if you can, ball up on the couch, and get some rest. You had a good day at work. Let it be a good day at work with recovery time at home. You don't need to check all the boxes in one day. Just like working out, if you thrash yourself, you'll feel like shit the next day.

One of the things that's really a sign of the times is how this new report lays out a variety of scenarios based on, essentially, how cooperative the two federal governments are. There's a funding scenario with hardly any federal funding, and a governance scenario that they assert wouldn't require Congress to pass a law either creating an authority, or even consenting to the states participating in one.

I honestly respect the hell out of the authors here for not treating the US federal government as a reliable partner, and planning for the worst.

1. **If you receive an offer by PM or Reddit chat**, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpokemontrades) and redirect the other user to post publicly on the subreddit. PM, DM and chat trading is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.).
2. [Full details](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny and/or event Pok√©mon. If you didn't include them, please edit your post to include them now!
3. Both you **and potential trading partners** must have [Pok√© ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades involving shiny or event Pok√©mon. 

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

"Hecate","t5_31izt","1.) Azazel is a Jewish and Christian figure. Hekate is independent of Abrahamic religion. Since Abrahamic religion teaches that there's only 1 God Almighty, it is illogical to believe in both Azazel and Hekate

2.) Neo-paganism, for the most part, does not teach that deities are absolutely good/evil. Some may be more chaotic than others, but that's not the same as wanting the worst for everyone all the time

3.) This is either a blatant shit post, or you need urgent psychiatric help. No rational pagan would claim that they talked to a deity and/or spiritual realm being through a phone, let alone clearly enough to have it identify itself to you by name because you've been asking long enough. If you're sincere in this, I strongly urge to try to reach out to a psychiatrist. Many will be busy amidst the pandemic and probably won't be able to help for at least a couple months, but at least try. Also, if you EVER believe, for whatever reason, that you will harm yourself or someone else, take yourself to an emergency room. They will be obligated to take you in as an emergency, and you will get a psychiatrist to check you out (a physician told me this, that's how I know)

4.) Assuming that you're being sincere and that your dream recollection is true, it's been my experience and reading from others that Hekate doesn't approach people unless they try to approach her first, or at the very least approach paganism in general (and even then, nothing is guaranteed). And again, Satanism and paganism are not the same thing. I'm inclined to think that Hekate is somehow a form of wishful thinking, even if you're not fully conscious of it being wishful thinking. And it is plausible, since Hekate is a ""dark"" goddess (a notion that is only partially upheld by historical lore)

5.) Aside from the theories described in #3, IF Hekate is sincerely calling you, or you want to explore that possibility further, my best advice is to drop any demon-related studies and instead study general pagan beliefs, including new-age pagan approaches, and take time to explore. It may take months. It might turn out that a separate deity was calling you that wasn't Hekate. Who knows. You'll have to do the dirty work, and unfortunately, only so much advice can be given when it's ultimately something you have to do on your own.

Also, just as a general note: paganism doesn't exist to fulfill some kind of goth/demonic/Satanist/alternative credential. Many people are pagan while enjoying goth subculture and fashion, and that's fine, but it is a nuisance to the community when someone uses one to justify the other",1609459417

"NiceHash","t5_31s3f","for someone using there Gaming PC (which is essentially what i'm doing) you should only consider mining with the CPU if you have an AMD Ryzen 3000 or newer CPU, the Intel CPU's and older AMD don't have enough L3 cache to run all the cores. If you have a Ryzen CPU good enough then look into the Large Pages Mod, this will increase the CPU hashrate.

Another piece of advice, it's all about EFFICIENCY, you want to find the sweet spot between power usage and earnings, If you can NET the same profit over power cost at a lower power setting then at a higher power setting then run the lower setting. The idea is to get the most BTC for the least amount of money spent so regardless of when you sell the BTC you are getting the best return on your electricity investment. Even if you have free power because of having Solar Power or living in an apartment with Electricity included in the Rent you still want to keep the GPU's nice and cool (sub 70* Celsius) to make them last as long as possible.

You couldn't say that in the 70's and it also might not be true in the future. Hell red states are already better than LA, let's both agree on that:

&gt; They're extremely uneducated with low GDP per capita and low incomes too 

[There is no correlation between a state's political preference and it's education levels](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education), 

Copy paste from my other comment which you refuse to look at:

As for blue states having more wealth, that's because almost all blue  states, with only a couple exceptions, have at least one urban area in  them. Large corporations which generate  the wealth tend to settle in  urban areas, not the small towns in the  middle of farmland. For  centuries, people who live more packed in urban areas tend to be more  progressive, and thus vote that way. Therefore blue states tend to be  richer and have more jobs. This doesn't make  them better places to live, the only reason they are is because of high house prices, (house prices in [Cali](https://www.zillow.com/ca/home-values/) are 300% higher than that of [GA](https://www.zillow.com/ga/home-values/), yet California's [average income](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA) is only 15% higher than that of [GA](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/georgia)), which leads to a higher [homelessness rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/727847/homelessness-rate-in-the-us-by-state/).

As for the Midwest vs the South, keep in mind that the [Midwest is shrinking in both population and economy](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/why-midwestern-cities-shrinking), while the south is growing in both those areas as well:

[https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/451454-the-souths-economy-isnt-falling-behind-its-just-getting-started](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/451454-the-souths-economy-isnt-falling-behind-its-just-getting-started)

[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/south-west-fastest-growing.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/south-west-fastest-growing.html).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Republican policies have caused their states to remain some of the poorest in the nation 

Then why do democrat states [have](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/07/31/bubble-watch-california-economy-goes-from-national-leader-to-subpar/) [shrinking](https://nypost.com/2016/12/25/heres-why-new-york-is-shrinking/) [economies](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/land-of-1000-shrinking-communities/), and have [the most debt](https://www.statista.com/statistics/312660/us-state-and-local-government-debt-outstanding-by-state/)? While Red and conservative purple states in the [west](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/fastest-growing-states) and [south](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/451454-the-souths-economy-isnt-falling-behind-its-just-getting-started) are growing?

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O Brasil registrou 1.036 √≥bitos pelo novo coronav√≠rus e 55.811 casos da doen√ßa nas √∫ltimas 24 horas. O pa√≠s, assim, chega a 194.976 √≥bitos e a 7.675.781 de pessoas infectadas pelo novo coronav√≠rus.

 Pelo terceiro dia seguido, foram registradas mais de mil mortes por dia. Foram tamb√©m registrados mais de 55 mil casos da Covid nos √∫ltimos tr√™s dias.

 O aumento no n√∫mero de casos e √≥bitos nos √∫ltimos dias vem em um momento em[ que parte](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/12/covidfest-lota-ipanema-e-nao-esvazia-nem-com-chegada-da-pm.shtml)[ da popula√ß√£o afrouxou a ado√ß√£o √†s medidas sanit√°rias, como distanciamento social](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/12/covidfest-lota-ipanema-e-nao-esvazia-nem-com-chegada-da-pm.shtml) e uso de m√°scaras.

 Os dados do pa√≠s s√£o fruto de[ colabora√ß√£o in√©dita](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/veiculos-de-comunicacao-formam-parceria-para-dar-transparencia-a-dados-de-covid-19.shtml) entre **Folha**, UOL, O Estado de S. Paulo, Extra, O Globo e G1 para reunir e divulgar os n√∫meros relativos √† pandemia do novo coronav√≠rus. As informa√ß√µes s√£o coletadas diretamente com as Secretarias de Sa√∫de estaduais.

 Al√©m dos dados di√°rios, a **Folha **tamb√©m mostra a chamada m√©dia m√≥vel. O recurso estat√≠stico busca dar uma vis√£o melhor da evolu√ß√£o da doen√ßa, pois atenua n√∫meros isolados que fujam do padr√£o. A m√©dia m√≥vel √© calculada somando o resultado dos √∫ltimos sete dias, dividindo por sete.

  De acordo com os dados coletados at√© as 20h desta quinta-feira (31), a m√©dia de mortes nos √∫ltimos sete dias √© de 706, um aumento de 5,6% em rela√ß√£o ao dia anterior. O estado atual da doen√ßa no pa√≠s √© acelerado, depois de um breve intervalo de estabilidade, com alta de mortes desde o final de novembro.

 A iniciativa do cons√≥rcio de ve√≠culos de imprensa ocorre em resposta √†s atitudes do governo Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido), que amea√ßou sonegar dados, atrasou boletins sobre a doen√ßa e tirou informa√ß√µes do ar, com a interrup√ß√£o da divulga√ß√£o dos totais de casos e mortes. Al√©m disso, o governo divulgou dados conflitantes.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

 Balan√ßo divulgado pelo Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de nesta quinta-feira (31) aponta 56.773 novos casos de Covid-19 confirmados nas √∫ltimas 24h, com 1.074 novas mortes.  
   
 Desde o in√≠cio da epidemia no pa√≠s, s√£o 7.675.973 casos e 194.949 mortes pela doen√ßa, de acordo com os dados da pasta federal. H√°, ainda, ao menos 2.478 mortes em investiga√ß√£o.",1609459420

As for how, I imagine it goes along the lines of artific insemination, in which an egg being taken from the mother (Luz in this case). Then, instead of sperm, a hair or blood sample is taken from Amity. Then through the use of magic (I assume a mixture of Healing magic and Potion magic), the blood/hair sample is converted into a sperm equivalent, introduced to the egg, and then the egg is planted (I don't think that's the right word) inside of Luz, then with a little more magical guidance, a baby can be born.",1609459422

"infertility","t5_2saej","Ran across this recent paper (Oct 2020) summarizing the results of 1,000 mosaic embryo transfers, which may be of interest to folks - 
https://asrm.confex.com/asrm/2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/8302

Meanwhile, I'm now sitting on two aneuploid embryos on ice (single whole chromosome missing, different chromosome for each embryo, reported as ""aneuploid"" rather than ""mosaic,"" but no additional info about percent aneuploidy) and wondering whether, when, how to reach out to clinics to discuss possible transfer (after consultation with genetic counselor).  These are the only ones we've got.  Taking a break while we figure out if we want to do another egg retrieval, whether we want to try donor eggs and/or sperm, whether and where we want to go for a second opinion, etc.  Mostly rambling.  Hoping to draw back from IVF a bit so I can focus on other parts of my life I've neglected since my first IVF cycle a few months ago, but time is still and always a frustrating concern.

If anyone has recommendations for specific REs who specialize in egg quality, advanced maternal age, male factor, trouble getting blasts, and trouble getting normal blasts, who we could consult for a second opinion, please let me know.  So far, we are 3/7, 0/12, 2/10 day 6 blasts from fertilized eggs, getting through day 3 okish but failing before blast.  

(I'm also planning to look at SART results to see which clinics have the largest volume of 41-42yo and 43+ yo patients, but specific names would still be helpful.)",1609459425

&gt; content of which is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted

If a cop states you ran a red light, that is content which is being offer to prove the truth of the matter asserted. That is hearsay, it is admissible. 

If a group of people claim that you were assaulting them, and give testimony under oath of this assertion; that is hearsay and is admissible. 

Had you actually read that *article* instead of skimming it to pick what you were looking for. You would have realized that it's not an article, it is a collection of case law preceded by the legal definition of hearsay. Among those cases are multiple examples of character witness testimony and police testimony.

*But wait, there's more!*


Regardless of how many other definitions you need to seek out in an attempt to prove your misunderstanding, the ones I gave are the actual laws that are currently adhered to. Along with cases where they were established and exercised. Ironically, the source for the wikipedia definition is the same exact source that I offered you. 

You are wrong, it's ok to be wrong. It is however not ok to stay wrong.

Edit: Even more further reading, because apparently you can't seem to wrap your head around a common knowledge definition.

And to add to this argument, apparently, AoS was more serial (not a super serial heavy show but it did rely on knowing things that happened previously and in a particular order) which makes watching it less alluring, in my opinion. The Simpsons (or Futurama, or Family Guy, etc...) is a type of show where you can literally sit down and watch any episodes in any order, etc...Again, I am just questing the data here because I thought that Disney+ had actual good content and not crap?

While Dustin has a lot of brains, planning and is a god at conning people, he doesnt have the fighting force to content with wrath (as seen when he was still an ogre and raging) pre Oni form. Maybe it could be a challenge if Vamp was completely turned, but why should she attack them? Maybe with Lust ruler authority, but that one was snatched by her herself.

Other fighting Power that Dustin have is his Secret Ops, which Shinobu was the strongest (and he aint there anymore), and his powerlevel doesnt come near the top.

Dustin has the best chances by convincing Shun, Katia, Sue first, they can probably content together with Wrath (tho hard doubt), and try to bring vamp over so she brainwashes the other classmates with Lust. With the Unique skill of everyone being known, there are lots of ones that could be very dangerous to Shiros army.

Especially when there is a review aggregate out there like Metacritic that takes reviews from all major publications and averages them.

The bottom line is, it's 47th most popular game of 2020 on Metacritic and makes no logical sense as to why it beat out games that sold better, had better scores, has better player reviews, and has better ""professional"" reviews.  

Not to mention, PC Gamer, the ones that awarded it GOTY, gave it an 85.  None of this makes any sense other than Kojima buying the award.",1609459426

I mainly dont see it happening because I dont trust Disney to do anything they cant censor (like how they cut out scenes clarifying Valkyries sexuality in Thor Ragnarok). The only show I know of that made a previously straight comic character gay was Doom Patrol with Larry Trainor, and the Doom Patrol are even more obscure then Moonknight is so its not like they were really risking losing fans or anything.

If that's still not available in your area, you can go with the popular gaming brands (Logitech, Razer, Corsair, etc.) although with the caveat that they might not have the best stabilizers, but come with features that enthusiasts here might not like (such as USB passthrough, media control keys, RGB controls, etc.).

I'd shy away from having someone build you one as costs can escalate quickly and you won't know what separates a good keyboard from a mediocre or bad one.

You can even try some budget keyboards (such as the ones from Redragon) just to have a sense of what mechanical keyboards are like. They're not the best keyboards, but for most people, they're good enough.",1609459428

Your post is closer to a personal essay than something that is appropriate for r/Privacy. If you're looking for tips and techniques to increase your privacy, you might want to check out our sidebar, EFF's *Surveillance Self-Defense* and www.privacytools.io. So, we'll be declining to approve this since it's already been covered.

But more broadly, it's going to be tough wanting to be a musician earning a living from something like SoundCloud, while maintaining 100% privacy. Just payment issues require real IDs, let alone interacting on a social media. It's most likely you'll have to strike a balance where you want to be on a three-way axis on being paid, developing an audience or maintaining ""perfect"" privacy.

Basically, my biggest worry is not finding an SO who'd be fine with a more feminine look / some cross-dressing, and a sex life that's more like lesbians rather than hetero men.

Whe however did not kill some kind of higher species. that mainly kills humans, so there is no roll, we need to fill. We should just try to not fuck it up more, than we already did. That includes methods to preserve what we have left, like the one mentioned above.

I'm morally pro life as I don't believe in killing innocent babies, but I'm ethically pro choice because I also  believe in a woman's right to body automany. Basically I use my ethics to override or bend my morals to allow for people being pro choice.

My belief is that this is what most pro choice people realmy do but they don't understand the nb difference between morals and ethics. Thus they need to find another way to justify killing a baby. So instead they it a fetus and come up with all sorts of justifications as to why it's okay to kill the baby they don't want.

Hearing pro life people talk about baby vs fetus triggers them because they don't really understand how they are justifying murdering babies. They them latch onto new arguements like you're hypocritical if you don't provide for the baby to justify their own internal conflicts on the subject",1609459430

The reason you aren‚Äôt taking the action, but feel in your gut what you want to do, is fear. So instead of fighting the fear, try accepting it. Try to ask yourself, what am in afraid of? If I allow that fear to be realized, what is the worst part that will happen?

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Ooooh, I adore that scene. Helps a lot that I have a friend who is very much into the BDSM scene. For all his posturing, the Master was absolutely *not* the one in control there. He never had less control than he had in that moment. It starts playing with the gender dynamics, and then flips the script upside down so hard, I absolutely love it.

And even before that, the way they *looked* at each other, gaaah. It may be easy to miss it all watching straight from the beginning to end, only once, if you're not paying attention to it, but the way their gazes just drop every once in a while to various body parts of one another, I just can't watch it and not blush.

It's a ship that I have been invested in for well over a decade at that point. I didn't think it was possible to top the homoerotic tension of Tennant and Simm seeking each other out by scent in a garbage dump. I was a fool, oh I was such a fool.

And, I very much get your point, it could be precisely *because* of the use of the theme that makes the Matrix scene just work. Thinking back to some anime series, where they end the series by playing the first opening song, with some accompanying narration that is based on how the series was pitched to viewers, but with additional subtext, and it gets me every time. It's borderline emotionally manipulative, but it's hard to stay mad at them for it. Plus, it had the Morbius Doctors. That absolute madman.",1609459431

Okay, this was a lot. I really don‚Äôt like how he reacts to your pain. Pain should be met with love, tenderness, and support, if not also understanding. I don‚Äôt like that he yells at you, I don‚Äôt like he dismisses you, I don‚Äôt like he shuts you down. That‚Äôs not good. That‚Äôs not good. 

Sit down with him and have this conversation. Like, tell him how it makes you feel when he reacts that way. How hurt you feel. Be as calm as you can, certainly NOT angry. If you feel you might break down in the middle, then prepare ahead of time, write a document with what you want to say, read it, or have it ready in case you need him to read it. 

But... if he isn‚Äôt able to have a civil, loving, or at least open, curious, and respectful conversation about something this important with you... that‚Äôs really not good. 

So, then, start the conversation by saying: ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like it when I feel negatively, but this is how I feel, and right now, I am in emotional pain, I want to talk about something serious in regards to this, and I need your love and respect and support right now.‚Äù

I'm not sure how I came across Michael Voris initially. But when I began to watch his videos around August of 2019, something about what I heard rang true to my recently reconciled soul. And I am still not sure how far off he is. I believe he is very likely much closer to the truth than a lot of Catholics wish to admit. I would characterize him as following the more intolerant (but spiritually *correct*) Catholic Church of the early to mid 20th century. One thing is for certain, he is very much black and white in his editorials. He is hellfire and brimstone in attitude. Frankly I think we need this attitude back in the Holy Mother Church. We have as a Catholic people become *far* too lackadaisical and apathetic to our true supernatural faith.  While I have a certain feeling his heart is in the right place, his message can be very off putting to the ""lukewarm"" Catholics.

Who is more interesting though, is Fr Mark Goring. I saw him go from sort of feel good homilies, through a very noticeable epiphany that  realized, especially after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest in the USA (he's a Canook;), that something is very much amiss in our world. And that his messages subsequently, became far more sharply judgmental. And I think we need it. A right jolly good ""wake-up""! (I love to ""culturally appropriate"" Briticisms--It makes me sound classy! ;)  And I think it *is* the will of the Most Holy Trinity for humanity on Earth from this day forward.",1609459432

Yuri SAYS TO ACT LIKE AN ADUT, so Taiga acts like a child. Ryuji imitates Taiga throwing paper airplane and throws Ami's shoe. Taiga follows Ryuji like a dog concerned for her master. She sits on the ground and looks up at him. Trying to discern his motives. Ami states that she doesn't want to stick around to watch Taiga get hurt. She is disgusted when she sees Ryuji with Taiga, and says that he has stalking potential. Ami states that she does not want to be loved by everyone.  Taiga tries to reward people with treats, when it is they who carried her.",1609459432

Mi opini√≥n que le doy a todos es esta: estudi√° y hacete ninja (?) en JavaScript (vanilla javascript, lo que significa bien base sin ning√∫n framework).
Esto te va a habilitar miles de ramificaciones dependiendo lo que te guste m√°s, ya sea web frontender con frameworks como React, VueJs o Angular, o mobile developer como React Native, o como backender en NodeJs, o hasta como desarrollador de apps para desktop (crossplatform: Windows, macOS, Linux) con Electron.
JavaScript es un lenguaje que cada vez crece m√°s y m√°s y va abarcando diferentes tipos de entornos y trabajos abriendo montones de diferentes puestos de laburo.
Platzi personalmente recomiendo much√≠simo, la calidad tanto del material como de los profesores es excelente para m√≠, adem√°s de que est√° todo perfectamente separado, ten√©s un curso espec√≠fico para JavaScript por ejemplo donde explican todo de 0, otro para React donde ya asumen que conoces React y se evitan explicarte cosas b√°sicas y fundamentales, y as√≠ con todos los cursos, adem√°s de la buena atenci√≥n y soporte que tienen.
Las empresas en tecnolog√≠a, al menos la mayor√≠a, no les importa ‚Äúmucho‚Äù en s√≠ tu background o tu educaci√≥n, por ejemplo en mi caso, tuve montones de entrevistas y actualmente trabajo para una empresa radicada en USA, y mi background es este:
- Secundario completo
- Ning√∫n t√≠tulo universitario
- +10 a√±os de experiencia, pero de experiencia laburando para m√≠ mismo y proyectos m√≠os, 0 laburo en relaci√≥n de dependencia para otras empresas

Sin embargo empec√© a tirar CVs, y a las 2 semanas ya tuve varias ofertas de trabajo y arranqu√© a laburar considerado arriba de un Senior al mes siguiente.
Independientemente de todo tu CV, siempre te van a hacer prueba t√©cnica y te van a adecuar en lo que a ellos les parece que pertenec√©s. Cualquier duda o consulta que quieras hacerme tirame reply y te doy una mano. Saludos!",1609459433

"KDRAMA","t5_2rqv6","This pair of episodes was EVERYTHING! I'm so excited that this show is hitting its stride this early. Really compelling development of the characters and how they are all intertwined. Also KSG in episode 6 was so damn cute and I love how he and OMJ are developing a friendship and understanding each other's character slowly. OMJ's brashness and open character is almost almost too much sometimes, but  never hits that line. I find her very charming and refreshing, and I like that she can both connect with people (like the track teacher) and handily tell them off when she doesn't like their behaviour (like with Dan Ah in the cafe). I wonder when we will get more insight into her difficult background. digging the rare for kdrama mentions of non hetero sexuality, although I'm kind of confused as to whether Dan Ah is actually a lesbian (or bi or pan) or if she's faking it like that guy said. Really I just had a big smile on my face watching these episodes and needed to share!
But regarding that last moment of episode 6 &gt;!was that a real confession from Seon Gyeom or just a ""I like you as a friend"" sort of thing? Mi Joo is of course sincere, so I'm hoping for both their sakes that they can healthily explore the depths of their connection!&lt;",1609459435

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; And if not, if I transferred my Wasabi coins to a Trezor with anonymous coins

I'm confused here.  If the Trezor is new how did you get anonymous coins in the Trezor in the first place?

In any case:

&gt; Does combining anonymous coins with identifiable coins in a wallet compromise all the coins?

Yes.  However, ""combining"" in this case would happen at ***spend time***, not receive time, unless you used the same address.  If you're separating addresses, then they aren't combined yet.

With coin control you can ensure that the coins are not combined at spend time, but that risks operator error --- if you forget to use coin control then you might combine coins you don't want to combine.  The Wasabi interface is better here in that you are *required* to use coin control, it's not optional like in Electrum.

&gt; First, are my Wasabi coins anonymous now?

Yes

--------

Did you know that Wasabi can access your Trezor via HWI?  You might need some drivers and/or additional software though, go ask in /r/wasabiwallet .  It can't mix from the Trezor directly, but using Wasabi as an interface to your Trezor is better since it uses privacy-preserving methods to determine your coins from the blockchain, otherwise you'd be telling Trezor the company about what coins you own and that a single person owns all those coins and that's not good, what if they are bought out later by Chainalysis?  Also see the note on coin control, which Wasabi forces you to use so that you're aware of how your spending patterns correlate.",1609459435

Turns out they were totally pro-lockdown in situations like this, actually. Had a smallpox outbreak in Boston during the revolutionary war and they literally locked down the whole town and forced people to get inoculated.

Kitamura's brought a colossal bento, and is showing off. It's very unlike Ryuji to laugh at anyone, least of all his mate Kitamura.

Ryuji goes to Ami for information about Kitamura. Don't think he's ever gone to Ami for anything, before.

Love the imagination Ryuji has of Miyo-chan. Looks like Yusaku in a wig! Looks like he can't stand being out-housewived!

Taiga seems to be lounging a bit on that trolley, as if she and him have been shopping together a thousand times.

Cup ramen. Not the healthiest thing for a growing Taiga. Ami is right! And it certainly wasn't enough to fill her up! It always pays to be on good terms with the waitstaff!

Ami's reaction to the ricecooker was the same as mine. Who else would try this, indeed?

Yet if you strip the context out and just say ""A did the same thing B did"" it unfairly paints their sins as equivalent and thus should get equally harsh judgements.

For context: I recently learned how to spin yarn using a spinning wheel. Because I always go the extra mile with new hobbies, I decided that I wanted to start processing my own wool before I spin it. This involves washing it and combing the wool into a long strand that can be used for spinning, and so far I‚Äôm loving it! I have also only purchased wool from small farms, like small enough I buy it from Facebook groups and they send me regular updates and pictures of the sheep who‚Äôs wool I am purchasing. I know all of the names of the sheep and know for a fact that none of them have been harmed in the shearing process beyond a potential nick or two with the clippers.

I recently posted a picture on Facebook of the wool and how I comb it, and this person (who I am at most acquaintances with) decided to comment that using wool was an abomination because sheep are hurt/killed during the shearing process. As I said above, I know how much these farmers care about their sheep and that‚Äôs why I buy from them. And even if I did purchase wool from a bigger farm, most sheep breeds actually NEED to be sheared on a regular basis because they cannot support the weight of the extra wool. I responded to their comment with this, and after some back and forth involving more links to PETA than I care to read, they just would not give up and I was done arguing. 

Here‚Äôs where I might be TA. I decided to reply ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right! I drove to the farm myself and personally killed these sheep just so I could use literally a pound of their wool, because as a non vegan I couldn‚Äôt possibly care about animals the same way you do.‚Äù This was obviously a joke, and I do agree that it was in poor taste and I could have just stopped responding, but I was SO tired of arguing about something that is just factually incorrect. They flipped out and called me an asshole among other things, and after that I just stopped responding and ignored it. I don‚Äôt necessarily regret what I said, but I understand that it went a bit too far in the situation.

AITA?

 I needed a good soldering iron with adjustable heat to liquify the factory solder. It was quite hard. In the end I had to just cut the thumbstick cradle out with some side cutters and melt/clear the solder from the PCB afterwards.

 The parts were cheap, about ¬£2 for a pair. Generic from China. The only complaint from my son was that it felt ""to new"" compared to the other stick. I literally cant win sometimes.

"ShitPostCrusaders","t5_3f7q5","I've found that most people are confused on the Diavolo aspect of it rather than that other part of it. They get that it ""skips"" the cause and leaves the result (it doesn't actually skip anything, it just seems that way to everyone but Diavolo), but then the question becomes ""where does that leave Diavolo and how was he able to do things like kill Narancia?"" And that's why I think explaining it through fate rather than time is a better way of going about it. Things are going to happen. Diavolo knows this, and can escape his own fate through ""skipping"" time, but he is the only one. No one else and nothing else can escape their fate. Even things that Diavolo himself would have done still happen during ""skipped"" time (for example he was fated to kill Narancia). It's just Diavolo (and his clothes) that can move around freely.

In other words, Diavolo ""skipping time"" is him letting fate play out. During this time no one but Diavolo has free will, and no one but Diavolo will remember what happened.",1609459442

In regards to meth being more euphoric, it's definitely more euphoric in that it's several times stronger, but I don't think the euphoria is any different a feeling. Adderall is also serotonergic, I don't think meth really releases more serotonin but either way it's primarily a dopaminergic high.

"lotrmemes","t5_2v0i1","Yeah, Tolkien certainly liked Sam a lot, you could even argue Sam was Tolkien‚Äôs favorite character although I think that‚Äôs hard to prove, but him mentioning Sam as the chief hero in one letter doesn‚Äôt mean much. There‚Äôs actually some controversy over wether Tolkien wrote that at all or the editors added it in, wether he was referring to Aragorn instead of Sam, or wether he meant hero in a very literal sense (fitting the definition of classical hero) and didn‚Äôt mean Sam was the most important. Even if he did mean Sam was ‚Äòthe best‚Äô his views on characters definitely morphed over time and this was just a passing comment in an outline of his works. It‚Äôs pretty explicit if you read the books that Frodo had greater willpower to resist the ring than the other members of the fellowship- including Sam. He‚Äôs also a lot smarter, friendlier, and overall charismatic in the books than I think he‚Äôs portrayed as in the movies. He gets so much hate all the time, and Sam is constantly praised and I guess it just kinda annoys me because I think it ignores the fairly established roles every character played to imply Sam would‚Äôve been able to resist the ring more than Frodo. Also Sam had faults too! I believe Tolkien said explicitly that had Sam been kinder to Gollum, Gollum would have been redeemed. 

Also just a side note about Faramir- yes he never physically held the ring, but he did have ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô over the ring more so than others. He had captured the hobbits, and it‚Äôs made into a huge deal that despite having total control over the ring and having great pressure to take it (wanting to please his father, save Gondor, and live up to his brothers legacy) he doesn‚Äôt even consider it. I think he says he wouldn‚Äôt take it if it were lying in the road. So I‚Äôd give him full marks on giving up the ring even though he never held it, he pretty much had possession of it and relinquished it.",1609459445

Who do you choose among PC, NDP, Liberal, Green, etc.

We do *not* know how people would have voted if offered this question:

Who do you choose between PC and NDP.

The result may be that people who had Liberal as a first choice would have picked NDP as a second choice instead of PC. This is exactly what happened in the PC leadership race. More people had Christine Elliott as their first choice among all candidates but more people preferred Doug Ford over Christine Elliott between the two of them because some of the people who chose chose someone else as a first choice still preferred Doug Ford over Elliott.

That system makes sure everyone can vote their conscience and still have their vote count towards choosing the eventual leader. Our current provincial system means people have to choose between voting who they actually prefer or voting for who they think is most likely to win.

I'm not really clear what point you're trying to make here. This isn't just some personal idea of mine, this is a voting system used in many different elections including by the Ontario PCs.

You cannot claim that more people preferred Rod Phillips than *any* other candidate, because voters were never asked that question. They were only asked who is their first choice among several different candidates.",1609459446

Dupes have purpose and you're also rewarded with a currency for ML5 dupes. Events are kinda worse but also sometimes better (daily 10x summon being one of the better ones).

There are no gems or grinds, which I consider a plus, though I do wish there was an equivalent for gems. Lots of free equipment to help clear PvE content but you need to farm/grind for PVP content. Company/devs definitely put more effort in than SW and are much more transparent.

Very similar in terms of gameplay so should be easy to pick up and go with. Give it a go!",1609459450

"IRS","t5_2shs6","If you filed a 2019 return and were eligible for the first one you are probably eligible for the second.  You can not change your banking information with the IRS.  What will happen is that if the direct deposit goes to a closed account it will get rejected by the bank back to the IRS where it will be flipped to a paper check and mailed out.  This will cause delays and potentially additional complexities.  If you have not already, make sure you put in a forwarding address with the Post Office if any address change happened since you filed your 2019 return.

## ""How will the IRS know where to send my payment? What if I changed bank accounts?

The IRS will use the data already in our systems to send the new payments. Taxpayers¬†**with**¬†direct deposit information on file will receive the payment that way. For those¬†**without**¬†current  direct deposit information on file, they will receive the payment as a  check or debit card in the mail. For those eligible but who don‚Äôt  receive the payment for any reason, it can be claimed by filing a 2020  tax return in 2021. Remember, the Economic Impact Payments are an  advance payment of what will be called the Recovery Rebate Credit on the  2020 Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.""",1609459450

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Sw/Sh and LGPE:

1. **If you receive an offer by PM or Reddit chat**, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpokemontrades) and redirect the other user to post publicly on the subreddit. PM, DM and chat trading is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.). 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the correct trader.
3. [Full details](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny and/or event Pok√©mon.
4. Both you **and potential trading partners** must have [Pok√© ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades involving shiny or event Pok√©mon. 

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution.

If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all.

You have the burden of proof after making the claim.

You give me even ten examples this year (not even hundreds, like you said, but ten) of church or temple burnings in Pakistan and I'll believe you.

EDIT: Hey /u/killubillus I've searched and have found **two** instances of a church or temple burning in 2020, not **hundreds**, but **two.**

* https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1310676/christianity-news-Pakistan-church-muslim-Punjab-Lahore-latest

* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/30/mob-tears-down-hindu-temple-and-torch-holy-shrine-in-pakistan

one more instance of a church being vandalized and threatened, but not burned

* https://sputniknews.com/india/202005121079279452-church-vandalised-in-pakistan-allegedly-by-armed-men-over-land-dispute---video/

It's super hard to find these cases for some reason, I've gone through 30* pages of Google news. Maybe it's because they aren't super common.

&gt; Funny how you don't even try to deny the first part.

I didn't because it can't be denied. Forced conversions are [**haram**](https://quran.com/2/256) in Islam, but unfortunately they occur in Pakistan by greedy men who don't care about their faith that are looking for virgin brides. I agree with you that such actions are deplorable, and that the government should be placing higher emphasis on ending them. What else can I say?",1609459451

A variante que voc√™ n√£o t√° levando em considera√ß√£o aqui √© op√ß√£o. Sim, a maioria dos relacionamentos acabam em separa√ß√£o, mas esses relacionamentos come√ßaram porque duas pessoas **quiseram**. No caso de um relacionamento entre um humano e um androide/ginoide, esse relacionamento aconteceria, na maioria das vezes, por falta de op√ß√£o (a menos que o androide/ginoide tivesse uma personalidade bastante convicente, como o exemplo citado por outro redditor, o da ginoide do Ex-Machina, e ainda assim n√£o seria um relacionamento igual ao de o relacionamento com um outro ser humano porque voc√™ sabe, de uma forma ou de outra, que ela √© uma m√°quina).

&gt;A maioria dos caras que comem prostitutas se vangloriam disso... Uma droid sexual ser√° tipo um carro tunado; monte zoa mas existe toda uma bolha da maioria que acha legal.

A maioria dos que comem prostitutas j√° est√£o em relacionamentos ou n√£o tem problemas para encontrar uma parceira (source: relatos no GPGuia). J√° os que fazem por falta de op√ß√£o ou tendem a recusar esse servi√ßo √† todo custo (source: relatos no r/foreveralone e em outros enclaves similares) ou tendem a ser mais fechados nesse aspecto porque eles sabem que, se eles confessarem o fato de usarem esse servi√ßo, isso pode trazer consequ√™ncias na vida social da pessoa ([exemplo](https://old.reddit.com/r/sexualidade/comments/hzxx85/me_sinto_um_lixo_por_precisar_pagar_por_sexo_%C3%A9/))

E volto a perguntar: por qu√™ mesmo anos ap√≥s a revolu√ß√£o sexual, t√≥picos como masturba√ß√£o, garotas de programa, brinquedos sexuais para o homem ou virgindade tardia continuam sendo tabu? Acha realmente que o aspecto social n√£o t√° envolvido nisso?",1609459452

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;You can bring up the violinist and a pro life person just points out it's not comparable because you didn't cause it, and if you did cause it then you would be held accountable.

But that's on them to prove. As I've already shown, no you would not be tethered to a violinist as a bloodbag as a punishment for causing their situation. That would be cruel and unusual punishment.

&gt;Well now I'm just confused about your views, lol. I think pro life people do view the fetus as a person, and it's necessary for their argument. If the fetus is not a person then how would abortion be wrong?

So we're agreed then? I thought you we're arguing that the pro-life position does not require personhood but rather most pro-choice positions do. But we've apparently established that the personhood of a fetus is central to the case against abortion.

&gt;&gt;A judgement call for the mother to make or a judgement call for others to make? 
&gt;
&gt;If discussing morality it's a judgement call for everyone to make. If discussing legality it gets more gray, I'd say we shouldn't outlaw it.

Ok so here's where we seem to actually disagree. I believe it's exclusively the choice of the mother. If we're going to argue whether or not her role in conception demands her play host for 9 months that's a discussion we can have but the same or equivalent punishment objectively wouldn't apply in the case of the violinist.",1609459452

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","I think if most people chould choose to be tall or short, they'd choose tall. That's if they couldn't choose average or just above average.

It's true many might think short people are cute, but the flipside of being called cute is that you feel condescended to. Someone you'd call ""cute"" is unlikely to be confident, sexy, etc. It's not something you'd call someone you also looked up to (no pun intended).

So, other than the gymnastics potential and being called ""cute"" (which plenty of short people are probably sick of by now, if they weren't immediately), what are the actual upsides you are thinking of?

Of the tall women I know, some of them mention that it is inconvenient to be a tall woman, especially if you only want to date people taller than you. I have two female cousins both over 6 feet tall, and they had that issue. But I think that's of the few downsides. Especially as you get older.",1609459452

"homeautomation","t5_2s8wn","I'm in a similar boat, I just moved houses and expanded my Insteon,  throwing in a few Innovelli Dimmers to bolster my Z-Wave network.

Insteon/SmartHome are not going to be around as long as Lutron, but I already know what I'm getting with Insteon and I want consistency through the house for vital things like overhead / primary lights. Handful of hiccups in 8 years has been good for me. 

The only recent issues I've had are with LED down lights flickering on my Keypadlincs, but I think I've got that fixed in most spots with a resistive load behind the device. 

With regards to price though: make sure you're on SmartHome's emails and wait for the 20-40% off sales.

What controller do you use for Insteon? ISY, modem or Insteon Hub?",1609459454

My mom is fully on the vaccine hopium train, but it's interesting seeing her react to climate change. I posted last week about how we hadn't had snow stick yet. Before Christmas she kept making remarks about previous Christmases and end them with ""back when we actually had white Christmases."" We actually did get snow a few nights ago that stuck before it turned to freezing rain. Not enough to catch up to our 8.6 inch average for the month of December, but I think we got half that.   


Next year the website that does the Wikipedia weather information for cities is going to update their totals to reflect 1991-2020 instead of 1981-2010. I'm a data nerd so I'm excited to compare and contrast old and new totals.

Marx did talk about these different stages and a very important part of Marxist ideology is the end stage is a classless society.
